In this work Jo-Kin Battles the IT preteens will immerse themselves in this action, stimulating their creativity and imaginations. Discover how 11-year-old Josh Atkins ""Jo-Kin"", referred to as Super Geek at school, was able to live his dream in competing and be nominated for the job of a Super Space kid among 11 participants.As a former educator I can see so many life themes woven throughout this book that make it a perfect practical time where life values can be instilled. Preteens will learn the value of pursuing goals and putting forth great effort to achieve them.

"Darryl Perry, in his book A Rebel's Journey, will take the reader into his rationale as to why he feels the way he does about various aspects surrounding multiple issues. Referred to as a libertarian, his views and sense of right and wrong would take on a new dimension during his high school years. He shares how his eyes would become open and today the reader can get a glimpse of his ideologies as it relates to:– Drugs  – Purchasing of goods– Taxation.  – Death penalty– Immigration  – EducationRegarding drugs for example he states the following: ""While I do not condone the abuse of any substance, I do not believe that jailing people who use a substance that can be misused is a good way to discourage use or abuse of said substance… I long for the day in which all substances are as legal as tomatoes"".He believes governments should not force you to fund its schools, roads, post offices or other government function. ""My solution to operating a government without taxation is to have said government rely on voluntary contributions, just as privately run businesses and charities do!""Perry is against the death penalty believing that innocent people have been executed which makes state-funded capital punishment immoral. His view on marriage is that if two people wish to get married and either partner desires to bring another person into the relationship they should be allowed to do so. He invites immigration believing people should be allowed to live where they so choose.The author would also like for government to be removed from the educational equation. ""Public schools do not exist to educate children, rather the schools exist to mold children into replicas of one another"".In the several jobs and places he has lived he refers to himself as a ""news junkie""and has been an advocate and activist for peace and liberty.Because of his refusal to comply with laws this award-winning author found himself in court several times. Today he leads a busy life also as a publisher, radio/TV host and regular contributor to several weekly and monthly newspapers. He can be found hosting several podcasts as well. The reader will better understand the reasoning he explains for each topic in this book. It will verify why he gladly admits to his ""rebel journey ""","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23W4V83WYQYNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013M9PHD0#wasThisHelpful","R23W4V83WYQYNP","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very short book by Devin Blue that aims at helping one analyze their life in order to change and re-order areas for greater success. He believes the starting point is having empathy whereby we treat others the way we would appreciate being treated. This book is introspective and honesty is essential for diagnosing maladies and then exchanging one's current value system for a more efficient set of standards.Blue stresses the necessity of ridding oneself of toxic relationships. He believes once values are adjusted that real friends will remain that have the same value set. To help the reader there will be a section entitled pitfalls in one's values worth considering. The importance of being authentic when relating to others is heavily stressed. He feels we should accept ourselves for who we are, what God created us to become, and to live out that gift. ""… For every second, minute, and hour you pretend to be someone who you aren't you're wasting away the very life that was gifted to you"".There will be an action plan you can follow to implement your new value system at the end of the book.Author Devin Blue lives today to encourage and inspire others. A product of a dysfunctional home his research and mission extends towards bettering the lives of others. Though informative, I didn't feel it had the depth and range of content to award it five stars. This book can easily be ready in 30 minutes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16RC4FRPD85ME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T52E370#wasThisHelpful","R16RC4FRPD85ME","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This memoir is written with excellent detail encompassing four decades from age 17 in 1972 to present day. Where the challenge comes in for the reader is the painstaking reality of the physical and emotional suffering this young man endured while fighting through his deteriorating condition.

Worst however would be his diagnosis of progressive glomerulonephritis taking him repeatedly to the hospital, away from his schooling and facing the uncertainties of his future.This ""hard to stomach ""depiction of his medical treatments and effects it had on his body will allow the reader to wonder, page after page, how long this would endure and the fate of his condition. He encountered the trauma on his ward of half the patients passing away during one night. ""The following morning at daylight the curtains of all of us patients that were still alive were closed and the bodies removed… Those of us that were left could see how few of the beds remained occupied… No one spoke for a considerable time...""With refusal to give up however, he would start a business out of his home and become self-sufficient financially. His condition would continually worsen until survival hung on the balance. Discover what miracle would await him and how he determinedly reclaimed his life, piece by piece.This miraculous story reaches the pinnacle of a heart's will to survive and thrive.

"This book is for both Christian and non-Christian as it presents the realities of how sex outside of marriage comes with a heavy price tag. Author, Minister and founder of International Prophetic Shifters prayer Ministries, Inc, Virgil Postell comes with a mandate from the Lord to expose witchcraft and explain how it is used to manipulate others into sexual sins.If you have had sexual relations with others and seemed to lose your thoughts and identity you may be under the curse of manipulative witchcraft. This book also is good for ministry leaders for helping to equip others from the snares of the enemy. Having intercourse outside of marriage, Postell shares, opens one up to demonic influence, transferring ungodly thoughts and bending ones will. When that relationship has long ended individual still struggle with dreams and soul ties they cannot shake off.The author understands experientially how this works as he previously was under the domain of sexual sins. It was through prayer and fasting then he became free and today desires to help others gain their true freedom in Christ. ""I became desperate to be free from it all and I had to walk out of it and I knew the only one that could bring me out of this mess I have gotten myself in was God"". There are many today in the body of Christ that need the understanding and deliverance strategies presented in this book. Minister Postell holds no punches at getting out this message. Ungodly transfers in the bedroom, he knows, will render one's ministry ineffective.The dangers behind sexual sins and the ways to be free will be revealed. He presents hope that with God nothing is impossible. There are a lot of Scriptures and Biblical examples used that help even those young in the Lord to understand. This Florida native has set many free from the sins of the past and desires this resource to help you or others you may know in need.The content is excellent but I give it four stars rather than five because of many grammatical errors. The errors however still render the book to be quite understandable. I encourage all to check out the other books by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPTRA9ZKR5MX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TVO57A4#wasThisHelpful","RPTRA9ZKR5MX9","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book by Billy Witt is one whereby the body of Christ, including church leadership need to take a moment to reflect and contemplate as to whether or not their lives are measuring up to the plum line of God's word. Witt exhorts us to be a ""doer ""of the word and not just a ""hearer"". In clear, concise language with several scriptures he exhorts the reader to pray, repent, and obey the Lord's commands.In the busyness of life it can be easy for pastors especially to be neglectful in their intimate relationship with Christ while doing ""church things ""that divide one's heart. He encourages us to move from the elementary teachings of Christ to seeking the Holy Spirit for revelation of the word. Be encouraged to know we have a defense from temptations as he declares, ""when we submit to Him and fully trust Him, obeying His commands, the Spirit will empower us to withstand even the most tempting of carnal fleshly sins"". Trace the chronological events through the eyes of the apostle John leading up to the rapture. Billy with presents the realities of how the prophets of old suffered persecution for speaking the truth and following God's commands. We likewise, he states, will suffer for his name sake.You'll gain inspiration to share the importance of the Holy Spirit with others while being empowered to live a life that pleases God. This book should be read with humility where one examines their heart and motives. There are plenty of scriptures that solidify each of the points presented. Author Billy Witt has a passion to study the word of God and participate in small group fellowship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R317GCQFUMVZK2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK8FC4U#wasThisHelpful","R317GCQFUMVZK2","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I will say first off that this book is geared to those that are hungry for more of God's presence. The material contained has been tested by author Michael Van Vlymen and he shares his experiences and keys to tapping into the supernatural like never before. In focusing on the eternal unseen, he points out in 2 Corinthians 4:18 a whole dimension of the Spirit can be grasped.Learn how to cultivate a lifestyle of worship, praying in tongue's, and waiting on the Lord by sitting before Him in silence. These are habits that must be practiced regularly. The author believes it is vital to establish the atmosphere over your home by pleading the blood of Jesus and anointing your home with oil. He recommends praise music often and saturating homes and families in prayer.I was amazed at all that can be unveiled in the spirit realm when one puts these principles to practice. Although a deep desire to hear from God to experience sounds, smells, feelings, and visitations are needed, that is not all. Van Vlymen also talks about spiritual veils that cover our eyes created by sins, fears, traumas, doubt, and other things. We must put a guard over our thoughts and keep them pure and clean so that clear channels are open to receiving all from God.This is not a book to just read. Rather, it will only be effective if the strategies are worked at. Along with this book are other works by this author that will enhance your Christian walk. Author Michael Van Vlymen is also a speaker with passion to share the supernatural things of God with others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PIYBUCHAQMTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015F2XEMS#wasThisHelpful","R2PIYBUCHAQMTY","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Here are other areas covered that will be beneficial.– Strategies to help a child spell– Publishers/book stores that have high interest low reading ages– Homework tips– Classroom accommodations for teachers– fonts specifically made for dyslexicsThis resource will be helpful and I recommend it to others for greater awareness of the challenges, an understanding of what to expect, and tools to assist parents and teachers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUBGGAQKREWT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010IKPSRQ#wasThisHelpful","RDUBGGAQKREWT","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this e-book to be quite informative in bringing clarity to the Old Testament books. It is written in a way that locks events into a more understood dimension, while not losing the reader to excessive detail. To help with understanding each book there are charts, pictures, and outlines that can be used along side ones Bible. Author, Bible teacher, and Dean Paul D. Weaver has used his scholarly ability in producing this excellent resource.I enjoyed writing in my Bible word meanings, dates, and other things that this book brought to my attention. Though I have been a Christian for over 30 years there was still much I did not know in the Old Testament. It is written scholarly in that, while key information was presented, it was done in a fashion that even new Christians could grasp.This is not a work to rush through but to allow oneself to immerse  in the quality of information presented, possibly with one's Bible alongside. Each book has predictable categories covered including:– Title– Author– Documentary hypothesis– Recipients– Date and place– Purpose– Message– TheologyThis will be a resource one can refer to over and over. It includes archaeological discoveries throughout with an easy to find table with links in the front of the book.

"This informative book by Keith Dorricott will be beneficial to new and mature Christians as it comprehensively takes the reader into six ages the Lord has prepared for mankind. From before the foundation of the world until we rule and reign with him after Satan is permanently bound, Scriptures will be highlighted and meaning extracted so all can see God's purpose and plan through the ages. Dorricott reveals that when God created time He created ages referred to as dispensations, which mark out the ways God dealt with people.With the first three ages occurring in Genesis you will discover how sin through Adam required a redeemer and how, through sin the age of conscience emerged. With Adam and the entire human race experiencing death, Satan would attempt to wipe out God's plan. As the age of human rule took place God's judgment would scatter nationalities and tongues when God was excluded in a unifying effort. As the age of promise follows 400 years through Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and his sons, the promise of future blessings needed to be coupled with faith. From Isaac would come Israel resulting in Christ.Learn how, in the age of the law( age of the prophets) because of the entrance of sin, priests were needed and King Saul given because God was rejected as King. Laws too were initiated for greater responsibility and accountability. In the age of Grace the body of Christ, the church, is introduced where the gospel is available to both Jew and Gentile. Mercy based on the work of Christ allows us entrance into the sanctuary of heaven by the Holy Spirit.Gain greater clarity on the coming of the Son of God to carry out judgments before He binds Satan and sets up his kingdom on earth. It will give you a panoramic view of God's working's and his need to implement each of these ages. Bible teachers will find this resource very helpful. I give this book a five star rating for the clarity of concepts and informative material presented. I encourage you to also check out his other resources.Keith is a retired Vice-Chairman of a Canadian bank and now teaches and serves others in churches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7CJJA0G23IAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DST9DIA#wasThisHelpful","R7CJJA0G23IAL","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you were attracted to the title and perhaps the history of this fine author I will say with surety that this work will not disappoint!! It is a book for the serious of heart and desiring to draw closer to God and reap the benefits of communion and a greater anointing.  Author A.W. Tozer holds nothing back in his straightforward way of revealing how sin, self, and pride are stumbling blocks preventing true union with God.In each of these chapters the reader will gain greater clarity on how to pursue God and follow hard after Him. His illustration of the Old Testament tabernacle will relay how the interior journey of the soul goes from sin to God's presence. The many sins of ""self"" will need to be brought to the cross, he states before the veil of true communion can take place. ""Self is the opaque veil that hides the face of God from us. We must confess, forsake, repudiate the self life and then reckon it crucified "".As you discover how a defective faith can result in spiritual numbness, too will be the revelation of how obedience can give Inward revelation and acute perception, enabling us to experience God as one pure in heart. Programs and church attendance can still leave one inwardly bankrupt. Tozer exhorts us to get still to wait on God to hear him speak to our hearts. Accept His full Lordship and give forth complete submission. ""We will acquire a new view point and mindset and a new power will begin to surprise us"".This book, quite frankly, will revolutionize your life if you determine wholeheartedly to be a ""doer""and not just a ""hearer"". These are simple, yet profound principles upon which any believer can follow if they choose to do so. I give this book a five star rating for the quality content and to the point principles.

Author Alexander Carson (1776 to 1844) shares the following: ""From this book the believer may learn to place unbounded confidence in the care of his God and the utmost danger, and to look to the Lord of omnipotence for deliverance when there is no apparent means of escape"".The reader will discover throughout history how God uses both evil and good men to achieve His purposes providentially and how there is no danger from which the Lord cannot rescue his people.  He exhorts us to look for God's plan that may have been prepared before hand when we are engulfed on every side. In considering evil for example Carson shares how God raised up Haman to bring his people into danger as well as Esther to deliver them.  As you better understand God's work in the transactions of man you will grow to trust him for provision, protection and the blessings of life.Carson argues rightfully as well as to why the book of Esther should not be rejected just because it does not express the name of God and is not quoted by the New Testament. This solid book is excellent for those in Christian service and for those maturing in Christ. The points of emphasis are heartwarming and will allow the reader to trust God in another dimension.I highly recommend this five-star book to others. Author Alexander Carson was an Irish Baptist pastor, leading scholar, and prolific writer. This classic book is one you do not want to miss out on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IEB9D8WIT2O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IGDK652#wasThisHelpful","R20IEB9D8WIT2O","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Praying Genesis by Elmer Towns is a uniquely written book that has an extremely interesting plot and great readability. In a book read like prayers to God, it takes the accuracy of the happenings and brings clarity to the text as never before. This is also written in a way where it reveals the events that play out like a movie to one's imagination.Incorporated into prayers, as a sample of what to expect in chapter 2. ""You, Lord God, put the man – Adam – in the garden to cultivate and care for it. You, Lord God, gave Adam this positive command, 'you may eat of the fruit of every tree in the garden'. You also, Lord God, gave him a negative warning. 'Don't eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil because you'll begin dying and ultimately die, the day you eat of it'"".This is an excellent book for those also new in Christ and who find the Bible challenging in understanding key points and phrases. Though a Bible reader for several years, I also gained clarity in concepts and Genesis came alive as never before. At the end of each section will be a segment called ""My time to pray ""where main points previously read are emphasized in prayers to the Lord.Dr. Elmer Towns has written over 125 biblical books while also serving as a seminar lecturer. Added to his scholarly credit is his cofounding of Liberty University in 1971 and in 1995, a recipient of the coveted Gold Medallion Book Award.  Currently he serves as Dean of the B.R.Lakin School of Religion and professor of theology and New Testament.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O8ZQCOHTWYRU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087GIS3K#wasThisHelpful","R1O8ZQCOHTWYRU","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Author Erik Sabistan is a passionate aviator that has survived a critical mission in Afghanistan and today lives to tell us in Dustoff 7-3 as a Medevac Air Mission Commander.  In his job to deliver soldiers into combat aboard Blackhawks and pick up wounded fighters he shares ""In the Dust Off business where lives are always on the line, one of the hardest things for flight crews to do is to suppress their emotions  and stay focused on flying and saving lives.""Eric Sabistan's love for the military came from his grandfather who was a World War II veteran. It was after the 9/11 terrorist attack that killed 3,000 people that prompted him to join the army with the dream of becoming a helicopter pilot. He was determined to fly in combat despite the deaths and injuries of friends that flew. In Operation Hammer Down for example, discover how the Taliban fighters pop up all over the caves and tunnels and how he had to alternate race track patterns with figure eights to avoid becoming predictable. In Watapur Valley Sergeant Julia Bringloe would hang from the cable connected to the helicopter  and in the ultimate rescue of 14 soldiers, incurred a fractured leg and black and blue marks from bumping into trees and scraping through obstacles.In this up close narrative account, Sabiston knew all the army aviators were soldiers like those fighting in the valley. ""When we flew a mission and a fellow soldier died before we arrived it was as if a part of us died also"". It was this settled purpose that allowed him and others to persevere when rockets were detonating close by.  Though mission was accomplished it would leave them completely exhausted – mentally and physically.If you are interested in action-packed, high adrenaline like missions this is a book for you! And it reaches more than a mission; rather, it is a test of the human soul to persevere.  A hero to many, yet modest and unassuming,Sabiston has prevailed over the most dangerous operations in Afghanistan.  His heart as a soldier has extended to speaking engagements nationwide professing faith, and spurning others to surpass insurmountable obstacles.  He instructs upcoming aviators to fly in the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter.  I highly recommend this book to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OQ4COYBQAQPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH7BLOO#wasThisHelpful","R3OQ4COYBQAQPX","A24PMY25BH3X5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A24PMY25BH3X5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I compared this to my Magna Cart that I bought a few years ago and has an identical weight rating.  This hand truck seems like it may be a little stronger but it is also larger and heavier.  Folded, it is 30"" long, 5"" longer than the Magna Cart although both are 40"" long when the handle is telescoped.  The additional weight of the Heininger is due to the tubular steel construction versus the rectangular aluminum construction of the Magna Cart.  The Heininger appears to be stronger but I did not do any torture testing, just using my foot to put pressure on the base plate and the Heininger flexed less than the other truck.  As a note, the Magna Cart I compared this to is no longer made.  The new MC is very similar to the Heininger.Overall, this is a well made hand truck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G92WJDSA0VSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNQ0QEG#wasThisHelpful","R3G92WJDSA0VSR","A37WVR9M1STQDU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37WVR9M1STQDU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This looks like a well made machine.  It is simple to use with dedicated buttons for Espresso, Lungo (Regular Coffee), or hot water.  It also has a button for steaming and another to run a cleaning cycle.  It has indicator lights on the front for the various functions, including low water, empty coffee grounds, no coffee and a general warning light.The 43 page manual makes this machine look complicated but it's not and it includes a 4 page quick start guide to get you started pretty quickly.  The first time start-up is a bit of a pain but I've never had one of these before so they may all require the same priming and rinsing.First, you fill the machine with water, run an Espresso cycle to prime it.  Then run the coffee cycle 3 times.  Next, run the steam wand until it runs dry.  Then refill the machine with water and coffee and brew 3-5 cups of coffee and discard.  Refill with water again and now you are good to go.Once the machine is setup as above, you just press the button you want for Espresso, coffee or hot water and wait 30-40 seconds and you have a cup of coffee!  You can also do 2 cups at a time by putting 2 cups on the tray and pressing either button twice consecutively.  It doesn't really save any time because it runs 2 cycles consecutively but you don't have to babysit it.  Let's face it, 60-80 seconds for 2 cups of coffee if pretty darn fast!  The drip tray is quite large so if you forgot to put a cup under the spout, you would not have a mess on the counter.  In fact, I'd guess the tray would hold at least 2 full cups of coffee before overflowing and it has a red indicator that pops up to tell you the tray is full.The steamer is powerful.  Be sure to use a big enough container and don't let the wand come all the way out of the froth or you'll get a bath.  If you've ever frothed milk, you know this already.  Basic daily cleaning is easy.  Just slide out the drip tray, empty the grounds cup, empty the tray of water, wipe the bottom tray grill, remove the steam wand and wash it.  It took only a minute or two to do all this by hand.  The tray grill is dishwasher safe but everything else must be washed by hand.  The the machine runs a rinse cycle after you stop using it.  This is normal.  The water runs into the tray so you should wait until the rinse cycle completes before emptying the tray.The machine is rather large.  It is 8W x 13H x 17½D.  That includes the right angle power cord in the back so you will need some counter space to accommodate it.Here's what I don't like.  First, you can only use coffee beans.  There is no way to add ground coffee.  Why is this a big deal?  Suppose you like regular coffee but your wife likes decaf?  This machine can't accommodate that.  You would have to add just enough coffee to make your cup (I'm not sure how much that is.) then get the remaining beans out of the grinder and do the same for her.  Many other machines have a provision to add ground coffee so you could make a cup of decaf then go back to regular coffee.  Also, the manual says that you cannot use flavored coffees as they will clog up the machine.  That's not a big deal for me but it may be for you.  One last thing is that you cannot program the standby time. It is preset at 30 minutes. I'd like to be able to set it for longer, perhaps an hour. Most machines in this price range allow this.While I haven't done the weekly cleaning or monthly cleaning, they look to be a bit of a pain.  Also, every 250 cups, you must descale using a special solution.  I'm disappointed that Philips did not include even a sample size of descaling solution in the box, considering this machine costs $600.  Philips, if you are reading this, please consider including a small bottle of descaling solution; even if it is only enough to descale one time.  The manual says that descaling takes 35 minutes.  It goes on to say that if not done, the machine will eventually stop working and the damage is not covered under warranty.Overall, I like the machine.  It makes a good cup of coffee, espresso or cappuccino.  You can adjust the grinder to your liking to control the strength of the coffee.  It does require more maintenance than your basic coffee maker though.  Whether it stays or goes will depend on how difficult the weekly/monthly cleaning are and if my wife will put up with the lost counter space.  After seeing her reaction to the cappuccino I made her tonight, I think it may be staying...Update: I learned that I can program the cup size dispensed by holding either size cup button. It flashes and starts dispensing. Then press again to make it stop. After that, the new cup size is memorized.  A word of caution is the more water you use, the weaker the coffee will be.  You could experiment with the grinding fineness to compensate for this.  As I mentioned, this machine is so fast you can just press the button twice rapidly and it will run two consecutive brewing sequences which won't affect coffee strength.Update after a month of use:The weekly cleaning of this machine is much easier than the manual made it seem.  It took all of 10 minutes and I was proceeding slowly.I've found a few quirks with this machine that concern me.  First, there is a cup inside that holds the used grounds.  They are compressed into small hockey pucks.  When the cup becomes full, you get a warning light on the display and the machine will not function until you empty the cup.  It's a great idea but here's the problem.  On several occasions, the light has come on with only 2 pucks in the cup.  So that means only 2 cups of coffee had been made since the cup was empty.  The light should not come on as the cup is nowhere near full.  It's a minor inconvenience and the light has reset after emptying the cup.  Often times just opening and closing the drawer clears the error.Here is a more serious issue.  When frothing milk, there is a delay when activating or deactivating the steamer.  I understand the delay for steaming to begin as the water must be heated and the pump takes some time to develop pressure.  That's not a problem.  The problem is you have the same delay when you press the button to stop the steam.  The delay is long enough that even if you stop steaming with the milk level 2"" below the bottom of the container, it will run long enough to overflow.  This means you have a mess but more importantly, you have scalding milk spilling all over your hands.  This is a poor design in my opinion, especially for a machine this expensive.  A friend of mine has a competing machine (D brand) and you can stop the steam instantly, which is the way it should be.  I dropped the rating to 3 stars because of this.  Even after using the machine for a month, I still overflow the milk when frothing.  It is easier to do than not and you could easily burn yourself in the process.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D37IIVLPG64Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8PZVLU#wasThisHelpful","R1D37IIVLPG64Z","A37WVR9M1STQDU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A37WVR9M1STQDU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Although the author says that you can read Knight without having read the first two books, I highly recommend you do anyway…so much happens in the first two books (Rose and Thorne/Brew and Martini) that it only enhances the experience so much more.This is a fantastic biker series that focuses on family and their messed up relationships as much as it does the politics and danger of three clubs fighting for control while making and then breaking alliances and truces that will ultimately lead to extreme violence and bloodshed. I loved every gory and at times steamy minute of this trilogy and you should grab it while you have the chance to score them at this really discounted price.***** 5 ***** “a father’s betrayal, a daughter’s love and breaking down the walls” stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PY9U8LYW3OPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017TVOFCG#wasThisHelpful","R2PY9U8LYW3OPM","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting and mysterious start to what promises to be a wild ride. I'm not sure what exactly is going on between Jordan Mills and Hunter Savage's parents...but it's no good and left me wondering exactly WHAT mission he was given and why his seduction plans were obviously done for suspicious reasons.A chick who can ride and fix motorcycles with the best of them and a pushy sexy man who gets what he wants (but follows his family's orders) are the ones who will probably change the way things are supposed to go down and as much fun as it was to read their verbal sparring, I was left with way more questions than answers.This is a debut series from a new author and although there were quite a few small issues that I found in this prequel that threw me off and made the story a tad unbelievable, it looks like it will be exciting and action packed and I look forward to finding out what is really going on.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.**** 3.5 **** ""family ties and lustful thoughts"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJ3TESVM48QN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ROWZHM#wasThisHelpful","R1PJ3TESVM48QN","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked Michael and Holly's book...not as much as I loved Ava and Mercy...but it was full of tension, violence, slow moving romance (the way it should be) and a complicated relationship between two people who had more in common than they ever knew.Holly was a victim of severe abuse and running away/hiding from her abusers and falling into the arms of Michael (the one who gets bad things done for the club) was her shaky plan to freedom. It took a lot of trust and strength to beat the odds but if anyone could do it, it would be this vulnerable but willing-to-learn waitress and her silent but deadly biker.I liked how the story played out and am looking forward to the next books but felt this one was a bit too repetitive and wordy...it could have been cut down and would still have been a great book without losing any of the impact of the hard storyline.

"Poetic, beautifully descriptive, sensitive, honest and truthful...and I'm describing a biker book...about a 1% club...and yes, I am serious.This book was originally released in 4 parts and I bought all of them before the author published it in one book...and I am so glad I read them!Ava is the daughter of the VP of the Lean Dogs MC and when he is about to be bumped up to President and she returns home for the celebration and to go to grad school with her preppy new boyfriend in tow, all hell is about to break loose. Her old love and the one who she ran from heartbroken to go away to college, is back and things are about to get really complicated. Some club wars and persecution by the town mayor are only a couple of issues to be faced by this family of bikers and in this first book we are given the detailed and rich history of all of the important players in this family driven saga.I have read so many biker romances that I have lost count...and while they are mostly enjoyable and some I have come to love so much I re-read them...this new one is different. Lauren Gilley manages to combine a lot of facts about MC life, descriptions of people and places, and a scorching love story that began when Ava was a little girl and her forbidden lover Mercy was a young prospect.Beautifully told but keeping the nasty, violent and sexy grit you come to expect from a book about outlaws.***** 5 ***** ""lie down with dogs and you don't always come up with fleas"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35OHLHTSA0U9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S6R75UM#wasThisHelpful","R35OHLHTSA0U9H","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to say ""I really liked it"" when a book is so wrong and dirty and hits so many triggers that I hardly know where to begin reviewing it...and I should have known better having read Mary Palmerin's work before...so yeah, read the warnings and some of the lower rated reviews before you read this one (full disclosure and all that).The synopsis does not even begin to give a clue as to the depth of depravity contained in this novel and even though it is actually beautifully written and almost sounds like poetry in some parts, it is very hard to digest and I had to set it down and go do something else a few times before I could finish it.I also wish the authors had put in the description that it was going to end on a cliffhanger and was not a complete story (being Red Market #1 does not necessarily mean it is a continuation series so I was a bit upset) and after surviving this depressing and bloody mess of heartbreak, I'm not sure I can go through it all again in another book.Mind blown and still reeling after what I just read...I think I need to read some sweet fluffy romance now to make it all better =)**** 4 **** ""life should never be this twisted and perverse"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W1U4H2HQK7QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0127AAYCY#wasThisHelpful","R3W1U4H2HQK7QK","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just couldn't resist...a long biker romance book with an HEA and only 99 cents...what's not to love?Hawk was SO bossy...sexy hot but alpha to the max...and he sure met his match with Cara, a lawyer who has a mind for business but a body for pleasure. And it was definitely Hawk's pleasure as he made it his mission to have her for himself...in all ways possible.A serial rapist/killer, a rival MC, a snobby family and a mysterious knack for always getting in bad situations all play parts in this really engrossing new biker book about two opposites who find they have more in common than they first thought. It was chock full of steamy kink and so much sex I was sweating bullets at one point...but the story was thrilling, the supporting characters interesting enough to carry on with more books in the series and all in all well worth the small price for a whole day of reading.If you love bikers as much as I do then you will want to grab this one while it is still less than a buck!**** 4 **** ""you can't judge a man by his leathers"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROCQ5AIO5UQUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178F32BS#wasThisHelpful","ROCQ5AIO5UQUT","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Boomer and PPP...they are the perfect match...both of them suffering from their own form of PTSD and attempting to heal themselves while putting those around them at risk for the fallout.Pamela is protecting those dearest to her heart while trying to find some form of ""normal"" peace in her life, but her scars (both internal and external) are sometimes too painful to live with...while Boomer lives with guilt and the shame of not being able to protect his ""brother-in-arms"" as he lives his life flying by the seat of his pants. When these two broken down souls come together in their misery, it is both gut wrenching and wonderful to watch and my heart was breaking for both of them as I read this book.I love these Hellions so much and just marvel at Camaron's ability to write such serious and universal issues in her books that so many readers can relate to...while also giving us an exciting and sexy biker romance with a ton of awesome characters.A must read addition to the Hellions series as this author never disappoints and her stories stick with you for a long time!I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.***** 5 ***** ""life is never simple but it can be if you trust"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QEZGEKCP59I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017KUZUM0#wasThisHelpful","R13QEZGEKCP59I","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of Nora Flite's books and as usual, this one pulled me in right from the start and then kept me interested until the very end.It was not quite what I expected...Abell and Nix made a hotter than hot couple and their sexual encounters were so erotic...but the twist in the story was slightly unreal and then to have more reveals later on just turned the book from an intriguing mystery to a so-so romantic drama. I have also read several books with a similar storyline as well but it is still worth the read (if only to enjoy those extremely steamy loves scenes and the HEA surprise ending) and this author writes her sexual tension SO well.If you are a fan of Flite's work, you will definitely want to add this one to your library.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.**** 4 **** ""keeping the family and money in sight"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFUM3320J0NVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017JC7I38#wasThisHelpful","RFUM3320J0NVL","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this as my one free loaner with Amazon Prime and unlike some months when I regretted using my one freebie on a waste of time, I really loved this one so much.It was emotionally deep and made me sad and heartbroken for what Jackson and Emily went through...espeically when you love and lose something that ""fits"" and makes your life complete.Forget that he was in an MC and she was young and inexperienced in that lifestyle...they worked and were happier and more fulfilled than most ""traditional"" couples...so when betrayal strikes and they are ripped apart just as things get deeply bonded, it was tragic and gutting.I liked the feelings that were brought to the surface as I read this one and although it was not what I am used to reading in a biker romance (and I have read hundreds of them!)...it was completely satisfying and well worth my time.

"WOW…what an amazing deal!! I read each of these books and they were all 5 star reads for me…so I will quickly run down each one.DRAW: Cord, Chase and Creed Gentry were like the unholy trinity of wild bad boy triplets growing up in their small town...the girls lusted after them, the town feared them and they were completely abused and discarded like old furniture by their own parents.Saylor was a sweet, too-trusting young woman who had a history with these boys (Cord took something very precious from her one day and it haunted her when she left to start a new life) but nothing could have prepared her for the abuse she would suffer from an unlikely person who was NOT one of the low-life Gentry men, but someone she should have been able to trust.When Saylor escapes and runs back to the safety of her cousin and BFF Bray, she is forced to confront the demons from her past and in that hell she finds out that the love of her life is standing right in front of her. I really liked the believability factor in this book...no insta-love, they had mature reactions to traumatic situations and I especially liked how a very serious problem that could have had a horrible impact on many characters, was resolved in an awesome conclusion.RISK: Where do I even begin to express how much I loved this book...it was dark, beautiful, heart-breaking and hit home with me on so many levels.When I first met the Gentry triplets (Cord, Creed and Chase) in Draw, they were everything a girl could want (or really shouldn't want) in a boyfriend. They were like a sexy bad-boy tag-team of muscles and brawn all rolled into a package of heat...you want one Gentry boy, you get them all...a package deal for any girl lucky enough to have a night of no-strings fun. To quote the author they were "" head-turning triplets that hatched somewhere in the desert and then descended upon humanity like a plague of testosterone""...LOL...I couldn't have said it any better! This was Creed and Truly’s story and both of them suffered from childhoods lacking in nurturing and loving parents, so it was understandable to me that they acted out (Creed in violence and sexual escapades and Truly with her own string of men and various relationships that went nowhere).I found myself so engrossed in their emotionally charged stories that I was brought to tears more than a few times, and it was hard to just read this book without tensing up and fearing the results of what obstacles lay ahead for them. A life and death situation threatens the happiness and future of the brothers as well as the women they love, and when all is said and done, the risk for what ""could be"" in the future outweighs the present predicament they must all fight through to the end.GAME: Cora Brent's storytelling has taken on a more mature tone with this book...don't get me wrong, it is still funny as hell in parts, steamy and sexy beyond belief (the Vegas elevator and hotel room scenes will stick with me for a while) and has that playful, fast-paced banter that makes reading her books so addictive. It also touches on the subject of addiction...which comes in many forms, from sex to drugs to gambling and how some people are born with addiction in their make-up, while others are able to overcome the urges and not be affected by hereditary or their environment growing up. Chase desperately wished for a relationship with his mother, while Stephanie lost her father to a lifestyle he could not control. I loved that both Chase and Stephanie were complex and interesting individuals...one could be dirty and lustful in one breath and then sweet and honorable in the next, while the other was emotionally fragile yet so loyal and loving at the same time and together they were exactly what each other needed and a strong force to be reckoned with.FALL: We first met Jenny in Promise Me (Defiant MC book #2) when she was rescued from the cult and brought to her sister for safe keeping. Jenny was only 16 in that book and was sent to live with her brother in California where she went to school and was given a chance to somewhat ""heal"" from her injuries, both emotional and physical. When Fall begins, Jenny is 19 and finds herself stranded at a bar, garnering the unwanted attention of some creeps, when Declan Gentry swoops in to save the day.Deck is a dark and dreamy bad-boy with a heart of gold...just as you should not judge a book by its cover...you also can not judge this man by his outward appearance.I loved Deck...ever since he took on the role of protector to his triplet cousins both growing up and even more so now that they are all settled with the loves of their lives at 23 years old. I really loved the patience and care taken to develop their relationship over time...there was no wham bam jump in the sack for these two...although OMG the foreplay and flirtatious teasing between Deck and Jenny was mega watt HOT and when they finally realize their feelings for each other (and seal the deal), it was truly explosive passion.We learn a whole lot more about the Gentry triplets heartbreaking childhood as well as some dropped bombs of possible big secrets that could impact the future...but for now, enjoy this really sweet and sexy and emotionally charged romance with cameos from some much beloved characters from the Gentry Boys and Defiant MC series.HOLD: Finally…enjoy a sneak peek into more of Cord and Saylor as they keep the romance alive after becoming parents to two adorable girls. It’s funny, sweet, sexy and reminds us that under the tats and tough guy exterior, Cord is a loving husband and father.

"We first met Kellan in Slade's book and man oh man has he ever grown up since then and literally become a lady killer...he attacks them after every fight with his killer weapon and let me tell you, it was extremely steamy and heat filled to read those scenes!Enter Parker Jones...reporter and the sweet woman who will be enough to bring this killer to his knees (and senses) and when it all goes down, it was exciting and playful and yet really really dangerous as well.There is a lot of intrigue and behind the scenes action, life threatening danger and passion when Parker sets out to get her story, get her justice and get her man.Politics and the slick world of underground fighting go hand in hand in this story of getting back what you lost, fighting for the rights of those who served and were left hanging and finding the one who can both rock your world and keep you level headed and calm.I really liked this new book a lot and although there are times where it gets a little preachy, it was worth the read and brings some important issues to light.***** 4.5 ***** ""fighting for justice and freedom"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PC1JPXCOYCDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GAHUH2#wasThisHelpful","R3PC1JPXCOYCDL","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Killer"", the first book in this box set duo was a thriller about a womanizing husband who is murdered and the plot thickens as his wife is blamed for it. Did she do it or was she the pawn in a scheme by someone else? This prequel was sexy, suspenseful and had so many twists that I wasn't sure who to believe. The end was a surprise and it opens up the door for the next book in the series. A delicious taste of what will be a great revenge mystery. There was plenty of nasty and just wrong revenge in “Stalker”, but it wasn't quite as explosive as I thought it would be. The methods used by Phoenix/Miles to capture and break down Vanessa were cruel, degrading and at times hotter than hell...but, without spoiling the book for anyone else, there was a complete reversal at one point and the ending was not as dark as I thought it might turn out to be.Both of these characters had terrible and unusual childhoods (just because Vanessa came from money didn't mean she was treated well) and although Miles was the one who everyone thought was dangerous and a ""killer""...Vanessa was forced into some pretty abusive and illegal situations herself leading me to wonder who the real bad guy was in this story.I think the two of them were fairly suited to each other and their childhood relationship and history made for some interesting revelations once Phoenix had her in his clutches.If you like twisted psychological thrillers with a lot of kinky sex and emotional trauma, then this is the one for you!I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.***** 4.5 ***** “two damaged souls make a right choice” stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231YAV9XJ5RAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017FASIFG#wasThisHelpful","R231YAV9XJ5RAZ","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think this is my favorite book of the series. In the first book we get a teenage Kyle and all the drama of growing up too fast and wanting to reach for the stars (with a very nave outlook). In the second book, we get Kyle and her bandmates on their first train wreck of a tour, dealing with pervy men and unscrupulous management who are only looking out for their own wants and needs. By the time we get to On the Rocks, Kyle is having to re-evaluate her whole life and career and basically start from scratch. Clawing your way back up to the top of the pile is never easy when it seems like everyone wants to see you fall down and there is not many people left in your corner to help anymore.But Kyle is not a quitter, far from it and it is only when she sets out to start a new band and attempts to leave all the haters behind, does she find peace in her life again.CJ has been off and on in her life, both as mentor and BF, but it broke my heart the way he made her feel and their unstable relationship was sad to watch as Kyle fought for discovery and to grow up.What I really loved about this book was the message and how no matter how much a person might mess up their life and how far they fall, the human spirit is stronger than we realize and watching this young woman's journey from her teenage angry self to the successful rockstar she becomes, was exhilarating and inspiring to watch.This book features some ""guest stars"" from Jamison's Bullet series and plenty of heavy metal action for those music lovers out there...not to mention a trip to Vegas where you know...what happens in Vegas...I especially loved how she ended the book...the last chapters and wrap up of everyone's stories was perfect and humorous (as there is always a lot of humor in between the drama in her books) and I felt satisfied that all ended as it should have.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.***** 5 ***** ""awesome heavy metal rocking and loving"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39TIZZED6UU0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N92YRE#wasThisHelpful","R39TIZZED6UU0H","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this one for free and it sounded good and for the most part it was ok...just too many things that were unrealistic and would never happen in real life.The idea was a good one...an undercover agent pretending to be the old lady of a biker who was working to bring down a criminal leader and his club...but all of the coincidences, the ""training"" to be a biker chick, the all day tattoo session...it just seemed impossible to buy, so I was just thrown off of the story. The almost instant falling in love and ending was more of a fairytale than a serious MC romance, but some readers might enjoy that type of thing...I just read too many books that I have become picky about plotlines that are rushed or too unrealistic...but that's just my opinion.Sex was steamy, lots of emotional turmoil and some raunchy club action.**** 3.5 **** ""falling in love for a second time"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWBHBZQO1WWKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0174WN9J0#wasThisHelpful","RWBHBZQO1WWKB","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very fast read...one of those books that just keeps on moving and keeps you involved with the story and the characters. I have to say I was at first not sure how I would feel about this story since it is another one of many biker books where a rich guy is stalking a young woman and she is forced to run away to either her father or brother's club for protection...but after getting past that issue, I really appreciated that the characters behaved in a more mature way and kept things real.When Piper reaches out to her step-brother for help, he doesn't throw her into a bad situation nor does she get treated like a club whore (good so far) and when Kix arrives on the scene to merge the clubs, he turns out to be a bigger/better man than how he could have been written.Piper is surprisingly strong and fearless when it comes to Kix and the author didn't milk the whole ""poor damaged girl"" thing which gets annoying when you've read it too many times.A short novella with a few predictable moments but well written and a pretty entertaining plot that left me wanting more...wish it had been longer with a bit more details.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.**** 4 **** ""no place left to run and hide"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQV6775U22I4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AMF2GW#wasThisHelpful","R1CQV6775U22I4","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read so many biker books that they sometimes become a big blur...but I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. It was different with the heroine being from New Zealand and yet it had a similar feel to other books I have read before.The plot was complicated and full of so many characters, I had to pay attention to keep all the friends and family members straight...but the action and thrilling romance was enjoyable to read...violent, bloody and then turning steamy in a flash.There were a few editing issues and the book was very long and drawn out in parts, but it was a good effort and so full of surprises that it definitely was not boring to read.

When she is taken by a rival club, it could have been much worse than it was...but enter the hot alpha second in command...and you just knew how it would end.Unfortunately after that awesome beginning, things took a turn into unbelievable and almost silly directions...too much happened and was described that would never happen in a real MC and made all the characters look and sound too wishy washy.The insta-love between Daniela and Julian was hard to swallow..and then when the crazy cheating EX shows up and she goes crazy calling him ""the love of her life""...it just got to be too much.The romance and sex scenes were hot and the chase sequences were so well described, I felt like I was watching an action film and found myself holding my breath.It was just OK for me (I read way too many biker books so I am very picky) and was free at the time I got it so I don't feel like I lost anything.**** 3.5 **** ""choose a side and stick to it"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AXG7YNDYAY5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145VHOJE#wasThisHelpful","R3AXG7YNDYAY5I","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh my ...just when I think I've had enough and decide to get off the ""stepbrother train"", Sabrina Paige goes and writes one that is so naughty, so deliciously wicked and funny at the same time (while pulling a bit on the old heartstrings) that I just HAD to read it.The blurb is over the top drama...Prince Albie is so full of himself that I couldn't help but snort as I was reading his arrogant dialogue...and yet it was so witty and playful with a crapload of steamy foreplay and dirty games, that it left me in a constant state of arousal (much like the characters) and that is a good thing when reading a romance novel. I can't say this book was all just erotica (although it was certainly chock full of it) because there were also some important lessons learned between mothers/daughters and fathers/sons about what really matters most in life and love...and it's not always about wearing that gold crown.If you want to have a fabulously raunchy good read and can just leave your logic checked at the door, please pick up and enjoy this romp through Vegas and the imaginary land of Kings and Queens and a badboy prince who found his perfect (albeit reluctant) princess...and you will be guaranteed a pleasurable time.

"I have read a lot of this author's books...they are always so sexy and steamy but filled with such passion and longing that they make you really feel everything.Who hasn't secretly wanted to ""go there"" with a BFF who just happens to be a sexy player and irresistable to women...one of the big reasons a lot of women ""can't"" be friends with a man...but when Alex is given a chance to get close, close, closer with his beautiful childhood friend Tripp, he wonders if it won't be the biggest mistake ever made.I really liked this one...so much angst and emotions spilling over the sexual tension and when things happened (just the way we knew it would) it was like fireworks and left me feeling like ""I"" had been ravaged by Alex.

"I really like Nicole James as a biker romance writer...she gets to the heart of what makes things tick between men and women...the excitement of the chase, capture and domination.I have read four of the five Evil Dead MC books so far and have enjoyed them all very much...although I maybe didn't love this one as much as I hoped I would. I think it had to do with too much back and forth and after a while, all the makeup sex and falling into bed after walking away got to be too repetitive and it was frustrating to read. Despite those issues, I read it in one sitting and will definitely continue to read her books because I really love her stories (even when they make me angry) and they are filled with as much emotion and deep family love as some of the best romance novels.Wolf was a complex and hard-headed man fighting to keep his freedom and not be tied down...Crystal was a tough sweetheart who loved as fiercely as she fought for herself and the two of them together were a perfect match...if only they both believed in themselves. Both had internal and external scars from their lives (before the book is through) and it was inspiring to watch as they battled their demons.A must-have must-read for Nicole James fans and biker book readers in general.**** 4 **** ""covering the scars of life"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI73Z5ZBRWHQF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR5SZP8#wasThisHelpful","RI73Z5ZBRWHQF","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave three of the four books in this series 5 stars so I would say it was pretty much a success in terms of how I like my biker books to be. I was a huge fan of the MC Sinners series, so of course I was thrilled to get a new one from this author and for the most part these guys and their women were just as entertaining, sexy and tough as the first biker club.Each book focus was on a specific couple but with other stories mixing in to give some history for the next book. I really liked that each one was unique and the plots very different from other books (a female prison guard/biker, a slave worker/biker etc.) so I never felt like I was reading something I had seen before.A wonderful collection for biker romance readers and especially if you are a Bella Jewel fan and love series that are very family centered.***** 5 ***** ""love, lust, life and happiness"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EUYYXK5S98MA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ABIIRA#wasThisHelpful","R1EUYYXK5S98MA","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first three books in this series on their own but picked up the box set when it was on sale so I could read the final one (and have the set for my collection). I have always been a big fan of Jewel's work and although I enjoyed the Jokers' Wrath series, it just didn't have the impact or as much heart as her MC Sinners series did for me.Pip and Tyke always had that sweet big brother/little sister kind of vibe (for him at least) and no girl could ask for a better ""brother"" to comfort, protect and just generally be a shoulder to cry on. Both of them have gone through tragic and life altering events and all was well until it wasn't anymore...until being friends wasn't enough for Pip anymore...until they crossed lines that they didn't realize were meant to be crossed.I found Desolation to be a bit drawn out in parts and then a bit too quick (I would have liked for everyone's storylines to have been given a more complete end) but for the most part it was good and Pip's story ended the way I had hoped it would.A must have series for Bella Jewel fans despite the small issues.**** 4 **** ""healing each other over time"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KOOBTRWBN51M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WPBPO8U#wasThisHelpful","R3KOOBTRWBN51M","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Hop was an interesting guy from book one and Lanie was a sad, misguided girl...but the drama was so thick and heavy in this one that it was exhausting to read at times and became a tad repetitive. The back and forth got to be too much and the constant change of heart (from BOTH of them) gave me whiplash...but that being said, I still enjoyed the hell out of this addition to the series (not as much as I loved the original Motorcycle Man or Own the Wind) but with reservations.The plot was complex and twisted up and nothing was what it seemed, as Hop and Lanie both fought to overcome the demons from their own troubled pasts before they could make a go of being together in a permanent relationship.It was funny at times (Lord those Chaos men are bossy!) and sexy as well as being full of rich family history and tackled the issues that always cause problems between men and women (as well as parents and their kids).Get it while it's on sale...this price is lowest that I've ever seen it and worth the read.**** 4 **** ""melting the ice inside with fire "" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307MOU7HZLAN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3VX5LG#wasThisHelpful","R307MOU7HZLAN2","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this book. Period. It took about 50% in before any real sex happened and when it did (after all of that steamy foreplay and verbal sparring and emotional turmoil) it was just beautiful and actually made me cry a bit.Elizabeth's story was painful and heartbreaking but she met the man who would be her savior and he was the one who taught her strength (all while she was giving it right back to him).Declan and Dax were twins who complemented each other perfectly...brains and muscle meet sweet and romantic...and I just adored their relationships both with each other as well as with Elizabeth.This was one of those romances that balanced real life with fantasy and sweet with spice just perfectly.

"I really enjoyed this new biker romance quite a bit...the author has greatly improved her storytelling since her Desperado series and although I really enjoy reading all kinds of books with alpha male badboys, bikers are my favorite. In the first book, fathers and daughters who share a tragic past and who have strained relationships because of those issues, are always tough to read about, but I was very pleased with the progression of how they mended their fences and how the violent events surrounding Maggie's return home brought them back together. Jase is that kind of tough guy with a heart of gold and inside the muscular and sexy exterior is a teddy bear who just wants to be appreciated and loved.The second book is about Will who is Jase's closest ""brother"" in the MC and he would do anything for him and his club. But when Will becomes a loner and goes outside of the club's rules because of a tragic fire that took away his only family and hope, it takes him to the bar which now sits in that sacred spot. A matter of being in the wrong place at the right time has him getting involved with the cartel in a dangerous game to protect the new bar owner's family and especially the delicate Eva, who brings out both the softness and ugliness inside Will's hardened heart.I really enjoyed this next installment of this new biker series and although they have some of the characters appearing in each one, they can be read on their own without losing any enjoyment.Steamy, intense, violent and heart-warming all at the same time with an awesome ending.These two books are a deal in this box set and I would recommend grabbing them while the price is low.**** 4 **** ""coming home and getting back what you lost"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SN5GQ7NCE967/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YCUQTW#wasThisHelpful","R1SN5GQ7NCE967","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read a lot of MC books and although this one had some good points, I'm on the fence about it. It was obvious that it was written with a lot of English slangs/terms and although I don't mind the fact it takes place in the UK, I wasn't a fan of the whole pregnant woman taken as payment for a debt and what happens to Heather when she gets to the MC was just not my cup of tea (an 8 month pregnant woman forced to dance/strip to pay a debt?)Blade is a hottie with a softer side and he takes her as his own to protect her and her baby but what goes on after the birth and the twist at the end with cliffhanger was just something that made me shake my head and roll my eyes. I was going to read the next book to see what happens but the price was raised up overnight so I won't be buying it just yet.An ok read for those who might like a different type of biker book but for me (who has read hundreds of them) it just wasn't realistic enough.**** 3.5 **** ""he takes them both as his own"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HBN4ZTKLMK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01176M4N6#wasThisHelpful","R4HBN4ZTKLMK5","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whew! This was a LONG one...and it was really good but so long that at times it just dragged on with way too much detail...although now that I am finished I understand that the author wanted to paint a crystal clear picture of the lives (past and present) of these four individuals.Ysabelle, Sebastian, Julia and Olivia...all of them had very different but complex personalities, lives and yet they all had so much to do with each other that it was an interesting mix of life experiences, emotional ties and fate that brought them all together.I think the storyline itself was well thought out and it was extremely deep at times (as well as very steamy and erotic) but I would have liked to see a bit less and maybe edited for some of the less than necessary background that weighed down the book and didn't really do anything to move the story along.It is a freebie right now so I'd get it while you can but be prepared for a very long (over 500 pages) read that is as sexy as it is heartbreaking and hard to stomach at times.

"I picked up this one based on all the great reviews and the fact it hit #1 in the kindle store...and of course I like to support male authors as well.It started off hard hitting and sexy with a danger beneath the surface that makes the story fit the title. As Faith needs to escape her abusive and mean-hearted BF who is the head of a ruthless biker club, she lands in the lap of Jackson, who tells her that he will take everything she has to give for his protection and to be warned that it will not be pretty.What started off as an exciting and intriguing twist on the bad boy biker train, became a sweet and almost melodramatic romance when Jackson returns to Faith after accomplishing what he set out to do...protect her from her past.Don't get me wrong, it was an entertaining and fun book to read, but it just was not as hard hitting as advertised and ended up being a pretty gentle story about getting back what you left behind and making things right...a father and son forming a strong bond and giving up your old badboy ways for the love of a good woman.A good deal at 99 cents and pretty romantic for having been written by a male's perspective.**** 4 **** ""you can't judge a book (or a man) by the cover"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKHGOF6EOACA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165RFTZM#wasThisHelpful","R1MKHGOF6EOACA","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Drew and Charity have come a long way from the teens they were in earlier books and from the time Drew set Charity free to fly on her own and achieve more than what her life had allowed her to be at that turbulent time with her stripper mother.When trouble at CRISIS calls her back home to help with a difficult case that becomes more of a personal mission instead, she reunites with that boy now turned into an even more gorgeous man, and together she and Drew take down an insidious enemy while rekindling what they had given up.I really admire this author's ability to draw us in and make us care for her characters...the long Heaven Hill history and family sagas keep on showing how much these people care for each other and I especially appeciated how maturely Charity and Drew behaved (even when Charity was being humiliated by a club whore and Drew was forced to hear the truth of what Charity had gone through as a teen). Wonderful and romantic sequel with some exciting action.I am looking forward to Mandy and Dalton's story now (that man needed a swift kick in the butt!) and the small cliffie we were left with is the start of some more major drama for the couple.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.**** 4 **** ""coming home and still being free"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NN13E3UUQ6IH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E3CS74#wasThisHelpful","R1NN13E3UUQ6IH","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love my bikers rough and tough and I love my MM reads passionate but naughty...and with Layla Wolfe's Bent Zealots series, you get it all.Harte and Bond made an explosive combination...both dealing with issues of their own but finding an undeniable chemistry together that has raw, dirty sex written all over it.Wolfe does not write flowery, sweet, pretty romance...she writes in your face raunchy and realistic...gay men are a different breed in and out of the bedroom and so a fair warning that this is not for the prudish or easily shocked reader.I love the mix of family relationships ( a father and son on the outs from betrayal), a young trans teen who has to deal with the harsh realities of how society sees him and the MC's own problems with crooked  law enforcement and it all intertwines to make an exciting action packed twisted biker romance book.Be sure to read the first two books in the series first though, so you know the history of all the players...this is an awesome MM series with bite.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.***** 4.5 ***** ""coming out and coming together"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UO40YC1VXJSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016HGZSKW#wasThisHelpful","R2UO40YC1VXJSW","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Young love is always so sweet and intense, but being gay and closeted because of your ethnicity can be even tougher and makes it near impossible to follow through with your desires.This is the case in this new romance from Lily Lamb and she writes with the knowledge of the Turkish culture...the music, the food and especially the attitudes of the people and specifically the parents of the adorable, virginal Ilhan. John is the hunky caretaker/maintenance man in his apartment complex who he has been watching lustfully from afar, and it was only a matter of time before the games and glances became touches, kisses and a relationship. Of course there's still the matter of Ilhan's old-fashioned, conservative parents and what will happen when they discover the big secret their son is hiding?I loved this sweet and very sexy new book...it was very interesting to read about all the Turkish customs and the food descriptions just made me hungry...not to mention the hotter than hell sex these two shared!A great second book full of family, honest conversation about coming out and romance.***** 5 ***** ""coming out with a bang"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XSOZQWO7E5TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E4APBY#wasThisHelpful","R2XSOZQWO7E5TQ","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A great combination of a murder/suspense/thriller with a steamy/romantic erotica filled love story.Two young people who have lost their parents to tragedy, hiding out at the beach and discovering they have way more in common than they first thought, become a force to be reckoned with and hit the road in search of answers and hopefully solutions.I read this one in an afternoon and although there was a fair amount of repetitive sex scenes and I thought the characters acted and sounded much older than 19 and 21, it was enjoyable and a quick, fast paced read.It's on sale for 99 cents right now and was well worth the price for the entertainment value.Lots of violent action, explicit sexual scenes and some interesting twists.**** 4 **** ""growing up and saving a life"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTLAZHUSCCRMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WKG9P2#wasThisHelpful","RTLAZHUSCCRMU","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with the first two books in this series, I loved Shades and Skylar's story...it was so thrilling and the romance was steamy hot and complicated.There were so many twists and secrets revealed in Skylar's life from past to present and when she gets herself involved with another MC and has to run back home for protection, she ends up turning Shades life upside down and bringing danger and drama home to the ones she loves.A figure from her past comes back into her life to make things even more complicated and I really can't say too much more without spoiling all the surprises, but I'll just say that Nicole James has kept up her five star book streak with me and I can't wait to read the next in the series.Excellent MC series for those who want a lot of romance, family drama and exciting club action in their biker books.***** 5 ***** ""coming home to where she belongs"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PADGNAG0HR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYWP438#wasThisHelpful","R19PADGNAG0HR3","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A cop and an escort on the run...loved the blurb and really liked the exciting plot as well. It sounds like a simple enough idea but in true Skye Warren form, she always makes her stories dark with some interesting twists and the steamy romance is always in the forefront.Luke (the cop) and Philip (the former lover) make an interesting contrast to each other and Shelly is torn between the man who once wanted her but feels betrayed and the one she desperately wants but feels like she can't have because of their differences.It was really good and fun to read but just too short...I wanted more Luke and Shelly and even to know what happens with Philip's story later on.**** 4 **** ""can a bad girl change her ways?"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SXCC2SLM2H1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P5MEUS#wasThisHelpful","R12SXCC2SLM2H1","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read Rage and Wrath's books in this series and really enjoyed this MC and their strong men and women. Thrash is a very different type of book but really good in its own way...as Thrash is a very internally sensitive man with an eye for art and a need for a strong woman who is much more cultured than what he gets around the club.Nora is a ""starving artist"" who has rich, abusive (and racist) parents and when she meets Thrash at a showing of her work, and he buys a painting of hers while flirting outrageously, she has no clue he is a biker and what big changes her life is about to take after meeting him.Revenge is big in Thrash's world and what Nora is asked to do after just having begun a relationship with Thrash is more than most women would be able to handle...but Nora is stronger than most women and in the end she proves herself worthy of being an ol' lady.A good and entertaining, intense addition to the series with a bit more depth and a satisfying ending that was a long time coming.**** 4 **** ""beauty is where you find it"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OBMBI82Z4W1N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QN5PUU#wasThisHelpful","R2OBMBI82Z4W1N","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first book in this series last year and was blown away with how dark and painful it was to read...my heart literally hurt for Anna. I hadn't read any of the other books though so I was glad the complete set was on KU so I could read the rest of them and find out how it all ends.To say I was left shocked is an understatement...this book was so raw and at times very ugly that I had to keep putting it down, taking a break and then going back to it. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, but I just had to know all the secrets about who/what Anna really was and if Jack and Devin would get what they both deserved in the end.This was a brutal saga of immortals, humans...a paranormal fantasy with extreme BDSM content...nothing like I have ever read before and honestly, I'm not sure I have the stomach to read it again.

"I pretty much just devour everything this woman writes and no matter what the genre I just know it will be awesome. I took Born Savages with me on vacation to read ""in case I had a quiet moment"" and go figure, it ended up completely taking me away from my trip because all I wanted to do was read it all day long until I was finished.A theatrical family...all pretty much drama queens in one way or another...and what happens when these five siblings reunite for a reality show, is the basic storyline for this book but with so much more depth and flashbacks to a time that was both joyful and depressing. Monty, Ren, Ava, Spence and Bree are as close as brothers and sisters can be (when you live with extremely dysfunctional and abusive parental figures) and the damages done from a childhood full of high expectations and low self-esteem is far reaching as they come together for a second chance (each for their own reasons) at love, life and hopefully, some healing. Enter Oscar/OZ, a once ""almost Savage"" and now working as a guide for caving expeditions...his forbidden romance and explosive past with Ren will return years later to shake up the family and bring even more drama to what proves to be a wild family reunion.I am a huge reality show junkie, so I just LOVED the storyline in this book and I was not disappointed with the outcome at all.Cora Brent's narratives were bitingly sarcastic, witty, crazy/funny sometimes and right on the mark as far as family dramas go where guilt and anger fuel the fires in the relationships. Lita is pure evil and what I would consider the ""mom from hell"" and her character was written in such a way that you want to forgive every wrongdoing of each child and applaud them all for just surviving.If you enjoyed the masterpiece that was Unruly, you will surely love Born Savages (a clever play on their family name and title of the show) and I know that I am desperately wanting the next book in the series which I hope will be about bad boy big brother Monty.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.***** 5 ***** ""the family that hates together, loves together"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RARUIW45E4YI6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0166A6K88#wasThisHelpful","RARUIW45E4YI6","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMG...Clarissa Wild has really gone to the ultra-dark side with this new one...geez...I could barely catch my breath. From the very beginning it was a race to the finish with so much adrenaline pumping through the story that I was worn out by the time I got to the end. Secrets, lies, betrayals both from ruthless parents to their children and lovers to lovers, made this story emotional and very personal for the characters.A young woman taken captive and forced to endure days of torture (both physical and psychological) at the hands of a surprising enemy whose motives are very personal, makes this a very hard to read and uncomfortable tale and believe me when I say, the violence is extremely graphic and the sexual games steamy as much as they are painful. It is very hard to say too much about what happens without spoiling the twists and surprises (except I did figure out what the big secret was partway through) but let me just say that this one is very complicated and takes family loyalty and respect to a whole new level.Not for the sensitive reader or those who don't like scenes of abuse/non-con sexual contact/extreme bloody violence.I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review.**** 4 **** ""breaking each other down just to be whole again"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI089HQSVZPOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0165XCG8Y#wasThisHelpful","RI089HQSVZPOP","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I like a good rock book and although this was the start of a series about the Blow Hole Boys...it was more about the beginning and the relationship between Patience and Zeke.Both of these characters were abuse victims (both emotional and physical) and what happens to them on their journey past their terrible childhoods and towards a brighter future together, is the main portion of this first book. It had some very tense and upsetting, violent moments and the scenes with Patience and her dad were horrific but after the initial main ""meat"" of the story, things were wrapped up fairly fast and the ending was a bit too quick (in my opinion) after ALL we had to experience before we got to the ending.I am about to start the next one in the series, so looking forward to that one as well.**** 4 **** ""things a daddy should never do to his child"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHZZ6A72RL5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIYSEUO#wasThisHelpful","R2RHZZ6A72RL5T","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was quite a long and interesting book...full of mystery, suspense, darkness and a whole lot of steamy goodness as well. Nobody in this story was completely light or dark, good or bad...everyone had flaws, virtues and secrets being kept from the ones they loved and in the end (when all is revealed), we were able to see that life can go on and you can be fulfilled despite your own self-destructive ways.I really enjoyed this book (although it seemed to take forever to read) and although I found Juliette to be at times very frustrating, Vi an absolute brat and Killian a despicable jerk...I still came to love them all by the end of the book and hope to maybe get another one featuring Vi or even Arlo (because I think he needs redemption and I am curious what became of him afterwards).Get it while it's on sale and enjoy the depraved and dark ride through their world.***** 4.5 ***** ""the more you push, the more I pull"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306IBXST5NK2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014NGXDWS#wasThisHelpful","R306IBXST5NK2L","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That being said, you could still read Unstoppable and enjoy it (since they do explain how the kids came to be born at the same time and why they were so close) but it adds a bit to know that history does repeat itself somewhat. That issue is the only part of the book that bothered me (that and another secret we find out near the end) but for the most part, it was an intense story of friendship, family ties and coming-of-age with the poignant pain of survivng abusive relationships and rape.Be prepared for an extremely emotional and at times really hard to read book but know that life is not always pretty and love and the truth can sometimes be triumphant in the long run.**** 4 **** ""meant to be forever"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPJSZZWGNGZHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QDBVZWC#wasThisHelpful","RPJSZZWGNGZHV","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

True, it was about Honor and not Clara (although both of their stories are explained and elaborated on quite well) but since she was the older sister when they escaped and thus, the one most likely to have her story told first, I really appreciated it and was not disappointed.The mysterious Ivan, his bouncer Blue and the other girls were all very intriguing...but none more so than the darkly dangerous and sexy as hell Kip. I was on the edge of my seat every scene he was in and it took me quite a while to figure out what he was doing and who he really was and by then, like with Honor/Honey...it was way too late to get away from him and instead, I just hung on for the backlash.I was very pleased with how things were resolved as well and can't wait to read the rest of the books in this series.

It was different to get an inside view of the ""secret"" gambling rooms in Vegas and what ""card counting"" is all about but there were just too many ""coincidences"" and surprise reveals at the end to make it very believable.Romy and Bryson made a HOT couple for sure but so much of the story was filled with such sleazy characters, it made my skin crawl.As always, I do enjoy these biker romances from Celia Loren, but this one was not one of my favorites.**** 3.5 **** ""getting away with the con"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQA3F8AZ2JQ2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG9MH0S#wasThisHelpful","RQA3F8AZ2JQ2X","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again M.N. Forgy has told a story of love, lust, hatred, passion and regret all tied up in an awesome biker family package.When Dani bravely comes back to face her father and Shadow she is ready to take whatever they have to dish out (or so she thinks), since anything is better than dealing with her lying, back-stabbing mother. What happens to her when she returns to the fold is heartbreaking, violent but ultimately shows what she's really made of and how strong her connection really is to both her dad and her man.This one was chock full of romance, hot sex, club action and some really twisted family drama and I loved every second of it.I can't wait to see what this author has up her sleeve for future books.***** 4.5 ***** ""coming home to where you belong"" stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2483HFWUOZ11J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQF5SLS#wasThisHelpful","R2483HFWUOZ11J","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this series on my wishlist for a while now and as soon as this book went on sale I had to grab it! I really liked it for the most part despite a few issues (editing errors, changing POV from one sentence to the next with no warning) and although the sequence of events was a bit rushed and at times unrealistic, I really liked the couple of Ashton and Ethan ""Trigger"".The action in this MC romance was more about protecting Ashton from her abusive husband and his bodyguards and less about the actual MC business that most biker books deal with. I did also notice that all the women (from the club whores to the old ladies) were extremely nice...no nasty, crazy catfights and that was different as well. The Sacred Hearts seemed to be more about family and their brotherhood in arms and less about illegal or criminal activities (with the exception of getting revenge).If you like a biker book with more romance and focused on relationships and not the club per se...then this book is for you. Don't be surprised if you start humming the soundtrack to Les Mis after reading though...lol!**** 4 **** ""a broken princess and her white knight"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27GJSEZJFPQVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWK6EOY#wasThisHelpful","R27GJSEZJFPQVE","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pulled in by the blurb, then captivated by the first few chapters of this dark, psychological romance and then had to force myself to skip some long drawn out portions to get to the good stuff.There was an interesting dystopian/futuristic world feel to this story but I got bored with a lot of the over-explained inner dialogue of the main characters Tate/Viper and Autumn...and it just seemed to take too much effort to get to their actual relationship.Maybe I'm just too jaded and have read so many dark, gritty slave/Master books that I expect a lot from my reads (sometimes they are too similar), but it was still good and I did read until the very (not surprising) end. If you like a romance that is very full of mental games to go along with the physical ones, then you will probably like this book and right now it is 99 cents so it's a deal.**** 3.5 **** ""she is his because she wants to be"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGD4DMH75I38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MAIKXCA#wasThisHelpful","R2NGD4DMH75I38","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A really short but very sexy and steamy start to a new MC romance series with an interesting story and some thrilling secrets yet to be revealed.I usually don't like when an author releases short sections and forces you to buy them all when they make up one normal length book...ends up costing way more than one book...so I will hold off getting the next 4 in the series unless she releases them all as one book.It was really good and well written, but at less than 80 pages there was not enough time to give us more history and character development.I enjoyed it and devoured it in one sitting.**** 4 **** ""Harleys are made for riding long and hard"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25E8RCIXS5OVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOLS0O8#wasThisHelpful","R25E8RCIXS5OVC","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this free MC ""romance"" and for the most part it was good...fast paced and mostly steamy but with a heavy dose of reality as it dealt with physical and emotional abuse in a relationship (and not between the biker and the girl).I found the heroine Sydney to be a little annoying with her back and forth behavior with the abusive BF and especially having her family be bikers, she should have been tougher and more street smart. Cade was the at first, unattainable hot biker who was there to defend her most of the time, but dealing with his own family issues left him vulnerable to sabotage by another woman and all kinds of misunderstandings happen before things get straightened out.Plenty of sex, violence and a cautionary tale for women to be careful who they wish for...sometimes the baddest boys look like your harmless next door neighbor.**** 3.5 **** ""love is not supposed to be painful"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDB9Z21PV5QK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NID22JS#wasThisHelpful","RDB9Z21PV5QK4","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book by accident but that blurb pulled me in...nothing sexier than a hot, dangerous modern day pirate and a woman who was caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. It was exciting, passionate and full of interesting facts about illegal artifacts and smuggling which gave the story an almost realistic feel to it, but filled with a lot of sexual tension as well. I felt like the whole Dom/slave thing was unneccesary though (it just didn't feel right for some reason) and it was the only issue I had with the book that made it less enjoyable. Nick was much more than he was portrayed to be and Ellie was not quite ""forced"" to submit in the way the description leads us to believe.I really enjoyed the intrigue, romance and unexpected twists to the story and would definitely want to read more form this author.**** 4 **** ""he owns the biggest treasure of them all"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PPDRNA2F9ZWW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MTWS65S#wasThisHelpful","R3PPDRNA2F9ZWW","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very interesting stepbrother romance with a slightly different twist. In this case Slade was a total bad boy who used his stepsister as revenge against his own father...but then left home to become...gasp...a doctor.You would think that becoming a healer and taking an oath to take care of people would change the manwhore...but nope, that would be too easy.When stepsister Iris is forced to put their shady and very steamy past behind her for a greater good and sets out to find him, the only person she believes is able to save her younger brother's life, will Slade's feelings for her be enough to convince him to help or will he prove himself to be the biggest jerk in the world.I really enjoyed this fast paced and biting story about a childish grudge gone bad and the far reaching consequences of one man's selfish actions. It was as emotionally sad as it was sexually charged...Slade and Iris had an off-the-charts chemistry and I was very pleased with the end result of their mutual desire to set things right.I received a free copy of this book for an honest review.**** 4 **** ""to forgive, forget and heal yourself"" stars","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWTMK1W74M79N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015D8F3W8#wasThisHelpful","RWTMK1W74M79N","A3W3XC01BFJJMR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3W3XC01BFJJMR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I’m not a big griller, but have been using the gloves in place of my old oven mitts in the kitchen.  I really like them.  They do a great job of keeping the heat out, they are much thinner than my old ones which makes it easy to maneuver items in the oven, and when I stick my thumb in something I’m cooking (which happens regularly), I can just rinse them off.My advice to the seller would be to market these in two ways.

"I have really enjoyed this book. I will say, there have been times when I felt like it was getting slow or I had read 50 pages and really not progressed in the story, but as soon as I thought that, something big would happen and suck me back in.This isn't the kind of story where it goes on and on and then everything wraps up in the last 30 pages. There are big events happening throughout the story. I kept thinking I knew who the killer was, but I was wrong in the end.I did ding one star due to the lulls in the story line, but it's still a book is recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDBM4X3XL15V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317382#wasThisHelpful","RWDBM4X3XL15V","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m not brand loyal when it comes to dishwasher detergent, so I’ve used quite a few brands over the years.  In general, I find them to all be about the same.  This product claims to provide maximum shine, ultimate clean, and no need to pre-rinse.• Did it make my dishes shine?  Yes.  Do other detergents?  Yes.• Did it clean the dishes?  Yes.  Do other detergents?  Yes.• Did it eliminate the need to pre-rinse?  No.  Do other detergents?  No.  (Let’s face it, when there are Spaghetti-O’s flinging around in the dishwasher, they’re going to get stuck to everything if you don’t rinse them off first.)I do want to add, I don’t live in a house with hard water.  My review might be completely different if I did.  I have lived with hard water and know the layer of film that creates.  It might be that I would have a different opinion of I were dealing with that.Overall, I feel this is a good dishwasher detergent, but I didn’t find it superior to the other cheaper options on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ILT7NW255DLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TP29C0I#wasThisHelpful","R2ILT7NW255DLV","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have three cats and this was a total flop with all three. First off, the flashing light in the ball was dead on arrival.  I removed the battery tab and nothing happened.  I searched for directions to see if there was more I needed to do and there were none in or on the box.  As for the cats, one actually got up and walked away when it was placed in front of him and the other two were completely oblivious. They didn't want to sit on the ""lounger"" (which is just cardboard for scratching) and were actually more interested in the box.

"Let me preface by saying, I’m not a camper, therefore, I’m not a sleeping bag connoisseur.  My son has been complaining that we never go camping, so for his 8th birthday, I bought him a tent (a real camping tent) so he could camp in the back yard.  Well, of course, he needed a sleeping bag, so when I had the chance to pick this up and review it, I jumped on it.Overall, I’m pleased with the sleeping bag for our use.  I have no idea if it will really keep you warm in 20 degree weather or not though because my son won’t be camping in the back yard when it’s that cold.  The sleeping bag is very comfortable.  It is well padded which is a must for sleeping on the ground.  The construction is amazing and will definitely hold up for years to come.A few things I didn’t like were that it was very difficult to put away.  Luckily, I just have to get it from the back yard into the house, but if I were backpacking, this would be a huge issue.  Once rolled back up, there is no way to tie it shut, so that is a struggle.  It comes with a bag, but I quickly gave up on getting it back in the bag.  So, we wrapped a bungee cord around it and put it in the closet.  I just don’t understand why a $75 sleeping bag wouldn’t have a way to tie it closed.As a whole, it is a very good sleeping bag with one flaw (the lack of a tie).  I dinged it one star for that, but it is still a sleeping bag I would recommend to a camper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1G7RJT851GB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AA4I422#wasThisHelpful","RH1G7RJT851GB","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been struggling with dry ends that want to split and break.  I expect most of it is due to using a hair dryer, so I was excited to try this product. I’ve been using it for about a week now and can tell a difference.  I’m not sure if I’m just adding moisture or if it is really shielding my hair from the blow dryer damage, but either way, it is working well.

When I first got the dryer, I looked at the ring and it didn't look like much. I'm still not sure how it's supposed to work, but I attached it to the dryer no gave its shot.I've been using the dryer for a few days ad I'm not sure the conditioning ring is doing much. With that said, I really do like the dryer. It blows a ton of air, but isn't nearly as hot as my old dryer (even on the hottest setting).  The thing is, with the increased airflow, my hair dries just as quick as before without the damaging effects of the high heat.I did ding one star since I really don't see the conditioning ring doing anything, but other than that, I really like this dryer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R549WCNPRNSVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQN6C0Y#wasThisHelpful","R549WCNPRNSVF","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked up this toaster because the one at home is about 20 years old and doesn’t have a lot of the functionality of this one.Pros:1. The settings seem to be dead on.  When I choose to make toast, I push the button and when it pops, it is perfect.  The same is true with other items.2. It can be adjusted both width and height to fit whatever you’re toasting perfectly.  This is great for someone who is sick of trying to cram a bagel in the toaster or whose Pop Tart is forever falling over in the toaster making it hard to get out.3. It makes toasted sandwiches!  This was the functionality that I liked the most.  I love a toasted turkey sandwich.  Before, I had to toast the bread and microwave the turkey (which I think makes it taste funny).  The basket allows you to make the sandwich, put it in the basket, put the basket in the toaster, and get a perfect sandwich that doesn’t fall apart while toasting.Cons:1. When I received it, my first thought was that it was huge.  It is big enough to put toast or a bagel in side by side which makes it pretty long and it takes up quite a bit of counter space.2. As silly as it sounds, it is complex.  I’m still not sure if I’m supposed to put everything in the basket or if I can put things directly in the toaster.  Depending on the directions you read, it is different.  Maybe you can do either?  If I bought this for my grandma, she would be lost and would go back to her old toaster.3. While it is a nice product, it is WAY overpriced.  It is a toaster.  I can get a toaster for $15.Overall, I like the toaster.  It works just as it claims to.  I did ding a star based on the complexity and the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11SSU9ZF7R41N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJLD7D4#wasThisHelpful","R11SSU9ZF7R41N","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to break this review out into different sections since the box comes with so many items.  In the box, you can expect to find one package of newborn diapers, two packages of size 1 diapers, one wipe refill bag, a plastic zippered travel wipe container (with wipes), and coupons.Wipes RefillI love Huggies wipes.  I think they’re better than anything else on the market.  They’re just the right thickness and are soft, but not too soft.  I’ve used them on bottoms, but they are also great for wiping little hands, wiping dirty faces, wiping the counter, and they take off eye makeup better than any eye makeup remover I’ve ever used!Zippered WipesThis is a great idea!  So many times our travel pack of wipes gets mangled.  This is durable and easy to refill with more wipes.  Why has no one done this sooner?DiapersUnfortunately, I’m not as big of a Huggies diaper fan as I am the wipes.  These are a little nicer than the Huggies of the past, but still don’t compare to Pampers.  I will say, I loved the soft inside.  I’ve never really understood the diapers that are soft on the outside since that part isn’t against the baby’s skin.  These are SOOO soft on the inside.  They have a nice elastic waist and a wetness indicator (although I find this gimmicky because it’s not rocket science to tell if a diaper is wet).  The biggest problem I have with these diapers is that they don’t hold urine well.  Too many times, we had wet clothes, but when I removed the diaper, the diaper was barely wet.  I actually joked that it was like they repelled urine.  For me, this is a deal breaker when it comes to diapers.Overall, I’m pleased with the set.  It’s a great assortment of diaper sizes and wipes.  I’m only knocking off one star for the leaky diapers because that is a small part of the set and I know some people don’t have problems with them leaking.  Maybe it’s just the shape of my kids!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT5W09AWPJQ2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQA23R6#wasThisHelpful","RT5W09AWPJQ2V","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this set because I’ve been trying to add some weight training to my workout, but there are days when I simply can’t get to the gym.  I figured this would be a good substitute.Pros:1. Very easy to use.  Just choose the exercise you want to do, place the bands over a door, and set it to the level indicated on the exercise card.2. I found that most of the exercises had decent resistance.3. Very small and easy to store/transport.4. They seem to be very durable.Cons:1. Limited exercises on the card.  I would have liked to see more.  I realize I can make up my own, but it would be nice to have instructions about position and the level that is recommended on the bands.2.

"I have tried numerous products that claim to kill weeds while not killing the grass.  I have yet to find one that is effective.  Usually, the weed wilts a little and then is just fine within a few days.  I was excited to try this product hoping for better results.  When I received it, I went outside and saturated four dandelions and one prickly weed.  A day later, the dandelions had done the usual wilting and the prickly weed was looking a little less green.  The second day, the dandelions hadn’t changed, but the prickly weed was looking pretty dead.  After about five days, I’m pretty sure the prickly weed is dead, but all four dandelions are bouncing back.  I will say, the product didn’t harm the grass at all.Overall, I found this product to be about as effective as any other weed killer that won’t kill the grass.  It seems that none of them are strong enough to kill the dandelions.  I was pleased with how it killed the prickly weed, but since I had one of those in my whole yard and hundreds of dandelions, the weeds I really needed it to kill didn’t die.

"I work for a large corporation (over 50,000 employees) and manage one person.  I was interested in this book as a way to evaluate how I’m managed as well as what kind of a manager I am.Pros:1. I think the book is dead on when discussing things like the impact of layoffs and  how a company that is loyal to its employees in hard times will create employees who are loyal right back when times are good and they could easily find other work.  I found myself sitting nodding my head and seeing the shortcomings of my company numerous times2. The 12 rules were perfect.  I really thing the seventh rule, “Don’t Kill the Meaning” was my favorite.  It essentially says that people will be more engaged and happier if they don’t see something they worked hard for destroyed in front of them.  I know my company struggles with this one.  We build applications and immediately replace them or marketing puts together new colors and logos and within two years, they’ve been replaced.  People sit and watch everything they worked for get replaced.  I also really liked “Magnify Their Success”.  This is something I’ve tried to do for awhile.  Something as simple as a pizza party after completing a project makes people feel appreciated.3. Management books can be very boring, but this book was full of stories and examples of good and bad management and was actually a fun, interesting read.Cons: The only con I found was that while the book focused on what to do and what not to do, I didn’t feel like I left understanding how to implement a lot of these things.  For example, one section talked about being cool and how one company allowed employees to wear shorts and flip flops all summer.  That is great, but most of us don’t have the authority to make those decisions.  So many examples of how were shown from a senior management level.  I would have liked to see more ideas on how to implement these things at a lower management level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXWFNSF0TIETL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071847782#wasThisHelpful","RXWFNSF0TIETL","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this product for free to review.  In my opinion, that makes me about as unbiased as anyone since I’m not angry about having wasted my money (and I would feel that way if I had paid for it).  I was very, very disappointed in this monitor.  When I ready through the description and saw all the bells and whistles, I was very excited, but unfortunately, most of them don’t work well at all.1. I was able to get the handheld device to work, but the app never did.  No matter how many times I installed and uninstalled, it just kept crashing.  I finally gave up.  So, sorry, I can’t rate the quality of the app beyond this.2. The picture quality of the handheld is pretty bad in the day and very bad at night.  For $250, I would expect the camera to be much better quality than this.  Or maybe it’s the handheld.  I don’t know.  I just know it’s bad.  Let’s face it, it’s 2015.  Cheap phone cameras work better.3. As if the video quality weren’t bad enough, there is a lag which is very annoying.4. I like the idea of a thermometer on the device.  I can’t tell you how many times I check on the baby to make sure he isn’t hot or cold.  But, the thermometer is pretty inaccurate so I’m concerned when I shouldn’t be and not concerned when I should be.5. The battery life on the handheld is poor.There were a few nice things about it.  For example, the video feed is secured, you can zoom and pan from the handheld, and it has the ability to add more cameras setup if you have more than one child.In all though, for $250, this should have been a top of the line monitor system and it simply isn’t.

"I’ll admit two things before completing this review.  1. It’s been about 6 years since I bought a high chair, so I’m not completely up to date on all the bells and whistles available by competitors.  2. I picked this up for my nephew to use when he’s at my house which means it isn’t getting daily use.  Therefore, it’s impossible for me to rate how well holds up with continual use.Pros:1. The biggest seller for me was how well it folds and stores.  Since I only get it out for my nephew, I want it out of the way when he’s not here and this high chair fit the bill.2. The cover is relatively easy to clean.  Like all high chairs, you ‘ll need to get into the grooves which is a bit of a pain.3. There is the main tray and then kind of a tray insert.  This is a nice feature for someone who wants to put a child in the chair and then prepare the food.  I never used it this way though.4. The tray comes with a cover.  I like this a lot because I can clean the tray, cover it, store the highchair, and know it will be clean the next time I need it.5. The tray is dishwasher safe.6. The assembly was very simple.7. I got the ecru color and like how it is completely gender neutral8. The height adjustment was great.  My table has kind of a lip and I’ve had problems actually pushing a high chair up to the table because it will hit.  With this one, if it hits, I can just lower it a notch and go on.Cons:1. As with all full sized high chairs, it takes up a lot of floor space when in use.  For daily use, I actually prefer a space saver high chair that attaches to a chair.2. Because the inner tray doesn’t completely cover the sides of the main tray, you end up having to wash both of them with every meal.Overall, I feel that the pros greatly outweigh the cons on this highchair which is why I gave ti all five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCLKYMUI1W5P8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOGIPV8#wasThisHelpful","RCLKYMUI1W5P8","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pleasantly surprised when this barn arrived.  My daughter had had one ages ago and I really expected the quality to have gone down over the years, but if anything, it has gotten better.Pros:1. Finally, a toy that actually comes with enough figures.  We’ve had toy after toy that come with minimal figures (or cars in anything that uses cars) and to fully enjoy the item, the parent needs to buy more.  This barn comes with one farmer, six animals (cow, goat, horse, pig, chicken, sheep), and a bale of hay.  There are enough figures to completely fill the barn, so no need to buy more. The style of the figures is typical Little People and they could easily be used with other sets.2. It is a very good size, but not heavy or awkward for little kids or parents.3. Overall, the barn is very sturdy.  This could take a tumble down the stairs and come out just fine on the other side.  This is very important with toddlers who will do things like use it as a step or sit on it.4. The barn sings, but it isn’t too annoying and can easily be shut off.  It came with batteries.5. After it is latched, it is easy for a small child to open.  There aren’t any latches or tight fits.  It stays closed okay.  Not great, just okay.6. Has a carrying handle which is very nice because it is a decent size.7. The age range is close.  Closer than some other toys, but I can’t imagine a 5 year old would be interested in this.  I would say it’s more like 1-4.  Also, since there aren’t small parts, supervised, I think a child under 1 could play with it.Cons:1.The packaging.  Oh, the packaging.  It took me forever to get all the parts out because everything was zip tied, taped, enclosed in plastic (that was also taped), etc.  About halfway through trying to open it, I caught myself thinking, “Well, this is the first thing I’m putting in this review!”  If you’ve got a toddler who will be waiting for you to get it opened, open it before showing it to him/her.2. It doesn’t come assembled.  You have to remove screws and then reinstall them to put together the two halves.  It isn’t complex, but does require a phillips screwdriver.3. We’re getting ready to go away for a weekend and this is a toy I plan to bring.  I noticed last night that there is nowhere secure to put the figures where they won’t fall out when being carried.  On my daughter’s barn (ages ago) you could put them in the silo and close it.  This one doesn’t have that.Even with the few cons, I really like this barn.  The negative things are minor compared to the things I really like which is why I didn’t ding this item a star.  Once it’s out and together, if you’re not traveling with it, none of the cons apply.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JPA9ZLAR4UTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHPH4CM#wasThisHelpful","R1JPA9ZLAR4UTS","A2OJCTT5WLB2HR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OJCTT5WLB2HR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And I have tried to find LED bulbs to convert from the old incandescent style but the other ones were either that harsh light or bright white...  these give of a more realistic light.

"This one surprised me.  I was expecting this to be a novelty type item but it turn out it works very well and does what it claims.1st the wine chiller:  This is a stainless steel piece you put in the freezer for a while then screw onto the pour spout.  It gets nice and cold in about 20-30 minutes and holds the temperature of the wine down for about 45 minutes (on a 45 degree white wine) and keeps the heat out of 65 degree red for about an hour when sitting in the shade on an 80 degree evening...  That actually surprised me. Most wine chillers I have used in the past lasted maybe 20 minutes under the same situation.2nd the pour spout:  It is plastic with a rubber stopper.  It works very well and pours wine pretty much exactly the way you would expect.3rd the aerator:This one I'm not overly qualified to talk about but in my limited knowledge of wine aeration it does at least as good as the much higher priced aerating decanter that I own...All in all at the price I would recommend this if you are in the market.  It does exactly as it claims and it looks pretty nice too.

"Good Halogen replacementsThese are in use in my parents art gallery and they work really well and I am very happy with them compared to the halogens they replaced.  I will say that if you are replacing more than 2 bulbs get enough to change all of them out at the same time as there is a slight difference in the ""feel"" of the light although they are the same warmth factor.Pros:*The light is a white light so it keeps colors more true.*4 LED sections, many only have a single array.*Ballast on these do not heat up. (Older LED Halogen replacements got really hot.)*They are direct fit replacements, they are the same size and same connections.Cons:*The true longevity is unknownThey tend to ""flick"" on (It is a little distracting sometimes, but only at the instant of turn on)Overall giving the lower cost per bulb these are worth the price and the cons don't cause enough concern to subtract a star.Just my thoughts,AKFull disclosure I received these at a discount specifically to do a review.

"As far as fruit infusers go this one is a great option.  It has a large capacity since most I see are maybe 20oz.  The infuser is easy to pull apart and add fruit into and it simply screws right back together.  Another feature that makes this bottle stand out to me is that the water has to flow past the fruit in order to get out which adds a bit more flavor (in my opinion).  It is made of a sturdy plastic with what seems to be higher quality seals.  Being such a large water bottle it holds a bunch of fruit too.Overall:  I really like this bottle and the price is very competitive for what it is.Just my thoughts,AKFull disclosure this was sent to me at a reduced price specifically to review.

"This is a Great Little water bottle...  I now use it as my daily carry around the house water bottle.  I use it primarily for water or flavored water and it works really well and even with flavored water the bottle doesn't pick up color stains.  I am pretty rough on water bottles and they usually only last a short time but this one seems like it will last quite a while for me.  I've dropped it, knocked it over and washed it without any issues.  The only fear I have is that the stopper will degrade and not be secure in the future but at this price point it's not worth deducting a star for.  All in all I am very happy with this bottle....Pros:*It holds just a bit more than a standard 20oz bottle.*The glass is pretty tough, since getting it I have dropped it twice and it shows no sign of damage or deforming.*It comes with a rubber stopper that holds liquid in very well.  I have flipped it on it's side and it hasn't leaked yet.Cons:*The lid does not screw on so there is a potential to have it come loose (This hasn't happened to me yet, just a possibility)Just my Thoughts,AKFull Disclosure I received this item at a reduced price to specifically review.

"As good as can be expected and they do their job without issue...I bought 4 of these to ceiling mount for some speakers and they do the job without issues...Installation is a bit tricky if you are not careful.  you need an exact square hole and you need to measure the box on each as they are all just slightly different in size (I'm assuming this is a manufacturing tolerance) all within 1/8th inch but measure them all and cut specifically for each one I would suggest cutting even just slightly under that size to make these snug in the wall and give enough space to screw it into the wall.  The screws are relatively close together so you need to be careful when cutting and securing them.What I did is use a little liquid nails around the outside and then fitted them into the holes I had cut so that way even if the screws don't hold they stay put.Despite the installation trickiness I would still recommend these as they give a nice finished look without the typical ""wallplate"" style...Just my thoughts,AK","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDBFTO6UQNRZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008S9JYCK#wasThisHelpful","RDBFTO6UQNRZ1","AOXXCWMIG217L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXXCWMIG217L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Full disclosure this was sent to me specifically so I could review it.  But I am giving my honest opinion of the product.Update:**After using it for a couple weeks I noticed it has become harder to swivel when containers have things in them.  This is not something I would expect even at this price point so I have -1 star for that...  I think this is due to the plastic warping a but under the weight of full containers of things like sugar.  I moved the heaviest (not very heavy) to the bottom and lighter up top and this has solved this for the time being**This is an interesting concept for a spice container.  I am using it for some of the things I use a lot of.  Sugar, bullion cubes, powdered creamer so far. I haven't decided what to put in the other 2 compartments yet...That said this is a plastic item, not glass and metal.  Also it is worth noting this does not contain ""bottles"" they are cups that rotate around a central core and they do not seal closed (Implied by the wording bottle)But I feel the price point reflects that which is why I left the rating at 5 stars.  If they made a glass and metal version that seals in this style this I would definitely get it.It took some thought of what to put into the compartments since it isn't quite big enough for bulk items you might use like flour and the compartments don't seal shut so keep that in mind.Overall I am pleasantly surprised by this spice organizer.  I had thought about using it for medications, but the pill bottles my pharmacy gives out are too large and I don't like the idea of having unsecured medications in the house, but that is a thought...  Also it does come apart easily for quick cleaning.My Rating:Price for what it is: 5 StarsNot Sealing containers: -1 StarComes with spoons: +.5 StarEase of cleaning: +.5 StarOverall 5 Star RatingJust my Thoughts,AK","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROAYFLITKKZ9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U27Z2VS#wasThisHelpful","ROAYFLITKKZ9V","AOXXCWMIG217L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXXCWMIG217L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these for install in my parents house to (Pardon the pun) unify their WiFi network which had been handled by 3 typical routers, 2 of which were in AP mode.  In my case the wires were already mostly in place, I just had to move them from the wall into the ceiling as indoor UniFi APs all like to be ceiling mounted for best coverage (Outdoor ones are a but different).  All 3 hooked in and powered on without a problem.  I paired them with the UniFi Security Gateway and Controller software v4+.They now give double the coverage range of the Amped Wireless high power Routers they replaced and with Zero hand-off enabled they can move around the house without losing signal or connection for even a second.  The 3 APs now give their entire house signal (3500SQ Foot) and full coverage in their front and back yards. The Amped routers covered the house with only a couple dead zones and barely reached the gardens at all.Install was dead simple if you know anything about running Ethernet cable and the software walkes you though setup even with the most basic knowledge of networking.Just my Thoughts,AK","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37I5UYOEHD25A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DJERLFG#wasThisHelpful","R37I5UYOEHD25A","AOXXCWMIG217L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXXCWMIG217L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So far so good.I am currently using this on a network now almost exclusively of UniFi products.  (3 UniFi AC APs 3 Trendnet 5 Port Switches and a BlueTech 24 Port Switch all running full gigabit)The box itself looks like nothing special, 4 ports, Lan, Wan, management and VOIP.  If you are used to a traditional router with WiFi and 4 Lan ports this will probably seem a bit weird but it isn't at all.  In my opinion moving to just a router, and just APs makes good sense becasue you can upgrade either without having to upgrade everything.  But anyway, back to my review.I am tech savvy but I am no trained network specialist.  That said I had this set up on my network within 10 minutes (including upgrading to the Version 4+ controller software.  The controller recognized it right away and it connected without a problem.

The router handles all the incoming/outgoing traffic without missing a beat. (Firmware v4.2.4.4733350)So far it's been a set and forget gateway and I couldn't be happier with it.

"This Replacement power cord for Toshiba Laptops is very good.  It is a direct fit replacement and it has been working without an issue for a week in my old laptop...  BUT Before you put it in MAKE SURE that the black and red wires are in the right place!!!  I can't stress that enough!!!I have an L655-S5150 and this cord fit perfectly but my 2 red and 2 black wires were reversed on the connector...  Before you remove your old one take pictures, make sure they are right.  If you get one that is reversed you can simply pull the wires out of the connector and reposition them (This is what I had to do) then reconnect.That said if you are not comfortable doing this yourself take your computer to someone who is, connecting this wrong can fry your motherboard and ruin the laptop...This is an issue for most versions of this replacement DC jack for Toshiba laptops so no matter which one you choose make sure the wires match your configuration!!If you are comfortable taking apart the laptop and making sure the wire colors match then this is a good choice for a DC jack replacement and I would recommend it.Just my 2 cents,AK","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R370FD8UZFBXTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005UEYDV8#wasThisHelpful","R370FD8UZFBXTT","AOXXCWMIG217L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXXCWMIG217L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:41 MinsAfter receiving these I promptly put the first battery on the charger, waited about a 2hours then noticed it was charged, so I swapped it out with my Samsung Battery and tried some tests.** I will be updating this review over the next few weeks as I use them more often.****Update 1: The company contacted me regarding this review, they seemed unhappy that I pointed out that this product charges phones using the USB slower than dedicated bricks do and not giving a 5 star rating.  I applaud them for being proactive and I feel this shows a very high willingness to put out a quality product and honestly my opinion of the company is quite high.  That being said I stand by my rating of 4.5 Stars, It is an excellent product, and it is significantly cheaper than OEM batteries and some alternatives that exist as well. But slower USB charging of devices needs to be pointed out as a small subset of users may find this to be an issue.  It makes little impact on the day to day performance, but the fact is that this is the case.  So in conclusion, I really like this product and feel it is a top notch value for the price point. With a few minor tweaks in future versions this could go from a 4.5 Star product to 5 Stars...**-Battery Drain seems on par with the Samsung battery-NFC works, no noticeable difference in NFC even with Wireless charging cover on the phone.-Charger does charge OEM Samsung batteries.-USB port on charger does charge devices but I did notice that it took about an hour longer to charge my phone from 10% to full than when using the standard cable and brick sent by Samsung.All in all I am happy with these batteries and charger and will use them as needed, I feel the price for what you get is excellent, the company seems genuinely interested in making sure you are completely satisfied so I would recommend this product if you are looking for spare/replacement batteries for your Galaxy S5...A Feature I thought would be awesome, but not required, would be the ability to use the USB port to charge a device when not plugged in to the wall (I.E. Using those extra batteries like a portable charger)  Like I said neat but not needed...So to sum it up:5 Stars to start-.5 Star for slower USB port charging (An issue that some people may care about while others will not)So 4.5 Stars overall, But since we Can't do half stars I rounded down to 4 in the interest of being fair and honest.Just my thoughts,AKFull Disclosure:This was sent to me specifically for me to review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A8XAI6Q6W9ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KF2TFRC#wasThisHelpful","R3A8XAI6Q6W9ZY","AOXXCWMIG217L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOXXCWMIG217L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laura Nyro's double album ""Live at the Bottom Line"" is an exquisite live set. Released on Cypress Records, Nyro shines in the looser live format with the her band, particularly Frank Pagano on drums, giving a punch to the recording as we hear the interplay between Nyro and the band. Nydia Mata gives delightful percussive touches throughout. ""Roll of the Ocean"" in particular works well with this live energy. Many of Nyro's songwriting hits like ""Wedding Bell Blues,"" ""Stoned Soul Picnic"" (recorded by The Fifth Dimension) and ""And When I Die"" (recorded by Blood, Sweat & Tears"") shine as well as some of the lesser known songs in her canon like ""Women of the One World"" and ""Sohphia/My Innocence"" that dazzle. ""The Wild World,"" written as an advocacy song for the treatment and respect of animals, fares well with guitars and other instruments imitating elephant sounds, etc. I have this release on both CD & vinyl; and the vinyl shines superbly with the depth and quality of the recording.

"Maia Sharp's ""The Dash Between the Dates"" is another strong set from this delightful singer/songwriter.  The set opens with the catchy ""Nothing But the Radio"" with its romantically playful lyric, ""Take off your shirt and don't stop until there's nothing but the radio on.""  ""Real Love"" (not the Beatles' single) is a strong track with Maia's vocals wistfully expressive and then full and resonate on the chorus, ""You don't have to be anybody but the somebody you really are; Give me that sweet laugh with the crooked grin.""  ""You Know Where I'll Be"" is another gem that has me reaching for the repeat button with Lizz Wright joining on background vocals that makes the recording take flight, ""I'm falling further than I ever dared to; It doesn't even throw me that I don't know where you stand.""  Other tracks like ""Little Bottles,"" ""Phoenix"" & ""Poison the Well"" are also standouts.  Sharp shines on this lovely set.

"Rhodes' ""Wishes"" is expansive orchestral pop that highlights his melodic songwriting and strong vocal presence.  ""Close Your Eyes"" builds and soars in the chorus, ""I'm just the same as you & it's alright; Just stay by my side.""  ""Let It All Go"" which brings in Birdy on vocals, is a gem with the sonic expanse, ""I don't know why we need to break so hard.""  ""Wishes,"" the last track on the regular CD, builds its romantic angst beautifully with piano, ""Remember the white knight stare; Didn't I show I care?  I do, I do.""  Of the six extra tracks on the deluxe edition, ""Glow"" [track 13] sparkles with strong vocals and Rhodes' expansive vocals exploding into stars, ""There a man in me; and he's always careful.  There's a light in me; and it's all I care for.""  ""Run,"" [track 15], also rivets the listener with romantic desperation.  ""Wishes"" is an excellent set by this strong new artist.

"""Light Up the Dark"" is my introduction to Gabrielle Aplin.  The opening title track bursts out of the speakers like an unexpected storm, ""And when the flood is over and the love starts pouring out, I wanna be the one.""  ""Sweet Nothing"" is another good track, with her voice given a chance to sell the melody, ""I feel your arms around me; You say you feel the love, but oh, I feel alone.""  ""Anybody Out There"" is another gem with a pounding rock beat and background vocals that howl like the wind, ""There's always silence in the void; and I kind of miss the noise of having you round.""  While the CD doesn't have the attraction of a set by Adele, it does boast much good work.  If there are weaknesses, some of the material seems faceless and the production submerges the young singer's expressive vocals.  That said, this is a very promising set, well worth your listening time.

"I spotted John Mark Nelson's ""I'm Not Afraid"" in new releases and flipped to watch some video performance.  He's got a great expressive voice; so I flipped for the CD.  Now that it's been spinning in my changer, I'm totally flipping for the music!  This disc is a great discovery.  There is no such thing as weak tracks on the disc.  His music is melodic pop.  The set opens with party sounds on ""After All I've Done,"" a sparkling joyful pop gem, and breaks into a gorgeous chorus, ""This is where I long to know you and everything you've created.""  ""I'll Give You More"" also sparkles with its beat like a stalker sneaking up on you, ""Growing older is a fragile game, ever onward, ever turning.""  ""Broken"" jumps out of the speaker with originality and verve, the catchy melody juxtaposed to a contemplative lyric, ""If the worst is really over, why do I still feel the same?""

"Rob Thomas' ""The Great Unknown"" may be his best solo set ever.  ""I Think We'd Feel Good Together"" blasts the set off with a throbbing quasi-rap chorus, ""Maybe you can stay one night or stay forever.""  The single ""Trust You"" follows with another pulsing beat and ends with what sounds like a child's voice echoing the title, ""I trust you!""  ""Wind It Up"" continues the pop ambrosia with Victor Indrizzo's pounding drum sounding somewhere between ecstasy and the resulting headache.  ""One Shot"" follows with high energy pop-rock, ""Everybody want to get high again and play it all night long; Everybody get a little wild and then they turn and go back home.""  ""Absence of Affection"" is the romantic polar opposite of the opening track with its breakup lyric laced over classic rock rhythms, ""In the absence of affection, you'll take anything and call it love.""  ""NLYTM"" (Not Like You Told Me) has one of those catchy melodies that gets stuck in your head -- Boom Boom Boom!  ""Heaven Help Me"" is another track that has me reaching for the repeat button the changer, a bit more melodic, totally catchy.  ""Lie to Me"" is a strong track casting Thomas as the guy desperately in love, ""Just tell me anything; Girl, you can lie to me; I want to hear you sing or scream and cry to me.""  This is Thomas' best since his 2005 ""Something To Be"" solo shot.  Don't miss it!

"I found a copy of this instrumental album from 1959 on Liberty Records at a used book shop.  Without knowing much about it but seeing that Si Waronker (the first owner of the label) produced it, I thought I'd give it a try.  Boy, was this worth my dollar!  I cranked this sucker up on my new stereo and was in my bliss.  It is a wild romp with the percussive elements going snap, crackle & pop out of the speakers.  I thought I might be getting some schlock, but was thrilled by the quality of musicianship and the care with the production and arrangement.  Having the cover and vinyl in great shape made me feel like I was in a time machine back to when I was seven!  ""Quiet Village"" which was a #4 hit and originally released on 1957 LP ""Exotica"" ends the album.  ""Firecracker"" which I subsequently read was covered by the 1990's band The Cocktails is a gem.  This is a sweet set, well worth discovery for fans of instrumental music.

"Lesley Gore's ""Someplace Else Now"" is the missing link for me.  I had not heard this album when it was released in 1972.  Quite frankly, I wasn't into Lesley Gore at that time.  With hindsight as the perfect eyepiece, I can see how this set would have raised hopes that Gore could transition into the singer-songwriter era.  Gore's 2005 CD  ""Ever Since"" knocked me out completely!  It seemed to come out of nowhere.  Her voice had deepened to where at times she made me flash on Nina Simone.  I saw her on the tour to promote that CD and realized how great her classic canon was.  [Note: I remember her saying in the concert that she didn't call them ""oldies""!]  This CD is kind of missing link between that great CD and her Mercury-era hits.This music is different.  So it does not have the girl group harmonies and hand clap percussion.  What we have is a mature singer at the top of her craft.  ""The Road I Walk"" is a beautiful song that Gore wrote with a strong melody and Gore's vocals full and impassioned, ""What price must we pay for love; What price must we pay for glory; Tell me God, it there's one above, must I live the same sad story?""  ""Mine"" is another strong song.  I don't know a lot about Gore's biography, but I did read that she was a lesbian, which makes me wonder if that realization might have impacted this strong song, ""I can feel the tears run down my face and hear my voice so low; You wonder is it really mine; You question all the me's I've let you meet; and soon you'll know that's the one I never show.""  ""No Sad Songs"" also plays well for me with its lyric trying to be cheerful juxtaposed to a moody melody, ""I've said it before, but I was never so sure before.""  ""Someplace Else Now"" is essential listening for those who revere Lesley Gore's craft.  She is a Master Musician.  She will be missed.

"This Ace release of Lesley Gore's third album ""Girl Talk"" is well done.  I bought a vinyl copy that turned out to be in such sad shape it was not playable.  I heard enough to know that this was a release I wanted to add to my collection, some 50+ years later.  While I think I am turning into one of those audiophiles who prefer the warmer, more resonant sound of vinyl to digital, Ace does a very good job with bringing back this music to great form.  ""Hey Now,"" which was a single that didn't do well, sounds good to me with its girl group vocals and handclap percussion, ""I can't waste my time just waiting on the line when I can find another guy.""  ""Maybe I Know"" is another pop gem with horns punching the strong melody, ""Maybe I know that he's been cheating; Maybe I know that he's been untrue, but what can I do?""  One of the songs that has gotten stuck in my head is ""Wonder Boy"" with its great sing-along chorus, ""If you're so smart, how come you don't know I adore you?  If you're so smart, you ought to know I love you.""  From the extra tracks that were not on the original LP, the Jeff Barry/Ellie Greenwich song ""What's A Girl Supposed to Do?"" pops out of the speakers with its strong background vocals, a great delight!  I also really like the Mike Post song ""No Matter What You Do"" that opens with some punchy electric guitar and some beautiful percussion.  It's a shame that Gore passed away February 16, 2015; what a loss!  ""Girl Talk"" is essential Gore listening.

"Jeff Oster's ""Next"" is a delightful sonic splash that is cheer for the ear.  One great strength is the pristine engineering that makes his horn pop out of the speakers like he's playing right in your living room.  The title track is an exquisite opener with its lovely melody & Chuck Rainey's subtle but powerful bass giving pulse to the arrangement over which Oster's flugelhorn glides.  This little gem is definitely headed for my personal top ten!  The other star of the set for me, perhaps because it is so familiar and much loved as Bonnie Raitt's hit, is ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" where Oster counterpoints his horn to Philip Aaberg's piano.  Other tracks that stand out for me are the lovely ""Ibiza Sunrise"" that paints a gorgeous picture of the island off Spain's eastern coast.  ""Avenue D"" has a great urban sound with some tasty guitar by Todd Boston.  I kind of wish they'd let the drummer go crazy or mixed the drums more prominently since the beat is so attractive.  ""Heroes"" is another strong track like a soundtrack to triumphant quest with Jeff Taboloff's sax mixing well with Oster's flugelhorn.  One of the great things about ""Next"" is that its many moods take you so many different places, but the set has a great unity; the music fits together really well.  I admire Jeff's passion for his music and recommend this set for those who love instrumental music.

"Rod Taylor's self-titled album from 1972 has long been one of my very favorites, one I pull out regularly and spin.  When David Geffen started Asylum records in the early 1970's, he hand-picked the acts he wanted on his label with amazing taste.  While most know his more successful finds like Jackson Browne, the already-popular Joni Mitchell and the Eagles, there was a whole sub-tier of acts who put out quality music but didn't quite break such as Essra Mohawk, Judee Sill, David Blue and Karen Alexander.  Rod Taylor is one of these.  After the failure of this disc, Taylor morphed into Roderick Falconer and put out a series of glam-rock albums.  But this country-flavored set is exquisite.  So God bless the Japanese for this CD reissue, a first on CD as far as I know -- and I've been looking regularly and periodically for a long time.  Anyone who follows Japanese releases of American artists, knows that the Japanese do their best with the song lyrics, but frequently make mistakes.  For example, on the gorgeous second track, ""Crossroads of the World,"" the Japanese booklet quotes the lyrics, ""Dreaming had time might unfurl"" rather than ""Dreaming how time might unfurl.""  But while it's true that most audiophiles will prefer the vinyl over the CD because it has a deeper, more resonant sound, the CD which I played back to back with the vinyl is still a good technical reproduction.  Bonnie Bramlett wails on the background vocals on Crossroads, sheer delight.  ""Double Life"" is a classic track with Jim Horn's searing saxophone solo, ""I got a right side & I've got a wrong; This double living's going to tear me apart before too long, from living a double life, and I guess I know which one is me.""  ""Making A Way"" has a great background vocal by label-mate Joni Mitchell on the stately piano-based melody, ""There comes a time riding in the tide, when a man you'll have to choose; Remember then that this fisherman, he's got blood on his shoes.""  ""Livin' Dangerous Blues"" has such an explosive guitar juxtaposed to the feisty piano on this edgy track, ""And the lightning of a woman's heart that's what keeps me on the run.""  The Japanese are again creative with ""Arthur Mandias"" replacing Taylor's reference to the classic Shelley poem, ""Ozymandias was a king of kings, had a hundred women, armies and things; But he's dead and gone, no fire is on his lips; In the ruins we're going to waltz; so come on, give me a kiss.""  ""Lost Iron Man"" is such a pretty country ballad.  Rod Taylor's self-titled album is a great record.  Seek & you shall find!

"""Back to Birth"" is a strong release by Jackie Greene.  Somehow, he's got put into a niche as ""Americana,"" but his melodic songwriting shines through.  On this release, I can't find any songwriter credits, but I assume these are all Greene originals.  Coming off his great association with Joan Osborne in the band Trigger Hippy, it's nice to have some of his recent solo work.  The opener ""Silver Lining"" has a pretty midtempo melody with Jackie's vocals expressive and clear, ""Don't think that the life we're living is easy; We travel around; Our feet don't touch the ground.""  The second track, ""Now I Can See for Miles"" may be the best on the set with its catchy hook and Reinhardt Weis's drums punching through between guitar jabs, ""Like telescopes in search of hope, I was mystified by the way she spoke.""  ""Trust Somebody"" is also a stellar Greene classic with a touch of country swagger mixed with tangy blues and Jackie's piano building up to the addictive chorus, ""When you're out of your mind, broken & blind, look at yourself; Do you like what you see? If you want something else, you better trust somebody.""  ""Light Up Your Window"" & ""You Can't Have Bad Luck All the Time"" are also gems.

"Tobias Jesso Jr.'s debut CD ""Goon"" has some strong moments.  ""How Could You Babe"" has a catchy hook on this midtempo track's chorus that makes it spark with Tobias' vocals alternately hushed and soaring, ""When I found out you'd gone & met a new man, I felt so lonely that I cried; How could you baby?""  It's a great tear-in-your beer closer tailor-made for a last-call juke box.  ""Without You"" is also a lovely heartbreak ballad with Jesso's airy vocals and plodding piano drawing us into a new empty routine, ""I can hardly breathe without you; There is no future I want to see without you; I just don't know who I could be without you.""  While the CD suffers from a lack of variety of tempos and instrumentation, ""Hollywood,"" ""Crocodile Tears"" and ""Leaving Los Angeles"" are also strong.  This is a promising freshman set from this young singer-songwriter.

"""Romances Latinos"" by Rusty Crutcher is a delightful gem.  The opener, ""All or Nothing (Todo y Nada)"" is an incredible track that recalls the moment I heard Gato Barbieri's soundtrack for ""Last Tango In Paris,"" a set that opened up a whole new genre and culture of music for me.  Crutcher's tenor saxophone oozes emotion into each bar with a seductive cosmopolitan sound.  Mexican musician and composer Armando Manzanero wrote ""I Miss You"" with Crutcher's sax blasting with passion, flavored with lament.  It stops the show for me.  The rest of the set is solid with ""What A Difference A Day Made"" bringing to mind my favorite recording of the tune by Dinah Washington.  This music is at times gentle, bursting with melody and above all, fired by passion.  It's jaw-dropping good.

"After first listening, I was deeply impressed with Groban's song selection for ""Stages.""  Show music seems to fit him like a glass slipper.  ""Les Temps des Cathedrales"" from ""Notre Dame de Paris"" reflects some of Groban's early work with soaring vocals, orchestral arrangement, and foreign language lyrics sung impeccably; this one in French.  ""Old Devil Moon"" starts with Chris Botti's gorgeous trumpet bookending the piece.  ""Gold Can Turn to Sand"" is a lovely tune with Groban's vocals engaged and expressive on Grammy winner Tim Rice's lyric, ""From a well that was poison, he drank water; and he died where he fell, a beast to slaughter; As his eyes slowly faded, here's a watchband from his hand, Oh Kristina, gold can turn to sand.*""  Epic!  Other tracks like ""All I Ask of You,"" ""If I Loved You"" and ""Children Will Listen/Not While I'm Around"" are glorious.  This was a set that I had to listen to a number of times before I really warmed to it; so it is not one where I recommend a snap decision.  Let it grow on you.

"Wouter Kellerman's ""Love Language"" is a blockbuster disc of mostly instrumental music that bursts forth from the speakers, vibrant and alive.  ""Si Do Mhaimeo"" rocks joyfully with Wouter's flute-centered arrangement of this traditional Irish song on a par with much of Tim Weisberg's classic flute work.  ""To Tango (Tis Nefelis)"" written by Loreena McKennit & Greek singer Xaris Alexiou, sparkles with Kellerman's flute slinking up and down the scales like a snake and Taryn Louch's vocals exquisitely expressive.  ""Ek Verlang Na Jou"" has a lovely ambling beat on a tune that was a hit in South Africa when Wouter was a child and is delivered here beautifully with Anna Davel on vocals.  ""Zininzi,"" ""Notre Futur"" & ""Love Gets Old"" are also gems.  This is a delightful disc that I hope many will discover!

"Nancy Huston's ""Black Dance"" was a complete chore to read.  How I labored through this book!  On a return flight from St. Louis, the book fell out of my luggage with my boarding pass for the connecting flight.  I was much more concerned about the lost boarding pass than the lost book.  I did, however, BUY this sucker for a penny and finished the whole thing.  It does not get much better.  The writer seemed much more intent on showing what a wonderful writer she is rather than telling a story.  This is one of the most confusing novels I've ever read.  It changes locations from Ireland to Brazil to Quebec.  At one point a woman says, ""We will speak French in this family!""  I did a double-take because I thought they were in Ireland. I had to re-read the dust jacket to realize that they must have shifted to French-speaking Quebec.  It also shifts between the screenplay written about Milo's life to Milo's actual life, often making it impossible to figure out which is real.  In addition to those shifts, we move back and forth in time during the 20th Century.  Literally, this book is all over the map.  From there is the final realization that no one in the book is the protagonist in the sense that we feel any sympathy or bond with them.  Finally, what's with the title?  Is this a racial slur?  ""Capoeira"" is defined as ""a Brazilian dance of African origin...""  With all of the rape, drugs and brutality in the novel, it's hard to imagine ""Black Dance"" as anything at all positive.  This novel is a complete mess.

"I picked up a vinyl copy of Dee Dee Sharp's Cameo Records release from 1962, ""It's Mashed Potato Time.""  The liner notes tell the story of how Dee Dee was booked on a singer on a Chubby Checker record.  Chubby didn't want a girl singing on his record; so he gave her the cold shoulder when he entered the session.  Then when she started to sing, he went, ""Wow!""  After the session, the producer told Dee Dee to go home, eat and rest and come back to the studio that night because they were going to cut her first record, thus was ""Mashed Potato Time"" born.  The album is a great early rock record, rock and roll with no apology.  Bobby Darin's hit ""Splish Splash"" and Gene McDaniel's hit ""A Hundred Pounds of Clay"" are modified to include due homage to Chubby Checker.  Dee Dee is in great voice on ""Gee"" and ""Gravy.""

"""Men Against Mountains"" is my introduction to The Revivalists.  The set explodes with much the same force as Alabama Shakes' first CD, packing a wallop in the early tracks and remaining strong throughout the set.  The opener ""Keep Going"" has a pumping blue-eyed soul arrangement complete with horns and David Shaw's swagger on lead vocals, ""The less I know, the more I learn how much love means to me.""  Track 2 follows with the blockbuster ""Wish I Knew You"" with a pulsing beat enhanced by Michael Girardot's glittering keyboards, ""So Friday night, holy ghost take me to your level, show me the one I need the most.""  ""Monster"" has a lovely hook-filled melodic sheen that softens the darker lyrics about a guy who is a romantic predator, ""I'm sleeping with a snake tonight & nowadays what's wrong feels right; I was a bastard of the worse kind; I looked you in the eyes, still told you a lie.""  ""Stand Up"" totally rocks the room with its shout-sing chorus and David Shaw's virile vocals, ""I'm a tax-paying fool.""  ""Amber"" is another super-strong song.  ""Man Against Mountains"" is such a strong set that it'll send you scrambling to find copies of the band's earlier work.

"Shelby Lynne's ""I Can't Imagine"" is a very strong set in her growing canon of recordings.  The opener, ""Paper Van Gogh"" is a midtempo charmer with Dusty Springfield's influence loud and clear in the lingering notes and the slow-burn of passion in Shelby's vocals, ""Watercolor art, I play my feelings on my origami harp.""  ""Sold the Devil (Sunshine)"" also appeals to me with that smoky midtempo groove and Shelby's croon achingly powerful, ""We all on this plant, arm and arm as we touch, sister, brother, and our earth mother.""

"When I popped Jesse Malin's ""New York Before the War"" in the changer on a long drive home, it popped out of the speakers.  In the weeks since then, each time I spin the disc I have the same thought, ""This is REALLY GOOD!!!""  I've enjoyed Malin's solo releases.  For me, he pulls it all together on this CD.  On ""Addicted,"" Malin rocks with apparently unrelated images of wrongs spit out like bullets from a shotgun and then he smokes a classic line, ""I'm addicted to the glory of a broken heart.""  ""Turn Up the Mains"" thunders with arena-sized rock and Malin's incendiary lyrical twist blows up, ""The place is packed & the kids are jacked on those anti-social songs; You swing low like a like a halo & you're wishing you were never born.""  What is my favorite track at present, ""Freeway,"" starts with a throbbing guitar part like a pounding headache and the spends his lyrics like a fatal disease, ""And I sprayed my love with the vultures and the crows with a lust for glory and a poison rose.""  I also like ""Bent Up"" that slows the pace to midtempo and sounds like rocking music hall fare.  The slow weeper ""She Don't Love Me Now"" is a delightful tear-in-your-beer last-call tune that could blare out of a juke box at an all-night dive, ""I know we had so many nights down there in the village, dressed up like each other's dreams; we were kind of killers.""  ""New York Before the War"" is a gritty in-your-face rock record with Malin's intelligence and lyrical wit whipping the mix into a sheer delight!

"Buffy Sainte-Marie's new set is an utter delight!

"Rachel Seiffert's ""The Walk Home"" might have been re-titled ""The Very Very Long Walk Home.""  It two me almost two months to trudge through this book, although it's only 291 pages long.  It's one that I'm really glad I can put in the past.  In a year, I will have to reread my review here to have a recollection of the book.  What Seiffert does well is place her characters in the historical context of the Irish troubles.  The story takes place after the bombs have exploded, but much of the bitterness remains.  This doesn't lead to an action-packed story, but a character driven one.  Unfortunately, the characters are barely sympathetic.  Probably the best written character is Lindsay, who leaves Ireland and an abusive father and latches onto a Protestant Irish lad named Graham.  Unfortunately for the novel, she departs before the tale is concluded to who knows where.  We build the context with Lindsay's new mother-in-law Brenda, who is an industrious cleaning woman.  Graham's father Malky plays a minor part; and I never quite retained who Malky Jr. was.  Brenda's brother Eric draws incessantly, never happy with his work.  His rift with the family and his late father Robert was because he married a Catholic girl, Franny.  Onto this pile of characters comes Stevie, Lindsay's and Graham's child.  When Graham refuses to move into a nicer flat, Lindsay blows a gasket and the two inexplicably separate.  Graham likes to play drums in the Orangewalk, a Protestant politically charged band, which also serves to fracture the relationship.  Eric is off in his head with Bible stories; and everyone tries hard to help him after the death of his wife.  Seiffert even more complicates the reading experience by splitting it into past and present, as we see Stevie working as an older teen on construction sites in London with a group of Polish workers.  The plot is awkward and we never get inside Stevie's head, although he is the central character and his is the very very long walk home.  While I appreciated the Irish flavor, this is not a tale well told.

"I started watching this movie, turned it off after a few minutes, and then went back and finished it when I was in more of a mood to be depressed.  It is not a film I enjoyed.  For me, the problem with the film is the writing.  Rachel Weisz was nominated for a Golden Globe for playing Hester Collyer, and she is woefully depressed throughout the film, but inexplicably witless.  The problem for me is that you sit through the whole thing and the character never changes; there's no arc to the character.  She starts depressed and she ends depressed; and everything between is also depressing.  The performance that most touched me was Simon Russell Beale as the cuckold husband Sir William Collyer.  He is so pathetically in love with his young wife who understandably has no passion for the geezer that it breaks your heart to see him so unappreciated by his wife and makes one wonder why they ever married.  Ann Mitchell as the landlady also has a number of nice scenes.  Tom Hiddleston as Freddie Page has a sexy creepiness about him, not as pronouncedly weird as Loki in ""Thor,"" but still volatile.  He is the one source of energy in an otherwise bland sea of British blokes.  Samuel Barber who died in 1981 is credited with the music, which is cloying and over-the-top dramatic.  During the opening sequences, we have not yet connected with Hester's character, but yet the music lushly plays as if we're watching the suicide with any significance or attachment.  The choice of this score for the piece made an already difficult movie even sappier.  If they'd selected some boppy jazz from the era, it would have juxtaposed the lively music with the lifeless suicide.  Taking nothing away from the fine actress that Rachel Weisz is, this movie did not work for me.

"I enjoyed the DVD of ""Susie's Hope"" very much.  The film originally aired on UP TV cable.  I found the story to be very touching.  Donna Lawrence is played by Emmanuel Vaugier who has done many Lifetime movies.  Her husband Roy is played by Burgess Jenkins.  I felt compelled to review the film since so many of the reviews here speak to the issue of the movie, more than to the film itself.  The story sets up Donna as an animal lover who is expecting a child.  Her husband Roy is a good-looking construction company owner, who doesn't always understand where Donna is coming from, but clearly loves her to pieces.  I think it is this relationship which speaks to me so strongly and holds the film together.  Donna gets attacked when trying to help an abused dog and miscarries.  The intense sadness of a couple facing a childless future breaks your heart.  Andrea Powell from Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part 2 & Enders Game plays Donna's best friend Ramona.  No matter what happens to Donna, husband Roy seems to find a way to blame the neighbor, even for the event when Ramona for all practical purposes saves his wife's life.  We wish Roy's emotional clockworks weren't wound quite so tightly, but cheer when he realizes his error.  Willette Thompson plays the owner of the animal shelter and has a number of great compassionate scenes in the film.  Jon Provost who many will remember as a child actor as Timmy on the series ""Lassie"" does a nice job of being the politician on the side of Susie's cause.At this point I should disclose that I am an actor who appeared in the film as the Public Defender of the guy who hurt Susie.  I did buy my own copy of the DVD; so I am an actual customer; and I am also not receiving residuals from the film -- unfortunately!  For my own experience, it was the first time that I'd worked with a number of extras behind me, and proved a wonderful experience.  That said, I really enjoyed working with Cranston Johnson who plays Shawn Griffin, the bad guy.  He has a smoldering intensity which comes across well on screen, even though his is not a character that as an audience we like.  Dave Blamy who played the Lawrence's attorney Chris Parish does a very nice job in his part.  Director Jerry Rees was a joy to work with on set; and I think delivered an excellent film that not only highlights the important issue of animal abuse, but humanly touches us as we become part of the Lawrence's lives.  This is a film with which I'm proud to have been associated.  I hope dog lovers everywhere will get a chance to see it.

"""Darling Arithmetic"" is my introduction to the Villagers.  The set is folk-oriented low-fi.  The opening track ""Courage"" is my favorite with its sweet vocals by Irish singer Connor O'Brien and a lovely melody, ""I took a lover but then we parted; It took a little time to get over this; and from time to time I get heavy-hearted thinking of how we used to kiss.""  ""Hot Scary Summer"" builds melodically to the chorus that has O'Brien going high into his register, ""Remember kissing on the cobblestone in the heat of the night and all the pretty young homophobes looking out for a fight.""  The song fades with sounds of birds.  The rest of the CD is also strong and grows with repeated spins.  Songs like ""Soul Serene,"" ""Little Bigot"" & ""No One to Blame"" contain superb moments.  ""Darling Arithmetic"" is a strong set that makes me want to discover the band's earlier sets.

"""Diamantes"" was released by UK's Proper Records.  There is no date references on the liner notes for the tracks; but I did find information on Joan's website which describes this set:  Proper Records announced the general release of Diamantes in the European markets on March 9, 2015. Diamantes was originally created for Joan's tour of South America in 2014. This special CD combines Spanish language songs culled from the 1988 recording of Diamonds and Rust in the Bullring with some in concert favorites and two newly recorded versions of the Portuguese songs ""O'Cangaceiro"" and ""Ate Amanha/Te Ador.""Joan's voice is in fine form from these recordings.  On the two Portuguese recordings ""Ate Amanha/Te Ador"" that was recorded in Brazil and the live ""O Cangaceiro"" which seem to be the most newly recorded, her voice is in fine form.  The tracks are midtempo songs with simple percussion.  Mercedes Sosa's vocals compliment Joan's on the delightful ""Gracias a la Vida.""  Joan's rapport with the crowd on the closing track ""No Nos Moveran"" is a sheer delight.Of my two favorite English-language tracks, the Steve Earle cover from his ""I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive"" CD (2011) opens the set in live performance.  With Joan's masterful touch, it is a stately homage to belief, ""I believe in miracles, something sacred burning in every bush & tree; And we can all learn to sing the songs the angels sing.""  Her take on the classic Paul Simon penned Simon & Garfunkel classic ""The Boxer"" is delightful with the ironic twist of a woman singing the lyric, ""When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy.""  It's lovely.  ""Diamantes"" is a bit of a patchwork release from different timeframes in Joan's career, but achieves unity by her masterful performance.

"""Beside Still Waters"" grew on me.  The frenetic opening titles had me blinking with images that flashed on screen momentarily between credits.  The center of the film is Daniel played by Ryan Eggold who has wowed fans of TV's ""The Blacklist"" as Tom Keen.  Daniel is under stress with the death of his parents, which has resulted in foreclosure on their resort home.  He invites his close high school friends for one last remembrance weekend.  The scene where Daniel tearfully rebukes all of his friends who failed to support him at his parents' funeral is a very powerful scene.  Into the mix we get Brett Dalton who plays James, a reality TV star in an awful series, who has an affair with his long-time friend Tom, played by Beck Bennett. Beck broke out as an actor in the AT&T commercials where he sits deadpan and interviews groups of children.  James then refuses to acknowledge his sexual attraction to Tom.  There is a great shot as James denies the encounter to his friends while Tom sits stoically in the foreground until a huge tear runs down his face.  Mesmerizing!  Britt Lower plays Brittany, an old flame of Daniel's, who brings her fiancée Henry unannounced to the party, played by Reid Scott.  Erin Darke (Still Alice) plays a professional woman whose unemployed husband Martin played by Will Brill seems to drive her up the wall.  Jessy Hodges plays Charley, a somewhat emotionally unstable woman, who falls apart when she discovers James, who she has a crush on, making love to Tom.  There is some nudity in the film as everyone goes skinny-dipping.  This was the directing debut for Chris Lowell (actor in TV's Veronica Mars).  While the pacing seems a bit uneven in the first third of the film, it soon grips the viewer as we see deep emotions bubble to the surface among these old friends.

"I heard of Sharon Goldman in an email blast by Sloan Wainwright when the two shared a concert billing and decided to check out the artist's music.  Sharon's ""Sleepless Lullaby"" EP is an 8-track offering of mostly acoustic often country-flavored songs.  She's got a nice voice, very melodic.  All of the songs are lovely, but the vocals seem maybe a bit too clinically sung, too perfect, perhaps not quite letting the artist's personality fully inhabit the songs.  Of Sharon's original songs, ""Winter's Come Around Again,"" ""Letters,"" and the very sweet ""Weekend Afternoon"" resonate.  She sings songwriter Rich Dean's ""House of Stone"" which may be the most engaging track on the set.  Her cover of Simon & Garfunkel's ""A Hazy Shade of Winter"" slows the track to a piano backing, minus the distinctive percussion that made the original jab at the listener's ear.  It's beautiful; but I'm still getting used to it.  While the set doesn't grab you by the collar & demand listening, it is very pleasant and sweet.

"Matt the Electrician's ""It's A Beacon; It's A Bell"" is another melodic mostly-acoustic folk offering by Matthew Sever.  The title track is the catchiest with Matt's gentle vocals sweet and reassuring, ""Was exactly at the right time, all the angels telling me to pay attention; And all the numbers were standing in line, was the easiest of days.""  ""Arkansas"" is a lovely tune with Dana Falconberry on duet vocals.  ""The Family Grave"" has a happy catchy tune juxtaposed by a somber lyric about dying surrounded by family.  ""Pioneer Bride"" is a sweet acoustic tune with Matt's gentle vocals, ""It rained & rained all the clouds could contain; And the sound was thunder inside me; And I held my ground while the sky fell down.""  ""Under the Wire"" plucks and strums, delightfully offbeat, ""I'm a ridiculous American sitting in a Burger King on the side of the highway in another country; It is actually beautiful; It is actually Denmark; I am a reading a novel by Junichiro Tanizaki.""  Matt the Electrician flies under the radar screen for most, but always makes lovely, sweetly felt music.

"Beth Hart's ""Better Than Home"" is a strong CD.  It will gather criticism from some long-time fans for slowing the pace & simplifying the arrangements.  The most effective of these slower tracks is the lovely ""Tell 'Em to Hold On"" where Beth's vocals throb with emotion & sincerity, ""Everyone's looking for something to hold; some kind of savior; They need to be told to hold on.""  The title track is also a gem with a peppier midtempo melody, ""I have found the place where hunger meets the edge & now I'm facing God.""

"""The Longest Ride"" soundtrack CD has some delightful gems.  The opening track ""Wildfire"" by Seafret is a sweet midtempo rocker that sounds vaguely Celtic with the catchy chorus, ""We are bound to each other's hearts; called, torn and pulled apart.""*  It's a great addictive track.  Middle Brother's 2011 self-titled CD was a favorite of mine; and ""Blue Eyes"" from that CD shines on this set.  (Middle Brother is a ""super-group"" effort from singers from the bands Deer Tick, Delta Spirit & Dawes.)  ""Backwoods Company"" is the leadoff track from The Wild Feathers' 2013 self-titled CD.  It blasts out of the speakers with loud electric rock and such a great bass line, ""Lay me down by the old oak tree; Cut my hair when they bury me.""  ""Oh, Tonight"" by Josh Abbott Band featuring Kasey Musgraves comes from the band's 2010 CD ""She's Like Texas"" and rocks pure country, ""Oh, tonight we're gonna set the world on fire; & I'm gonna set aside my pride; Not gonna be the one to say goodbye.""  Sweet!  Black Pistol Fire's ""Show Pony"" is a blasting rocker that zaps you with its swagger, ""Getting kind of cozy with a loaded gun.""  Adan Jadorowsky's ""Dancing to the Radio"" is hook-filled with a catchy chorus.  Kodaline's 2012 CD ""In a Perfect World"" is the source for their gorgeous ""Love Like This.""  Other tracks like Pistol Annie's ""I Feel A Sin Comin' On"" & Ryan Adams' ""Desire"" make this a very strong soundtrack with no clinkers.

"Fred Eaglesmith's ""Tambourine"" is a great addition to this masterful singer's long catalog.  The opening track ""What It Takes"" delivers a strong vocal performance with Fred's voice urgent to the point of desperation plus a lovely melody and lyric, ""I'll face the wind; I'll fight the rain just to hold you in my arms again; I'll run against the sky until it breaks.""  ""Can't Dance"" has a retro feel with a bass line not too far off from ""Secret Agent Man"" and Fred's vocals celebrating the joy of performance, ""I love my electric guitar; I love when I play it way too loud.""  ""Nobody Gets Everything"" rocks to a midtempo beat with Scott Merritt's keyboards deliciously framing the melody, ""Nobody gets everything; and I guess I don't get you.""  ""Sally Green"" slowly burns about a guy in love with an unfaithful girl.  ""Tambourine"" is a strong set by one of Canada's best.

"""Lesser Oceans"" by Fences is a strong set on the classic Elektra Records label.  There are no weak tracks on the set, but there are a couple cuts with which I particularly connect after a half dozen spins.  ""Arrows"" pops out of the speakers with driving energy and an internal rap segment.  Listening in the car, I thought he was singing ""Dead Roses Are Falling"" instead of ""Arrows""; ""My old man, he kicked me out when I told him that I live this way; He doesn't own me; Just escape.""  The track sparkles.  ""Dusty Beds"" is another track that I really like with a midtempo beat and lyrics that seem mundane like signing a check on the refrigerator, but Chris Mansfield's vocals give life to the lyric, ""Roll over & touch me angel; Nothing ever happens on dusty beds.""  The opening track ""Songs About Angels"" and the title track are also incredibly strong.  While this is my introduction to this band, it's strong enough to make me want to check out their past work and to hear more.

"The Lone Bellow's first CD was excellent.  I think ""Then Came the Morning,"" their second, nudges it, and is even better.  There are more strong songs and the set doesn't ever drop out, even on the slower tracks.  The title track has an exquisite lyric and an inventive orchestral touch in the arrangement that gives the track depth.  The ""joy comes in the morning"" lyric mirrors Psalm 30 from the Bible, ""weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning,"" one of my favorite Bible quotes.  ""Marietta"" is another superb track with a midtempo beat and a plodding melody that marches through a range of emotions, ""The worry for what couldn't be, the love for the lust of your name, of losing, of winning, of striving, of leaving and stealing and breaking and shame.""  Its marriage of lyric and melody is exquisite.  ""Take My Love"" sounds quite radio-friendly with its hook on the chorus and the full background vocals, ""You're no broken record turning; you're a wild melody.""  ""If You Don't Love Me"" is another exceptional track with its pounding beat and lyric, ""Leave me or let me go.""  ""Cold As It Is"" addicts the listener with its catchy hook and the Zach Williams' vocals that trail off into the upper register, ""I wouldn't leave.""  There are so many great tracks on this disc that it is essential listening, one of the best of 2015.

"This is another amazing disc by Ace Records that highlights the songwriting of Carole King and Gerry Goffin.  The engineering & sound reproduction make this set sound fresh.  The Righteous Brothers' title track is an epic recording arranged by Jack Nitzsche and produced by Phil Spector with his ""wall of sound"" trademark. Bill Medley's deep voice throbs, ""Though I'm not free to fall in love with you, oh baby, why did I have to get so hung on you?""  The Clovers' ""The Sheik"" has a vaguely Middle Eastern flavor, but is a lot of fun with the tabla percussion and the sassy sax, ""If you got a date, you better not be late; If you make your baby wait, you'll find that the sheik is straight.""  Henry Alston's ""So Many Lonely People"" is an exquisite record that has a Drifters' sound and Alston's tenor voice soulful and expressive, ""But baby don't you see we don't have to share their company, we've got this chance to make our love last.""  This set has great liner notes and many of the tracks wear well half a century later.

"Glen Phillips' ""Coyote Sessions"" looks like a very indie release in appearance from this fine artist, kind of ""Glen Phillips Unplugged.""  There are no lyrics, no record label mentioned, no copyright date, no songwriting credits, just the 10 song titles listed.  ""Everything Matters"" is a classic Phillips track with him attacking the rhythm guitar with a vibrant strum on the lovely track, ""Every word is a seed that you scatter.""  This is the first time that I'm aware that Glen has recorded ""No Blue Sky,"" although it appeared on The Thorns' self-titled 2003 CD.  I love the chorus where Glen's voice rises into the upper register on the chorus, ""If you want me, you know where I will be; I don't get out much anymore.""  Glen turns in a fine rendition of Paul Simon's lovely ""American Tune"" that appeared on Simon's ""There Goes Rhymin' Simon"" 1973 album.  ""Green Zoller"" was on Glen's ""Live @ Largo"" 2003 set, but everything else here is new, as far as I can tell.  ""The Song Is Still Here"" is an addictive Phillips' hook-filled melody with a strong lyric, ""He didn't want to be no one-hit wonder; Lightning strikes quick, you can hear the thunder for miles and miles, it echoes across the East, The fire is gone, but the spark is still here.""  ""The Coyote Sessions"" is a welcome addition to Phillips' music.  He's grown into one of my very favorite artists for whom I race to get each release.  This does not disappoint.

It's a beautiful love song.  ""Even when the rain pours down, even when the light seems like it's fading, even when your heart aches, feels like it's gonna break, that's when you sing out loud,"" Drew sings on ""Shine Like Lightning,"" a midtempo rocker with a with a great bass guitar underpinning the verse until the song explodes on the chorus.  ""I've Got You"" has a whistling chorus that makes it sound like a hiking song to me, ""I've got a dream over my shoulder; I've got love tied around my waist; I've got a big imagination; I've got the world & I've got you.""  While these are my favorites on the set, there are no weak tracks.  This is a very strong set that makes me want to hear more from this band.

"Nick Nolan's ""Wide Asleep"" is an interesting book with several different threads.  Crime, romance, and the paranormal intertwine.  Arthur Blauefee and Jeremy Tyler's romance reignites after a four-year hiatus.  This rescues Jeremy from a self-destructive spiral of drugs, alcohol and casual sex.  Jeremy's financial state is at a low point as his former lover Lazzaro has set him up to assume a huge debt on a house.  Arthur also is struggling with a health crisis.  Jeremy begins past life regression with Dr. Studski that puts him in touch with his former self from Greece and the Civil War.  Jeremy also seems to have hallucinations that may be paranormal.  Nolan brings up the subject of reincarnation, which you must buy to take the plot seriously.  He goes a bit overboard with having people not only have past lives, but having them look like they do in the present life.  So if you want to get a good picture of Jeremy Tyler, search for Antinous, his Greek counterpart.  The secondary characters are bit thin for me.  Carmella seems like such an evil woman that it doesn't quite work when we find there are layers to her persona.  Carlos is so very sweet.  But if you buy the reincarnation aspect, then these blemishes may be overlooked too.  I did really like the dogs.  The conclusion crashes together like a Perry Mason plot with the surprise conclusion.  Mostly, I did like the book.  Jeremy and Arthur seemed like people who really cared about each other, which was sweet.

"Mary Lambert's 1st full-length set sparkles.  Where there are some flags to wave whose causes may endear the disc to some such as lesbian issues and heavyset body images, ultimately it is the music and Mary's passionate singing that sell this.  ""Secrets"" opens the disc with a rap-like laundry list of self-examined issues and blooms into a chorus of carefree bliss, ""So-oh-oh-oh what?""  Mary's cover of the Rick Springfield hit ""Jessie's Girl"" grabs your attention as she takes the rocker and transforms it into a piano ballad, ""Where can I find a woman like that?""  ""Monochromatic"" is a powerful ballad that starts simply and then adds instruments to make it an aching anthem, ""My heart's too big for this city; My heart's too big for my own body; My heart's too big for you to understand me.""

""18"" is catchy with about every obstacle to young love referenced, ""She told me to meet her there, but I can't afford bus fare.""  ""Long Way Home"" has a melody that sets it apart, ""We're hiding out in a dream; Catching fire like kerosene.""  The set closer ""Amnesia"" appeals to me with some acoustic guitar and a brokenhearted melody, ""I remember the day you told me you were leaving; I remember the makeup running down your face.""

"Melissa Manchester's new set is a strong return to form for this talented singer.  Besides looking ageless in the great cover photography, she's lost none of her steam or talent since her stunning 2004 set ""When I Look Down That Road.""

Keb' Mo' joins Melissa on guitar on the delightful blues-tinged ""Feelin' for You"" that slinks and smokes with desire, ""You got your mojo workin', dancing your crazy voodoo; Quick, take this kiss off my lips.""  ""Open My Heart to Your Love"" is another track that resonates with me with its lovely melody and upbeat lyric with Stephan Oberhoff's accordion giving a New Orleans flavor to the arrangement.

"Imaginary Friend is a duo composed of Neal Leatherman and Jeff Carroll.  This independent release from 2007 brims over with retro charm.  The two-disc set is composed of the music on the first disc and then a second disc with the guys listening to the music in the background and commenting on the songs.  ""Her"" is one of my favorites with its prominent guitar line and retro harmonies that ironically the lads disparage on the commentary portion, ""One night it's a blur; And your speech is slurred; You've been out drinking, thinking that you're sinking without her.""  ""(Not Your) #6"" is a direct homage to the 60s hit ""Secret Agent Man"" by Johnny Rivers and serves up retro-ambrosia.  ""Cut of Attention"" is a decidedly retro with snarling drone vocals juxtaposed to the guitar line, ""She pours like the moonlight falling on the shore; And she roars like a fire churning at its core; She pours like red wine staining the floor.""  ""Drug Perfect"" unleashes some searing electric guitar with Imaginary harmonies.  ""Mangos & Peaches"" has tight harmonies that are oh-so-60s except for an F bomb casually dropped in the lyric.  Imaginary Friend's CD was recorded independently in a basement over years.  It is a labor of love that sparkles for all lovers of 60s music.

""Shut Up & Dance"" is one of the most addictive tracks playing on the radio, ""A backless dress & some beat-up sneaks, my discotheque Juliet, teenage dream.""  ""Up 2 U"" pumps vibrantly until synthesizer explodes with keyboards, ""It's hard enough just making money; It's hard enough just trying to feel alive.""

"Casey Neill & the Norway Rats' ""All You Pretty Vandals"" is another excellent chapter in Casey's excellent recorded work.  Recorded in Portland, Oregon, the disc offers a number of great gems.  The opening track ""Hollow Bones"" is a slow ballad with Casey's restless spirit bubbling over in the vocals, ""If I had feathered wings; If I had hollow bones; I'd span these lonely seas; and I'd make you my home.""  It's a beautiful song.  The title track pumps up the volume with a polka-rock beat and Casey's caustic vocals dripping with disdain, ""Have you come to wreck the place and leave?""  ""She Came Alive"" gets its drive with excellent drums by John Moen and a musical rave-up at which Neill excels, ""Came alive in a blinding flash; came alive in a culture clash.""  ""No Earthly Pleasure"" is another favorite with its pumping beat and Casey's vocals as foil to his electric guitar seemingly at cross-purposes as his voice soothes and the guitar jabs like a poke in the chest, ""I swam in the wells of sadness; Locked myself in the halls of madness; Travelled to the distant mountains and across the Bridge of Sighs.""

"Dulcie Taylor's new set ""Only Worn One Time"" offers some delights.  The opening track ""On A Rainy Day"" is a ballad with a touch of blues and Dulcie's vocals sad and aching, ""Let the tears of heaven hide my pain away; I wait to cry on a rainy day.""  ""Take A Chance"" has a catchy melody set to a midtempo beat,  ""Remember when you were little & somebody begged you to do something that scared you?""  Many of the other tracks also shine.  Less to my liking are the four tracks where Dulcie lets male vocals predominate and moves to the background.  Quite simply, they're not as good singers as she.  That aside, there's enough here to more than recommend this set.

"Emily Dieffenbach's EP is a strong country set from this young artist.  I read a description of this set that described this as ""a mix of pop and blues originals.""  Make no mistake, while she certainly writes and sings her own material, this disc was recorded in Nashville and has mainstream country written all over it.  Each of the five tracks is strong.  My favorite track is the catchy midtempo ""It's You"" with Emily's vocals achingly passionate, ""It's not you, it's me; How good can those words really be when they're not true? Yeah, it's not me; it's you.""  The set closer ""Wipe Your Own Tears"" rocks out with the bite of breakup, ""Are you satisfied with your life the way it is now?  Did all those happy years disappear cause you didn't feel like having me around?""  The other tracks like the melodic opener ""Kiss Me,"" the very lovely ""Drive,"" and the title track are all strong.  This is an excellent intro set by the developing artist who is super strong as both singer and songwriter.

"I just finished reading this book. . . and I was all ready to give it 5-stars. . . . until I got to the end. . . . and that’s when it all came crashing down.From the beginning, the story rolls along well.  It keeps you turning the pages to see what’s going to happen next.  I like the different characters.  It’s a very fun read.But I didn’t really like the ending.  Actually, it doesn’t “end”.  It just “stops”.  I hadn’t noticed, before reading, that this was going to be a “series”.  I don’t know how many books are going to be written in the series.  But unlike some other books of a series which tie everything up neatly at the end . .  . but leaves you knowing that there’s going another book to follow. . . . This one really feels like you got to the end of the chapter. . . and you should turn the page and the next chapter should be right there and follow.  But it doesn’t.  There are just blank pages.  I don’t know how long it will be until the next book is out. Again, I don’t know how many books will be in the series.  But because of the way that this one ended. . . . And assuming that the next book will pick-up right where this one leaves off. . . . I’d rather wait until they are all out and just read them in order one-after-the-other.In upcoming books I would hope and assume two things would happen:#1.  Find out more about Yude.#2.  Incorporate Cheng and Ramona into the “adventure”.Finally. . . I know that there are names which are “gender neutral”.  .. but. . . . “Pam” is not one of them. I have NO Idea why the author chose “Pam” to be the name of a male character.  Perhaps there is a reason for that, and it will come out in future books.

"First. . . I might be the only person in the world who has never seen a “clasp mechanism” like this. . . but it’s “odd” and not in a good way.  There are no instructions on how to open / close it.  You either have to really pull on the “buckle” part. . . or. .  I would recommend you use something to press underneath on the two center squares to pop it out from there.  If you pull too hard on the top, it could easily break.  The “buckle” itself, which has the “rod” which goes into one of the holes on the band. . . Hold it with the “LP” facing you.  Then pull-up on the top to pop it open so that you can thread the band through. .  find the hole that works for you. . insert the rod. . . and press down on the top to close it.

On top of this, I don’t know the “right” way to open it, once you have it on.  The way that I’ve been doing it is to pull-up on the band, which will “pop” the clasp open so you can take it off.  The only way I would ever use this watch on a regular basis would be to remove the current clasp. . . and put a “regular” buckle on the end.  The leather band is really not bad. . . It’s just the clasp which I really do not care for.  Instead of having a video which simply shows the watch. . . They should have a video which shows how to open-and-close the clasp.  If you too are not fond of the clasp, then I’m almost certain that a jeweler can remove the current clasp and put a standard type buckle on it.The watch itself is pretty.  In the picture on the listing the rose gold tone case looks like it has a matte finish. . . it doesn’t. . . It’s glossy.  The hands are fairly easy to read.  It’s a nice size and the white leather band works well.  If it had a standard clasp, I would give it four stars . . . but as it is, I can only give it three.The “list prices” are just crazy.  These are cheap watches Made in China.  They certainly are on the “low-end” of watches.  Another thing they do that I don’t care for. . . They put paper instructions on how to set the watch inside. . . but for several different types of watches.  It’s a piece of paper.  They could easily just print what you need for this watch, but they want to save themselves time / money by printing instructions for multiple watches and letting you “find” yours.  Again, instruction for opening the clasp are not given, and should have been.Finally. . . It’s the box which impresses me most.  The box looks like it costs almost as much as the watch!","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25B8WV2APU4GG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXJBWM#wasThisHelpful","R25B8WV2APU4GG","AVU1ILDDYW301","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU1ILDDYW301?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Please Note: You’ll need two AA batteries each for the tall “pillar” candles.  So six total.  The smaller candles already have batteries, but the larger “pillar” candles do not.If you’re not familiar with “flameless” candles, this is a very nice assortment.  The lights inside “flicker” to give them a more realistic look.  When they are off, they are off-white in color.  When they are illuminated, they are “golden” just like it shows in the picture.One thing that the pictures do not show is that in the top of the pillar and votive candles is a black “wick” to make it look more realistic, especially then they are not illuminated.  Of course when you have them on, and they are glowing, the wick is obviously not burning.One thing I’m not hugely fond of, but it’s not a “deal breaker” by any means is the fact that the light that glows in the pillar candles is somehow “hanging” inside.  You can see the shadow and hear it rattle if you shake the candle.  But it’s not centered, so there is a “bright spot” on one side of the candle.  Depending upon your preference, and also where you’re using them, you may want to turn it to the front.. or the back. . .The “pillars” have kind of a cool timer.  The way it works is. . . . At the time you want the candle to turn-on each day you press the switch on the bottom over to “timer”. The candle will be on for 5-hours, and then turn-off.  It will continue to turn-on at the same time each day for 5-hours.  You can reset it simply by turning the candle off and the switching it over to “timer” at the exact new time you want it to turn-on each day.Because they are wax, the pillar and votive candles are certainly “realistic”.  But also, because they are was, you will want to be careful and not put them next to something hot, like a fireplace.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V9083UXXSUY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EV8YOK#wasThisHelpful","R2V9083UXXSUY2","AVU1ILDDYW301","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVU1ILDDYW301?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This biography tells the story of Billy Fiske, and to a lesser extent, three other bobsledding pioneers (Jay O'Brien, Clifford ""Tippy"" Gray, and Eddie Eagan) who made up the team that won the gold medal at the 1932 Winter Olympics held in Lake Placid despite initially being the underdog.The stories go into how the four of them met one another during the 1920's and 1930's; their individual backgrounds; how they overcame the odds placed against them at the Olympics; and what happened to them after their Olympics win, especially during and after the World War II years.At age 16, Billy Fiske won his first bobsledding gold at the 1928 Winter Olympics despite having had no previous experience or training at bobsledding, just like the much older Jay O'Brien and Tippy Gray, who were two of his team mates at the event. Not many people knew that Billy was only 16 at the time because he showed a lot of maturity and leadership qualities that made him a lot of friends.At the problem-ridden 1932 Winter Olympics, Jay O'Brien butted heads with the games organizer, Godfrey Dewey, whose selfish agenda would have proved detrimental to the eventual champions had he prevailed.  Which was why Billy Fiske and team felt vindicated when they did win against all odds.The 1936 Winter Olympics was held in Germany.  Despite Germany's anti-Jew policies, the then American Olympics Committee did not support boycotting the games.  Even though Billy was initially invited to participate, he ended up not being a part of the games for various reasons covered in the book.Then came World War II.  Despite being an American, Billy volunteered to join England's Royal Air Force to specifically serve with the 601 Squadron at a time when the United States was still a neutral country.  The book goes over Billy's reasons for doing this and recounts his heroism.Overall, I thought this book is well researched and written.  It actually covers more than just the risks and thrills and technicalities of the bobsledding sports to bring to light the humanity -- the best and the lesser aspects of it -- of the various people whose paths crossed during the decades covered in this book. While Billy Fiske's courage and heroism are this book's central focus, the story of Eddie Eagan is quite interesting as well.  The only aspect of the book that I did not enjoy as much was the sometimes extended excursions into the Olympians' Hollywood adventures and connections.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NGHMTV530MOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409091#wasThisHelpful","R2NGHMTV530MOI","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the study of evolution, the concepts of competition and ""survival of the fittest"" have been front and center. Recently, however, proponents of an endosymbiotic theory of evolution have been calling attention to the importance and/or pervasiveness of symbiotic or more cooperative processes in evolution.In this book, Dr. Graffin delves into the presence of such symbiotic processes and the evidence for them from various microscopic as well as more macroscopic investigations of interacting organisms.  He then discusses the implications of these findings and possible takeaways for systems-level thinking about how we should behave towards one another and towards the environment if our goal is for humans to survive for as long as possible.The discussions employ several technical terms and concepts utilized by biological and evolution scientists, but they are explained reasonably well for a lay audience.  There were times, however, when I wished the discussions could have moved along more quickly by perhaps leaving out some of the less pertinent minutiae.The overwhelming message that I got from this book is that our evolution is not and should not be driven by the competition imperative -- an abstraction that, according to Dr. Graffin, has been used to justify untrue beliefs and unkind acts against society's less fortunates, etc. There's plenty of scientific evidence for the symbiosis imperative as well.  In fact, symbiosis may be more key to human survival than competition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141S1FEFGADL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250017629#wasThisHelpful","R141S1FEFGADL3","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"According to the author, many people with stress-related health problems are reluctant to seek help because of pride or shame.  In explaining how stress affects us psychologically and physiologically in terms that are understandable to a lay person, he seeks to destigmatize stress-related health problems, stating at the end of the book: 'Ultimately, psychological problems reflect ""a flaw in brain circuitry and not a flaw in character."" p. 268'The broad range of topics covered includes several rudimentary chapters on stress-related health problems and what are currently known about their underlying biochemical processes.  The book ends with discussions of available approaches to stress reduction, including relaxation training, psychotherapy, and drug treatments.The depth of the discussions is appropriate for a lay audience.

"This book is organized into three parts. Part One looks into the vulnerability of our power grids to a catastrophic cyberattack.  While a few in the power industry still think our power grids are resilient and well protected, a majority of the experts interviewed by the author concede that someone who has the right skills and knowledge can indeed cause damage to our power grids such that multiple states and their millions of residents can be simultaneously knocked off from the grid for a very long time (a year or longer is possible, depending on, say, how quickly replacements for damaged grid components can be manufactured, etc.).Part Two poses the following question (my wording, not the author's): What has our government been doing to deal with this possibility of a catastrophic cyberattack on our power grids? Unfortunately, the answer seems to be ""Not enough.""  To be fair, some in the government do know what some of the challenges are, but to date, there is no known coherent ""big picture"" plan.Part Three examines the efforts of some communities at becoming self-reliant when it comes to disaster preparedness, the limits of such efforts, and possible takeaways for our government and the rest of the nation.  The Mormon community's organizational capability is described in good detail, and there is passing mention of other religious organizations having a similar capability but no additional detail.Overall, this book is well written and does a good job describing the nature of the problems we have and why we need to push our government to do more sooner.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HZ2OCM63YTKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055341996X#wasThisHelpful","R1HZ2OCM63YTKZ","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This well-written book discusses the different ways in which our country's moneyed elite have been able -- and continue -- to ""rig"" the system to their advantage; the damaging effects of these ""riggings"" on competition and innovation, consumers, and ordinary wage earners; why a shrinking middle class is not good for anyone, including the moneyed elite; what reforms are needed to counter the ever growing economic and political powers of the moneyed elite; and why such reforms can only have a chance to come to fruition if enough of the disadvantaged unite to make their outcry heard.The proposed reforms themselves are reasonably sounding and well-considered.  They include new ideas from both conservative and liberal thought leaders, and also ideas that have been implemented and seem to be working quite well in countries such as France and Australia.  One proposal that, in my opinion, requires a lot more thinking is the idea ""to provide all Americans, beginning the month they turn eighteen and continuing each month thereafter, a basic minimum income that enables them to be economically independent and self-sufficient. (p. 218)""Overall, I thought this book is very readable, and explains vety well the kinds of problems we're wrestling against.

"As recounted in this book, President Johnson's nomination of Thurgood Marshall to the Supreme Court was a surprise to the Senate's Judiciary Committee.  There had really been no vacancy in the Supreme Court, but because President Johnson was intent on getting an African American seated in the Supreme Court in 1967, he engineered a couple of clever behind-the-scenes dance steps to induce such a vacancy.  When the vacancy materialized, Johnson moved swiftly to nominate the then Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall to fill the vacancy.Senior and conservative members of the Senate's Judiciary Committee, many of whom were from the then very racist South, were displeased with, and vowed to defeat, the nomination.  This book recounts the drama that unfolded during the prolonged hearings, cutting away every now and then to harrowing tales of past lynchings of African Americans, as well as current racial riots occurring in different parts of the country outside of the Senate hearing room, to put into context what were at stake with the nomination fight.The author also provides just enough biographical information about each of the major players in the nomination fight to help readers understand how the life experiences of those individuals affected them, and whether they were able to rise above or shape those experiences into something constructive.Some of the side commentaries pertaining to actions ascribed to Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and John F Kennedy that African Americans have historically viewed as having impacted their civil rights negatively may also be of interest to some readers.Overall, I thought this book is well written and researched.  It's not as interesting to me as a detailed biography of Thurgood Marshall would have been, but it's informative enough to help me appreciate why the man was held in such high regard by many.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3YURFZF8QMQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307957195#wasThisHelpful","R3YURFZF8QMQC","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Neo-Nazi skinhead that lawyer Daniel Duckelman reluctantly agreed to represent was a 20-something high-school dropout.  This film explores the reasons why Duckelman decided not only to stay on as the skinhead's court-appointed lawyer but also actually poured a lot of time and energy into helping him, despite protestations from his wife and brother. The writing and acting are both powerful, but I didn't like that part of the ending involving the TV interview of the skinhead several months after the conclusion of the court trial.

"One of the things that I think sets this well-crafted sci-fi thriller apart from the herd is the relatively successful integration of a wide range of behavioral, political, physical, and genetic science-related topics or discussions into the novel.  These ""science-y"" discussions are not difficult for lay readers to follow, but they do tend to slow things down a little bit sometimes.  The notes after the end of the novel provide information regarding what is fact and fiction in those ""science-y"" discussions.The major characters are all interesting and fleshed out reasonably well, with the possible exception of the main villain, who tended to be somewhat one-dimensional.The well-crafted plot is the best thing about this novel. Its effectiveness (sorry I have to be vague here so as not to risk revealing any spoiler) makes up for the thriller's relative dearth of action scenes, and it does completely resolve the questions and doubts that were accumulating in my mind while following the sometimes twisty plot developments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RII9W56NME1ZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0692282343#wasThisHelpful","RII9W56NME1ZY","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This apocalyptic tale has a literary, even theatrical, feel to it. If it were staged as a play, members of the ""chorus"" would have pithy lines to deliver.The story, however, is nothing special. All of the characters are ""lost"" in some ways, and most of them have a dark side. When things start unraveling, the crazies predictably become unhinged. Yes, the way they become unhinged is ""staged"" dramatically, but it also felt contrived (e.g., the abandoned opera house scene).We get to know the characters largely through their silent musings or passively told back stories, so the characters often have a ""remote"" quality to them. The plot does not unfold in a strictly linear fashion; at inflection points where a new character needs to first be introduced or a returning character resurfaces, the clock is briefly turned back to give readers pertinent background information about the new or returning character(s) so readers can get all caught up with them before the storytelling thread picks up where things were previously left off.Overall, the story did not live up to its initial build-up, straying instead into a different direction, which while still unsettling, was nowhere near the spectacular ending ""promised.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B5XNEKB310VQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594634238#wasThisHelpful","R3B5XNEKB310VQ","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

In that essay, the professor revisits the events that led to the last Eurozone financial crisis, and his views on why the incrementalist approach to managing the crisis has been inadequate, and what Eurozone politicians and citizens must find the courage to do in order to make the monetary union work on a more sustainable basis.Professor Habermas' views on why the EuroZone countries need to move towards full political union are not very different from those already expressed by others, so readers who are already familiar with the arguments for or against such full political union won't find anything new in the essays included in this collection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X1T6WHCXWX7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745686826#wasThisHelpful","R1X1T6WHCXWX7U","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're traveling to the Mediterranean on a cruise ship, you may find the logistics information in this guide on how to get from a port of call to attractions within a coastal city handy.The guide provides good but not in-depth information on several of the more popular coastal cities, beginning with Spain's Barcelona, Malaga & Granada, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands; the French Riviera and Provence Region's Marseille and Provence, Cannes and St-Tropez, Nice, and the city-state of Monaco; Italy's Genoa, Florence, Pisa, Rome, Naples, Capri, Sicily, Malta, Puglia, and Venice; Croatia's  Split and Dubrovnik; Greece's Athens; and Turkey's Istanbul.For each region and / or city, you'll get capsule information of the place's history, culture, and anything noteworthy about the cuisine or attractions, in addition to the usual color-coded maps, pictures of select attractions, and information on lodging and restaurants.Both the general (e.g., dress codes are more conservative the farther south you go and in most rural areas, and especially in Turkey; few public buildings have restrooms, pp. 272-273) and insider (e.g., what attractions may require advance ticket purchases; Granada is one of the best cities in Spain for free tapas, etc.) tips are very helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B830JEYFGDDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426214634#wasThisHelpful","R1B830JEYFGDDR","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Caswell is an assassin sent over to a planet that his handler has dubbed ""Duplo"" because of its similarities to Earth in terms of physical characteristics and use of ""English"" as a generally spoken language. Traveling in a spaceship with pre-programmed destination and return routes, Caswell only knows what his handler thinks he needs to know to carry out his super-secret mission: who the target is and a general statement of what the stakes and potential challenges are.Like the advanced spaceship that's transporting him to ""Duplo"" through a little known ""wormhole,"" Caswell's body has also been enhanced with a few highly sophisticated technological devices -- implants that could temporarily increase his hearing and fighting capabilities, and also make him forget anything connected to a recently concluded mission, including anything unpleasant that may have transpired, such as the number of people he may have had to kill.In a first encounter with his target, Caswell also meets a native ""Duplo"" woman named Melni, who's actually a spy who's been tracking Caswell's target for about two years.  These two central characters will learn different things about each other that will make them wary of but also concerned for the other.  The knowledge they acquire about interesting similarities and differences between Earth and ""Duplo"" not only helps drive the pretty good world building that unfolds in this novel, but also introduces a major twist to the plot when they discover that many of those similarities and differences were not coincidental.The novel is reasonably fast-paced and packed with plenty of gory action scenes, a few of which may be needlessly over the top in terms of the degree of spectacularness or violence. Character development is focused mainly on the two central characters. And finally, there are a few surprises that propel the plot in new directions that may not please some readers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7GLCHP6IUV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391267#wasThisHelpful","RZ7GLCHP6IUV4","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The silicone kitchen utensils that I received included the following four items:  a ""classic"" spoon, a slotted spoon, a slotted turner, and a spaghetti spoon. All of them have a sturdy metal core but the exterior is all silicone that is heat-resistant up to 480 degrees fahrenheit.  The ""classic"" and  slotted spoons are bendable, which can come in handy when you need to scoop things up from a corner. The spaghetti spoon works really well.  My favorite is the slotted turner, which I find to be a lot sturdier than the one I've been using; it is the firmest and least bendable of the four utensils in this set, which is as it should be.The tools are a bit smaller than similar tools I have and my preference, but they are all very good quality.

"This book tells the story of how the CIA's Moscow Station got off to a rocky start and for many years did not even dare recruit any Soviet citizen living in Moscow to spy for it because of the extreme danger involved for both the recruit and the agency with the city under heavy surveillance by the KGB whose headquarters was only a few miles away.That was why when Muscovite Adolf Tolkachev first started making overtures to the Americans, intimating he had military secrets to share, the latter did not ""bite"" immediately because the overture could have been a trap.  After Tolkachev provided details about himself and what secret information he had access to, however, the CIA changed its stance and made a calculated risk to get engaged, and, boy, were they glad they did.The information that Tolkachev was able to provide to the CIA over several years of espionage -- from 1979 through 1985 --represented a windfall to the CIA's military clients who thought the information was easily worth over a billion of research and development dollars that did not have to be spent.  What was really amazing about this feat was that secrets were being pilfered and Tolkachev was having face to face meetings and exchanging notes and packages with his CIA handlers right where KGB surveillance was supposed to be really tight, and the lack of detection could have continued had the unanticipated events detailed in the book not occurred.The book delves into Tolkachev's self-proclaimed motivation for volunteering to be a spy for the CIA and the attributes that won him the respect of his CIA handlers.  There are detailed accounts of the challenges Tolkachev and his CIA handlers had to overcome, and the changing nature of spycraft during the Cold War years. The book is well written and documented, and reads like a good spy thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TP264210OMPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385537603#wasThisHelpful","R1TP264210OMPK","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All of us have stories to tell, some more interesting than others, and there's also an art to effective storytelling.  In this book on how to produce engaging narrative radiocasts, the creative minds behind seven popular narrative radio shows share their views on how to sift through story ideas, pick ones with interesting possibilities, gather the bits for developing a story, arrange and re-arrange those bits into a desired structure, chisel away most of those bits to retain only the most compelling ones, and add narrative bridges or overlays such as sounds or music to enhance the emotional tone of a radiocast in appropriate places.The information is presented in a comic book format which has advantages (e.g., very suitable for visually depicting some aspects of the creative process such as multiple people providing feedback or editing advice to a writer concurrently) and disadvantages (e.g., a storyboard panel can get crowded with not-so-easy-to-read small texts).

"One way to describe this thrilling, mystery-laden fantasy novel is to characterize it as an action-packed tale of aristocratic lunacies that manages to lightly touch upon serious topics such as the unjustness of women's lower standing relative to men's in a patriarchal society, the cruel treatment of the poor by the rich, and the tensions between scientific and faith-based reasoning, while still keeping it a relatively fun read for young adults.The novel's setting is an alternate 19th-century Ireland where the existence of non-procreating machine-animal breeds known as ""engimals"" are the subject of intense curiosity as mysterious examples of life forms that Darwin's newly expounded theory of evolution cannot account for. Somehow, these ""engimals"" have some sort of linkage to the Wildensterns whose ancestry goes several centuries back.Gifted with an ability to live very long lives and a physiology that helps them heal quickly, the Wildensterns are obscenely wealthy and powerful, owning properties and businesses in Ireland, Britain, and America.  Edgar, the current patriarch, has three sons designated to succeed him in the following order: Marcus, Roberto, and Nate.  As part of their upbringing, Edgar's heirs have all been taught, before the age of 16, the art of assassination and how to live by the eight ""Rules of Ascension"" which, aiming to encourage ambition and aggression, two qualities thought critical to the bloodline's continued success, make it perfectly honorable for an heir, 16 years or older, to murder a higher-ranking heir for the sole purpose of advancing one's own ranking.The kind of lunacy this can lead to should be predictable.  In fact, shortly after the novel's opening, readers learn that Marcus has been found dead.  Many suspect that Edgar's youngest son, Nate, having the most to gain from his eldest brother's death, may have assassinated Marcus. Just to make things even more mysterious, when centuries old Wildenstern ancestors suddenly rise from the dead, everyone is suddenly asking: Should Edgar welcome these resurrected ancestors back into the fold, and for what reasons?The tale initially develops at a leisurely pace in the first half of the novel, but the pace picks up significantly after that, with quite a few interesting twists and turns.  The main characters are well-drawn and memorable, and some of the dialogs are witty.  There is some violence, a bit of religious talk, and a brief scene involving a homosexual kiss. If none of these is a big concern, you may want to give this action-packed, well written young adult novel your consideration.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V5AYAJOGVTMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497665701#wasThisHelpful","R3V5AYAJOGVTMZ","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The XSories Camera Mounting System that I received includes the following four items:  * U-Shot orange-colored Telescopic Monopod / Pole that, when fully extended, is about 19 inches long  * small tiltee  * magnetic mount attachment (for stainless steel surfaces)  * suction cup mount attachment (for smooth surfaces, such as glass)(No manuals are included, but how-to instructions and graphic illustrations are printed on the container box.)Both the magnetic and suction cup mount attachments can each support up to about 6 lbs when attached to the types of surfaces they are meant for (indicated in the bullet list above) and the surfaces have to be sufficiently large to provide a stable base for the mounts to ""grab"" or hold on to.Either the telescopic pole or small tiltee can be screwed to the magnetic or suction cup mount attachments. For maximum flexibility in camera angle positioning, however, you can first screw the small tiltee to the magnetic or suction cup mount attachment, then screw the telescopic pole to the small tiltee (are screws are of the 1/4"" universal screw type, and both the telescopic pole and small tiltee have aluminum ball-heads).I used a lightweight compact digital camera to test all mounting set up combinations.  For the magnetic mount attachment, I used the stainless steel lid of my washing machine (A) and the stainless steel edge of a table (B) as my test surfaces.  For the suction cup mount attachment, the test surface was my patio's glass door (C).  All mounting set up combinations were stable and worked excellently with (A) and (C) but not (B), the latter due to the fact that the test surface was not big enough (the magnetic mount attachment by itself attached stably to the test surface, but with the telescopic pole screwed to it, the entire set up did not stay attached to the ""smallish"" test surface as expected).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJMT2J5RSJPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKYVY0C#wasThisHelpful","R3BJMT2J5RSJPB","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For several years now, the United States of America has been successfully using robotic soldiers, also known as ""Tin Men"" to police the world's troublespots.  Some countries support this interventionist policy, even contributing financially to it, but many others have come to resent it.Robotic soldiers give the U.S. military several advantages over other countries' militaries.  They are built to have better vision, strength, and speed than their human counterparts, and can survive many forms of attack.  While their synthetic brains do need to be ""mapped"" to and controlled by the corresponding brain of a trained flesh and blood soldier, the ""mapping"" process is done through satellite transmissions, so that the flesh and blood soldiers can carry out their missions from fortified remote locations, physically away from the troublespots themselves.  This does not mean that no harm will ever befall the human controllers, however, as members of Platoon A, animating the robotic soldiers patrolling Damascus, Syria from Wiesbaden, Germany, would soon find out.Anarchists who are opposed to America's interventionist policies and want to level the playing field have been gathering information on how to defeat such robotic soldiers and also bring down the human operators linked to them.  When they carry out their plan on the occasion of a summit gathering of G20 heads of states in Athens, Greece, large swaths of the world apparently suddenly go dark, and the U.S. President and Platoon A -- both the robotic and human contingents in Damascus and Wiesbaden, respectively -- find themselves under siege and cut off from all forms of electronic communications.Both the U.S. President and Platoon A have to figure out quickly what's going on in order to respond to the crisis appropriately, and -- more importantly -- to survive.The storytelling seamlessly weaves together how the crisis unfolds in Damascus, Wiesbaden, and Athens. There are ""light-touch"" subplots involving the romantic feelings of two Platoon A members for each other, two pairs of father and daughter trying to do better by the other, betrayals, and breakdowns.  Some dialogs and plot elements felt very contrived, and despite the author's attempts to humanize as many of the characters as possible, those efforts fell a little bit short relative to the greater focus given to narrating the combat actions and maneuverings. But overall, I still thought the action-packed novel was a good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20KMZBPIUDC8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034554885X#wasThisHelpful","R20KMZBPIUDC8M","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fast CPU, sensitive full HD touchscreen, good touchpad and backlit keyboard, unusual keys layout, WiFi but no Ethernet, only 2 USBsS7-393 vs. S7-392  The 5th generation Intel (Broadwell) CPU in the S7-393 offers incremental improvements over the S7-392's 4th Generation Intel (Haskell) CPU that should translate to 5-15% faster processing speed and slightly longer battery life.  The S7-393 also has an upgraded Wi-Fi Module that's also incrementally better than the one that's in the S7-392.  Other than these two primary improvements, most everything else in the S7-393 have not really changed all that much compared to the corresponding parts or features in the S7-392.WHAT YOU GET OUT OF THE BOX  For those not familiar with the S7 series at all, the contents include: the ultrabook, a power adaptor, a nice looking sleeve for the ultrabook, and a hardcopy of the  Quick Start Guide, International Travel Warranty Program Guide, and One-Year Limited Warranty agreement / description. (A pdf version of the User Manual must be downloaded from Acer's website if you need it.)  The ultrabook connects you to the internet thru the embedded Wi-Fi module only.  Ethernet dongles or accessories are a separate purchase.  The ultrabook comes with a high-resolution full HD (1920 x 1080) display, multi-touch screen, decent keyboard and touchpad, decent webcam, 8 GB RAM (not expandable to a greater maximum capacity), two mSATA 128 GB SSDs (Solid State Drives) configured into a RAID-0 arrangement so you can only use them as an integrated single drive rather two separate drives (but with the Windows 8.1 OS + other pre-installed software, only about 189 GBs remain free for user use), only two USB 3.0 ports, a Secure Digital (SD) card reader, DC-in jack, headset / speaker jack, one HDMI port, two stereo microphones at the front, two side-speakers, and a proprietary Acer Converter Port that, with the appropriate cable / accessory (apparently, many kinds are available), will allow for easy connection to a LAN, an external display, and / or an additional USB device.  Like most other ultrabooks, this one has no CD / DVD / optical drives.DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION  The S7-393 has the same sleek look as its predecessors. Aluminum is used for the frame and chassis, as well as the entire interior and the screen’s hinges. The lid is covered in a layer of Gorilla Glass, doubled by another one on the other side, on-top of the display. The bottom and the back are made from plastic though.  The ultrabook sits well on the desk, despite resting on tiny rubber feet. One can lift the ultrabook's lid with a single hand to about 90 degrees, but beyond that the hinge stiffens and you’ll need both hands to push the screen further back.  The hinge is designed and constructed to provide steadiness to the computer, so that when the screen is at 90 degrees, you can interact with the touchscreen actively without fear of wobbly unsteadiness that could topple the ultrabook over. The screen can go 180 degrees all the way back, so the entire ultrabook can lie flat against a surface or on your lap.  Once you lift the screen, you’ll notice that there is plenty of space for the keyboard and trackpad, plus a fairly-roomy palm-rest area.  The space above the keyboard all the way through the venting area close to the hinges is kept clear to help with keeping the ultrabook cool.  There is explicit mention in the Quick Start Guide and User Manual not to use a keyboard protector as ""the keyboard includes ventilation intakes for cooling,"" but if you think a keyboard protector may help guard against spills and such, you might want to research this matter further or consult with Acer before purchasing a keyboard protector.  The cooling fans do a very good job without being noisy at all.  The ultrabook does get warm but I've not experienced it getting hot.TOUCHSCREEN, TOUCHPAD, KEYBOARD, and LITHIUM BATTERY  The sensitive touch screen works well, offers full HD (1920 x 1080) display resolution, and supports multi-finger touch [though I have yet to use more than two fingers. :-) ]  The touchpad has been reported to have problems in older S7 iterations, but the S7-393 touchpad has worked relatively well for me.  The Quick Start Guide contains basic information on how to simulate left- and right-mouse clicks as well as how to drag screen objects using the touchpad, while the User Manual provides fuller details regarding all the things you can do with or on the touchpad.  Included in the pre-installed software is an Acer app called ""Acer Touch Tool"" which you might want to check out. The tool came in handy for me when I needed to do some things such as having to interact with small user interfaces, such as having to check or uncheck a really small checkbox, etc.  The keyboard is light-sensitive (it does this with the help of a sensor).  When room illumination goes down, the individual keys light up.  There are only five rows of keys in the keyboard -- the function keys are not on a row by themselves, and there is no separate numeric key pad; instead the numbers and function keys are combined together, and to get access to a particular function, you need to simultaneously press a combination sequence (for example, the ""Fn"" key + the ""F2"" key to get to the BIOS Setting Utility Screen).  There are also some other unusual key placements, like the ~ placed just near the CapsLock key or the Del placed on the bottom row near the Right Alt. There’s also no right CTRL key.  So there's definitely a learning curve involved to get used to the unusual keyboard layout, but otherwise, the keys themselves have a good tactile feel to them.  Most users would not be able to easily replace or change the lithium battery themselves.  Depending on display brightness and task intensiveness, I've been able to get 6-7 hours of continuous work done from a single full battery charge (Acer rates battery life to be up to 10 hours, but I haven't had a chance to do that kind of very long test yet).PERFORMANCE  The S7-393's 5th Generation Intel (Broadwell) CPU is rated 5-15% more efficient than the S7-392's Fourth Generation Intel (Haskell) CPU. The use of SSD as the storage device enables fast boot ups.  Upon opening the ultrabook's lid just after shutting down the ultrabook and closing down the lid, the computer starts up again really fast (within 3-5 seconds).  The S7-393 makes use of sensors to constantly check for start up signals, but you can turn off this ""Fast Startup"" setting if you wish to save battery life a little bit (instructions are in the User Manual, but essentially you go to Control Panel's Power Options >> Choose What the Power Buttons Do >> Change settings that are currently unavailable >> Scroll down and disable the Turn on Fast Startup option checkbox.)  Even after disabling ""Turn on Fast Startup,"" the computer still starts up relatively fast (within 10 seconds).  The Broadwell CPU includes improved integrated graphics processing, so graphics applications work just fine.  The two stereo microphones and side speakers work very well.  You get very good sound quality.SOFTWARE  The S7-393 ships with Windows 8.1 and other pre-installed software, leaving just about 189GB of SSD space available for user use.  Windows ""legacy"" or ""accessory"" software such as Notepad, Paint, and Windows Media Player are included, but none of the Microsoft Office apps are (there's a utility screen to request trial versions but I didn't make such a request).  There is a little bit of ""bloatware"" but not much, and most of them are either cloud-centric apps (such as abDocs, abFile) or utilily apps from Acer.  Because I don't have a need for AcerCloud, I deleted the cloud-centric apps but not the utility apps.  Four of the Acer Utility apps are potentially useful.  They are: Acer Touch Tool (already mentioned above), Acer Screen Capture / Grasp Tool, Energy Management Tool, and Acer Quick Access Tool.  The Acer Screen Capture / Grasp Tool lets you capture a full screen or portions of it to the clip board, Acer Scrapbook (not installed, but free download), or well-known media-sharing sites.  The tool also lets you edit the captured images in basic ways before sharing them.  The Acer Energy Management Tool tells you which running apps seem to be draining battery life most.  The Acer Quick Access Tool provides conveniences such as turning Wi-Fi on or off, specifying whether start up should go to Desktop or Apps mode, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S4HXD9S6GIYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45UMSE#wasThisHelpful","R3S4HXD9S6GIYI","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A stabbing pain jolting her awake, the novel's narrator discovers she's trapped inside a coffin, with curved bars restraining her wrists, ankles, and hips.  One of the first thoughts that comes to her is that she should not be waking up like this on her 12th birthday. She screams for help but no one comes. After several struggles, she frees herself. Climbing out of her coffin, she finds the clothes she's wearing much too tight for her body, making her question whether they are hers. Looking around, she finds there are other coffins in the room.  Then she hears a cry.  Locating the coffin where the cry is coming from, she helps get the lid off the coffin.  The newly freed stands taller than her, looks like a beautiful adult female, but like her, is only twelve. Others they help free from their coffins have the same strange story to tell:  They don't know who or where they are, other than they're all celebrating their twelfth birthdays.  They all look like they have the body of an adult though, and they are all strangely beautiful.The narrator speculates that the names etched on their coffins must be their names.  She takes on ""M. Savage"" as her name, and by virtue of the fact that she was the first to wake up and help free the others from their coffins, she is made de facto leader.  Her first decision is to get everyone out of the creepy room they're in, always going straight and upward, reasoning that always going straight will make retracing their way back easier than if they include turns, and going upward is more likely to lead to a place where there is light than going downward, which could also be an endless descent.Every decision she makes will have consequences, some greater than she would immediately know.  There will be dissents and challenges to her leadership, but the more these arise, the more she grows determined to hold on to her decision-making role because she can't seem to see any better alternative to her.The pacing of the plot is slower in the initial two-thirds than the last third of the novel. Whereas the first two-thirds of the novel delves a little bit into the world-building and some needed character development, the last third of the novel takes the world-building into an entirely different direction by crystallizing the overwhelming odds against M. Savage and her ilk.  Suddenly, we get explanations for many of the strangeness regarding M. Savage and her ilk, but as soon as these revelations are made, we find them in a desperate do-or-die situation.The first installment in a planned trilogy, this novel builds a good foundation for the subsequent installments, which I think have the potential to be even more interesting than this first one, because many possibilities have suddenly opened up. Even though the characters in this installment share some similarities, they are reasonably distinct and interesting in their own rights.  The M. Savage character is reasonably fleshed out in this novel, but there is more to learn about her as well as those other characters who are close to her.  The world-building and the plotting are all just fine, so overall, this planned trilogy is off to a good start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T54EMRTIXIAL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393103#wasThisHelpful","R1T54EMRTIXIAL","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Logitech Conference Cam is easy to setup and use.  All I had to do was turn on the cam device and connect it to my Windows 8.1 computer via the included USB cable.  Once plugged in to my computer, any required device drivers are automatically downloaded and installed.I used Skype to test videoconferencing.  As long as the lighting level is good, the video quality will be good.  Four to six people sitting in a small table can all be readily seen and heard clearly on the other end.  The camera has pan/tilt and zoom in/out capabilities, and the controls for those are in the camera itself, as well as the remote control which also doubles as a cover for the camera to help keep dust away when the device is not in use.The two microphones built into the device can pick up sound 360 degrees within a diameter range up to 12 feet, so there's no need to huddle close to the device in order to be heard clearly.You can pair a bluetooth-enabled music player to the device to play music through the device.If you have an HDMI cable to connect the cam device to a TV or display, you can put the cam device into a ""screen mirroring"" mode.  In such a mode, you can connect a Miracast-enabled smartphone to the cam device, and whatever is showing on your smartphone display will also be mirrored in the bigger display connected to the cam device.  Not all smartphones are Miracast-enabled, however, so if this ""screen-mirroring"" capability is really important to you, check first if you have a Miracast-enabled smartphone that can be used with this cam device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ATQ2IOOPST6Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SQG16MG#wasThisHelpful","R3ATQ2IOOPST6Z","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the process of narrating Taylor Wilson's journey from shy precocious child determined to build a portable nuclear fusion reactor in his grandma's garage before reaching the age of 15, to self-confident, gregarious, and award-winning young scientist whose practical but very useful nuclear device inventions have been winning him admirers worldwide young and old, Mr. Clynes manages to not only get us to cheer for young Taylor's successes, but also to help us comprehend at a layperson's level the science behind Mr. Wilson's inventions, as well as the challenges faced by young Taylor's parents, Tiffany (who's a yoga instructor) and Kenneth (who owns and runs a soft drink bottling company), in deciding how to support Taylor's interests while remaining mindful that they don't have the scientific background to properly vet safety concerns related to the projects Taylor was pursuing.Comparing and contrasting the decisions made by Kenneth and Tiffany with those made by the parents of David Hahn, another teenager who also wanted to build a nuclear reactor, Mr. Clynes observed that Hahn's scientist parents' fear for his safety led them to forbid the youngster from pursuing that interest, but that decision only pushed him to pursue his interests clandestinely; whereas the Wilsons' support for their first born involved finding mentors for Taylor, who eventually thrived, the Hahns' fear-based decision led to some unfortunate results.According to Mr. Clynes, research has shown that after parental support, a child's early school environment is the next most critical in a gifted child's development.  Mr. Clynes laments that, despite the common knowledge that children don't learn at the same pace, our educational system is mostly a one-size-fits-all system, where most schools are not finding creative ways to help gifted children reach their potential, unlike the special schools that the Wilsons were able to find for Taylor, and his younger brother Joey, who's exceptional at mathematics.Mr. Clynes asserts that while it is true that schools would need additional funding to find creative ways to help gifted children grow to their potential, there is also an economic cost -- perhaps an even greater one -- if we fail to develop talents to stay competitive in a post-industrial global stage.  Furthermore, for gifted children programs to really succeed, they must not neglect the child's social and emotional development, and there must be a concerted outreach to economically disadvantaged families who may lack the resources that wealthier families have to advocate effectively for their gifted offsprings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGM0ZWPAKDAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544085116#wasThisHelpful","R2TGM0ZWPAKDAF","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Most of the short stories in this fine collection are either love stories of sorts or tales of World War II experiences, especially of Hungarian Jews'.  The latter include tales of dissident musicians, and a few are inspired by the author's own family history, in which the grandmother or grandfather in the story is memorialized with fondness.Quite a few of the stories have quirky characters.  My favorite is the one telling the story of how a much younger Cristophe Chapman -- who's found fame as a photographer punching famous artists in the face with one hand while capturing their reactions with a camera held in the other hand -- came into 50 year old artist Francisco Ling's life at the height of the AIDS Crisis in the 1980s just when the latter really needed someone.  Although Francisco's friends worried that Chapman may only be using Ling to further his own career, it was actually Ling who pulled a surprise on everyone, and Chapman's response to that surprise is both poignant and impactful.The stories in this collection are all very well written but some may be easier to relate to than others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8LIEG6JOUBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0525426698#wasThisHelpful","R3B8LIEG6JOUBO","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This well written book provides a broad examination of different areas in which our justice system can be improved to make it more ""just,"" including:* Initial assessment of whether a crime has occurred where focusing on the wrong things could lead first responders to jump to erroneous conclusions* the undue weight that could be given to confessions extracted possibly with the use of questionable techniques* the use of eyewitness testimony that psychologists have found to be vulnerable to many kinds of problems* the emphasis on ""winning"" rather than the ""search for truth"" in our adversarial legal system that could incentivize the prosecution team to not share information with the defense team that could benefit the latter's client(s)* the focus on ""punitiveness"" rather than ""rehabilitation"" in our prison systemUsing different sources of information such as psychological studies of eyewitness testimony reliability, or look-backs into cases where convictions were overturned due to the more recent use of DNA evidence on appeals or reopened trials to learn how the justice system failed the innocent people in question (many of whom tended to have mental disorders or low levels of education), the author helps readers understand where, how, and why miscarriages of justice could occur.Many of the author's proposals on what we can do to make our justice system more ""just"" sound reasonable. Examples:  Why not digitize all case information and documents and store them in a repository that would be accessible to anyone working on a given case, including staff from both the prosecution and defense teams? Why not use video footages instead of relying on eyewitness testimonies whenever possible?Comparing and contrasting how our legal and prison systems work relative to other, mostly European, countries' systems, the author also highlights how those countries' emphasis on prosecution and defense teams partnering together to better understand what really transpired in a given situation lays a better foundation for focusing on how to help with the rehabilitation of non-violent offenders than our adversarial legal and punitive prison systems, and the lower rates of recidivism in those countries seem to provide evidence that their approaches seem to be working better than ours and might be worth adapting or at least studying further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DWW6XT80Y2QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770437761#wasThisHelpful","R3DWW6XT80Y2QL","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel tells the story of three young men -- Wintric Ellis, Armando Torres, and Big Dax -- who joined the military very early on in their lives because of a perceived lack of attractive good choices available to them, only to return home in much worse shape because of the tragic events that occurred while they were serving in Afghanistan.The novel opens with the more experienced Dax and Torres helping new recruit Ellis get through his nervousness while watching over local Afghans streaming into a makeshift clinic for medical attention and being on guard against suspicious behaviors.  This opening chapter is ominously entitled ""Be Polite but Have a Plan to Kill Everyone You Meet.""The chapter is then followed by flashbacks into the men's teenage years delving into the kind of rut they were all in before they signed up to join the military. Those chapters are a bit too long but they do show what kind of a support system they had prior to joining the military.The third person narration then switches back to Afghanistan and the tragic events that they get ensnared in and would weigh on their mind for many, many years, which the remainder of the novel delves into.In my opinion, of the three characters, Dax is the least fleshed out one; Torres has the most interesting backstory; and Ellis experiences the most difficulty coming to terms with what happened in Afghanistan. What makes these three men's stories especially poignant is that, despite finding strong and supportive wives, all three of them could not completely open up to their wives regarding what happened in Afghanistan.  Experiencing new misfortunes, they sink deeper in despair. Fortunately, hope comes to at least one of them.The storytelling drags on a little bit, but the writing is fine otherwise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T5Y1V498JIKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544380983#wasThisHelpful","R2T5Y1V498JIKR","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is the first installment in an epic fantasy series inspired by real figures and events that played important parts in the rise of the Han Empire in Chinese history.  The reimagined story is infused with mythology, and takes place in the Islands of Dara, which were created from the solidified lava tears of Goddess Daramea as she gave birth to eight children, who would later stake claims to different parts of the islands. Ever since then, the fates of the islands' inhabitants became inextricably bound with the doings and undoings of the goddess' deity children.For centuries, back before the so-called Xana Conquest, the various island states vied for dominance. They were in a constant state of war and shifting alliances. When King Reon of Xana came to power and defeated all of his rivals, he ruled the unified islands with an iron fist as Emperor Mapidere.  Although his rule brought about some good changes to his subjects' lives, many more of his and his minions' actions and decisions caused deaths and sufferings, and in time, some of his subjects would find the courage to rise up against him.The two subjects who would find the most success at opposing Mapidere are Kuni Garu, a commoner who is street-smart, kind-hearted, and can seemingly talk his way out of any predicament but who has also displeased his family for seemingly throwing his life away preferring to live as a drifter rather than finishing his education or working for his older brother, and Mata Zyndu, the last descendant of a noble unjustly murdered by Mapidere and Kuni Garu's polar opposite: tall, brawny and skilled in martial arts, with very rigid notions of what constitutes bravery, loyalty, justice, and honor.When Kuni and Mata first meet, they take to each other immediately, calling each other ""brother."" Fighting Mapidere's men together initially, they enjoy many successes. Then a misunderstanding happens and drives a wedge between them.  They drift apart, and eventually, their differing temperaments and ideologies lead them to become rivals, attracting different kinds of recruits to their respective causes.  More heterogeneous and inclusive than Mata's recruits, Kuni's recruits include bandits, women, and former soldiers with different kinds of disabilities. With Daramea's deity children also taking sides, Kuni's and Mata's power struggles take many twists and turns.The storytelling delves into the various strategies and tactics employed by Kuni and / or Mata, which include the use of: brute force, deception, psychological warfare, sci-fi type of airships and weapons, majestic whales, Trojan-Horse-type of contraptions for surprise attacks, etc.The world-building is excellent. The prose includes some beautiful sayings and constructions.  The cast of characters is huge and reasonably interesting, with new characters getting introduced (then sometimes getting killed immediately) even up to the last quarter of the novel, but only few of the many characters that have significant screen time are fleshed out.  The ending is conclusive, and doesn't really leave any loose ends, except for the questions of how the surviving characters would further evolve or devolve, and what further adventures or misadventures await them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IU8YE79EMMTA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481424270#wasThisHelpful","R2IU8YE79EMMTA","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This history book provides detailed behind-the-scene accounts of what was happening in Russia in the years leading up to and immediately after World War I, including:*  Russia's humiliating defeat by Japan in the 1904 to 1905 Russo-Japanese War;*  How the shock of that defeat contributed to the Russian Revolution of 1905, which in turn caused Tsar Nicholas II to issue the October Manifesto promising limited government reforms but in fact failed to address the social problems that years later would boil up again;*  How the same defeat spurred Tsar Nicholas II to pour money into reforming and rebuilding the military at the expense of other domestic programs;*  How Russia's military buildup did not sit well with Germany and Austria especially when viewed in light of their rivalry for control of the Balkan states and other Eastern European concerns; and*  How war between Russia and the German-Austrian alliance came about in 1914 and why the costs to Russia included the downfall of the monarchy that ended the Romanov Dynasty and also opened the door to Bolshevik rule of Russia.In addition to providing insights into the conflicting personalities and ideologies of factional leaders with influence in the conduct of government and foreign relation affairs, the author also makes interesting comparisons and contrasts of military and citizen support for the Russian state during the Napoleonic Wars and World Wars I and II, and discusses the lessons learned.  The author's musings regarding several what-if scenarios are also interesting.Some of the details shared felt like minutiae that when edited out could have made the book less dry and easier to read, but otherwise, the analyses and insights provided are valuable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K6PD0FA6E13B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670025585#wasThisHelpful","R1K6PD0FA6E13B","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These freeze-dried apple slices have only three listed ingredients: apple, ground cinnamon, and citric acid.Each 6 ounce can contains about six servings, with each serving consisting of about 35 slices.

"My overall rating for this product is 4.5 stars (loads of really nice features, few limitations but many can be fixed with firmware updates)This Sony FDR X1000V action cam is palm-sized and weighs only about 4 ounces (with the included NP-BX1 battery installed). It comes housed in a 33'-rated underwater casing that is easy to unlock, but even without this casing, the camera is rated IPX4 splash-proof, water- and dust-resistant. The rest of the base product bundle includes: a flat and a curved adhesive mount, a 23"" micro-to-standard-USB cable for connecting the camera to a computer (and also in-camera battery charging), a Startup Guide, and a Reference / Specification Guide.  At the time of this review, there was only an online version of the Help or User Guide (not even a downloadable PDF).This action cam can be used to take videos or photos.  The f/2.8 lens is located on the narrow side of the camera, so when shooting something in front of you, the long side of the camera's body will most likely have to be oriented perpendicular to you, with the lens facing what you're trying to capture.  The camera's base contains a standard tripod / monopod mount, and a stereo microphone sits below the camera's lens.Menu navigation is done via pressing the ""PREV"" or ""NEXT"" button in combination with the ""REC/ENTER"" button. The LED Display located on one of the camera's long sides (same side as the ""PREV"" and ""NEXT"" buttons) is for displaying current mode or settings information only.  There is no View Finder, but with an Android or iPhone version of Sony's PlayMemories Mobile [PMM] app installed on your smartphone or tablet, you can use the latter device(s) as some sort of a view finder as well as to remotely control the action cam, including changing camera modes and settings (you can also purchase the more expensive product bundle that includes Sony's Live View Remote, or purchase just the latter separately;  but since I don't have the Live View Remote, I can't comment on it further except to say that I don't have a need for it currently, because I'm able to do everything I want to do just using my Android and the PMM app.)The X1000V lets you select recording movies in either XAVC S (Sony's efficient codec) or MP4 formats. 4K recording is offered a resolution of 3,840x2,160 and only in XAVC S; selectable frame rates are 30/24p at 100Mbps or 24p at 60Mbps.XAVC S recording is also available at bitrates of:* 50Mbps (1080/60/30/24p)* 60Mbps (1080/120p or 720/240p)* 100Mbps (1080/120p or 720/240p)MP4 recording is available at:* 1080/60/30p* 720/30/120p* 480/240p4K recording at 100Mbps requires at least a 64GB microSDXC card with a UHS-I U3 or better rating, such as Sony 64GB microSDXC High Speed Memory Card (ASIN: B00ND1LN7M).Electronic image stabilization, which compensates for camera shake, is a built-in feature of the X1000V that's lacking in the GoPro.  However, this feature does not yet work with 4K recording mode, and with image stabilization turned on, the camera's field angle can only be at 120 degrees (with image stabilization turned off, the field angle can be as wide as 170 degrees).With an aperture of f/2.8, the camera's ZEISS lens works very well in low light situations.The built-in stereo mic comes with a wind noise reduction capability that's settable from the menu.The camera's loop recording feature lets you record video continuously, preserving the last 5, 20, 60, or 120 minutes of footage - depending on setting. As soon as something important happens, you can commit the duration of the loop permanently to memory and continue recording seamlessly. There is an ""Unlimited"" mode that will fill up the remaining free space on the memory card. During loop recording, any previously recorded material never gets overwritten.Manual settings on the FDR-X1000V include:* Auto Exposure Control: 2.0, 1.7, 1.3, 1.0, 0.7, 0.3, 0.0* White Balance: Auto, Color-Temp (2500 to 9900K selectable), One PushYou can take pictures leisurely one picture at a time, or shoot multiple pictures using interval recording or burst shooting modes.While video quality can be excellent, still image / photo quality tends to be just very good.Sony rates the battery life at 115 minutes with continuous recording for 1080p, and 50 minutes for 4K, which jibe with my experience.While in-camera menu navigation and setting / configuration tweaking can require quite a few frustrating button presses stepping through unrelated menu items in order to get to the relevant ones, the use of the above-mentioned PlayMemories Mobile app with a mobile device can not only make setting / configuration tweaking easier, but also provides the following additional conveniences: navigate to the online Help Guide for the X1000V if the web is available, and switch to the included Highlight Movie Maker software to create highlight clips for web sharing, perform basic editing, and view and / or delete the saved media files.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXCMPT36RWYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1COCT0#wasThisHelpful","R2IXCMPT36RWYO","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In addition to learning many fascinating things about hummingbirds, including their amazing capabilities and a few urban myths about them, I also enjoyed reading the various little stories surrounding each rescued hummingbird -- where and how they were found, who the rescuer(s) were (which included compassionate cats and kids), and the unselfishness of some of the more ""heroic"" rescuers who were willing to go the few extra figurative and / or literal miles to get the birds to the author for rehab help.Readers get to find out how the author got started as a volunteer hummingbird rehabilitator, the hard work involved in being one, the many times the author had to play ""psychotherapist"" to both distraught and frightened rescuers and birds, and the attributes and personalities of the birds she had christened ""Gabriel,"" ""Pepper,"" ""Chucky,"" ""Brad,"" and ""Iris"" that made them unforgettable to her and taught her different things about the caring of injured hummingbirds.The book is very well written. The author's and some of the rescuers' slightly whacky but endearing personalities come through very clearly.  Not all of the rescued hummingbirds can be nursed back to health, but every time one of them complete rehab, which takes -- on average -- about two months of tender loving care, and soars to the air after being released back to the wild, you can't help but cheer not just for the nursed-back-to-good-health hummingbird but also the author and the people who worked with her to make it happen: seemingly ordinary people performing out-of-the-ordinary acts of kindness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QI75ZZUME4OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544416031#wasThisHelpful","R1QI75ZZUME4OR","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book delves into the personality and ideological clashes between two political figures, Jawaharlal Nehru and Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who later became the political leader of post-World War II India and Pakistan, respectively, and how their lack of trust and respect for each other drove them to make costly mistakes, with consequences that still reverberate today, and pit the two neighboring countries against each other, with no end in sight to their enmity.This well written book will help readers understand the historical roots of the enmity between India and Pakistan, the depth of this enmity and why it has not subsided, why Kashmir is still a disputed region, the role played by Pakistan in the rise of the Talibans in Afghanistan, and how Pakistan became a U.S. foreign aid recipient.The book contains many graphic accounts of Muslims killing Hindus and Sikhs, and Hindus and Sikhs killing Muslims solely because of fear and hatred, or for vengeance.  Except for a brief mention in the epilogue of a potential way to resolve the Kashmir dispute between the two countries, the book does not really address how the now nuclear powers can rise above the deadly legacy of India's partition into predominantly Muslim Pakistan and predominantly Hindu India.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMHRPLSHT78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547669216#wasThisHelpful","R2FMHRPLSHT78","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main takeaway from this short but well-written book is that if your organization is not constantly looking to recognize emerging new realities in order position itself to benefit from them, then your organization risks losing out to more agile and proactive competitors who are able to scale up on the new endeavor very quickly and may leave your organization in the dust.Being left in the dust is what the author calls a ""structural"" risk that organizations can attempt to address by cultivating leaders who can develop their:* Perceptual acuity, or ability to pick up ""bend in the road"" signals* Mind set to see opportunity in uncertainty* Ability to see a new path forward and commit to it* Adeptness in managing the transition to the new path* Skill in making the organization steerable and agileCase studies of organizations with leaders who succeeded or failed to step up their game with respect to the five bulleted points above are provided, along with the appropriate post-mortems or lessons learned.Readers familiar with the SWOT (Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats) analytical method would recognize some of the author's recommendations on how organizations can stay on top on their game (e.g., the first three bullet points above involve the analyses of opportunities and threats, while the last three involve a commitment to recalibrating an organization's strengths and weaknesses as needed), but some of the recommendations do go beyond the analysis of SWOT, making the discourse in this book a good and welcomed contribution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39LQPE0GZT3HD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610394747#wasThisHelpful","R39LQPE0GZT3HD","AK9FTWLCW09RR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AK9FTWLCW09RR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vansky Pets Ultra Violet Urine Detector Dog/Cat Stain Remover Fluorescent Whitening Agents Detector, UV Blacklight Flashlight, Find Dry Stains on Carpets, Rugs, Curtains & Fabrics. 3 x AAA Batteries Included & InsertedReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews This has batteries included – a real bonus, as its awful getting something new and then having to hunt round or “steal” batteries from another device! works best in the dark and made me feel I was back in the 70’s where every disco/live band venue has these lights. We girls all learned not to wear white bras unless we wanted lots of attention! and the poor guys with dandruff.....Still, how well does it work? We haven’t any pets now ( except Muska the horse and she doesn’t come indoors, much though she’s love to. If she did we wouldn’t need a urine detector – they pee pints and it would be pretty obvious!) However my daughters two dogs are here frequently though, and Flash has just stayed a few days with Him Indoors while we all went to Center Parcs. He didn’t think Flash had peed, we couldn’t smell anything but it was good to have it confirmed. What I did discover though was that though I thought the bathroom was clean – I was playing around with the torch and decided to check – it’s got a horrible amount of stains I didn’t see. I know they aren’t pee stains as they were round the bath and shower, and the sink and back spalsh, we’d need to be acrobats to pee up there! Clearly it picks up soap scum and lime scale or something too, but I was so shocked that our bathroom looked liked something off Grime busters! In normal light it looks fine, and I do clean it but I guess its time to get the steamer out again....didn’t dare try the kitchen surfaces, I’ll do that After the steamer has been round.If you’ve a house proud and supercilious relative or acquaintance you want to put down then visit with one of these! Or of course if you simply want to root out pet pee stains and target the neutraliser....If it doesn't seem to work then check the batteries are in correctly. I put them in without checking and  one was wrong way round...I guess it's that usually its 2 or 4 and I automatically put the next in the other way up without thinking, and of course three means two adjacent ones same way round.Stars: Five, but remember it shows up other stains too, not just pee, before you get a heart attack at what's revealed.Product supplied for review  If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews. ","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPFGKGFTYR6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LPWXV6#wasThisHelpful","R3DPFGKGFTYR6Q","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Erofa 48 Color Art Colour Pencils Drawing Pencils, for Secret Garden Pencil Pouch colored pencil Artist Sketch SetReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews As an artist I’m always interesting in art equipment so was delighted to get these for review. There’s been a recognition recently that adults find colouring relaxing and there are several books aimed at adults with beautiful complex images ready to colour. These would work perfectly with one of those for a gift for a stressed adult for xmas! They look elegant in a simple silver colour with hexagonal design, and I feel that makes them easier to grip than round pencils. They are easy to sharpen and have an anti break formula. That’s good, sharpening a pencil only to find it snaps two minutes later is very frustrating! I like too that they are “Professional crafted with recycled wood, which is environmentally friendly and non- toxic”.  Anything that helps the environment is a bonus IMO.  There’s a huge range of colours and of course by using techniques such as blending and crosshatching you can create an infinite numbers of variables. As well as the pencils, this set includes a great carry case, in a sturdy soft fabric with elasticated inserts for each pencil and a couple of spares for an eraser of ruler maybe? Makes them perfect for taking out of the home for outside sketching, for school and college.  I found them easy to use creating both sharp edge effects and sideways for large cover. I’ve shown in a diagram below a quick ad hoc  experiments I did with a  couple of these.Stars: Five, terrific gift for others or yourself!Product supplied for review ","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDWKVAUT1ID8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013WMAR2S#wasThisHelpful","RDWKVAUT1ID8T","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On Our Own Terms  Adelaide HipwellReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance,I like second chance romance and rock band romance so this was a no brainer, and I expected to enjoy it. And I did, but it didn’t quite have that magic spark I was hoping for that makes a five star read for me. Its a well deserved Four though and a story I was drawn into.One of the things I really liked was that Harriet wasn’t some poor downtrodden waitress/bar tender/shopworker living in squalid conditions etc. waiting to be rescued by the Hero, (they have their place of course but sometimes its good to read about other types). Nope, she was incredibly clever, and had made millions through the sale of her apps technology. Money doesn’t bring happiness though and poor Harriet was devastated, gutted, had all her confidence sapped when her long time boyfriend and business partner is caught cheating...She leaves Australia and goes to stay for a while in LA with her sister and family, the adorable twins, lovely husband and Bitch Face and Sour Puss the pets. Their next door neighbour is none other than grown up teen boy band sensation Ned.I loved Ned, he was such a gorgeous man, very natural and down to earth.  He was tired of all the promo stuff they went through, tired of the hype and the pressure that led to one of the band members to attempt suicide and his feelings of guilt for not doing more. The guys from 4G are still close friends though, and we see all of them here in this book, see them grown up, pursuing other things but those teen pressures still affect them all. Ned’s attracted to Harriet instantly ( I LOVED their meeting where one of the twins was...well, read it!!), but oddly though they are both successful people they each think they’re not good enough for the other – its that old thing that haunts many of us, confidence, do we have what’s needed, can that special someone really want to be with us, when they are surrounded by people more successful, more intelligent, more handsome/beautiful, thinner/better body....nearly everyone has hang-ups about themselves somewhere, and sometimes they play on our minds too much.They spend more and more time together, we see more of Harriet’s and her sister’s friends and the rest of 4G, and its a fun read. Usual spats with the media – they so annoy me the way they haunt celebrities, intrude on their privacy, but sadly those images sell and that’s why people suffer – why do people want to see private pictures, believe all the lies....? Still, it provides some great plots for the book, and adds that touch of realism that I so need. I really liked Ned and Harriet, thought they were perfect for each other, but they seemed to have not only their own inner voices to overcome but outside pressures too. Its a story I really enjoyed, and I loved the way the band used their celebrity and the things that had happened to them to support a much needed cause. I spoke about realism earlier – that part felt very genuine, and sadly I can imagine just that happening today. I feel for some of the young celebrities around, surrounded by those who just want to make money from them and aren’t at all concerned about them as people, about their welfare or health. This part of the plot was all too real but Adelaide turns it to the good in the end. Overall there’s a fabulous blend of romance and humour here with some wonderful one liners and snark, and I really want to read more from Adelaide. Its an excellent start for her writing career with this first novel.  Stars: Four, a terrific first book.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3M61E9UHVZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167JXLX0#wasThisHelpful","RE3M61E9UHVZV","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Breaking Hearts, Full Hearts book 4,   by M.J.SummersReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, I liked the little we saw of Trey in an earlier book, and of course that bombshell, that he was the father of Gabriella’s baby! Now circumstances have changed, and he needs to bring his son home. Out in Brazil he finds its not so easy, he’s no money, no job and the Brazilians want to see proof he can support toddler Tomas before they’ll give permission for him to leave.Alessandra has been looking after Tomas while completing her Law studies, and agrees to continue to help Trey with him. She knows Tomas will leave soon and wants to spend as much time as she can with him, she’s been his main caregiver and loves the little boy.Its a great story potentially but somehow it didn’t live up to the promise for me. Its well written, had good plots that expand the main story and yet ...I just felt kind of underwhelmed, a bit bored at times, wanting to get to the end and find out what happens rather than enjoying the journey there :-( Trey and Alessandra were a great couple, but at times both seemed so juvenile, so young and stubborn. It wasn’t hard to see what was going to happen and I need to be taken by surprise, not see what’s coming a mile off. Its a good read, just for me not a great one.Stars: Three, a good read but nothing to get excited about for me. ...ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YIMXSW7E4RYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHL3UB0#wasThisHelpful","R1YIMXSW7E4RYD","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I Do, A.J. PineReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, New AdultWell this is part of a series, but each book is complete and can be read as a stand alone. Having said that I’d not read the earlier ones and I think I’d have got more from this if I had. There is brief backstory info given where needed but I just didn’t really get a sense of the people they were and what was important to them as individuals. Clearly they’ve had some issues but are a close group of friends.Its told from multiple points of view ( seven!) – I like that, but it did mean a lot of jumping from person to person in quite a short novel ( 2330 kindle locations) so there’s no space for really getting into anything in real depth.What appeals to me about the New Adult genre is the drama and emotion  books usually have but its all very surface based light and fluffy here...and I missed the angst, the sadness, the drama that makes the happy parts all the sweeter.It’s a fun read though, with a HEA for everyone and some great characters. If you want short, light and fun this is perfect.Stars: Three, a good read if you’ve followed the series and want a perfect ending for the couples. ...ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFW3X8VZ3PPCM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MPPDMM#wasThisHelpful","RFW3X8VZ3PPCM","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Tell Me You Need Me,  Joya Ryan Review from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, I've loved some of Joya's novels but this one just didn't work for me. Having an ARC of this info re length wasn't available and I didn't know that it's a novella at just under 2200 kindle locations. Sadly for me novella's rarely work. If I know in advance I try to avoid them but this time I didn't :-( Chloe came over as a bit brash and in-your-face to me. I've no issues about someone knowing what they want and going for it, but her reasons for avoiding romance seemed just weird, and I didn't really understand them. Likewise her compulsion to make her mum's cafe/restaurant a sucess as it was when mum ran it - why? Maybe if the book had been longer I'd have more background and understood her and her motives better. I felt the same about Gage - his intransigence about his job, his refusal to consider that maybe if he could persuade Chloe into a romance, a relationship - which was what he wanted, she'd want more than to be just waiting around for when he decided to return, and be happy when he was off for weeks at a time again was to me just plain selfish. When they are together there are some very erotically charged sex scenes, but to me that's it, just lust, and I never felt more emotionally between them. Sex is fine in a story - in fact in a good romance I enjoy it, but here I felt it was All the story, that for me there was little else except some hot and sensual sex scenes, and I need a solid story backing them up to enjoy them. I actually skipped many of them, looking for more between Chloe and Gage, looking for some kind of connection, some indications of more. Its a short novel anyway, timewise as well as length, only covering a few weeks so I guess that's again why I didn't really have the chance to get to know them and what made them the characters they are. Sadly its a book that's a pass for me, will still look out for more of Joya's excellent stories but this one hasn't hit the spot. Stars: Two, hot sex but not much else for me.  ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4FKCD2A210EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CLZ89Y#wasThisHelpful","R4FKCD2A210EN","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eggsnow Travel Backpack Daypack, Lightweight, Ultra-Large Capacity, Waterproof Packable Backpacks, Perfect for Camping, Hiking, Climbing and TravelReview from Jeannie’s Product ReviewsThe UK have just introduced a bag charge (which I think is great, save all that plastic in landfill) so this backpack is a great buy. Its waterproof, folds into a tiny pouch with a zip that can be easily tucked in a pocket, and is perfect for carrying around so you’ve always somewhere to put purchases. It’s got a large central capacity with an inset pouch for purse or phone, with an outer zipped pocket and two mesh side pockets – perfect for drinks bottles for hikers or students. Its incredibly lightweight but very strong too, so will take groceries, heavy books, packed lunches easily. There are a couple of reflective tabs just above the mesh pouter pockets that are useful for dark nights or gloomy mornings.

"Dearborn, (Woodland Creek),  Jenni Moen.Review from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Sci-fi and FantasyWhat a fabulous concept, 30 books by different authors centred around the same small village. I’ve looked and – hurrah - some are on Kindle Unlimited, so I’m planning ( when time allows!!) to read more from this collection. I’d not read anything by Jenni Moen before but this sounded such an interesting plot I wanted to try this one. I did find it slow to start and in that way, the writing style and the way it unfolds it reminds me very much of Charlaine Harris Midnight Crossroads, though the only murders here are the Cluedo variety! Its a gentle story, full of tiny mysteries and hints about what's coming, so that when things are revealed we’ve an idea what’s going to happen. And then I got surprised when it didn’t work out the way I’d thought :-) but that’s fine, I love the unpredictability of when that happens. I loved Willow right from the start. She’s got a kind heart and that comes through, where even though she can feel other people’s emotion she still tried to think the best of them. I loved her plans for the house and when it was complete I could visualise those rooms – I’d love to stay there. Quinn too, a lovely man but so traumatised by his experiences he’s in a way scared and yet something draws him to Willow, they complement each other really well. Ryan her diner colleague was a great guy too and had some good lines. Its a very gentle story, no heart stopping romances and dramas, no edge of seat suspense, but a plot that gradually reveals more and more about the people in the village. I savoured the story, its not one to rush through or you miss the tiny elements that add so much to it. I don’t think its one I’d reread though, but the description of the village and its heritage made me want to read more in the series.Stars: Four, a tender, mellow story.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful. ","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKCLLUQNHMGFY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0172RPX8M#wasThisHelpful","RKCLLUQNHMGFY","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Ice Moon,  Lisa KesslerReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Sci-fi and Fantasy.I’ve loved this series but did feel the last book felt a little slow, but for me this is back on track. Doc Jason’s twin Jared is the subject here, and when he meets Taryn Goldstone about a new contract, some decking at her house he realises she’s his Mate. Taryn has issues though, as a Psychic with fire-starting talents she’s scared of hurting people so closes herself off. She adores her young son Charlie, but never touches him, never hugs him for fear of burning him. Her talent seems to be allied with strong emotion and she doesn’t have control, so avoids letting her emotions out. That’s why she gets nicknamed The Ice Queen.  As we get to know more of her and Charlie we can see she’s just in the right place, just where she needs to be, guided there by an unexpected source. The shocks and connections keep getting stronger, and I can see how the Pack is amassing people with the skills they’ll need if and when there’s a final head to head with Nero. As well as keeping her Pyro-kinesis a secret Taryn knows nothing of werewolves, so Jared has a hard task in front of him. He learns about her problems by accident and of course then he’s waiting for the right moment to tell her about himself. Its not only him he needs to tell her about too....Of course as always Nero are looking out for those with skills they can utilise, and they don’t ask politely but will use anything to force people to them. Jared needs to protect her and Charlie but how to protect someone when you can’t tell them everything yet, as they’ll think you need locking up. He has a plan to show her its all real but until then his family agree to keep it secret. What happens with those though? Yes, they always get released at just the wrong time!There’s love and heated (!) emotions here, dangers once more from Nero, problems to overcome for not just Taryn but Jared too, and a wonderful boy, Charlie, to protect! Its a great read and one I really enjoyed, kept me gripped right through..Stars: Five, a great instalment to the series. ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25F13TVCSMPK9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MPPDNG#wasThisHelpful","R25F13TVCSMPK9","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Christian, Book 10 of The Vampires in America Series,  D. B. ReynoldsReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Sci-fi and FantasyThis is one of my favourite Vampire series. Each book is almost a stand alone in that its a complete story, but there are threads of the battle to come, the European vampires that want to take over America, that weave through all the books. Slowly the parameters are set, the lines are being drawn and Allies forming, masterminded by the clever and intriguing Raphael ( books one and two). This time we meet Christian, child of Mathilde. She was killed in the last book after using some devious means to try to get to Raphael, and Christian refused to support her.Debbie’s vampires are tough, very Alpha, and hold their territories by power alone. Anthony holds the South after a battle there but isn’t strong enough to hold it himself, and has been supported by Raphael as a strategic move. It was actually Cynthia, Raphael's human mate, that killed the former Lord but of course that can’t get out – they have some very strong and traditional laws, and a human killing a vampire lord wouldn't be seen kindly. For that reason even though many suspect the truth its seen as Raphael that defeated him, but with his own territory to run he’s delegated Anthony. Now that support is being withdrawn, he’s helped with the set up and Anthony should have been able to manage, but he’s proved not to be up to it. He’s resigned, something unheard of, usually territories are gained by formal challenges or a battle to the death. Anthony is secretly working away underhandedly in the background though to keep himself in power in an area that suits him. He certainly doesn’t want Christian to be the next Lord, he’s far too strong to allow Anthony's plans to come to fruition. Then there’s Natalie. She’s been working for Anthony for the past two years, he has her family in a stranglehold and she’s had to fall in with him. So far he’s kept it all circumspect and allowed her to do her job without any interference in her personal life, but as things heat up and he’s preparing his next move he has plans for her too, regardless of what she wants. Its another torrid, fast moving, sensual read with action and drama throughout, interspersed with some searingly hot vampire sex. Those guys certainly know how to show a lady a good time....As always there are things from previous books that creep in, scenes that were set much earlier and that’s why I’d recommend reading the previous books to fully enjoy this one, even though its complete in itself. As with past books I loved it and it will join my keepers file. I find with Debbie’s books each time I re-read I find little things I missed first time round, little references to past events and clues for future ones. Some series get a bit tired after this many book but this is as fresh still as the first few books and I’m happy for it to continue. I look forward to more – looks like Sophia, the only female vampire Lord, is set to feature largely in the next book. Although she’s the only one in America at the moment there are some strong female characters placed throughout the series, both vampire and human, no simpering milksops here.

"The Alpha's Temporary Mate,  Victoria DaviesReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Sci-fi and Fantasy.I really enjoyed this – I loved the first two novels, and its one of those easy to read, fun series that you can just relax with. This time it’s Chloe who’s the main subject, put in a difficult position by Alpha werewolf Kieran. He wants a temporary girlfriend, one that will fool his pack and get them off his back about settling down. That’s something he’s not prepared to do. Chloe needs this to go right, he’s offering big money and if she can land him she’s promised the office managers job, as her boss will use his funds to open the next Fated Match. They don’t do temporary though, they’re all about finding Mates, but the money he’s offering persuades Chloe's boss to do this as a one off, so long as the other person involved is clear its not permanent too. So far though all the people Chloe comes up with get rejected by him, while his wolf is telling him Chloe would be good. She reluctantly agrees to do it – its only a few weeks but involves living with him, and going on the annual pack retreat. She’s a witch, so that would be the perfect breakup reason for the pack, in fact it’s a win win – or is it?I love the way it played out, how we learned more about both Kieran and Chloe, how we met briefly the characters from earlier books, and how the friends on both sides needed them to be very convincing to pull it off. As Kieran says though she can’t flinch when he kisses her in public, so they need to practice...and that turns out to be the catalyst for much more emotion than either of them bargained for.Its a cute story, with some smouldering sensual scenes and some great humour. I did hope for a bit more jealousy from the pack females, who naturally would resent Chloe but what there was worked well. When it all fell apart I was so upset for Chloe – and I need that, need the sad bit.  Its another good addition to the series, and one to read when you want a light novel to relax with and entertain you, not a deep dark drama that needs all your attention and concentration. There’s a place for both in my reading lists, it depends on my mood what I want to read. Stars: Five, a great addition to the series. ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J4W02J6GSEO8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015MP6I1M#wasThisHelpful","R1J4W02J6GSEO8","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Semlos Romantic Bedroom Ocean Projector LampRelaxing Blue Night Light Projector Music Projection with 3.5mm built-in Speaker(Powered by USB Cable Included)Review from Jeannie’s Product Reviews This arrived well packed along with some other items in a secure box. Its a strange looking device but once working it transforms a room into something magical. Its easy to use and can be run from the mains or battery powered. That’s  useful if you want to use it in bathrooms where mains electric isn’t available or safe. I use it with a power bank. I love those and they  make electric devices so much more portable. It means this could also be used outdoors too, something I’ve not tried yet but which I think would be lovely in full dark.This projector really comes into its own when used in the dark, sending beautiful and relaxing shimmering waves to ceilings and walls. It can be used with or without music, and automatically switches off after an hour, making it perfect for a gentle descent into sleep at bedtime. I’ve not seen these before but have had great fun with this, and think they are perfect for atmosphere setting, for romantic evenings and for those who find sleeping difficult and the gentle waves projected feel so relaxing. Combined with one of those natural sounds CD’s ( I have one and they work really well) you’ll soon be nodding off....Its in shades of  gentle blues, but I think you could use other transparent plastics in different colours taped over the top to add variety if wanted. Personally I love the blues, but a red transparent sheet would make ( I think – light may not be like paint)  purples or a yellow one to change it to greens....fun to try anyway and something I will be doing sometime.Product supplied for reviewStars: Five. Perfect for those who have sleep issues and for mood setting.  If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPO1E1RLI09T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z6G2DW6#wasThisHelpful","R3SPO1E1RLI09T","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rare Form, Descended of Dragons: Book 1, Jen CraneReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Sci-fi and fantasy.Well, this sounded great fun – and it was. Its something different from the norm, shape shifters, but in a kind of parallel dimension, and with others magics being used too. Its the first book in a new series and that’s always a difficult job, delivering a good story while introducing the reader to a new world and the people within it, and its a hard balance to get right. I felt the world setting here was great and its certainly one I want to read more of, but the actual storyline of this first part was a little simplistic for me. It had a very YA/NA feel to it; that’s not a bad thing, I enjoy a well written YA/NA at times but it did present a few frustrations for me as someone long past the YA range!! The storyline is really just one plot, about Stella’s heritage and I would have liked a bit deeper plot, or some sub plots working alongside it. For someone introduced to such a fantastical new world Stella is incredibly accepting. I know she felt a little “out” in her life and how she fitted in, but she had very few questions about something that surely must have gobsmacked her totally. Would she really have thrown everything up just like that without a few more questions? Maybe, maybe not?  The romance part too frustrated me, Stella seemed quite in-your-face to Rowan while he seemed to jump from hot to cold to hot again. I was disappointed in Livia (La-VEE-Yah) I had such hopes she was going to live up to the fantastic bit ch person she first presented, but somehow that never quite worked out – next book maybe? I hope so, I do so like a good “bad” person and she sounded perfect for the role, being involved with Rowan and clearly jealous of and disliking Stella already.It sounds like it’s all criticisms from me, and it’s not. There were some great characters, a good mix of the loyal, the conceited and the friendly types. I loved the way the people had evolved, with many showing parts of their magical heritage in their human appearance and natures. I loved the  Radix Citadel, the fabulous descriptions ( I could mentally picture the place), the magic involved, the premise of Stella learning about her history which served to make us readers aware of the background story too. I could feel the connection between Rowan and Stella right from the start, just wished they’d been more consistent. Somehow their relationship felt neither one thing or another. I note some reviews have remarked on the  dichotomy of the YA feel and the language and sexual implications. There is some bad language and sexual connotations here but I don't feel its really an issue, I still feel it fits well in the YA/NA range. It's one that’s deemed suitable for the upper end of the YA grouping, not the early teens ( though I wouldn’t worry about my 14 year old granddaughter reading this, there’s far more sexuality and bad language on TV daily!)Its a fun read, in a fresh new world and one I want to read more of. I see book two is out already, and am hoping that means Jen is one of those writers who turn out novels quickly, not keep us waiting months/years for more. This doesn't end on a cliff-hanger thank goodness, but at a natural break point leading the way into the next book. .As one who hates cliff-hangers a huge thanks to Jen for that!!Stars: Four, a fresh and interesting new world and a promising start to the series.  ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3APAGAE14E6QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116EHJIO#wasThisHelpful","R3APAGAE14E6QD","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rock Me Two Timesby Dawn RyderReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, First in Dawn Ryder’s sizzling new Rock Band series.  I really enjoyed it and will be keen to read more. I really enjoy the Band/Film star trope so seeing this I was keen to read and it was well worth the time. Syon is a real jerk at first, and I just couldn’t feel I was going to like him – and that’s a big issue for me....but as I continued and got to know him better I could see why he acted this way. Part is just going with the flow, rock star expectations and availability of limitless sex, and part seems to be a defence almost like doing something before he’s accused, and never getting involved more than the minimum needed for sex means he keeps himself closed off to emotions. He knows the groupies don’t want him, the real man, but the rock star persona that is a facade. Of course when he sees Kate and wants her he’s shocked at first that she doesn’t give in the ways the groupies always do, but there’s something between them and somehow he just can’t give in. The moves he makes to get her shock himself, and he questions his feelings and actions but he just can’t let her go.  Kate’s been disappointed by the fame thing before, when an ex found fame and treated her badly. Now she has her rules, no married men, no drugs, no rock/film stars. She’s firmly set on growing her business with her partner, the adorable Percy, who’s got a huge crush on Syon ( and the rest of the band it seems) and is strongly encouraging her to have a fling with him. Syon opens up a travelling costumer position for Kate - the band all wear leather, wear it hard and their wardrobe is in sad need of renovation. Its not just a sop position – image is all and they’re a very keen and ambitious group so sub par clothing isn’t acceptable to them. Kate is the best, and they want the best. She’s not keen on spending time in such close proximity but she can’t turn it down, it’ll be the making of her company, offering opportunities not to be missed, giving unparalleled publicity to it and designer rights after the tour and her job finishes. Its a shock to both of them how strong their feelings are, and they both fight making it more than just sex. Kate can’t deal with the insecurity of groupies and all that would bring, Syon can’t give up what he thinks makes him the person he is. Nevertheless he finds his attraction to others has waned, Kate is all he wants.  Its a fun read with some underlying plots involving other band members and people involved in the tour. Its quite a light read, not hard to follow and I’d guessed one of the main issues, but its still a fun read with some very sensual sex scenes. I really want to know more about Taz and his ex girlfriend – maybe he’s book two? I hope so ;- ) One thing: Spotted Dick. Its an old English dish, currants in a steamed suet pastry, origins from the 1800’s. Its not Custard, though its usually served with custard. To be honest it’s rarely seen on menus unless its a wartime or historical special. Calling it Custard is like calling a Big Mac a pickle..... and though we have lots of pub quizzes it’d be a pretty unusual prize!!Stars: Four and a half, not quite a five, a bit light for that but a really fun read, that I’d happily reread and look forward to more.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NG0T6X98BFSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SPAJ24#wasThisHelpful","R3NG0T6X98BFSZ","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Untamed, (Thoughtless 4) S.C. StephensReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, N/AThoughtless and the follow ups were among the first NA reads I found, and I loved them. Now its Griffins turn to show his story, and this book is written from his POV. That gave me  problems and to be honest I was getting really tired of reading just how Awesome he thought he was. I struggled though first half, got so fed up of Griffin, I don't remember him being that selfish and plain rude/obnoxious. I remember him as being arrogant, crude and overly sexual but devoted to the band, always making jokes, even if they were crude ones, and being a loud, larger than life but at heart good guy. Griffin here doesn’t seem to have any of those features apart from that he adores Anna and Gibson. He’s simply so rude, so selfish and self obsessed that I found the first 40% of the book really hard going, and has to restart several times where usually i read right through a book, time permitting of course. Then it started to pick up. It was clear he was frustrated and I did feel for him when he kept getting a flat No from the band, when they just wouldn’t even consider any of his suggestions – Ok, most of them were puerile but he could have been encouraged to take a larger role, to practise, to have lead for one song once he was good enough....but all he got was a No, so I understood when he felt he’d got as far as he could if they’d never consider him for more. His actions though – typical Griffin OTT, and even in the way he did it. From then on I got much more into the story and the last 30% was heart breaking, incredibly emotional and made the book for me. It had all the angst and emotion that make NA reads so gripping. I loved seeing how he changed, and how the others reacted to him. Anna was an absolute star here, and the ending was very surprising, satisfying but didn't take the safe, predictable route that would have been easier, instead we got more heartbreak and a chance for Griffin to finally show everyone the man he is, the man that's been hidden for so long, and that only Anna could see was waiting to come out. If only the start had been better it would have been a five star – as it is its a 2 for the fist part and a solid five for the last with a kind of 4 in the middle. .Stars: Its a 3.5 – 4. such a shame about that start IMO – still, it’ll work for many. I’m just disappointed that it didn’t for me. The last 40% was a very well deserved five. ...ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9LPJTHP5L739/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URUOJIM#wasThisHelpful","R9LPJTHP5L739","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"His Kind of Trouble, Terri AustinReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  romance,I loved Terri's first in this series, His Every Need, and at the end there was a sample of this one and I was keen to read. we see Monica a bit in the first book, now in this one we meet a different version of her, a more subdued, watered down Monica. what’s made her like this? Cal can’t believe how much she’s changed and he doesn’t feel its for the better. He thinks she’s existing now whereas the Monica he met was living life to the full.Cal is a great lead, hot and so full of life. He’s had his own issues though and reminds Monica too much of the bad boys she’s sworn off. Still, he’s hard to resist and eventually she gives in to his persistence, telling herself its just lust, sex and she’ll stop before getting hurt or letting her emotions get involved. Cal’s OK with that, he doesn’t do love, doesn’t do relationships and all the responsibility that comes with him. he likes his life as it is, with his business restoring old classic cars in the UK and his trust fund allowing him to take off anywhere in the world at whim. So, there they are, both really enjoying the very steamy and sensual sex, and kidding themselves that’s all it is...then life steps in, things go wrong and they’re forced to reassess. Monica in the first book was a happy, no holds barred, full on fun girl and she’s so changed. I wanted to know what happened and when it was revealed I felt so sorry for her. she’s forced herself into the mould of a person she really wasn’t, at the cost of her own happiness. Cal seems very “playboy” lightweight, and its how his family regard him, and yet as we get to know him he’s so much more and I really really wanted him and Monica to work things out. They were perfect for each other.There’s some snippets with Allie and Trevor in, and it was good to catch up with them. Its put me in the mood for a re read of their story. The books really complement each other, and as there’s a third sister, Brynn, I’m hoping she gets a story too – there’s a hint, I think anyway – of who might drop in to her life ;- )Its a fun read, hot and sexy, easy to follow, with some great characters and some very sensual and erotic sex scenes. the drama part was good too, nicely balanced with all the fun and happy parts. I need that contrast, the “down” part and find it makes the good parts even better. Without the balance for me its not a good read.Stars: Five, a sensual story without going OTT on the sex scenes. Its a great blend of sex and story, with neither dominating and that’s exactly what I need.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BTTC96EHUWZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0108GOLXW#wasThisHelpful","R1BTTC96EHUWZ3","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Fortunate Blizzard,  L.C. ChaseReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, LBGTQIA.I’ve enjoyed a few novels from L.C.Chase before so know I enjoy her writing style and this one sounded interesting.Its an unusual scenario with Trevor facing end stage kidney disease. Making a romance with someone terminally ill is tough, but LC does it and doesn’t go the obvious route either. Its touched on, but would have been just too cheesy, too unbelievable if that had worked out , so I’m glad she chose a different solution. That made the story better too because it drew in how Marc had been living, how he’d been letting his past issues with his mother dominate his life, and brought forward some other characters into the story. As Trevor says – and of course means – Life is for Living. When I was diagnosed with cancer, and told the outlook wasn’t good it made me think.  I saw and talked to other patients  for whom that phrase took on a new meaning, and it made me too look to what my priorities were in life. 20 years on I’ve relaxed a bit but still keep in mind how short life can be.  Its so easy to do as Marc was, work all hours, promising that “one day “ we’ll have time to do XYZ. That time isn’t always there, each hour, each day, each week that passes can’t be got back and given a do over, and so many discover like Trevor that the time they thought they still had could be severely reduced.The story is  a beautiful and  tender romance, and so realistic. Trevor is in a place so many others are ( and as an AB neg blood group I hope I’m never in his type of need) and meeting Marc seemed like a cruel twist of fate at first. Slowly though things fall into place, and even though we’re dealing with a sad issue there’s moments of lightness in it, snippets of beauty and a real feeling of satisfaction when I reached the ending. Its not a long read at 175 pages but one to savour and enjoy.  Stars: five, a great read, and a tender romance.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J07V5K1LH5KY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017GHTD3Y#wasThisHelpful","R1J07V5K1LH5KY","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Learning to Speak American,  Colette DartfordReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Women’s FictionWell, for a debut novel this is simply incredible. It kept me hooked to the page right to the end. It’s packed full of emotion and so, so realistic.To start with I felt so sorry for Duncan, he was trying so hard to help Lola with her depression since their young daughter died, but she was in a grey fog, drifting aimlessly, and not even trying. Then on a morning out while on holiday they come across a derelict property for sale. She’s enthused about it, it pulls to something in her and Duncan is so pleased he arranges to buy it. From there my opinions began to change, we leant more about them and see from the outside that each are dealing – or not dealing – in their own way. Duncan is buttoned up, refuses to talk about their daughter and throwing himself into getting Lola better. Hobbies, counselling, anything but letting her talk to him about her. Lola just wants to talk, not treat their daughter as if she didn’t exist, and over the two years since the accident they’ve drifted. I felt she was so cold to Duncan when he was trying so hard, I didn’t like her but as I knew more of her I saw another side. They’re still on holiday when the cottage purchase starts to bring her forward, and she responds to Duncan as she hasn’t in a long while. Their love life had fizzled out, Lola just wasn’t interested for so long and now it looks to be sparking alive again.Duncan’s having work issues too though, but he doesn't talk to Lola about them, and that harks back to his upbringing and the Stiff Upper Lip British way of men coping.  He’s very traditional, he spends long hours at work, never really switches off, he deals with money and bills, and Lola runs the home and her livery yard, which he treats as a kind of hobby. They live outside London and he has a long journey into work each day, and often stays over when work ends late. Things get worse for him at work when he loses an important contract, and the stress pushes him further into actions he rationalises as OK.Lola gets more and more involved in the new property and the people there. We can see slowly how what was supposed to bring them back together is having the opposite effect. I was really annoyed at Duncan, didn’t understand how he could reconcile his actions, how he could justify himself like that. Of course he’s doing what most people do, thinking up reasons to rationalise and excuse what we know isn’t right but what we want to do. He’s human not a saint! I felt for him even when I was angry at him. I felt for Lola finally coming out of her depression just as things as going so badly for Duncan and he’s keeping her in the dark about it all. He’s very old fashioned and the age difference between them leads him to treat her as if she’s a child in a way. If they’d just talked she could have helped...but then we wouldn’t have this fabulous story.Its a story that could happen to anyone, and so full of emotion. I so felt for both of them, was desperate for things to change for the better, for them to be happy. The death of a child is something no parent should have to deal with. I loved Treetops, the people around and involved in it. They felt so real, were so warm and welcoming even when they’d had their own issues. There’s some shocks here, things come out that no-one expects, and its a wonderful read. I’m a true romantic at heart, I want happy endings for everyone and here I got it. I finished it feeling very satisfied at the way things worked out, but it wasn’t at all as I’d thought it would be when I began reading....Stars: Five, an emotional journey and fabulous début book. . ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39UVM3B7QUJEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RG22DO#wasThisHelpful","R39UVM3B7QUJEM","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mudder Carbon Monoxide Alarm DetectorReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews There’s not too much to say about this, its a standard Carbon Monoxide alarm, and has a good loud noise to it. It doesn’t come with batteries so order those too so that soon as it arrives you can install it. It has good instructions for use, and has indicators to show low battery or – very important – if its malfunctioning. That's not something you want to find out too late! Pay attention to installation recommendations to get it in the appropriate place. No use having one if its blocked by curtains or sited by an air vent preventing it picking up dangerous gas levels. Our current device  is a free standing one in the kitchen, same as the gas boiler, and is on top of a tall fridge on the opposite side of room as advised by the Engineer. I’m going to use this one in the living room where we now have a wood burner.Carbon Monoxide is a silent killer. I’ve had an alarm  in the kitchen for years. Our boiler is there and when servicing it the Gas Engineer recommended  one a few years back. I mentioned we had of those visible ones but as he said, if its in the night you won’t be looking and do you check it daily? It a small price to pay for safety. A friend some time back had been suffering from headaches and discovered, in time fortunately, that it was due to carbon monoxide from an appliance that wasn’t working correctly. If you’re going abroad why not take one with you – we’ve all seen those tragic reports of kids and families dying because safety isn’t always as good as it could when it comes to servicing appliances. I’ve copied the below info from the B&Q website – its simple practical advice.What is carbon monoxide (CO)?Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a colourless, tasteless and odourless gas that can cause harmful and potentially fatal effects.Carbon monoxide is produced by the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, such as gas. This can occur in inadequately maintained or badly fitted domestic heating appliances, such as boilers and gas fires. If your flue or chimney is blocked, CO will be unable to escape your home if produce, allowing a dangerous concentration to quickly build up.If carbon monoxide escapes into your home it will cause symptoms that include headaches, breathlessness, drowsiness, vomiting, chest pains, dizziness, vision problems and eventually collapse and loss of consciousness – which can easily be confused with, or misdiagnosed as, flu, fatigue or food poisoning. Be aware of the symptoms and be prepared to react if you recognise them in yourself or others.Reducing the riskWhen was the last time your boiler was serviced? Ensuring that your gas appliances are installed and regularly serviced by Gas Safe Registered engineers is the first step to safety within your home. Landlords are legally obliged to have an annual gas safety check completed in every property they let - and should provide tenants with a copy of the certificate.Install a carbon monoxide alarm in your home. The sensing technology in a carbon monoxide detector accurately measures the levels of CO and the time of exposure, and is designed to sound before carbon monoxide levels become threatening.Where to install carbon monoxide (CO) detectorsIt’s important to note that your carbon monoxide detector will not detect smoke - you will need a separate smoke alarm for this purposeCarbon monoxide detectors should be installed in every room that contains a fuel burning appliance. You can install them in other rooms to ensure adequate warning is given for occupants in other areas of your home - such as in rooms where people sleep.Install your detector at a horizontal distance of between 1 and 3m from the potential source.

"Herb Grinder Large 3.0"" Kingtop Weed Spice Tobacco Grinder 4 Piece Zinc Alloy BlackReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews This arrived well packed along with some other items in a secure box.It comes in its own box, making it the perfect gift for a smoker who does their own tobacco  ( I'll pass on the weed reference!) or keen cooks who want to gring herbs and spices. Its a solid piece, heavy and very robust and feels it will last years. It comes apart easily for cleaning, and fits well when in use, making the grinding movement easy.Not being a smoker I tried it for grinding up some spices. Its easy to use, I just shook gently until all the spices had settled in-between the grinding teeth. Then added the lid and swivelled it back and forth till spices through to next section. It left them quite coarse but if I wanted them finer they can be run through a few more times. I also tried some dried bay leaves I had to hand, and they ground up far easier than trying to crumble them. You could make specific herb/spice blends for teas or marinades, casseroles etc with this and keep in jars ready to use.Product supplied for reviewStars: Five. Quick and easy to use. If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OBKHEWDWQTV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOVKLKY#wasThisHelpful","R1OBKHEWDWQTV7","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Angel After Dark,  Kahlen AymesReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, EroticaWell, my biggest disappointment of this book was that is a trilogy...I didn’t realise that, had thought it was one of those where the series consists of connected books, the ones where a couple in the first book become the mainstay of book two and a couple from there make book three but each book is standalone. Luckily books two and three are out, and fortunately not expensive. That’s the upside – I can carry on ( soon as I have time from review reads) with the story while its still fresh. I like to read duos/trilogies back to back, waiting months, years even for some I lose the momentum and there’s never the same impact.Anyway, moving on, the book: Two terrific characters, both very intelligent, hardworking, Alpha types and neither want emotional attachment for reasons personal to them. When they first set eyes on each other sparks shimmer between them, but circumstances mean they don’t actually get to meet till six months on. By then Angel has some preconceived ideas about Alex, via his “girlfriend” who phones into her show. Even though its clear her story is very one sided Angel still thinks Alex is an arrogant jerk, and TBH he doesn’t do much at first to change that opinion. Somehow, by a bit of bribery by way of donation to her favourite charity, and encouragement on her part from her friend who thinks Alex is drop dead gorgeous and worth a fling with, they have one date, that leads to another and another. Soon they’re steaming up the sheets and there’s some sizzling sexual tension between them.Its not just a romance though, hot though it is, there’s more going on. Alex is concerned about Angels job, she’s had a couple of incidents in the past where her decisions have been unwelcome by those convicted, and now she’s embroiled in a very nasty case where everyone feels the guy is guilty but he’s clever, knows what to say, how to get round her tests and looks to get away with it. Angel is determined he won’t but then things start getting dangerous, with threats to her and her friends....Alex is scared for her safety, its clear she’s been contacted and threatened, he’s there for some of it, but she can’t discuss it with him, simply reassures him she’ll be fine, can take care of herself. He’s an alpha too though and by now she’s more than just someone he wants to teach a lesson to, he can’t sit back and do nothing while she’s under threat. I was expecting things to begin to wrap up by 80%, and of course when it didn’t look that way that's when I began to suspect more books. I feel its quite a sudden, abrupt ending, though there isn’t always a neat stopping point in trilogies. I do think if books are not standalone that needs to be made very, very clear upfront, but as I said at least the next part of this is out...Its got some great side characters too, not just Alex and Angel, and a plot that’s going to be really interesting, but I did feel at times this dragged, felt a bit as though it was filling space more than moving things on. Still, its well worth reading if you want a hot, sensual story with some decent plots behind it, a book that’s more than just a romance.Stars: Four, excellent start to the trilogyARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECRA8K033551/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCK1TZQ#wasThisHelpful","RECRA8K033551","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Racing Hearts, Melissa WestReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance,Well, I’m a sucker for anything involving horses and this had some great reviews...sadly having struggled through it – to the point I nearly abandoned it a few times – its not one for me. There’s nothing actually wrong with it, except that it just didn’t move me, I felt indifferent at best to the characters and annoyed at worst.Horses? A book about racing that’s what you’d expect, yes? Except you’d be wrong. There’s one horse, just one, in a few scenes with a mention of a couple of others. No stables scenes  or horse training, of life in a busy top training yard. No evidence of owners, jockeys, yard boys and girls, no horse related issues – nothing. That’s a big disappointment for me, I expected the story to be set around that kind of background, but we see more of the inside of the two town cafe/bakeries that the yard life. The cover should have tipped me off ;- )Then there’s Emery, and I understood her issues at first when she was just 17 but she’s 25 now – time to stand up to her dad, not keel over and hide like a naughty ten year old. I didn’t really understand the issues stopping her and Trip first time round, why he didn’t tell her at least, why neither tried to contact each othe,r and now eight years on they’re still letting it hold them back. Argghhh, grow a back bone people.Emery had a bad accident – hey its racing it happens all the while. As Him Indoors likes to tell me over and over, horses and accidents go together, but he knows, if they’re in your blood that doesn’t stop you. Jockeys though take it further, hide broken bones so they can race, and get back up with sprains, bruises, concussions as if its nothing. I’m not that tough. Emery boke her leg, I broke my hip ( falling out of a wheelchair, not even on my horse, just moving the electric fence for them) I was advised not to ride for a year, and that it takes 18 months for long bones like legs to heal fully. Emery though, a top jockey, hasn’t even sat on a horse for two years...is still using a walking stick and yet expects Trip and the horses owner to let her ride him? Why? He’s a multi million dollar horse, hard to handle, giving experienced jockeys an issue, and if she doesn’t handle it that could cost them all $$$$$$$$s What makes her think they should even consider the risk? She’s not putting herself out, hasn’t even kept up her fitness, and it takes a lot of stamina to control an animal of that size. That was just so unreal I was eye rolling when she asked, and gobsmacked at the result.....So, the horse side, a let down and unbelievable when it did happen, the romance – they were like pre-schoolers in how they acted, even though the tension and sexuality between them sizzled really well on the page. The final straw for me was the feud between the two ladies and the way the town all rallied or otherwise. Wasn’t there anything more important going on? I know small town politics likes to blow things up – its the same here in UK, but this was just too OTT for me.All in all sadly a book that I had high hopes for was a fail for me, but the high reviews mean its not for others – another example of how we all want different things from our reading, so read the sample, read reviews and make up your own mind. Stars: Two, a good book potentially that for me just didn’t work.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HQ1N4H6FJT9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3JZCSW#wasThisHelpful","R3HQ1N4H6FJT9J","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paint Brush Holder - Organizer with Space for 15 Long Handle Brushes - Premium Art Supplies by MyArtscape (Black) Review from Jeannie’s Product Reviews  This arrived well packed along with some other items in a secure box. As an artist I’m always interesting in art equipment so was delighted to get this case for review. Brushes can be very expensive so whether you’ve bought a set from suppliers like MyArtscape, or like me have amassed an individual collection over time you want to take the best care of them. This organiser allows them to be kept securely protecting those important brush ends, and being made of a breathable material ( feels like heavy cotton) helps stop mould developing. It comes in a choice of colours and is very good value. The case itself is very robust, well finished and with a sturdy zip closer and looks very durable. It can be adjusted when in use to set the brushes up an an angle ready to select each one. Its also a good idea ( IMO) if possible to leave them out like this for a couple of hours after painting to let them dry thoroughly. Brushes cost and need taking care of. Product supplied for review Stars: Five.These would make a great gift for any artist. If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews. ","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTUZ83O0T8CMH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W3KOQ6#wasThisHelpful","RTUZ83O0T8CMH","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Detail Paint Brush Set - 12 Miniature Brushes for Fine Detailing & Art Painting - Acrylic, Watercolor, Oil - for Miniatures, Models, Model Airplane Kits, Warhammer 40k - Quality Supplies by MyArtscape™ Review from Jeannie’s Product Reviews  This arrived well packed along with some other items in a secure box. As an artist I’m always interesting in art equipment so was delighted to get these for review. Handy little detail set containing twelve versatile brushes. The kit includes Rounds, Liners and Flats making them ideal for model painting. son number 1 used to be a huge Warhammer fan, and he and his friends had loads of those little models that they’d painted. this brush set would be perfect for that.  I like that the tips of the rounds ones come easily to a point making them excellent for sharp lines and definition. That’s very important. The flats and liners gave a good sharp outline, and all the brushes picked up the paint well. As with anything you get what you pay for, and these aren’t going to be as good as pure sable brushes that can cost as much as this set ( or more!) for just one brush, but for most artists these are excellent value and produce very decent quality results. I use watercolours and keep my very few sables for those, never for oils or acrylics because they can be hard on brushes, especially if like me you tend to work large and use texture. I’ve shown on a chart some quick ad hoc  experiments I did with these with watercolour paint against my round sable brush and a good quality square end brush, and you can see there’s very little difference. ( To be fair my brushes have also been heavily used, I'm an enthusiastic artist and my poor brushes get some harsh treatment, so the sable is showing signs of wear at the tip). I’d be happy to use these brushes for my artworks. The sellers also gave me some useful brush care FAQ.Q: What should I do when I get my set?A: Always wash your brushes with warm water and a mild soap before using them for the first time. The brushes are coated with a water-soluble treatment for their protection during transit. Washing them will remove the coating and prepare them for their first use.Q: How should I clean my brushes?A: Wipe off excess paint from the brush using a towel or ragRinse off the remaining oil paint with odourless thinner or mineral spirits.Rinse off the remaining acrylic/watercolour paint with lukewarm water and mild soap.Repeat washing and rinsing the brush until the water runs clear.Shake or wipe off excess water.Using your fingers, gently reshape the brush head back into its original form.Dry the brush, handle and ferrule by using a brush stand or the provided holder. Then store them in the holder.Q: How can I lengthen the lifespan of my brushes?A: Always clean your brushes immediately after use.Never allow paint to dry on the brushes.Never leave the brushes soaking in water for a long time.Never stand the brushes on their heads. Product supplied for review Stars: Five. these would make a great gift for people who paint in fine detail or paint game models If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews. ","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39QJOW199QP92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QLOJ3G#wasThisHelpful","R39QJOW199QP92","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" Wicked Release,  Katana CollinsReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Erotica.When I read Wicked Exposure I hadn’t realised there was a prequel novel, Wicked Shots. I loved it anyway and have since read Shots ( It was free on Kindle), and seeing the story from the beginning helped make sense of it. There are numerous characters here and all connected in different ways so its easy to get confused. Still the story races along, with hot sex, a little BDSM, and a cracking adventure that kept me guessing. I went through a number of different guesses as to “who dunnit” but got it wrong each time, and kept changing my mind as the story advances. I loved Jess, she’s been through so much and still secrets and shocks keep hurtling up on her. She’s feeling like the sister she thought she knew was really a very different person....then there’s Sam. He’s been carrying a huge secret too, and I so felt for both of them when it came out. There’s so much going on here, the drugs issue and who is behind it, is the BDSM ring connected or just a convenient cover,then there's the murders of Cass and the doctor, and as the story continues there’s even more danger being exposed.   It becomes clear that whoever is behind things wants Jess out, but she can’t let Cass’ murder go free, can’t let the drugs ring continue, and what she doesn’t know is there is even more going on that any of them realise. Its a complete surprise on several fronts at the end from who is ultimately behind things to who is working for different sides. That ending too...what a shock, had me completely fooled!  Is a fabulous read, breathtakingly paced and full of surprise and sensuality – a solid romantic suspense and one  loved.Stars: Five, a great finish to a fabulous series.

"Grave New Day, (Jess Vandermire, Vampire Hunter Book 3), Lina GardinerReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Sci-fi and FantasyWell, I hadn’t read book one, enjoyed book two, though with some reservations and was keen to get to this one. Sadly for me there’s one major flaw that makes it a three star. Its well written as was book two, full of great characters and fun plots but – and its a huge issue for me – I hate when characters get some unheard of mysterious new powers right at the moment they need them :-( This book is really based so much on that happening, it occurs in one of the characters throughout, and to Jess at one point. (I didn’t Jess’ choice quite as the description suggests,  but it does make her think about what she needs to be for herself v what she needs to be to continue to fight for others. ) I like to see characters fight it out, winning by the skin of their teeth using the powers and skills we already know about. To me getting new ones just when needed is a cop out. Its a personal issue and one many readers aren’t bothered about, they simply accept it and enjoy the story, but sadly I can’t. It impact in a major way how I feel about things. This was the problem that didn’t make for a great read for me.I did like that there was a continuation of a storyline that was left open at the end of the last book, something really sad happened but was left so that maybe, just maybe there could be some good come from it. Its kind of hard to write without giving things away, but I do love it when it gets this result. I love Regent, he’s so loyal to Jess, worked so hard over the years and still the Church gives him grief, but of course they don’t know, can’t know what he’s been doing. He’s such a strong Christian, so unwavering in his faith and I love that he answers to God only, not the church officials...well, that’s how he seems to me anyway. Jess as always is a puzzle, so strong, almost cold appearing on the outside and yet inside she’s such a moral, do the right thing, always person trying to save everyone from evil. Her friends though know her true side, and I really admire her. She’s had a tough life but worked hard to make the best of it despite the cost to herself. I didn’t like the idea of – I’ve forgotten his name, Kier? – who kept popping up just when needed. I guess that relates to my dislike of the new powers things too....It was just too timely, too convenient. It wasn’t him as a character I disliked, just the way he worked in the story. It was an interesting and unusual storyline but for me the way it played out just didn’t work.Stars: Three, a good storyline but the way it worked out irritated me at times. ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6EMRZM6R7YQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GEAN26#wasThisHelpful","R2E6EMRZM6R7YQ","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"  Black As Night, (Quentin Black Mystery 2), by J.C. Andrijeski Review from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Fantasy  and Sci-fi,  ParanormalI loved the first in this series, and this one lives up to that great start. Its got the same terrific world building and characters as the Allie’s War series, but is lighter in feel. I love that I feel I “know” this kind of world and the character types because of all the info in AW, but if you’re new to it JCA gives enough info for the reader to keep up, understand the human/seer dynamics and characteristics without boring those who already understand it. A tough thing to do but JCA pulls it off and delivers a fabulous story once again.Like before the main dynamic is Miri and Black. She’s angry he’s left her along for over a month, no contact, nothing after all his promises and indications he wanted more from her, and then out of the blue one of his weird calls. He needs her Now in Bangkok, and is sending a car for her in 10 mins, and his assistant ( well one of them) has already packed her case, cancelled her clients etc. Typical Black style, when he wants something done he makes it happen.Miri is furious, tired, jet-lagged when they meet and yet that charisma, that pull to him, gets her straightaway, and soon as they’re alone he’s kissing her furiously in that intense Seer way that pulls at her insides. There’s a killer to find though, traps to lay, a child to be rescued and Miri soon gets embroiled in the drama more than either of them expected. She’s in some real danger here. Warning: This part gets graphic, and is very violent. It didn’t bother me, I saw it as essential to the storyline but for those that have issues take care. JCA pulls the reader right into her  stories and here I could feel Miri’s attack, feel her hurt and despair. She’s tough though and won’t give up. Black of course is distraught, furiously pulling strings everywhere trying to find her. He’s a very wealthy man but there are things money can’t buy.Its an exciting, gripping story, a solid tale backing up another incredibly sensuous story. Its not one of those sex every other page reads so many stories deliver, but one where a kiss can be more sensual and erotic that out and out in your face sex of so many reads. Its the emotions that come with the actions that do it for me in these books. Its as if they are erotic by accident almost, that their action within the storyline add that edge of sensuality. Some stories try so hard it seems forced but here its just Is, it feels natural and right for the characters.  I love the culture differences between Miri and Black. She’s part Seer but until very recently thought she was – just as she thought everyone was – human. She still thinks in the way she’s always been brought up, whereas Black thinks like  a Seer, after all he’s been one for many many years! Sex to them is something essential, necessary and almost an everyday thing. He doesn’t understand Miri’s reaction when after no contact for so many weeks she’s upset when his first actions are to kind of jump her, and tell her how much, how desperate he is to f uck her.....he says it like its a kind of compliment and she’s just stunned, shocked. She wants the explanations first and he’s trying to persuade her he can tell it better through sex....poor Miri, and poor Black too! You can see so many times how they float on the edge of emotional disaster simply because they don’t understand the others actions and reactions. Like USA v GB, countries divided by a common language for them its Seers v Humans, divided by culture where the same thing means different things to each. Like Miri I’d be jealous, be wondering, given the way women seem to give Black the come on constantly, and that she’s finally coming to understand just how open they are about sex.It all comes to a head in an exciting finish where its impossible to work out what’s going to happen because it changes constantly, minute by minute it seems with Black making plans on the fly and adapting them just as quickly. Its tough fighting an enemy who can get in your head, read your thoughts and plans....A great read, one for the keepers and I’m looking forward to book three.  Stars: Five, an exciting mystery with the spice only a Seer can bring!ARC supplied by AuthorIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful. ","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23EOFKUEX91JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016YPLLA2#wasThisHelpful","R23EOFKUEX91JX","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shifter Planet,  D.B. ReynoldsReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance,Well, I’ve read and re read all of Debbie’s Vampires of America series so when I saw she’d a new series out ( at least I hope its a series) it was a cert that I’d want to read it.I don’t usually go for the space type sci-fi, but this isn’t all trailing endlessly through space, but concentrates on one planet Harp, where people from Earth took up habitation some 500 or so years ago. I was fine with the space bit in that context, and it allowed some new and unusual issues to arise. Amanda is a great lead, strong and independent but tired of living on a spaceship – she was born on one and has lived in space ever since. When they land on Harp for what should be a brief visit, she’s amazed that she can hear the trees singing – and it seems no-one else can....and she wants to stay, to find out more, to live with her feet on the earth ( well Harp earth anyway ) for a while.There are Shifters here, all males, all very Alpha, and its one of the things the Harpers keep quiet about to strangers. They’re in the minority of the population with the others being called Norms. Amanda seems to bridge the two – she can hear trees, which Norms can’t, but she’s female and cant shift. She takes up an apartment in town and starts exploring, but there’s a massive secret hidden from her, and when she discovers it she becomes a target and her life is in danger. The delicious Rhodry gets involved too, and the two have a long and perilous journey involving natural dangers and those made by jealous individuals, that brings them close to death several times.Its a fun read, quite simple in plot and most of the book covers this journey, but sets out politics and ways forward for more books – well, that’s what I hope. I didn’t love it as much as V of A, but it’s a first book and they often struggle with introducing a new world, set in the future here in the 4000’s and giving us a plot to start the series off. It felt a bit light for me even though the dangers were real and played out well, no superpowers found off the cuff, but good old fashioned slog and training! One of my pet hates is when characters get out of a scrape by some new unheard of superpower and Debbie doesn’t do that either here or in V of A.Its a great start and I’ll be looking for more books but hoping they get a little more complex now the setting had been introduced to us.Stars: Four, a little denser plots and this series will be a five for me. ...ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S0NB4U85D8NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WBFNVM#wasThisHelpful","R1S0NB4U85D8NI","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tonor USB Professional Condenser Sound Podcast Studio Microphone For PC Laptop Computer Upgraded Version - Plug and play, BlackReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews This arrived well packed along with some other items in a secure box. It comes in its own very smart display box. It comes in three colour choices, and we tested the black one. That looks very smart. Its very lightweight so easy to take where you want.  As it’s plug and play I expected it to do just that, I plugged it in but nothing seemed to happen...I’m not great with tech though and didn’t know whether there was a way of checking or doing a manual install. I thought maybe there was a conflict with something else. I contacted sellers who were very helpful and emailed me some useful info leaflets, but they were for windows XP, 7, 8 vista etc and I have win 10 ( and updating to that has caused me horrific problems but that’s another story...). I was still stuck, but luckily I knew Son number 2 was  soon visiting with his two children who happily played around, found it had installed automatically, no extras needed. I just didn’t recognise what the name of it was. ( Why doesn’t software have simple names like Logictech cordless mouse, Samsung phone, Tonor microphone etc instead of weird random letters and numbers that mean nothing to us none tech people!)They connected a freestanding speaker to the pc,  as my pc ones don’t work , opened https://online-voice-recorder.com/ and the kids were soon having fun singing and talking and listening back to it. Most people probably don’t need to use that, it says nothing extra needed but my pc is old and this seemed the easiest way.  We set the tripod and mic up on my desk top next to PC and it was fine there. The tripod flexibility allows for the mic to be positioned wherever most convenient.  If you feel the tripod might get knocked you could always use a bit of blu-tac or similar to hold it firm.  The mic can be used in the tripod for hands free or taken out and held closer to mouth if wanted. We tried both ways and found it worked fine either way.For the price I think its great, its simple to install for most people – I am a real tech loser so don;t take my experience as typical - and great fun for kids. It’s useful for adding voices to videos, for karaoke type games and parties, for dictating articles for typing later etc....You get what you pay for and I think for £15 this is value for money. Its clear enough for most occasions, if you need specific clarity then maybe you need a more expensive mic, but for most issues this should be fine. Certainly we found it very clear, little interference, and easy to use once it was set up.I noticed a couple of reviews had similar issues re installing, all I can say is that I found the sellers very helpful when I contacted them, and very quick to respond. It would be useful to have an on/off switch though that’s my only criticism.   Product supplied for reviewStars: FiveIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KA4W67642CEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01142EPO4#wasThisHelpful","R3KA4W67642CEK","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Solar Lanterns, FREETOO Inflatable Solar LED Light with 3 Lighting Modes, Water-proof Design, 6-12h Battery Life (1000mAh), and Carabiner as Gift Included (Cube)Review from Jeannie’s Product Reviews  This arrived in it’s own sturdy cardboard box, with other items in a larger box.Its a really useful idea for outside use being completely enclosed so its very waterproof. I haven’t tried floating it on water but the description says it an be used that way, I guess if you’re out boating or fishing or something that’s good to know. Drop it in the water and it’ll be fine to retirve, and of course the air will let it float too. Its inflatable so it comes flat and you blow it up similar to kids armbands – It takes a lot of blowing to fully inflate, well – with me and Him Indoors doing it did anyway...maybe we’re just lacking puff ;-) or unfit. It came partially charged and being solar powered I simply left it on the windowsill to fully charge. It means if you leave it out it’ll always be charged. Even packed away it holds charge for some time and is quick to recharge. Its very light, takes up little space when deflated, and can hang up when used to get maximum light. Handy for outdoors camping and caravanning and for power cuts emergency lighting or to take and keep in the car ready for use. Its got two light settings and a flashing on/off sequence, useful for emergencies when you need to catch attention. Its easy to switch on and off, simply press the central red button, once for on, once more for bright, once more for flash and once again for off.

" Christmas Ever After,  Sarah MorganReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance,Women’s FictionI wish I’d read the earlier reads – this was such a great book, and I’d like to know more of the other two couples. I didn’t realise it was part of a connected group when I requested it – that didn’t actually matter as Sarah gives enough info for new readers like me to keep up, without boring those who already know the story. I know when I’m reading a later book in a series the last thing I want is precious pages used up recapping events in detail for those new to the series, and here I think Sarah has got the balance just right.Skylar, on the surface a rich girl who has it all, popular parents, fabulous career, successful and wealthy boyfriend and yet...underneath all that she’s lonely. Her parents expect their children to fit a mould suitable to her father's position, and art doesn’t meet their criteria so that’s always a battle, with them waiting for her to get a “proper” career. Her boyfriend turns out to be  - well, not right for her... She’s got two long term loving friends who live on Puffin Island who save her sanity thankfully, and though they are unable to come to the opening of her latest show in London they make Alec go. He’s friends with their other halves, but he and Skylar have never hit it off, they’re best kept away from each other. He thinks she’s a spoiled princess playing at art, and she thinks he’s an arrogant and aloof man.Events happen that change things, we see another side to both Alec and Skylar, and I feel a little in love with both of them, understanding them much more.  I just loved the time on Puffin Island and seeing the rest of their friends. That’s where I realised there were more books and what made me want to read them.I thought this would be a light and fluffy read and to a degree it was, but it had some solid emotion, and the kind of problems many people face, family issues and expectations, career choices, and just the problems from everyday life. They all felt so real to me and I was sad to leave them. Its a perfect read for when you want a romance that’s not too dramatic, but full of fun and emotion, and a read to relax with.  BTW: Alec’s gran – I loved her! Stars: five, another winner. ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers.If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EBA80OTPCEJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1M9C06#wasThisHelpful","R2EBA80OTPCEJU","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Infuser Water Bottle, Mudder Large 32 Oz Sport Fruit Infused Water BottleReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews I’m not great on fruit flavoured waters as I find commercial ones taste over sweet and artificial, however with this you have just that hint of whatever fruit you add, and its far better. Its not a heavy flavour, just a slight infusion. I tried it with orange and apple slices. You could also add things like peppermint leaf or lemon balm too – adding the whole leaves on the stalk if you grow it, means it’ll stay in the container.I like that the plastic is eco friendly Tritan plastic and Food-Grade silicone– who wants to make a healthy drink that picks up toxins from the bottle....The makers say its shatterproof and it certainly feels robust. At a huge 32oz its a great size to take out a drink to last the day. It has a handle to hook it up nearby so its always to hand, and is designed to fit most car cup holders. Its got a secure extra latch to ensure it stays closed and doesn't leak. That’s important!  Its easy to clean with a very wide neck and it coming totally apart, and though I don’t have a dishwasher ( ah, don’t you feel for me...) it’s great for busy families that do.Product supplied for reviewStars: Five[...]   ","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJL5QH88UIPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140SVIMQ#wasThisHelpful","R1SJL5QH88UIPK","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Personally I feel leaving them to hang up ( on the string connected to them) between use is more than adequate..Q: How do I use my sponge?A: Soak the Konjac Sponge with warm water until soft and fully expanded. Then carefully press it between your palms to expel excess water. Gently massage your face in a circular motion, while avoiding rubbing sensitive areas too harshly. See here for full instructions: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91nCSzaDbPL._SL1500_.jpgQ: What should I do with it after use?A: When finished, gently squeeze the sponge between your palms to fully expel the water. Never wring the sponge, this can damage the delicate fibers and cause it to fall apart. Hang the sponge in a well-ventilated area to dry it. Do not leave your sponge in a humid place, such as the shower. To prolong their life, you can also store your sponge in a container in the refrigerator.Q: What do the different sponge colours mean?A: Some of our sponge sets come with different coloured sponges. While the sponges have the same basic functionality, the different coloured sponges are best suited to particular skin types. Natural White is for sensitive or baby skin, Green Tea is to rejuvenate damaged and weary skin, Charcoal Black is for oily or acne-prone skin.Q: Do I need to use a cleanser?A: Our sponge is naturally cleansing - you do not need to use a cleanser. However, you may also prefer to use a small amount of your favorite cleanser. Remember, a little goes a long way!Q: I am worried about bacteria in my sponge. What can I do?A: You can easily disinfect it by soaking the sponge in hot (not boiling) water for 3-5 minutes. Using boiling water can deform and damage the sponge. Remember to drain the water and let the sponge cool before handling it.Q: When should I change my sponge?A: With proper care, you should get at least 2-3 months use. At this point the sponge may start to disintegrate and should be replaced. It is fully biodegradable and can be safely composted. Chop it up and mix it into potting soil to help retain moisture in your pots!Q: Can the sponge be consumed by myself or my pets?A: Absolutely not!

"Brighter Than the Sun, A Charley Davidson Novella Darynda Jones Review from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Fantasy,  ParanormalIf you haven’t read the Charley Davison series you’re missing a real treat. It a mix of humour and pathos, prophecies and adventure, mysteries and murders, fantastic characters – human and not so human – and a sensual, searing passion that transcends time. Literally as Reyes, Son of Satan, changed his fate to be with Charley.Who is Charley? Well, she’s the Grim Reaper, she helps people pass, can see ghosts and runs her own PI agency, with the help of Cookie, her scatty BFF and a few ghostly sidekicks. she’s an amazing woman, incredibly generous spirited, loyal, warm hearted, funny,  and a total magnet for danger. Reapers don’t usually survive long on Earth, but Reyes is determined to change that and has the ability to drop in to her life incorporeally. He’s saved her a number of times now and she doesn’t yet realise it. Reyes thought he’d grow up with Charley but plans, even those of the Son of Satan, go awry and he ends up with the most horrific childhood. This book tells us more of his journey so far, more of what we’ve gleaned from Charley's stories, and we see things from his side, from his first sight of Charley being born, his awful, tragic childhood, his sister Kim and long time friend Amador, he gives us the story right up to where he’s comatose and in danger of the life support being switched off. That’s when Charley finds him, I think that was about book two, maybe three.If you haven’t read the main books read them first, find out what is so special about Charley that the Son of Satan falls in love with her, goes against his fathers plans and spends his life trying to be with her, drawn in to her Light that he describes as being brighter than the sun. Its a fabulous read, a terrific insight into the mind of the man Charley loves, who we usually see only from her viewpoint or in tiny glimpses from his.This is a wonderful series and one I bought, not a review series!! Paid out Real Money ;-) Its one for my keepers file and the books are excellent value, being really full of story, of plots that keep the reader guessing, and some terrific humour to lighten the sadess of the murders and attacks that surround Charley. As we've got to later books things from the earlier ones that puzzled me have come clear. I haven't actaully read book eight yet, its on my kindle waiting for book nine to come out, so I can read them back to back, because this one ends on a doozy of a cliff hanger and I know I need to be able to read what happens in the next book. Fortunately Darynda doens't keep readers waiting years for next in series!  Stars: Five, a great addition to the series. If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8GQ7OYFS78Z6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PIFCB8#wasThisHelpful","R8GQ7OYFS78Z6","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OZ Naturals Eye Treatment Gel For Dark Circles, Puffiness & Wrinkles- Contains Haloxyl For Dark Circles, Caffeine For Puffiness, Hyaluronic Acid For Moisturizing, Matrixyl Synthe'6 for Wrinkles, & Apple Stem Cells - Guaranteed To Help Your Eyes Look Younger & Brighter Than Ever!Review from Jeannie’s Product Reviews  I’ve had a few products from Oz Naturals now and they’ve all been excellent. One really important thing for me is animal testing and these carry a Cruelty Free logo, and also looking after the environment by minimising artificial chemical use. Look up the company website if you want more info, they’ve some really useful stuff there.There’s a logic to the ingredients that appeals to me – no miracle stuff, just working with nature and that seems sensible. Its a gel that  comes in a pump dispenser, no jars to dip into potentially leaving germs behind, and that’s something I always like to see. It has a thickish semi transparent white appearance  and is easily absorbed into skin. Its expensive but you need very little. It seems to be fragrance free, certainly I couldn’t smell anything so no worries about perfume clashes.  Although its aimed at eye area it can be used all over face, as I've been doing. I’ve sensitive skin but have had no issues in using this, and it leaves my skin feeling pleasantly moisturised, not tight and angry as some creams do.  Product supplied for review Stars: Five If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews.    ","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XQ86R8FZRH2T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZTT260#wasThisHelpful","R2XQ86R8FZRH2T","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apexel 20x HD Macro Lens Universal Clip for iPhone Samsung Galaxy Note LG HTC BlackReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews I was really impressed with how well this is packaged. The lens and clip come in a shaped, dense foam protective unit within a cardboard outer so its very safe. Its very easy to attach to your phone, simply clip lens into holder and slip over top of phone – even it the case I keep my phone in this was fine. I've a Samsung mini S3.I’m a keen very amateur photographer and enjoyed using my trusty Fuji-finepix for years, but its quite bulky and I love the spur of the moment pics. So with phone cameras getting better and better over the last few years I use my phone mostly, as its always with me.I’ve a large garden so love to take images every time I’m out, of whatever catches my eye. Right now its lots of fungi, colour changes of leaves, cobwebs strung with pearly raindrops etc...there’s always something every day. What I miss though is the macro settings of my camera so was really keen to try out one of these.I found it needs lots of practice, my indoor shots were too dark and if I used flash I had too many shadows. Maybe a way round that with practice/knowledge of course? Still, by moving objects to where there was good natural light I got some far better results. Then I moved outside yesterday, a sunny day but damp. I found I needed to get really close to subject, but too close and my breath moved it and set it swinging, and at this close that created lots of blur! That can be an effect you want sometimes though – no knowledge is ever wasted. The raindrops got on the lens at one point too...I found I needed to really play around with how close to get for different things, and to work out light source etc. but given its so easy to take as many as you want on digital and edit later, that just made it more fun!I really enjoyed using this and its something I’m gong to keep close for future use. I’ve shown the results of some of my playing yesterday, and you can see just how fun it is. If you know more about photography than me then of course you’d do better, but for most of us this is a gadget well worth the money if you want some great close up images.

" Rain Shadow, A Bluewater Bay Novel,  LA WittReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, LGBTQIA I love the Bluewater series, love LA Witt’s writing and yet with this book I never really connected. It was a good story, very real characters with problems any one of us could have regardless of sexuality – and I love that feeling of realism so I really don’t know why I didn’t feel more for this story? Its a puzzle, its got all the elements I love but I felt a bit detached somehow. I did like seeing other characters from the series and earlier books, even if it was only a reference to them – it reminded me of them and their stories.I did feel for Jeremy over his kids reactions, and yet knowing teens ( been one, had them!) its hard not to feel for them too. They’re all about themselves, how everything affects them, its a sort of Rite of teen years. Of course whatever Jeremy and his wife tried to do would have been wrong. They tried their best and that’s all you can do. Sometimes there are no right answers, Life if messy like that. I felt for Scott too with his past, and his inability to let go of it...I could see why Jeremy presented a problem for him. I laughed at the time they got caught making out in the car ( To my kids: Look away from the page now!) Been there, done that... It rounds off neatly and I enjoyed the way it finished but somehow I just felt that though it was a good read, it wasn’t one I’d reread and that’s unusual in an L.A.Witt story for me.Stars: Three, a good read, enjoyed the Bluewater connection but lacked something to make it a great read for me. ...ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO0OHCOBF7JLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626493677#wasThisHelpful","RO0OHCOBF7JLZ","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A Moment of Weakness,  Brooklyn SkyeReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance,I usually like Brazen reads and this sounded fun but...sadly it was a fail for me.I didn’t like either of the main leads, Micah was a surly, arrogant individual and Laurel was just a pushover. Given Micah wants the best for his daughter, and Laurel supposedly needs the job and wants to do her best, they didn’t act that way. I didn’t feel any connection between them except lust which they both gave way to far too soon IMO.Then the fact it was for the summer only – what was going to happen after that?  Who’d be looking after his daughter? He has to leave for his second “job” at late hours and short notice very often, and its a dangerous one where he could end in hospital or worse. That's not what a caring father does....When you’ve kids you have to plan for every eventuality especially if you don’t have other close family to help. The ending, the scenes at the school just wouldn’t/couldn’t happen. Wouldn’t be allowed in these security conscious days. I know its fiction and you can stretch reality but this was a step too far for me.It just didn’t work for me. I struggled with it, picking it up, putting it aside, trying again and again to get a feel for the characters and the story but I never did. Some you win some you lose and this was a lose for me. As always though everyone likes different things and there will be readers who love this story – its all very personal and its not a bad book, just one that doesn’t work for me.Stars: Sorry, just a two – others will love it, five star it and that’s great for them but for me this story just didn’t make it. ...ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful. ","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EI7TUQ3CT2AB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014PDG3BW#wasThisHelpful","R2EI7TUQ3CT2AB","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3D Fiber Lash Mascara by Mia Adora - Premium Formula with Highest Quality Natural & Non-Toxic Hypoallergenic IngredientsReview from Jeannie’s Product Reviews This arrived well packaged, and the box itself with the mascara is sealed so you know its sterile and unused. It contains two applicators, one with a clear seal and one with lash fibres, and also a brush for separating lashes. No one wants that leggy spider look ! It comes in a sturdy box, silk lined with magnetic clasp. I've seen comments that this is too bulky for handbag, but as the lashes are long lasting why would you need to take it with you? If you're going from work to xmas party or something it's easy to simply pop the products in bag without the case. It's easy to use, and the suppliers emailed a handy booklet giving instructions and a host of other useful tips for healthy eyelashes. I like that it's not tested/never tested on animals - why should they suffer for our vanity....and also that the ingredients are non- toxic, and paraben and SLS free. I found it easy to apply, and it gives very quick long lasting results. It's a 3 step procedure but very simple and each step takes just seconds, so only a  little longer than applying a normal mascara but with far more effective results. You can repeat steps as wanted according to day or night use, once for daytime casual, two or more for a dramatic nighttime look. I used the side of my finger to curl up the ends as I do with normal mascara, having never got to grips with curlers. To be honest when you're as short sighted as me things like that are difficult as I have to have the mirror right in front of my face...If you don't want to go the false eyelash route but want a quick and easy way to get longer, thicker lashes this is perfect. As a former contact lens wearer I'm cautious over anything that could irritate them and I'd still take care with this, applying lenses before using and removing lenses before cleaning mascara off just in case, but the sealer coating seems pretty effective at preventing any stray fibres from coming loose. The instruction say it's easily removed with water, but I've used an eye cleanser or a little argan oil as I don't want to risk broken lashes - don't have enough for that ;-)  Product supplied for review Stars: Five If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I9OGM1D2P6BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBCD7MW#wasThisHelpful","R3I9OGM1D2P6BC","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Rock Redemption, Nalini SinghReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance We’re on to the third book in the series and its fast become a favourite for me. I loved Nalini’s Archangel series and now she’s firmly entrenched in my contemporary romance authors favourites too. I couldn’t really remember Noah from the other books, though have a faint recollection of Kit coming to Fox’s house one day and meeting Molly, where they got off to a bit of a difficult start. Never the less they’re now fast friends along with Thea, Molly’s sister and David’s girlfriend.Kit’s wanted Noah since she met him but he’s always kept her firmly in the friend zone. Then a while back they got closer and he broke her heart – what a jerk, I was thinking when I read what he did, what a horrible man. She’s well rid of him. Still, hearts don’t work on logic and common sense, and despite how heartbroken she was she still cares for him – but they can’t seem to get that old friendship back. Then when we got to know Noah it was clear he was hiding a huge secret, that he was acting to protect Kit from him and his fears.Things change though, they get closer once more and then a media photo goes viral and its make or break time, Kits career hinges on whether they can act as a couple. Its kind of like a bittersweet time for her, she’s still in love with him, and he wants to do whatever he can for her but is so scared of hurting her. He doesn’t seem to see what we can see, that by his actions he’s hurting her worse.Of course I wanted to know what the secret was, and whether it would follow the usual format – well, Nalini puts a twist on it so that its different, that it gives another dimension to what happened, so we can understand better all his fears. Once its revealed so much makes sense and I so felt for him, and understood his past actions better. Alongside all that there’s the parallel plot of Kits stalker who’s been around for some time now, and has done some pretty horrible things and forced her to move into a more expensive property, employ twenty four hour security, and all that means her career is essential, she needs the money to keep this up, and she is scared that entering the “relationship” with Noah will break her heart when he cheats – because she feels its a when not an if. He’s a kind of manwhore, doesn’t do dates or relationships, uses sex as an escape, doesn’t care a bit about who the girls are, they’re just faceless to him, to be used and then left. She doesn’t see how he can manage without for the few weeks they need to keep up the pretence. Then the stalker steps up the action too – and it wasn’t until almost the end before I began to work out who was behind it....very cleverly done, and a realistic rational behind it. I really enjoyed this story, perfect pacing, great characters and I loved seeing the other band members there too. I’m looking forward to reading about Abe and Sarah next.  Stars: Five, loved it.  ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers.If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4HKIQC9WL23F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142YLRUQ#wasThisHelpful","R4HKIQC9WL23F","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Owl and the City of Angels,  Kristi CharishReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Sci-fi and FantasyI saw Owl and the Japanese Circus was up for review a while back, but at the time I was trying to restrict myself as once again my review list was creeping up and up....wish I’d got it though as this looks to be a great series, but incredibly full of different supernatural characters that link in to Owl and her complex life. I followed this ok, but think I missed some of the subtleties and nuances that I may have understood better if I’d read book one – and of course got the Train wreck/Whore statements in some kind of context...they shocked me a bit the first time, said in a kind of apologetic humour and I didn’t follow the logic. There’s a lot like that, where I think the earlier book would have set the scene for me.Its a real action packed adventure – poor Owl doesn’t seem to get a break, going from one disaster to another. I love her and the gang she’s somehow acquired. On/Off boyfriend Incubus Rynn, the talented, quick thinking Nadya, Captain the vampire hating Mau cat and of course Carpe, World Quest partner and hacker extraordinaire. Owl is indebted to the Dragon shifter Mr Kurosawa, working for him but not exactly voluntarily. And this time the treasure he wants is deadly....Poor Owl, her intentions are good but each time she somehow gets into trouble, with a whole cast of Supernaturals out to get her. then there’s the IAA, usually just an awkward inconvenience but now they seem to have focussed on getting  her, and are round every corner. She really needs the help of those friends this time, and as always the search is on for maps, hidden traps and of course the clock is ticking. It could be a story that’s so complex that it makes me switch off, often adventures like this do just that even though others adore them, but its not. The humour permeates through all the dangers and keeps it feeling light and not bogged down in details and battles, the pacing is fast but easy to follow, the dangers and fixes out are fun  and its a really enjoyable read.  The detail is incredible, Owl rattles off stats and facts about identifying antiquities as if she’s simply compiling a shopping list, Nadya has so many contacts to help them escape, and of course World Quest and Carpe provide the maps telling them where things are found and something of the traps they can expect. Good to know when the dangerous  Supernaturals contained in them are usually the eat or kill variety....Rynn – seems he’s always trying to protect Owl, usually from herself and her spontaneous decisions, but of course he’s mainly there in the aftermath rescuing her yet again, and trying to persuade her that what she wants to do is not the best course of action. I’m not sure of the connection between him, Mr Kurosawa and Lady Siyo, he seems to have more respect from them than would be expected of simply an employee, but as yet I’ve not worked it out.Alexander pops up again, still angry at Owl,  Lady Siyo still dearly wants to kill Owl but isn’t allowed, we meet Carpe in person, Rynn’s Cousin and a host of Somali pirates, and Owl somehow has to negotiate her way through yet another series of life threatening dangers, not really knowing who to trust except Rynn and Nadya. I’ve really enjoyed this read, its made a change from the usual fantasy fare and its a fun series. I love Kim Harrison and Jenn Bennet’s novels, and I’d agree with the comparison to their works, the same kind of fun even in danger and attention to detail that make them feel so real.Stars: Five, a cracking story, definitely one to reread and a series to watch out for.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishers If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, in case I've inadvertently added a spoiler and need to edit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FARNNBW1Q40T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCIXUE#wasThisHelpful","R1FARNNBW1Q40T","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" Blueberry Pet Collars 2cm Wide x 37-45cm Neck Summer Hope 3M Reflective Fluorescent Yellow Padded Dog CollarReview from Jeannie’s Product ReviewsMy daughter’s dogs were the testers for these collars once more. Flash is a lab x spaniel, six years old.   This collar looks great on him. It’s made of a soft polyester webbing and nicely padded. The outside layer is the bright yellow with reflective edges that show as grey in daylight, and the inner is a softer black neoprene. Its fully washable, much needed with these dogs who love dirt!  It feels as though it will dry very quickly, useful if caught out in the rain when the smell of wet dog can last in a slow to dry collar such as the cotton or leather types. The fit is very adjustable, Flash has the medium collar, and that’s on the larger side of adjustment but still has more room. These collars and harness to cover a wide range of sizes. We’ve got three collars for review, this one, the tribal pattern and the diamond print one. This feels the strongest of the three and the snap locks and metal lead connectors area bit larger, although they are all size M. If you’ve a dog that’s hard on collars you might want to get this one. Its a slightly different design having a kind of wrap over action with the collar sliding through the lead clip ring.  I’ve added photos showing the size differences.  All the blueberry collars are very robust, the ones we had earlier for review are still looking good after several weeks of constant use and a couple of washings. Flash and Roxie do seem to love dirt – still, that’s true of most dogs given a choice.What we liked:--The reflective addition; walking dogs in winter months, early mornings or evenings, or days when its rainy and just a dull gloom means anything to make them stand out to traffic is excellent, and the reflective parts on this work really well. You can see from the photos how well the flash caught the reflective surface and how incredibly bright it is. this was on the earlier collars and harness we had for review which have been worn constantly for several weeks and washed/got wet in rain many times and the reflective part still works as when new. On cheaper types this part flakes off after a short use, but not so with these.-The fit covers a wide range of sizes, and doesn’t rub or pull coat hair. Both dogs have short hair but I feel this would be just as good for a long hair dog. They’ve both taken to wearing them comfortably, no rubbing trying to remove it which is excellent.-The clips to connect are eco-friendly plastic, but strong and very simple to clip together. For people like myself with hand/finger issues for whom buckles present problems this type of clip is perfect. They’re in a contrasting colour to the main part of the collar. ( blue for the yellow one we had as shown in illustration)- I like that the name tag attachment is separate from the lead clip, too often they’re a combined function and the name tag gets caught/damaged when clipping the lead on.- Washable, so when they roll in the fox poo – every time they visit me it seems Flash finds some....its quick to wash it off and  dry the collars.- Even if your dogs don’t do things like that – and most dogs can find something smelly to roll in- collars still pick up grease from coats and dirt from everyday wear but a quick wash and these look great again.Product supplied for review purposes.If you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why so I can improve the usefulness of future reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WRMZRQ2RY3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W52343Q#wasThisHelpful","R7WRMZRQ2RY3J","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anterograde, KallystenReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  LGBTQIA, RomanceI read Kallysten’s Out of the Box series when I first bought a kindle - some years back now - somehow I’ve never got round to anymore but seeing this thought I’d try it. Was one that just didn’t work for me though, it’s not a bad book, its a great read for many but just that I didn’t connect with it.  I started by reading in the order its written, which is not chronological, but by the time I’d got to about 40% I was totally confused. It doesn’t help that this is a side book from another series, something I hadn’t realised, and maybe it would make more sense to me if I’d read others in the series. I was so lost that I restarted and did the Chronological option and that worked better for me. I struggled though with seeing the two in a romantic light, I just didn’t feel any real connection between them most of the while, though there were odd moments when I saw a flash of it, of tenderness there. Its quite a harrowing read, how Calder would feel being so stubborn, so independent, so proud of his brain and skills, to be so reliant on others even though Eli says he doesn’t think of him as a burden. He must have been scared it would be too much at some point, and that conversation was really emotional, as was the tattoo that resulted. Actually all the tattoos were very special, the reasoning Calder gave to them, not just the purpose of them but how he would recognise that he wrote them and held the feelings they told.  It made me think how awful it would be to know nothing about the present and your place in the world every time you woke. Scary, very, very scary.  Eli was a saint – he put up with so much from Calder, much of it understandable ranting, but sometimes Calder is just plain arrogant and selfish. I guess that made the times when he showed his love to Eli more beautiful though.The sci-fi element isn’t really present here – the hospital where they both work is dealing with constant Demon attacks, but there’s no interaction or direct contact with any supernatural entity. Stars: This is difficult for me, it was an interesting read in that it made me think about Calder and his situation but as a book it didn’t really grip me and at times I struggled to continue with it. For me I think its a 2.5 – 3. ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful. ","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1II0OSO3H50RE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDW4CG2#wasThisHelpful","R1II0OSO3H50RE","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love You Better by Natalie K. MartinReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  women’s Fiction, Literature and Fiction. Strange how fate works...I’ve just read two books that were romance, were about cheating and the effects it leaves and yet they were very, very different reads. Both kept me gripped to see what happened, had me totally unsure of just how they would end, and were five star reads. Not ones I’d reread but certainly a terrific one off read.So poor Effie, heartbroken by Smith, a complex character, one of those non committal types, always on the edge of the Law, always leaving her unsure of exactly what their relationship was, once they’d moved from long time friends to lovers. Then he gets caught up in some disastrous events, abandons her and breaks her heart. Dragged out by her best friend a month later she meets Oliver, and they embark on a whirlwind romance. He’s all she ever dreamed of, stable, adoring,romantic, all the things Smith wasn’t. Within a few brief months they are married. You can see once you know more about Effie just why Oliver appeals, it isn’t just that he’s the opposite of Smith in so many ways, but his whole lifestyle and family are what she always dreamed of as a child. Brought up always on the move by her single parent mum she doesn’t have any other family, and for the last decade or so she’s had only a sporadic contact with her mother. Thank goodness for her friends, Lou and Mickey – who are a couple, and of course Smith before their breakup....Now Smith has returned and somehow he’s back in her life, there at her friends meetings as he’s still close to Lou and Mickey, and now he’s even working in the same place as her....Her perfect marriage is showing signs of wear, Oliver’s care comes out in strange ways, she knows he only wants the best for her when he suggests the changes she needs to make though, of course he knows best, he’s come from that background. Lou isn’t so sure and soon its clear that Oliver doesn’t really approve of Effie’s friends. Its scary how clever people like him are, how they play on insecurities, how they use the “ I only want what’s best for you” and other excuses, making people feel in the wrong all the time. From our outside viewpoint it’s easy to see what’s happening, but Effie is living it and in many ways she understands he’s only doing this because he loves her, wants her to succeed....Then there’s Smith, the bad boy, the man who broke her heart. He seems to have changed, but then things happen that make Effie think he’s the same old Smith, still flirting with danger, still full of lies. So why then when she’s with the perfect, adoring Oliver does she feel a bit oppressed by his insistence on her changing so much of her ways, why is she so attracted still to Smith who’s made it clear he didn’t want her, who told lies, who broke her heart?Its one of those reads where we can see what’s coming, but also see how Effie living it doesn’t. We’ve got the whole story, she’s only seeing parts of it. Its got some very agonising events in, things that sadly happen all too often in real life and I so felt for her. She’s a great girl, hardworking, loving and all she wants is a stable life with someone she loves. She thought she had that with Oliver, but he also seems to have another side that comes out more frequently. Smith seems to be around very often when she needs some help, and he seems very changed to the man that left. Is he though, or is it all part of his scheming? Poor Effie....confused or what?Its a realistic, very interesting read, showing how people are shaped by events and how we change over time and by what happens. I really enjoyed that part, seeing how all the characters were at the beginning and how they grew up when life got in their way. The characters felt so real, and the side story of Lou and Mickey was another part that felt very genuine and provided the catalyst for much of the later events. Stars: five, a terrific read.ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IPDJE9ANCBQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UMBGZFG#wasThisHelpful","R2IPDJE9ANCBQQ","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its got a pleasant herbal smell, though not strong enough to clash with any perfume. I’ve sensitive skin but have had no issues in using this, and it leaves my skin feeling pleasantly moisturised, not tight and angry as some creams do. I’m not convinced yet that it works for the cellulite but I can see the science behind the thinking, as I know about the properties of many of the herbs and extracts used in this cream. Its certainly worth trying, and so far my skin feels soft and well moisturised but as I’ve only been using this a few days its too soon to tell about the anti cellulite properties. I love the company’s ethos, this extract is from their website: Our products are Organic and natural treatments that look great, feel great and smell great, and therefore make you feel good.  We've combined the best gifts of earth and ocean in our skin care. Aromatherapy elements nourish your body and soul. And most importantly our products are safe for mum and baby and  everyone who seeks the healthiest alternatives for every day skin challenges. Did you know that everything that is applied on our skin, the largest organ, ultimately ends up in your bloodstream?

"Crazy Over You,  Carol ThomasReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre:  Romance, Women’s fiction This isn’t the meet, split, get together and HEA type of romance that’s very common, but one that’s a bit deeper. We see how Abby and Simon met all those years back, fell in love so quickly, how they’ve been so close ever since and now after two children poor Abby has discovered that he had an affair recently. A short one of just a week but even so – the betrayal....Its now a few months post discovery and Abby is floundering, finding it hard to cope. Simon makes it clear he wants her back, regrets what he did,  but what does she want? Does she still love him? Can she forgive? Can she ever get past this? So many questions, and it really made me think. There’s times when she’s mulling it over and angry and asking herself did She, Her,  – the mysterious Helen – care that Simon was married? Had kids? That’s something I feel too – an affair is wrong, always, every time. think before acting, think of what’s at stake. Sort out home issues first and never get entangled in someone whose got a partner. I’m very strong on this – don’t have patience with the “it just happened” “we fell in love” type of excuse. Everything has a starting point, and there’s a clear divide between innocent flirty chat and taking things that step further. Stop right there is my view. Affairs cause such heartbreak, destroy families, upset kids and their homes and schooling and can be stopped before they start.So with that rant over its clear I really feel for poor Abby and I can see she’s struggling – and who wouldn’t? When she finally begins to pick herself up and seeks counselling I felt like I was there with her, thinking about the questions Mallory posed and gradually we saw how far Abby had come, and I so admired her. She’s stronger than she felt, and I loved that her new friend encouraged her to go to the gym, to get new clothes and haircuts etc. She needed that boost to her self esteem. Its never happened to me thankfully but I can imagine how many people look at themselves and feel less, feel that they must be lacking if their partner wanted someone else. When she’s writing in her book about the questions she had, those where whatever answer Simon gave he’s be wrong I could so see that happening.All the way through this I really wasn’t certain what the outcome would be. Simon was clear that on his part he acknowledged he was wrong, and had no intention of doing it again, but I really didn’t know if Abby could move forward with him or whether the betrayal was just too much to get past. It made me think how I would feel, and I understood that though she still had feelings for Simon, for now they were overshadowed by what happened. Carol kept me guessing right to the end about what would be the result – and its not often that happens, usually its clear which way things are going but not here! A great read, and it looks like its a debut book too – I can’t find anything else, so well done Carol for a thought provoking, entertaining read.  Stars: Five ARC supplied by Netgalley and publishersIf you enjoyed my review I'd love it if you would please click “Like” and if you didn't I'd love to know why, so I can make future reviews more helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LZH2FS3H411/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015RRBU0E#wasThisHelpful","R6LZH2FS3H411","A1X2URS71RRMMF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1X2URS71RRMMF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:53 Mins The camera comes with a power adapter with a 10’ foot power cable which makes finding the right place for it a little bit easier. It can either sit on a flat surface or be mounted to a wall or ceiling. The camera measures 4.5” tall and has a 4.25” diameter and has 360 degrees of rotation on the horizontal axis and about 120 degrees on the vertical axis allowing you to view from just about any angle. The unit is made from a lightweight hardshell plastic and has a shiny white finish, but almost feels a bit cheap like a toy.Luckily though, the hardware inside is pretty good and the camera has high-def capabilities as well as a Wi-Fi antenna and repeater to rebroadcast your Wi-Fi signal and extend its range. The camera has a ring of infrared lights around the lens for night vision. You can adjust the camera’s orientation live while using the mobile app by swiping on your screen (pan/tilt feature). Note that when changing the orientation of the camera, each swipe moves the camera a set amount in the direction that you swipe. So it won't be a single, fluid motion and you can't make the camera stop at a lesser amount of rotation. The instruction manual is well written with easy to follow directions that includes helpful color photos with each step.You will need either an Android or an iOS device that can install apps as well as a wireless network connected to the internet to use this camera. After the unit is setup, you can also view the camera from any internet connected computer by logging into your account and you can add multiple AstroView cameras to your account as well.The mobile app is called iSecurity+ by Seedonk, Inc and can be downloaded from both the Apple App Store and Google Play. You also need to register an account in order to connect with the camera. Adding the camera by following the instruction manuala nd on screen prompts was simple and straight forward. The camera has various settings you can modify like motion detection sensitivity, mobile app alerts from motion detection events, and camera resolution.The camera microphone which captures sound is very sensitive and oftentimes picks up sound from far away, though don't expect the audio in the video to be super clear. It's decent at best and is cluttered with lots of digital noise. You also may notice quite a bit of lag between the audio and video in the recordings. You can send audio to the unit which has an external speaker so you can speak to people in the same room as the camera. Again, the audio quality isn't the best, like using a walkie talkie, and there is a slight delay in the transmission.The motion detection feature can trigger mobile alerts through the app which will pop up on your mobile device's screen, or you can turn on email alerts from your account via iSecurity's website if you have a paid subscription to their motion detection monitoring and cloud recording service. The camera lacks a DVR and does not automatically record video, even on motion detection events, unless you subscribe to the iSecurity cloud service which costs $5.99 per month or $59.99 per year per camera, but you do get a 30-day free trial with your purchase of this camera.With a subscription, the camera can be set to record motion detection events which will be saved on the iSecurity server for 14 days. Without the subscription you can still view the live feed over any internet connection for free, or you can manually initiate recordings and take snapshots that will be saved to your mobile device. I found that at the highest sensitivity, I got a lot of false positive alerts from the camera; that is, I was notified there was motion when there wasn’t any, perhaps due to lighting changes. So I dropped the sensitivity to medium and it worked a little bit better.The video quality is very good and the audio is bearable. The images were much better that what I expected from this type of camera. Each minute recording to your mobile device takes up about 15 MB of storage space. You can also zoom in while viewing the camera, but it is a digital zoom so the image can become grainy. The night vision is pretty good and allows you to see clearly in the darkness, but note that images will be presented in black and white.Overall the camera was simple and quick to setup, and the cloud storage subscription plans for recorded motion detected events are fairly priced. The camera won’t record 24/7, but you can always view the camera for free over any internet connection without a subscription and initiate your own recordings to your mobile devices.I received this as a sample for my full  and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZKN6IPPDFHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BF1LQK#wasThisHelpful","R2SZKN6IPPDFHD","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:23 MinsThe ski goggles come in a soft microfiber bag to protect it from scratches which also doubles as a cleaning and polishing cloth. The goggles measure 9"" across and 4"" high so have a fairly wide coverage and visibility. They have a foam cushion that’s lined with a thin fleece for a soft fit to your face and it adds a bit of warmth and comfort while wearing them. On the top and bottom of the goggles as well as the top of the lens, are air vents stuffed with porous foam to allow air flow and prevent fogging of the goggles.Be sure to remove the protective film on the inside of the goggles before use. The head band is a 1.75” wide soft elastic strap that can be adjusted on both sides of the goggles. The lens is one piece of mirrored acrylic with an orangey-red sunset color to help reduce glare from the snow on sunny days and in bright conditions. One interesting feature with this set is that the lens is removable if you flip up the two latches on the sides, so that if it becomes damaged or worn, you can replace just the lens.When wearing these, everything has a slightly blue hue to it at first since red/yellow light is being reflected, but everything looks normal after a few minutes as your eyes adjust. The goggles provide clear vision and good protection from wind and snow, but I found that because of the strap is so wide, I can’t wear the band above my ears and instead the band has to wrap over my ears. It’s slightly uncomfortable because the placement of the plastic adjusters happens to be right over my ears, but in general, I would be wearing a hat or earmuffs that cover my ears under the band which would provide additional padding and I couldn't really feel them through the additional layer.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJKPITSV2LZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NTC94W#wasThisHelpful","RZJKPITSV2LZ6","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:21 MinsI have to admit, I don't consider this one of the better shampoos from Luseta. There are a few reasons. Firstly is the odd fragrance. I really couldn't put my finger on it, but I just did not like the smell at all, and it's a bit hard to describe what it smells like. The closest I could come up with is a more floral baby lotion, but even that, I think would have at least been pleasant. Different noses may have different opinions though.The bottles are a nice size and contain 16.9 fl oz each. They feature a pump action dispenser on top that are locked and wrapped with plastic when you receive them; but they twist open pretty easily. One ""pump"" dispenses about 1 teaspoon of product. I didn’t experience a lot of sudsing at first, but this is typical depending on the soil level of my hair. A second shampooing typically yields more bubbles, which did happen, somewhat, with this shampoo. The consistency of the conditioner is quite thick, almost like a paste or lotion but the product works in smoothly.After using the products, my hair felt clean, but it was not as soft as I was expecting. It had a little bit of a waxy texture and my fingers felt like they were sticking in my hair as I ran my hands through it. Usually, after washing my hair is light and fluffy. The perfume from the shampoo also lingered to the point of almost being overpowering. Overall, while my hair was clean and relatively smooth, it felt weighted down, though the texture did improve when fully dry, but the texture was coarser than I've experienced with other shampoos.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AL8PTTWRT83N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JEZSAA#wasThisHelpful","R2AL8PTTWRT83N","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:40 MinsThe hair oil comes in a 4 fl ox bottle and has a slightly thick consistency, like olive oil. The oil is smooth with a light orange color. The product should be applied to towel dried hair, so it's best to use it after a shower when shampooing often strips your hair of moisture and its protective oils. Work a small amount of oil into your palms and fingers and apply from the mids to the ends of your hair. My scalp tends to get dry after washing, so I worked the oil in close to the roots as well. The oil absorbed well and my hair ended up tangle free and easy to style. I was afraid it would feel greasy or look too slick, but when dry, my hair simply retained its shine and has a moisturized look without feeling heavy or oily. You can even style with product like mouse or gel after using the hair treatment.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22L7L8L4M1QLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VIOM18G#wasThisHelpful","R22L7L8L4M1QLB","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:35 MinsIf you don’t wash your hair every day, whether that because it’s too drying or harsh for your hair type, you don’t have the time, or you just simply don’t find it necessary, using a dry shampoo can be a great way to cleanse your hair of some of the excess oil and dirt that’ll accumulate over time between washings. It’s also really great for texturizing and adding volume to your hair.Use the can like a typical spray aerosol: shake first, then hold it about 8-10 inches away from your head. I like to lift the hair so you can get at the roots and better overall coverage. Spray evenly with quick bursts. If you spray too close or for too long in one spot you’ll notice a white powdery buildup, but you can work this in so it doesn’t leave any residue behind. Massage the product in your hair with your hands for a few minutes and brush it out. After, you can style it however you want.The dry conditioner is optional with a similar application process. You can hold the can about 6-8 inches from your hair and you can spray just from the mids to the ends of your hair, then use your hands to work the product in and distribute it. This will give your hair a bit of shine and leave it feeling soft to the touch.I got the lavender scent and it's quite pleasant. The products left my hair feeling soft, clean, and refreshed. Not at all greasy or dirty. The conditioner added a ton of texture and volume to my hair, and I didn’t notice any white powdery residue that’s a common problem with dry shampoos. The finished result has a nice shine without additional products added and these are neither thick nor heavy feeling.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L0KN4XI9PIJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015IL6YBO#wasThisHelpful","R2L0KN4XI9PIJF","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:14 MinsThe speaker comes with a small aluminum carabiner clip so you can hang it and a 20” microUSB cable for charging. The speaker measures 4"" x 3"" and is about 1"" thick. The unit charges in about 2 hours and the port for charging is to the left of the handle, just below the TF card slot for optional microSD card (not included). On a full charge the unit can play up to 5 hours continuously. The speaker is coated in a soft-touch matter rubber and has four rubber feet on the bottom to prevent slipping; one of the feet came loose almost immediately, but it was simple to glue back in place. Also, the feet have clear plastic protectors on them that you can peel off the outer surface, but the feet are NOT adhesive. When you peel the plastic off, the rubber feet are smooth and dry. They're just for non-slip grip, not adhering to a surface.The symbols on the keys are a bit hard to see because they are just slight engravings on the buttons; I would have preferred if they were colored in with black to make them more visible. To turn the unit on, press the power button for a few seconds which is the third button on the right; it will enter pairing mode automatically. The audio prompts for the speaker are in Chinese and unfortunately cannot be changed.Connect your mobile device to it by selecting BT-SPEAKER in the Bluetooth menu. There is a built-in microphone in the speaker and you can also answer phone calls on this unit when paired to a mobile phone. If you don’t have a Bluetooth device, load some MP3s on a microSD card and pop it in the TF card slot. There is no AUX input option on this speaker. You can toggle between Bluetooth and TF mode by pressing the M/call button which is the second button on the right; this button also answers phone calls. The first and last buttons skip tracks backward and forward with a short press and change the volume down and up with a long press. I wasn't a huge fan of the volume controls as oftentimes I ended up skipping tracks rather than changing volume. I preferred to change the volume via the transmitting device.The sound on this unit is much better than I was expecting from a unit of this size and build quality. It’s not only clear, but it can get loud. Although, it lacks a lot of bass and silence at loud volumes can tend to sound staticky. The sound is also a bit thin at higher volumes but not necessarily blown out. Overall, you'll get a lot of quality sound out of a lightweight, durable, and portable unit.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3MHFV6I58D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016KHTCW8#wasThisHelpful","R2A3MHFV6I58D","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:50 MinsIncluded with the speaker is a power adapter with 5' cable and a 2' male-to-male audio cable. The unit measures 8"" x 4.5"" x 2"" and weighs about 2 lbs. The unit isn't very attractive and is plain and industrial looking. However, it feels like it is made from heavy duty and durable materials, from the firm outer metal casing to the thick rubber top and bottom. This speaker features dual 8W drivers with a built-in sub woofer for extra bass. The unit takes several hours to charger up and the charging port and AUX in port are located behind a silicone flap on the right-hand-side. The Aux port can be used with devices that have headphone out ports that do not support Bluetooth. On a full charge the unit can play up to 10 hours continuously.Along the top of the speaker are the controls including, power, skip tracks, play/pause and volume control. To turn the unit on, press and hold the power button for a few seconds. This speaker uses Bluetooth 4.0 technology and will be called Music Box Studio in your device’s Bluetooth menu. The sound is impressively clear with little to no static, stuttering or lagging. At the loudest volume, these speakers can easily fill a room without blowing out the sound and the vibration from the bass can be felt through the surface the speakers are sitting on. There is a built-in microphone, so when paired to a mobile phone the speakers can be used to answer phone calls; use the play/pause button to take an incoming call.While this isn’t the smallest, lightest, or most beautiful Bluetooth speaker out there, it's still quite portable. It packs a punch and outputs great sound which is good enough to get the job done at a party or outdoor event.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1690JGFSW692L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OK1XZM#wasThisHelpful","R1690JGFSW692L","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 3:54 MinsThe camera comes with two antennas, power adapter with 10’ foot power cable, a bag of hardware for mounting with Allen wrench, and an instruction manual. The camera measures about 8” inches long with a 2.75” diameter and includes a 40” cable for power. The unit is made of a durable metal material and is suitable for use outdoors. The paint will chip if you bang against something hard, though, which may impact its water/rust resistance.The camera has a ring of infrared lights around the lens for night vision and it is seated on a ball joint so you can rotate its position and point it in almost any direction. Once the camera position is set, it will be stationary unless you manually change its position. The instruction manual is well written with easy to follow directions and even includes helpful color photos with each step.You will need either an Android or an iOS device that can install apps as well as a wireless network connected to the internet to use this camera.

" 5:23 Mins The set comes with the rearview mirror DVR unit which contains the LCD for viewing, front camera, microphone for audio recording, optional GPS input and SD card slot. You'll receive all the cables you need to complete the hookup, a 16GB microSD card, cigarette lighter to dual USB adapter, extra rubber latches or enhanced grip on your existing rearview mirror, and mounting screws for the back camera. This unit is designed to fit over your existing mirror for easy mounting and installation, but note that different car models may prove to have a better fit than others. For reference, I installed this on a recent model Honda Civic.The mirror is quite large; it measures 12.5”W by 4”H and the LCD screen in the middle has a 5” diagonal. The mirror itself is quite dark and has a deep blue tint to it. While this does help reduce glare, it tends to look a bit dim and at night makes seeing details muddier. The camera for the unit is on the side facing the windshield, as well as its external speaker. There are a variety of options like motion detection, G-shock sensor which will automatically save/lock videos when the camera senses heavy shaking like in the event of an accident or large pot hole, audio recording and date/time stamping on the video.The rear camera has an adhesive sticky pad to assist in mounting but also comes with two mounting screws which may require drilling into a panel on your car's trunk. It must be centered and is typically installed just above the license plate. If you want to rear camera to turn on automatically when you put the car in reverse, you have to wire the pair of black and red wires coming off the back camera to the reverse light. There are a number of ways you could connect the wires tot he power line too, for example, by splicing the wires into the power line, using a scotchlok or plier tap connector.As a mirror, it works fine and is quite reflective, though again, it's a bit dark, especially at night. The video quality of the recordings is okay. I have mine set to record in 5 minute intervals and each file takes up about 200 MB (400 MB total with front/rear feeds). That's ~3.5 hours of video on the included 16 GB card. The front and back videos will have the same audio and time stamps so that they are easy to match up. You can hear most of the conversation and radio in the car but there is a bit of road noise as well. It’s not a very high definition video resolution, but you can see what’s going on around you, which is important in case of an accident. Sometimes the color and white balance seem off and the front camera has slightly better quality and resolution than the back camera but not by much. One thing I noticed is that while the reverse guidelines make it appear as if I have about 6-8 inches from the curb, I’m actually only about 2 inches from the curb though I believe this has to do with the height placement of the camera.Overall, the cameras will capture enough detail to assist you in you need to refer back to the recordings and the unit was relatively easy to install (took me about an hour).I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFLV652LR7SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010H0SL9O#wasThisHelpful","R2XFLV652LR7SC","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:57 MinsAs every parent knows, kids are heavy. And they only get heavier, which can cause some serious strain and stress on your arms, back, hips and knees. This baby carrier, worn like a large backpack, has built-in waist and shoulder strap support to help evenly distribute your child's weight, relieving you of some of the strain and stress on your body. The wide Velcro waist band provides back and core support and the padded shoulder straps give your baby a secure hold. For reference, I’m 5’4” and weigh 120 lbs and with some adjustments, the baby carrier worked fine with an 11 month old. Note that the baby carrier is designed to hold children up to 3 yrs of age or weighing up to 44 lbs. The carrier should not be used with children younger than 3 months or those than cannot hold up their heads on their own.You can wear the carrier with your baby either in the front or in the back. When your baby is on your back they should be facing towards your back. When your baby is in front, they can either face you or face away from you. Your baby will sit on a firm Styrofoam cushion which can be detached and removed if you need to wash the carrier, which is made from 100% polyester. On the front of the chest there is a small zipper pocket that measures about 5"" x 6"". On the right hip there is a small Velcro pocket that measures 4"" x 5”. While the instructions state that there is an NFC identification chip located behind the logo tag here, I wasn’t able to detect one with my Android phone, and I gather that one isn't present on this version of the product.The carrier comes with a small side bag that can be attached via the Velcro back strap to the hip belt and also has a shoulder strap for carrying. The side bag measures 7"" x 8” and has a snap button front pocket and zippered back pocket. The carrier also has a detachable hood that you can use to cover your baby's head when they are seated facing you either on your back or in front. You also get three drool guards that snap/Velcro on: one for each shoulder strap and one for the front of the carrier when your baby is facing forward.When putting on the carrier, make sure the Velcro is strapped tightly at waist level at your navel and not low on your hips. Secure the waist band with the large plastic sliding clasp behind you and pull to tighten. Then seat the baby on the foam seat and put your arms through the straps and over your shoulders. Secure the small plastic snap clip behind your neck at the base of your neck. Adjust the side straps and tighten them to take out any slack so that your baby is secure and doesn't slip out. The carrier makes carrying your child hands-free and distributes his or her weight evenly, reducing fatigue and back strain while allowing your baby to be seated comfortably. It works well and has a variety of adjustable options to help you find yours and baby’s fit and comfort.I received this as a sample for my full and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X6IJFHL2AGMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015OG2Y12#wasThisHelpful","R1X6IJFHL2AGMN","A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2E2Q4CNJ2NJAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been a fan of the Alex Delaware series right from the start (well I say from the start, I read the first 6 or so all in a heap and since then have not missed a single one) and they never fail to get my reading mojo going - excellent reads every time.Milo of course. Can't have Alex without Milo - the best ""buddy"" pairing around in crime fiction as far as I am concerned and both are on top form in ""Motive"" as Milo is landed with a randomly strange case involving dead bodies and a lot of food stuff. As Alex is his go to guy for the weird and horrific, they start to try and make some sense of it all. But as ever these things are never easy and before we know it BAM things are getting darker..I'm a big fan of the prose that Kellerman uses to involve the reader in the plot, it just kind of gently flows over you but before you know it you are engrossed and utterly addicted. The characters have grown so beautifully over time, with all the ups and downs, you know them so well - and yet every time you have something new and even after all this time those we know best can act in an unpredictable manner - it keeps things fresh and never fails to keep you intrigued.Motive was basically another great story, involving some terrifically drawn characters with all the disturbing twisty turns you can hope for within a series that could potentially run a good few years yet. Here's hoping.Happy Reading Folks!**Bookbridgr UK**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FAHLZ6BVVKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N9AVKRU#wasThisHelpful","R28FAHLZ6BVVKP","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An absolutely brilliant page turner this, focussing very much on character rather than mystery (although the mystery element is also superb) as we delve into the heads, hearts and minds of a group of people caught up in a child abduction case.When Rachel lets Ben out of her sight for a few moments, he disappears apparently into thin air. Following the ensuing police investigation and how it affects not only the family but the officers involved, this is an emotional rollercoaster of a read that utterly grips you from the very first page.Rachel is an elegantly drawn character who is both sympathetic yet often incomprehensible – it is easy to understand why the general public turn on her. Gilly Macmillan has taken a story that could be straight out of the news and given us a fictional insight behind the scenes of such a traumatic event. It brought to mind a very obvious real life case which caught the public imagination, lets face it we’ve all done it, that little voyeuristic leaning. Seeing someone being interviewed on the news and thinking “ooh they look suspicious”. In “Burnt Paper Sky” you see it from all sides, from many angles and most of all get a real feel for how that can make an already stressful time that much worse.Then we have Jim Clemo, in charge of the investigation, a man who we see in the aftermath as haunted and broken – as we look back over the details the reasons for this become apparent. It is beautifully constructed and has huge psychological depth. Jim I did sympathise with throughout, genuinely determined to find Ben at all costs, still his own personality traits often interfere with what might be logical. Authentic and totally believable, it was heart wrenching stuff.Looking at the mystery element (what DID happen to Ben) this is woven into the plot seemlessly – whilst the characters and what they are going through are key, each little insight into them (not only our two main protagonists but the wider family and the other officers involved) gives another clue to a possible outcome, another step on the ladder to discovering what happened on that afternoon. Again realistically drawn, there is nothing here that is thrown in for the sake of it or to create red herrings, it is simply a good story that could easily be completely true.Mostly this novel will have you questioning – the next time you see a breaking news story a little like this one (sadly I feel that this is bound to happen) you may look at things differently. After all if YOUR life was thrown under such a spotlight, where every nuance and every action was dissected and taken apart, how would you look to the outside world? We all have our secrets, we all make errors in judgement. If that one error led to a tragedy, could anyone really blame you more than you would blame yourself?Whose Side are you on? Well Ben’s of course. But that won’t stop you going back and forth on the other players in the drama – guilty or innocent they will all get into your head and stay there. Brilliantly done.Highly Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73BK6PX5D632/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM9S9DS#wasThisHelpful","R73BK6PX5D632","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really loved The Daughters Secret. For starters it was a bit of a departure in plot from the plethora of (mostly great) family drama novels I’ve read this year and had a particular depth and resonance to it that really appealed to me.Eva Holland uses the past/present timeline to great effect here, painting a picture of the rifts in the family caused by her daughter absconding with her teacher years before, and now when he is about to be released from prison, putting new and deeply disturbing pressures on an already ruptured dynamic.There is a great perception to the writing as we see the different ways the characters try to deal with the issues – none of them are particularly practical or indeed particularly likeable, but they are eminently realistic with an intuitively drawn depth that really gets you inside the issues. Ros especially, full of anxiety and neurosis, as the story unfolds and you see flashes of the home life Stephanie had, you begin to understand that there is more to things than meets the eye.I was intrigued mostly by what would happen when Nate was released. Would Stephanie see him again? In that sense it was a real page turner and I was engaged all the way through. A story ripped straight from the headlines, imagnining the people behind the drama, The Daughters Secret was compelling, often sad and very authentic with a spot on pitch perfect ending.Highly Recommended.**Netgalley copy UK**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XO9J9KUDGDCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TXH9GTW#wasThisHelpful","R2XO9J9KUDGDCL","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had written a full review for one of the previous Scarpetta books explaining why, after so many years of loving them I had finally, reluctantly decided to give up so I won't go into all that again. I was persuaded back into Dust by someone who told me the series had picked up and was looking more like itself.To be clear the rating I have given this one is based on the first quarter of the book only - at which point I just lost the will to live and (reluctantly again) put it aside.The star is for the idea of the plot which could have been brilliant. The trouble is the prose - repetitive, rambling and just for gods sake get to the point. And seriously the Marino/Scarpetta thing is beyond ridiculous now. The characters are all caricature, Scarpetta is a shadow of her former self and no longer has any redeeming qualities for me as a reader. Frankly I just want to slap her.Never again.**Paperback purchased via Amazon UK**","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA5EMSD8ZAEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQ5R18G#wasThisHelpful","RUA5EMSD8ZAEQ","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harm is a really excellent thriller from the pen of Hugh Fraser - Better known as Captain Hastings in ITV's Poirot -but about to be known for something quite different if this is anything to go by.We meet Rina - she is a paid assassin - told over two timelines, one while she is ""on a job"" in the 70's and where everything that can go wrong is going wrong and also in flashback to the 50's showing us her path and what has led her to where she is today.It's an intuitive bit of writing when it comes to character development - seeing how Rina was, what she went through, how she lived - all leading up to what she is doing now, running from drug dealers and generally getting into trouble. She's kick ass though so is likely to get out of it - hence the ""thriller"" aspect of the whole thing.The real intrigue of this one though is in the human interaction and the examination of why we do the things we do. Rina as a youngster growing up had litte choice in the matter - living in poverty, with danger on the streets from lowlife criminals and even danger in her own home - some of it is really emotive stuff. But then even so its a bit of a jump from tough girl to killer and the hows and whys of that make for a great if often sad story.In the ""present"" timeline there is a lot of action, a fair few edge of seat moments (which are not exactly missing in the past either) and a rollicking good adventure. Violence yes (Although you know you are going to love Rina when, upon awakening to find a severed head on her pillow does not immediately scream like a girl or even have a rabbit in the headlights moment) but also a lot of depth of plot and a growing understanding of just how Rina can do what she does and do it all with barely a flicker.A really most excellent read - the ending was kind of abrupt for me but to be fair the story had been told and there may not have been a way within the narrative scope to even that ending up - still I hope that Rina returns. Ooh look. Rina Returns. I've come up with a title. Not a very good one granted - but as long as we get to see this character again I'm going to read it no matter what the title.Good stuff.Happy Reading Folks!**Publisher Review Copy UK**","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R22A04M3SB8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MOJMD4#wasThisHelpful","R2R22A04M3SB8V","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet promises so much and delivers so much more. One of those books you simply HATE to leave behind, so involved have you become in the minutae of the characters lives that you have practically lived with them yourself.A really wonderful read on so many levels, a character drama set in space, an intensely intelligent and evocative building of worlds that sinks into your subconcious and hovers there, I loved every minute of it.We have humans and aliens, but it's nowhere near as simple or as standard as that - Becky Chambers weaves her story around the almost mundane day to day, the difference of course being that this is Outer Space, the worlds we visit are not our own and the cultural richness and utterly gripping social strata of each different species we encounter make it completely and definitively addictive.The glue holding it all together is the Long Way of the title - our eclectic and very differing crew members are all heading to one place to complete one task - the road is seemingly forever, there are dangers and pitfalls along the way, odd moments of pure adrenalin followed by downtime of seemingly endless space -  throughout the journey we learn and adapt and are happy, sad, scared, alone, angry and emotional right alongside the inhabitants of the Wayfarer - a ship that becomes very much a character in its own right.The sheer richness of the descriptive prose paints a truly magnificent vista for the reader to cast their eye over - the worlds are easy to imagine in the very talented hands of this writer - but the strength of this novel is not so much in the places as in the people. Rosemary is our ""man on the ground"" if you like - she is joining the ship trying to escape a family scandal - initially through her eyes we start to get to know the rest and get a handle on their many different layers - but as time goes on each character is given equal opportunity to shine, capture your heart or your sympathy or your disgust - a true group dynamic that is ever changing, ever developing and slowly but inexorably heading towards that small angry planet...This is sharp, intuitive writing with a really keen eye for human nature and a brilliantly imaginative sense of how other species may view us. I liked how humans are actually the least important part of the universe she has created here, rather than being all that - it allows for a deeper exploration of ourselves in a lot of ways and as this group forms alliances and starts to become more than just a crew but absolutely a family, there are edge of the seat moments, utterly heartbreaking ones, some giggles and a whole lot of really terrific old school storytelling.If you've read this far (thanks for sticking with me) you may have noticed that I have mentioned only one of the characters specifically - this is deliberate on my part, they are all so well drawn but I didn't know anything about them going in and you shouldn't either. I had the best time getting to know them  and I wouldn't deprive anyone else of that - I finished reading this last week but I can still see every one of them, just glimpses out of the corner of my eye.I was sad to leave the Wayfarer and those that travel with her behind. I can only hope to go back one day - The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet is the type of novel that demands a sequel, cries out for one- YES I say. Let there be more - but even if this is the only time I get to spend with them all then it was time well spent. Not one wasted moment.Brilliant.

"Luckiest Girl Alive resonated with me. It was one of those novels that at points I had to force myself to keep reading, not due to it being bad but due to it being too real. Not perhaps with some of the circumstances but with the descriptive sense of emotion.The main character, yes rather a silly name Tifani Fanelli - known when we first meet her as Ani - is eminently unlikeable. This continues throughout the book. She's about to marry a rich guy and the first part of the novel focuses very much on her reasons for doing this and her constant struggle to seem as if she ""fits in"" to that world. She is sarcastic, seemingly selfish and as I said terrifically unlikeable in a lot of ways. And honestly I never truly warmed up to her...About to film a documentary - a ""retrospective"" on an incident at a private school she used to attend, we start to get some of her backstory. Gain a better understanding of her - whilst she perhaps was always annoyingly needy the fear factor came later, as we see her as a teenager this comes more into focus. There are some emotive themes here which I won't go into as I don't want to spoil it - but Jessica Knoll does a great job of showing us then and now, the nuances of what have brought her to this point.Some of the most powerful scenes in this book happen in one spot - when Ani is telling her story of that day to camera and we finally see the end game fallout - but this point IS more powerful due to the slow build up preceding it, both in the present time and in the past - getting a feeling for all those involved, and even hints of the aftermath that has followed Anni ever since.The reveal moment is not what this book is all about though and that was something else I loved about it. It is a tool to allow the character to choose her path through life - the path of least resistance or a possible one to real happiness and acceptance. What happens after the reveal is just as important, or perhaps even more so, than what has gone before it. The true unpredictability of this one is not WHAT happened but what eventually Tifani will choose because of it.There is a sentence in this book that stayed with me.""You only scream when you're finally safe.""I get that.I would definitely recommend this one - not as the next Gone Girl - SERIOUSLY publicity people ENOUGH already you are doing this book AND Gone Girl no favours whatsoever - but as a strong and resonant character piece that talks about truth and consequences, puts one human being into a major spotlight warts and all, where the huge event in her life is not necessarily the one that defined her and her choices are up for the harshest scrutiny. You may not like Tifani but you will want her to be ok. Whether or not in the end you think she will be I guess will come down to your own feelings and the path you may have taken. Food for thought indeed.Great book. One I will return to.Happy Reading Folks!**purchased copy via amazon uk**","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5WVZ2SDKE56D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SN938HC#wasThisHelpful","R5WVZ2SDKE56D","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Liars Inc is a beautifully twisty turny YA tale that flows beautifully and is really gripping – some great characters and an addictive writing style made this an easy and fast read that I thoroughly enjoyed.Liars Inc – set up by a group of friends to make a little money. Forge the odd note, make the odd “pretend parent” phone call amongst other things and soon the cash is pouring in. A lie though, once told, can flow outwards like ripples in a pond and soon at least one of our group finds himself in hot water.Its a clever little tale to be sure, the author does a great job with the ongoing twists and works nicely around the readers assumptions to make it unpredictable and fun to read. Max as a main protagonist is eminently likeable even as he occasionally does some downright stupid things so you are very involved in his trauma and with him all the way. I especially liked the interaction and tangled relationship between Max, his girlfriend and his best friend – the core trio that we are concerned with here.Paula Stokes has weaved her web around some real life issues – adoption, fitting in, sense of self, that gives it a stroke of poignancy and is handled very well within the plot. Whilst it is, yes, sometimes a little unrealistic on the mystery element side (but then if everyone behaved sensibly this novel would have ended at around page 10 so you know, creative license and all that) the personal emotional side means that you don’t really care.Overall a very well written and engaging YA story with some great little twists, a fascinating set of characters and an entirely captivating conundrum to solve. One Lie many consequences.

"I’ve been a fan of the Joe O’Loughlin books from the start so this one could not come soon enough for me – and as usual it was blinking fantastic.I’ve got a huge book crush on Joe, clinical psychologist and sometime consultant to the police, who fights Parkinson’s disease and family issues, he is a terrific series protagonist alongside his occasional sidekick Ruiz (who has plenty of stories of his own)In this instalment a double murder at a farmhouse has Veronica (Ronnie) Cray determined to utilise Joe’s skills – he reluctantly gets involved whilst at the same time trying to repair his marriage under very difficult circumstances. Adding to the issues, a glory seeking ex student of Joe’s may have already irreparably damaged the investigation and meanwhile women are being attacked, choked and branded.I think what I love most about these is the gloriously intricate crime elements all mixed up with the equally intricate personal lives of the series main cast – one element often informing and driving the other – there is great depth of perception to the tales overall which make them huge page turners.One moment you are caught up with Joe’s personal life and desperate to find out how it all pans out for him, next moment BAM you are in the middle of a twisty turny psychological thriller that is always cleverly constructed and difficult to unravel. Close Your Eyes is no exception – both the crime being investigated and Joe’s ever more fascinating family life will hold you enthralled.For me the strength of this one was Joe’s relationship with daughter Charlie – Charlie, I really hope, will one day star in an offshoot from this series all by herself, I find her sympathetic and eminently readable and would love to see her out on her own. Some difficult times ahead not only for her but for all of them gave this book an added pull, that little x factor that takes a crime novel out of the standard and into the addictive, must read category. Beautifully done.Everything about Close Your Eyes is excellent – the character development, the mystery, all of it. I thought it was a fantastic addition to the series, perhaps even my favourite one so far and when it comes to Crime this series has to be up there with the best of them.Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6LUJ0X3KD36S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFYZX3U#wasThisHelpful","R6LUJ0X3KD36S","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m a fan of this author’s previous works so was delighted to receive a copy of The Other Me – and it was more of treat than expected, a little different to what you might think looking at the tagline and a very emotional and moving read about coming to terms with family history.When we meet Klaudia, she is a teenager who is ashamed of her parents. Nothing new there you might say, but her family has a history and background that is somewhat different. Later she reinvents herself as Eliza in an attempt to leave it all behind, but the past has a way of staying with you and Eliza must face it head on if she is to be truly happy.This was really beautifully written, the different viewpoints serving to elicit a really emotional response to the story – I found the portions where we follow Ernst through some of the war to be particularly gripping. I’m keen not to give too much away here, this is a story that highlights how the past can be hidden within myth and assumptions made that are at odds with the truth. What Saskia Sarginson has managed to do is show that up, Eliza’s outlook on her family is very skewed, coloured by what she thinks she knows and by others reactions to her.The story unfolds at a perfect pace allowing you to sink into the lives of the characters, there is much to debate in your head as you go and this is one of those books that will stay with you long after finishing it. Really terrific stuff.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVFP11JQZM9XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM9S8Y8#wasThisHelpful","RVFP11JQZM9XZ","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a terribly addictive character driven thriller with a hard sexy edge and a really intriguing and clever storyline.Grace is a prostitute – known in the business as Stella, she caters to the whims and desires of her clients daily. When another girl is found murdered Stella becomes embroiled in the mystery of her death and as she moves ever closer to the truth, things are about to get very dangerous.What I loved most about this is the beautiful mash up of mystery, thriller and real life drama and the sheer depth of character Ava Marsh brings to the people you will meet within the pages. It is dark for sure, unrelenting in its descriptive prose, with an authentic look at life for a call girl, touching on realistic issues and yet also managing to tell a stonking good story at the same time.Multi-layered, it is endlessly fascinating as we peel away the surface to what lies beneath especially with relation to the motivations and personality traits of the characters. Grace is such an alluring and provocative character to follow as she tells her story and you begin to understand her more.If you are not a fan of graphic sexual content this one will definitely NOT be for you. The author has not pulled any punches when it comes to the realism of the world she is showing you, whilst it is never gratuitous and always speaks to the story, it IS gritty and honestly described which some may find disturbing. For me it was extremely necessary to the plot and indeed gave the whole tale a definitive and credible edge which would have been lost should the author have tried to mollycoddle.Overall a really really terrific debut – almost impossible to put down once you start I sincerely hope that we will meet Grace again. She has, I think, a lot more to say.Highly Recommended*source; netgalley*","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MJLH6RWSN5IN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWKNA5S#wasThisHelpful","R2MJLH6RWSN5IN","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok so the very first thing I want to say about “Rosie Potter” is that it is hilarious. So funny – I spent an awful lot of the time either smiling or giggling as Rosie wakes up one morning to discover she is dead, sets off to discover why and finds out all sorts of things about her life and those in it that she never even suspected.Not usually being a fan of this type of book (the whole “Dead girl” aspect having drawn me in to read it) I was genuinely surprised and delighted at how much I enjoyed it. That is down to the gorgeous flow of the writing and Rosie herself – a beautifully drawn character who just pops off the page and makes you fall in love with her. There is a bittersweet poignancy as well to the knowledge that she is gone, still she is vibrantly beautifully alive while you are reading her story.Very intriguing as well – it had me considering what it would be like to suddenly be a “Fly on the wall” and see what people were really like – Rosie’s journey of discovery leads her to all kinds of secrets and it is truly addictive as you wait to find out what happened on that night and, indeed, what may happen next. In between the fits of laughter there is an alluring emotional undercurrent running throughout the story which gives it a great depth even through the fluffier lighter moments.Kudos to Kate Winter for turning a story about a girl struck down in the prime of her life and making it into a witty, insightful and truly life affirming tale – considering the subject matter there is simply nothing at all depressing about this book – you will come out the other side of it feeling great. Ok yes as I said, bittersweet perhaps but still, this novel is definitely one you should read if you need a bit of a lift, want to be genuinely entertained and feel the need to leave the duller aspects of life behind you for a while and spend a few hours with a smile on your face.Loved it.*source publisher review copy uk*","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EFF3HM51FPJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LT8OBKW#wasThisHelpful","R1EFF3HM51FPJ6","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow I read this fast. Completely compelling from the very first page this is a beautifully written novel, an authentic and intriguing family drama that had me completely hooked.It is about the breakdown of a marriage, the heartache and sometimes ultimate life affirmation this can bring, a story about how we can never really know each other. This one truly spoke to me – the couple in this tale have been together a long time, yet here they are in absolute crisis. Something I have been through myself recently, it touched a nerve but only in a good way – I related so much to Beth,especially as a lot of her thoughts and emotions so closely mirrored my own.On the opposite side of that is Adam – a man who cheated on his wife not once but twice, the second time leading to their split. Nothing is ever as simple as that though,despite his actions I ended up feeling quite sympathetic towards him – the author does a really terrific job of delving beneath the surface of her characters, showing that in anything there are two sides to the story.There is even more depth to it to be had in the form of Meg, their daughter, who is now grown but this does not lessen the impact that all this has on her. As more secrets begin to surface, it is utterly engaging and really gripping.The best part is the emotional impact – you feel right alongside the characters in this novel, you may take sides but in the end we can really only ever be who we are – a truth that Fionnuala Kearney obviously knows for sure.Beautifully done. Kudos.Happy Reading Folks!*Source: Netgalley**","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6Y9EDCS6QYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0008102937#wasThisHelpful","R2K6Y9EDCS6QYF","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came across this book by chance – gatecrashing the launch party while I was at another across the road  – I was lured in by that gorgeous cover, so I purchased a copy, met the author, got it signed and could not resist reading it almost straight away.So glad I did. Starborn is a beautifully imagined fantasy tale with some really engaging characters and a rich and deep mythology running through it that is very compelling and utterly addictive.The world building is fantastic, done intelligently and with a touch of class, as Kyndra sets off on a journey of discovery you are right there alongside her observing and learning about the expansive places and people beyond her small village as she does. Legend and superstition abound, the story unfolds in glorious vivid ways, the characters are immensely intriguing – Kyndra herself is a perfect anchor for the reader to follow along with and this is a story you can sink right into and leave the real world behind for a while.This is old school fantasy in a lot of ways but brought into the modern era with a delicate touch, really well written, taking some classic genre staples and giving them a new edgy and gripping focus – a real page turner. Plenty of heart stopping action, some purely emotional moments and a cast of eclectic and alluring characters to give it all focus and life.Overall then really terrific. The ending was such that I am REALLY looking forward to whatever comes next. This comes highly recommended from me for fans of Fantasy – taking it back to its roots and making me remember why I loved the genre in the first place.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKTMJEGXVKKR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NLFVQGI#wasThisHelpful","R2EKTMJEGXVKKR","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Killing of Bobbi Lomax is a superb crime debut – multi layered, with absolutely fascinating characters, terrific descriptive prose and a really really intriguing tale. Set in “God” country in the 80’s Cal Moriarty manages to bring that time and place to vivid stunning life giving this novel a terrific atmosphere and telling a beautifully managed and addictive mystery story.This is old school storytelling set in an old school world – the detectives having to go about things the old fashioned way, the age of super electronics and internet still years away – this gives such an added depth to the mystery element, an almost Christie-esque feel to it that is both wonderful and nostalgic.Add to that some remarkably authentic and well drawn characters – I adored Clark Houseman, such an engaging and sometimes hilarious protagonist, I think his parts of the book were my favourite – also, rare book dealer – what else needs to be said? Our detectives are a superb duo – so beautifully normal and casting a wry eye over events as they try to unravel the various elements and track down a bomber before he can strike again.Overall then a rich, diverse and gorgeously written page turner with some interesting themes set in a captivating time period with a riveting and highly stimulating story.Highly RecommendedSource: Advanced Reading Copy**","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DSC6OVMPQW8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWQSBS6#wasThisHelpful","R2DSC6OVMPQW8T","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well I LOVED this one. In a kind of a love hate fashion. It broke my heart into little pieces at the end there…and somewhere around the midway point as well.In Feed we are post zombie apocalypse – the dead no longer stay dead due to a virus that arose from curing the common cold. In this world bloggers are the newshounds, traditional news reporting being practically over. Licensed, followed, life for a blogger is all about the market share and the ratings. Enter Georgia and Shaun Mason – invited to follow a presidential campaign. During this they discover a conspiracy that may cost them everything.For a zombie novel this packed a hell of an emotional punch – whilst being written in a very matter of fact almost documentary style for the most part, there is a brilliant emotive edge embedded into every single paragraph. I loved the Masons – their relationship, with each other and the world around them, the ever expanding cast of characters they interact with all being very well drawn and intriguing.One of the huge strengths of this novel for me was the world building – descriptively brilliant, feeling authentic and realistic in its scientific basis but still very much focusing on the human aspect – the two sides to the coin so to speak are interwoven in fine fashion to give a solid backdrop to the drama going on.Character building is just as good – I adored both Georgia and Shaun (And Buffy, Rick, Steve, et al) and became very emotionally involved with them during the reading. The author does a fine job of making you care and gives a great mix of action and thrills to keep you on the edge of your seat a lot of the time.The themes explored are as wide as they are deep – reporting integrity, political agenda’s, rights and responsibilities in a world gone mad – using characters whose job it is to get the news out there as the main protagonists for this story works extraordinarily well and allows many different aspects to be explored. It was fascinating, scary, sad and extremely intriguing from first page to last.All in all then definitely on my favourites list. But oh that ending killed me. I am torn between diving straight into “Deadline”, book two of the series and hiding under my duvet for a couple of weeks until my heart rate slows. We’ll see.Happy Reading Folks!**Source: Trilogy boxset purchased via Amazon UK**","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHIY8N9VDM3RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PPDBSK#wasThisHelpful","RHIY8N9VDM3RL","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So a 5th outing for DI Damen Brook then, one of my favourite literary detectives and this one packed a hell of a punch – straight into the action, no time to breathe and off we went.This instalment centres around a whole bunch of missing girls who nobody realises are actually genuinely missing. Until Damen Brook, avoiding another rather boring assignment, sits up and takes notice. At the same time the reader is given a snapshot of one of the missing girls – Caitlin – what is happening to her is horrific, violent and will have you begging Brook to save her. But there is a lot more going on here and he will have his work cut out for him as he unravels a mystery with a heart of darkness.The Brook novels are always really terrifically constructed to give the most emotional impact – in the case of “A Killing Moon” this is achieved through Caitlin’s character and through that of others who are caught up in this thing and you have a genuine sense of urgency as you are immersed in the tale. As time runs out for Caitlin and a whole load of other things start muddying the waters, it is addictive and totally heart stopping.I do love Brook as a character -whilst he is in a way the quintessential “cop with issues” in his case it does not feel at all cliched. Brook embraces his flaws, is open about his previous mental health issues and with each novel takes a step further away from them – Steven Dunne has given his main protagonist an actual healing process, a journey that the reader can get behind and root for. An authentic one at that – he takes steps forward and steps back like the rest of us, there is a realism and gritty irony to that thread of the story that reflects  life very well.Brook is not alone – the author surrounds him with many other well drawn and intriguing characters (Angie is going to end up being a member of the team right? RIGHT?) and the mystery element is, as always, pitch perfect and often surprising. I’m willing to bet that a fair few readers are going to let out an actual cheer at the end of this one – it was a fantastic ending to what had been a scintillating read.Really really excellent crime fiction. Roll on book 6.*Source; Bookbridgr UK**","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RJM5GCNJQUL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NT7YOTY#wasThisHelpful","R3RJM5GCNJQUL7","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a HUGE fan of the first novel in this series, so to say I was happy to get to read the next one a little early is putting it mildly. And for me it was worth every second of the wait.Silver and friends have escaped the immediate clutches of the King and are on the run. Decisions have to be made and everyone is looking to Silver to make them, she however is not sure she is the right person for the job.Renegade is very addictive – whilst Kerry Wilkinson expands and deepens the mythology he has also written a bit of a thriller, a bit of  road trip drama and given our characters a lot of emotional upset to deal with. He keeps things rocking along at a heck of a pace, introducing new places and people, giving Silver a lot to handle and solidifying and intensifying the relationships between our core group. It is engaging and compelling throughout.I am entirely in love with this series, one of those times I can’t really tell you why – although it probably is mostly to do with Silver as a character who is a gorgeous mix of strong independent woman and ditzy teenager. You just want to follow along with her, a bit like her fellow runaways – one of those brilliantly written characters that just pop off the page and become very real.I’m being careful not to say too much about the story itself just in case you have not started this series yet – but I will say it is excellent – great writing, great characters, terrific world building, at least several bags of maltesers worth of reading joy.The end drove me nuts – yep thanks for that Mr Wilkinson – now the wait begins for the finale. I’m going to be first in the queue.

"This was quite an intriguing read - the first in a series featuring Inspector Amaia Salazar, beautifully translated and a great piece of Crime Fiction.My favourite thing about it was the mythology aspect - exploring local customs and legends in an area that I know very little about - I always find it fascinating when reading a novel set in a different culture and the author brings this to life in a really terrific way. There is also a historical element that was highly engaging.As far as the police procedural element goes, it is fairly standard stuff, still extremely readable and if you are a lover of Crime Fiction this will hit the mark in a lot of ways. Salazar is very well drawn - another aspect of this I liked was the way the author filled in her background, fleshing her out in a way that gets the reader caught up in her world. Compelling and often dark, there is a lot to appeal here.Overall then a good solid crime read, one that I would recommend. Certainly it is a series I shall be following along with.Many thanks to the lovely crew at Killer Reads for sending me a copy of this novel - another huge plus for book collectors and hoarders such as I am is that it is a beautiful hardback with a stunning cover.Happy Reading Folks**Source: Publisher review copy UK**","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E04XCP948LZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=000752532X#wasThisHelpful","R2E04XCP948LZH","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well Jeez Louise, what a darkly unrelenting, brilliantly emotional and utterly authentic book that was. This one incidentally is another one that author Louise O Neill insisted I read – yep thanks Louise. As with “Bright Places” you’ve managed to find me another story that has left me emotionally traumatised. You and I are going to fall out (keep ’em coming)So “Weightless” then deals in a unique way with the subject of bullying in the modern era, but it is so much more than that. A picture of life in a town where everyone knows everyone else, into this scenario comes Carolyn, new to the town, new to the school who immediately gains popularity and notoriety. But here is the thing when you are an interloper into a place like this, that has its own rhythms, a way of life that is smooth and knowable – make one wrong move and there is nowhere to run.Written in a style that allows you to see things both from a distance and close up – our narrator is never named, she is “we” – observing these rhythms, sometimes involved, sometimes not, painting a picture for the reader of a place, a time and a girl – a picture that is utterly compelling, often melancholy and leading inexorably towards a conclusion that will hit you right where it hurts. You are aware very early on that things will not turn out well for Carolyn but the writing and the construction of this story is so vivid and engaging that you still kind of don’t see it coming.I was enthralled and often horrified, the thing that struck me most about “Weightless” is the sheer atmosphere of the piece – you are immersed into this town and this way of life without even realising it. Sarah Bannan has a way with words that just works on so many levels that I still feel like I’ve been turned inside out emotionally. It is possibly the most definitive fiction I’ve read with bullying as one of its themes – clever use of language, stark realism and a refusal to sugar coat any part of it makes this an absolute must read for teenagers and their parents alike.Our narrator is really a most terrific creation considering you have no idea who she is – whilst she makes intensely canny observations about the things going on and what comes later, she also serves to remind the reader that nothing is ever black and white. Shades of grey are everywhere, nowhere more than during life in High School, where despite the cliques and the popularity stakes and everything else, ultimately they are all just children still – coming of age in today’s world where social media and constant communication means that nothing ever belongs solely just to you but is often out there for the world to see. She also reminds us of the benefit of hindsight and how nuances of memory can change things from reality into something much more dramatic. EVERYTHING is magnified beyond the norm during these formative years, everything felt more deeply, the end of the world caused by what to an adult might be a most minor thing. By writing the book in the way she has, using a really genuinely intelligent storytelling technique the author has created something different and in this readers opinion very special.Go read it. Go read it now.Highly Recommended!Happy Reading Folks!**source: Purchased copy via Amazon UK**","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21F4EXNX1A73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4TDDFA#wasThisHelpful","R21F4EXNX1A73","A34NG31NRN7WJL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34NG31NRN7WJL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This leash is a little different than the usual dog walking leash in a couple of ways. The first thing to be aware of is that I would not advise using this with a dog that isn't well behaved or trained to walk politely in public to begin with. I got the 47"" leash and that translates to only about three feet of real lead distance from your hand to the dog's collar or harness connection. If you have a rambunctious dog, he's going to dragging your arm off. Secondly, the actual clasp is not heavy duty, so again, a rambunctious, runaway dog is at risk of breaking the snap.The reasons I actually like this leash are simple. The padded handle is very comfortable and the entire leash is very lightweight in use and in my dog travel kit in the car. With a well trained dog who already knows how to heel, sits at the curb when I stop walking, and doesn't habitually pull on his end of the leash, this unit is very handy to grab for a quick run into vet or for use at a coffee shop when I want my dog closer than I might on a regular walk. It's also a good training tool for the refresher course at home for heel and sitting politely before taking the dogs out in public places.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AGV3LR3J0CU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GGU0SQ#wasThisHelpful","R2AGV3LR3J0CU","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fast sprouting seed mix - for the ones that do germinate into actual grass. We are in deep East Texas and I put this Sun and Shade mix out at the same time as a bag of the Scotts Perennial Rye Grass seed. We've had rain every day and the Rye Grass on one side of the paddock has taken off and is thriving in lush clumps. On the other side of the paddock, this stuff is not quite as motivated. Within five days, we have about two-thirds of it sprouting and  the rest is looking sort of blue and sad in the dirt.I don't do a lot of babysitting with grass. I am a firm believer that it should go in the ground, drink water, absorb the sun and grow. If I have to hand-hold grass, then it needs to live in a pretty pot in the house and produce amazing flowers in trade. Since this is just a ground cover and future food for the Donkey, I am only going to water it and wait. In the future, I will stick to the Rye grass version though since it seems to like our soil better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLESMTHRB2WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CA42ULQ#wasThisHelpful","R2FLESMTHRB2WL","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these for one reason - dog nose prints all over the foyer floor to ceiling windows and the front door. With six dogs here, those windows stay dirty and the smell of Windex etc makes my stomach turn, so I tend to put off window cleaning as long as possible. These wipes work really well for my purposes. The doggie stuff came right off with minimal elbow grease and the glass is actually clean. There's no film left behind, but a few streaks that did require a light once over with a second wipe. My biggest reason for buying these again is there is no ammonia scent to make me nauseous.

"I've been testing several of the Luseta products (shampoo, conditioner, oil treatment and masque conditioners) with different results - some that I have received free from Luseta directly and some that I purchased out right and I have narrowed it down to the ones that really work well for me and the ones that just don't. This set of Keratin Smothing shampoo and conditioner is one I will continue to use and buy again in the future.The scent is fresh and not heavy or cloying. The shampoo leathers nicely without creating a bubble bath effect on my head. The conditioner feels like silk and just coats every strand of my hair with just four pumps. That's a big deal for me - my hair is very thick and reaches the middle of my back. Dry my hair feels light, there's no frizz and it shines the sun without any additional styling products - just hair spray.

"This looks like food rather than mush. There are square chunks of meaty bits and what appear to be carrot and potato pieces in each can. I split a can between two of my senior (11 years old) dogs, mixed with their dry kibble and water. Both of them really like this and I haven't noticed any extra flatulence or digestive upset at all after a week.

"I love the light, fresh scent of this masque. I have very thick, color treated hair that reaches the middle of my back and I take good care of it. Working outside with horses every day means my hair is constantly exposed to sun, wind and dust so it can get dry fast.

"The medium sized non slip mat fills about half the bottom of our regular size, traditional guest bathtub. We put it in the exact center so you can stand on it to shower and that is just right. There are no instructions included with this mat and while the installation would seem simple enough at first glance, it's more than tossing it down and done. If the tub is dry, the suction cups don't stick. If there is any sort of soap or shampoo/conditioner residue on the bottom of the tub, the suction cups don't stick. Scrub the tub and run some water over it and the mat, then put the mat in place and it adheres just fine.

"This is my first experience with a BLU brand phone and my first experience with a dual SIM card phone, but not the first trip down the aisle with Android phones. My current phone is a Fire Phone and previously I used an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note, so I had an idea of what to expect and what I hoped to find in the BLU Studio Energy 2 that is/was missing from the other two. BLU definitely hit a homerun here.The physical phone is a bit heavier than some of the other flagship phones out there, but with the big battery that's to be expected. The body is a deep grey color with snap off back that is tight enough to require deliberate effort to remove. Inside you find the dual micro SIM card slots and the SD card slot. All three installed easily for me and worked immediately with no drama. We initially tested this phone using a prepaid AT&T Go Phone SIM card from a local store. No problems at all and the service was going and we were making and receiving calls & text messages in ten minutes.The battery in this thing is simply amazing. Before installing a SIM card, we charged it over night and turned it on at 6pm on Tuesday. My husband and I both used it as a mini tablet on WiFi only - we played games, streamed music from Amazon Prime, watched videos, surfed the net, did email, plugged in a Google account and downloaded apps, took photos, Bluetooth connected to the Echo and the car. For two full days without ever charging the phone! On Friday morning at 7:30am it still had a 51% charge left. Even after installing the SIM card and making calls, I didn't recharge the phone until Saturday morning.The calls are clear and clean both incoming and out going. The signal strength is solid - that certainly will vary depending on your location and service provider. BLU has some of the best built in ringtones I've ever seen in a cell phone - the rendition of Hallelujah is lovely. Adding and making my own ringtones for each contact was painless. We haven't tested our European SIM card yet for calls, but the phone recognized it with no issues. The camera is pretty good and has a variety of settings to choose from if you don't want to eat up space with a photo app. One thing I really like is noticeably less bloatware on this phone than the Samsung Note I had previously. The 1.5 GB Ram and quad core processor shine through - with 5 web pages open and switching between three active apps, I have not seen any sluggish behavior or stuttering at all. It just works - even while downloading several songs and playing Angry Birds at the same time with a text conversation going.BLU has thoughtfully included a rubberized bumper style cover, screen protector, earbuds and two charging cables with the phone. It's ready to be a part of your life immediately. Just sign in, pop in your SIM card and go. For the price, features, and the freedom of being an unlocked world phone, combined with this awesome battery - I am converted. There is no reason to buy an over priced phone from the carriers ever again. I'm keeping this one and buying a second one for my husband.******* UPDATE NOV 7, 2015 *******My husband took this phone with him to Amsterdam this past week and it worked with no problems. He also used the Magic Jack app in conjunction with our existing Magic Jack account and the free WiFi at the airport - worked perfectly. No international minutes used on either SIM card that way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11P8ZJZ4BICZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01686OYKQ#wasThisHelpful","R11P8ZJZ4BICZP","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure what is really ""new"" about this recipe. It tastes like pretty much any other yellow mustard on the market today. Unless you're eating a brown mustard or a hot mustard,  there just isn't a lot of difference between the big brand names once it's on a burger or ham sandwich.

"This is the first Luseta hair product that I truly don't like and have been displeased with. The instructions are pretty straight forward - rub on towel dried damp hair to moisturize and treat etc. The oil smells nice, but I immediately thought of mineral oil when I touched it. It just feels sticky and greasy in the hand. A little research on the ingredients and sure enough - mineral oil. On my long hair this was a mess, even in a small amount. My hair dried looking flat and...well...greasy. Enough so that I had to wear it up in a bun all day so people wouldn't think I had dirty hair! I am giving this three stars because it did make my hair soft and my neighbor used it on her short, very straight hair and had a much better result. Her hair was soft and smooth and looked heavily conditioned, but not greasy. My results are, at best two stars. Her results were a happy four stars.

"I love stories of Old Hollywood and of course, the classic movies from that era - the 1930s through the 1950s. All the glitz and glamour and no overt vulgarity and muted violence. The scandalous real life behavior behind-the-scenes remained where it belonged - behind closed doors and in private rather than splashed on every front page for profit. I was expecting more of a biographical book with All The Stars in the Heavens and it's like a cross between a fiction novel and a tabloid.I have never read anything else by Adriana Trigiani and to be honest, I don't care for her style as evidenced by this novel. The dialogue in many places is difficult to follow and can run on long enough to lose track of who is saying what. There are some characters and scenes that feel very one dimensional and flat when the circumstances should be very emotional and involved. The book would have been much better if it had been trimmed significantly - maybe 100 pages shorter. As with any fictionalized account of real people's stories, there is certainly some speculation and guess work by the author as to what may or may not have happened, been said, been felt or thought by Ms. Young, Mr Gable, Mr Tracy or any of the other people in Loretta Young's world. Take what you read with a grain of salt. I just came away from this book feeling slightly sleazy - like I had eavesdropped on tacky mean girl gossip.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CWO6ZX6WGFYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062319191#wasThisHelpful","R2CWO6ZX6WGFYB","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have tried several of the Luseta hair products over the past couple of months and while I really like the overall quality of everything, I have been searching for my favorite shampoo and conditioner from their varieties. I liked the tea tree & argan oil, but not the scent. I bought the Tangle Free and it really works, but again...not my favorite scent. ( I love the way the Suave Moroccan Infusion smells.)This Argan Oil moisture version is better than the other two. The scent is much more subtle than the other two Luseta versions - softer. The shampoo is a creamy white with an almost iridescent, shimmer to it. It doesn't take much to generate a real lather - two pumps for me. My hair is very thick and reaches to the middle of my back. The conditioner is similar in color and texture and the bottles are almost identical. If you're in a rush, it could be easy to mix them up. Luseta definitely needs to change up the color on one of the pumps so you have a visual cue. My hair is soft, shiny and has lots of bounce after using this combination. It looks good and feels good to the touch.  I would be happy to keep this in my shower and my guest shower.

We have one on the big iron BBQ pit that has survived the extreme heat and sun of the Texas summer and one on the big generator.

I'm tired of cleaning it after every storm and wiping dust and leaves off it.The chair cover has four straps to fit around the chair legs so you can adjust the fit to some degree. There are two sewn on handles on the front and back of it - I really like that. This is a large, thick cover and the handles make pulling it up and off just a bit less cumbersome.

"We keep gloves of this type on hand, so to speak, all the time. I use them around the barn with the horses and at home for a lot of different things.

"We tried the geranium-rose scent version for our first foray into Poo-Pourri territory. It smells lovely, but it's very strong in an enclosed space - a water closet type toilet separated from the rest of the bathroom for example. After flushing, the Poo-Pourri scent lingers a long time, so you better like it.The instructions say spray three to five times into the bowl before you go and it will capture the undesirable odors. This definitely works as advertised, no question! It puts a sort of white film/layer over the water which then covers the Poo, encasing any fumes before they escape. I think it's better suited for a traditional open bathroom set-up where everything is all in one large, open space so the Poo-Pourri scent isn't so concentrated. It's strong enough to make both my husband and me sneeze.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK5USOJVG2S2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW5YVS8#wasThisHelpful","RK5USOJVG2S2X","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using a 2009 17.9"" Gateway Windows 7 laptop happily all these years until just recently when it began to cough and sputter and generally show signs of wanting to die. I nursed it for several months while shopping for a replacement and suddenly this Toshiba L55T-C/5388 appeared from Vine. Serendipity. I am writing my review from the Toshiba actually rather than my tablet which what I've had to resort to for the past few months - that's a nice change actually. My initial impressions after a week of daily use are pretty good overall with some niggling design complaints for the physical hardware.First - for the record ... I'm not a gamer - just a regular person using my laptop to write articles for the local newspaper now and then, do a lot of email, a lot of online shopping, some social media stuff, watch some videos now and then, sort and store serious quantities of photos and average net surfing. If I want to listen to music, I tend to use Alexa (the Echo) for that rather than my computer and we watch movies on the big television around here - though sometimes I'll use my laptop instead of my tablet for tv shows etc when I'm traveling.This Toshiba has a very nice high definition screen and I haven't noticed any fuzziness or blurred screen edges etc. The HD video I downloaded from Amazon as a test sample looked as crisp and bright on the laptop as it did on our Samsung 1080p television. The sound clarity is very good for dialogue and background music - the full speaker running across the length of the front of the machine is really good and the volume is quite loud.Additionally, the touchscreen is responsive, but not so sensitive that just brushing it will mess your page up or close an open tab. I did run into a couple of sessions where the screen would go to black as I was scrolling rapidly by touch - this seems to be a Windows 10 issue when using the new Edge browser and not a laptop physical issue. I haven't had a repeat of this in the Chrome Browser in a week. (It could also have been a fluke)The battery life on this computer is freaking amazing! I've been using it for almost 3 hours now for a variety of things and it's currently sitting at 74% with an estimated 6 hours and 35 minutes run time left. By three hours of use, my Gateway would have already been at 10% and that's before it started having problems. Thus far, I have used this laptop for a five hour straight run - writing, with email refreshing in the background and music playing as a test at the same time and the battery barely hit 52% when I was finished working.Uploading and transferring files from both the cloud and my old computer hasn't been as big a hassle as I expected. The USB 2.0 thumb drive I had handy worked just fine and everything came over intact. The cloud transfer was a bit stickier just because Windows 10 now wants to make unzipping files more complicated than before. (Thanks Microsoft) Additionally, the DVD RW drive works fine and I have had no problems at all uploading the software for my 3D printer and downloading files from the net for it. For those that are interested, unlike other reviewers, I had zero problems uploading and am now using Google Chrome as my browser etc. I've included a photo of my basic screen - the Chrome icon is right there. You just have download Chrome and then unzip it manually.My one star deduction is for physical comfort. This is a light computer compared to my previous one and I appreciate that. However, the edges are not rounded off. They are sharp, square and pointy. This means that as you are typing - doesn't matter if it's on your lap or a desk - after awhile, these pointy bits will dig into your wrists or arms and this HURTS. My five hour marathon the other day left a little indention on my right wrist. That is just ridiculous. The second design flaw is the touch pad. It is very large and sits perfectly flush with the base of the laptop. This is pretty, but you tend to brush over it as you are actually typing and that can make the cursor jump - now you're typing in an entirely new location. These two issues are obnoxious enough that I am now looking for a way to create a little rubber bumper for the front edge of the computer and a wireless mouse.In general, this is a nice replacement for my old workhorse Gateway - I've grown used to the smaller screen because Toshiba has made it very easy to enlarge the font and any image on this screen. The 8 gig of ram makes multi tasking and switching from things prompt and thus far, I haven't experienced any lagginess. There is some bloatware pre-installed (like with any computer), but it is easy to get rid of. WIndows 10 requires a learning curve of course, but that's not the laptop's fault. Four solid stars after almost ten days and if that changes, I'll update.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FFQBBLCZBV9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015806RJO#wasThisHelpful","R3FFQBBLCZBV9B","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I inherited a four piece set of the Cutco serving utensils with the pearl white handles. This slotted spoon is really useful for a number of things.

"Finally a product made of actual recycled materials that makes perfect sense and is fully functional AND is made of more than a token amount of recycled waste. Even the box these Hefty trash bags are in is made of recycled card board - nicely done. The bags themselves are .9 mils thicks - exactly the same thickness as the non recycled Glad 13 gallon bags we've been using and these bags feel just as durable as the other ones. They have a seam at the bottom to help prevent tears and leaks. The drawstring pulls smoothly and easily with no tearing even when the bag is full.

"Frasier is one of the rare shows that remains funny and smart even 10, 12 and more years later. The writing is intelligent, the chemistry between the cast is palpable, the humor never relies on lazy vulgarity or violence, and there is always a sense of both the urbane oneophile and the Lazboy beer drinker in every episode.

"Wow. I have tried a few times to remove this ugly yellow/brown stain of unknown origins from our cream color wool carpet and nothing has worked. This mark has been here for years - I noticed it after a house guest left in 2012, so I'm not joking about it being set in for a long time. I suspect her dog did something unspeakable to the carpet and rather than clean it immediately, she simply moved a chair over the spot. Two weeks later, I moved the chair back and voila... (See the photo) So I thought I would give this Rug Doctor Platinum Spot remover a try. It can't get any worse and it certainly won't fail any more spectacularly than the myriad of other products I've used in the last three years.The directions are as simple as can be - spray generously, agitate the stain from the edges working toward the center and then blot with a paper towel until mostly dry. Allrighty. First thing I noticed is the pleasant scent - instead of smelling like dry cleaning chemicals or outright poison, the Rug Doctor smells a little like air freshener and there wasn't a cloud of noxious fumes giving me a headache. I used a simple textured dishrag to agitate and scrub the stained area with my hands. I spent about 8 minutes actually working on the spot - this thing has been here for years and is seriously set. My dishrag came away brown!! The ick on the carpet was on my rag rather than my carpet. I was so shocked, I sat there staring and almost forgot to do the blotting thing. Blotting with the paper towels got a bit more of the stain up and then no more dirt, just damp from the remainder of the cleaning solution.It's been several hours and the carpet is dry - the stain is gone. There's no smell and no trace of it ever having been there. I am amazed. My husband walked in and couldn't' remember exactly where it had been - so there is no trace of it left. See the photo - it pretty much says it all. I used this on a mud spot in the car and it worked just as well. If you have pets or kids, this needs to be in your cleaning supply pantry. I know it will be in mine from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2COPSVZ7Q77DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KL6ZSU0#wasThisHelpful","R2COPSVZ7Q77DT","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These smell meaty, so whatever the flavor coating is, it's pretty potent. My dogs were intently focused as I opened the package and broke off pieces for each of them to try. The three pieces are covered in round nubs that are supposed to facilitate teeth and gum cleaning & are shaped like a trident and easily broken into thirds. The ingredients include wheat and glycerin as the first two items with soy further down, so if you have a wheat or soy allergic dog, you'll want to steer clear. Additionally, these have seaweed meal and alfalfa - I am not sure what, if any benefit alfalfa has for dogs.My guys like these for the most part. Two of the six dogs weren't interested in a second piece. I think the nubby bits may actually be hard to chew and deal with for the senior dogs - both of the 11 year olds were the ones who declined seconds. The youngest two dogs really enjoyed them though - one is 9 and one is 4. So one star deduction for the primary ingredient being wheat and being too hard for senior dogs to eat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP2KF8QB2LVYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DH4LRK#wasThisHelpful","RP2KF8QB2LVYI","A2O421DTA8J0RW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O421DTA8J0RW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a pretty decent pistol cleaning rod. The handle allows you to get a good grip, but doesn't render the rod unwieldy or add extra weight. This kit comes with five patches and one .45 caliber jag, so it is actually ready to use immediately.  The one star deduction is because the wording on the package label is misleading. It indicates that this kit is ready to go for both a .22 and .45 caliber pistol and includes the jag for both. It does NOT have the .22 jag.

"The Flamin' Buffalo Chicken bites are a miss for me,  but my teen nephew loves them. These are softer than traditional jerky and the basic ingredients are pretty straight forward. The mouth feel is a little drier and  chewier than expected. The actual taste is mild - no ""flamin'"" spice here and there's no weird aftertaste at least. But these pieces are very salty. My 2.85 ounce bag had 16 bite size pieces of buffalo coated chicken - each bag is supposed to hold three servings, so 5 small pieces in a single serving.

"Wow. It takes a helluva a story to keep me reading late into the night and thinking about the characters later the next day (hours) after having stopped reading. Fallen Land is a rare combination of harsh and beautiful, terrifying and hopeful and it will break your heart and leave you satisfied at the same time. Taylor Brown has been compared to Cormac McCarthy and that is presumptuous, but close. Mr Brown has a similar ability to see the root of a man's base desire and show his true colors in a splash of hypnotic storytelling.The attention to period details is critical to Fallen Land and as a result this book may move a little slowly for some readers. I found the pace to be exacting and before I realized it, I was caught up in the anxiety, exhaustion, hunger and cold just as Callum, Ava and Reiver were. I definitely appreciated that Mr Brown never forgot the basic fact that the horses required care, rest and food just as the humans - a critical point many authors neglect.

"I am excited about using these lights to decorate for the holidays. They will look amazing and with them being solar powered I can put them is so many places that I haven't been able to in past years. I remember I would hold my breath as I opened my light bill after the holidays because I knew it was going to be high. Since I'm making the switch to primarily solar lights this is a stress that I won't have. Plus, if you've ever put lights in a live tree you know how drying the heat from the old bulbs can be. This can be very dangerous. These cold light source bulbs don't get hot so I can use them with confidence is so many places that you only dreamed of with the old traditional lights.

"With so many health benefits and coconut oil having a high smoke point it is great for baking, stir frying, or as a dairy free replacement for butter. With so many recipes on line there is no need to purchase expensive creamer.  I like to  Make my own with 1/4 cup coconut oil and 2 tablespoons of raw honey. I blend them together in my bullet with a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Plus, coconut oil works great for many of your skin care needs.

"When my Meditation Gift Set arrived I was pleased to see that each one was individually boxed. I am always surprised at how strong the scent of candles made with essential oils are when I open the tin. However, when I lit the candle I found it quiet pleasant and calming as it melted. I have had one of the lavender ones burning for twelve hours so far and my house smells amazing plus there are still many mores hours of burning time left. I tried both of the scents that came in the set and found that they both offer a nice aroma that is not overpowering.

"I have cooked with cast iron since I took up house keeping more than thirty years ago and have a large collection of skillets and other handled pieces. The smaller of the two fit my smallest pans, those with narrow handles, as well as the handles of my cornbread pan and ten and half inch flat griddle. The larger one fit most of my handles and was a bit snug on my largest curved handles but could be slid on a hot pan coming out the oven with great care. It fit the other handles with ease. The lift assist was large enough to fit all of my skillets with this handle. I've been burned over the years by grabbing a hot handle and know how painful this can be.

"These labels are perfect for all your labeling needs around the house. Although it may be easy to tell white sugar from brown sugar at a quick glance it isn't always easy to tell white sugar from salt or powdered sugar from bread flour, etc so  I used several of these labels to label my dry goods in my cupboards to make it easy to tell what is in each container without having to remove each one and open it. The marker that is included has two different tips. Just pull it out and flip it around to change from fine to wide.

"I loved taking my children whitewater rafting, hiking, and swimming in the pools below the waterfalls in the Mountain Rest, SC area. What I didn't love was all the weight in our packs.

"What can a young pastor expect in a new parish in the first years of ministry? How can he meet the high expectations of the congregation? What can he do to manage the relationships between the Church leadership and the pastoral team? Taking a leaf from Paul's exhortation to young Timothy, author Jason Helopoulos believes in the importance of a good start for it often sets the pace for the subsequent years in ministry. How can one cope with the ups and downs of pastoral work?New pastors need encouragement, especially in the first few years. Unlike books written by retiring pastors at the end of their ministry vocation, or experts from seminaries, this book is very much written by a young pastor for fellow young pastors. A newbie book for newbie pastors. Helopoulos is associate pastor at University Reformed Church in East Lansing, Michigan. He begins slowly with the meaning of calling, defining it as something distinct and primarily with pastoral care. Three elements are essential for the call: 1) Internal call; 2) Approval by the people; 3) Confirmation in the Church. He has advice for those starting out as senior pastor, assistant pastor, youth pastor, and church planter. There are lots of very practical tips on the role of each position.The bulk of the handbook is devoted to the encouragement section. Using a baseball metaphor, readers learn that ministry comprises three loves: love for Christ, love for the people, and love for the Word. We are encouraged to care first for our families before we devote our time to the flock. Know the history of the Church. Know the greatest need of oneself is personal holiness. Tips include time management; listening; visitation; knowing self; delegate; dealing with complaints; silent suffering; hospital visitations; and many more. These chapters on encouragement are short on details but highlights key helpful points. Finally, there are pitfalls for young pastors to avoid. From idealistic zeal and trying to do too many things too fast, to sermon delivery and control, many of the struggles described would resonate with even the most seasoned pastors. I appreciate the last section, ""Joys of Ministry"" which is a core component in pastoral work. The joy of the Lord will be our strength. the moment we lose this joy, it's time either to leave or to take a sabbatical.In an age where pastoral turnover in churches are getting higher and pastoral tenures shorter, this book serves as a useful guide for pastors both new and old. Pastoral work is never easy, but also not impossible. A good pastor takes time to develop. One of the most important points is a good pastoral-church leadership relationship. Without this, it is impossible for the pastor to grow and for the Church to flourish. I warmly recommend this book for the reading and reference of new seminary graduates and pastors to be.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Baker Books and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Being present and available sounds easy and a great thing to say. Practicing it however is anything but that. In fact, people who recognize the challenges of availability will soon find out that it has complex implications, time challenges, and also a problem. Problems like how much is too much; how little is too little; how appropriate is appropriate; and how can it be a gift rather than a bane to receivers. In fact, being 'too available' can also be a problem in itself.What if being present with God becomes a perpetual state of self-criticism?What if wanting to be available is actually a sense of loneliness?What if our expectations for intimacy are not met even after making ourselves available?What if our modern lifestyle of busyness and hurry are preventing us from being truly and fully available?It means coming face to face with the barriers that impede our availability.In this update of an earlier version published some thirty years ago, Psychologist and Professor at Loyola University Maryland, Robert Wicks probes the idea of availability from three angles. He begins with ourselves, which may be intriguing to some readers thinking that availability should always be for others. The wisdom of this is clear. If we do not know ourselves and our limits, how can we be of help to others? Healthy people are the best help for others. Unhealthy people suck away the emotional energy around them. Wicks is so emphatic about this that he asserts ""we must understand and preserve ourselves at all costs... not merely so that we can survive, but also that Christ may live on in us and in those whom we touch in His Name."" In being available to ourselves, we learn about our own uniqueness. Through our struggles, we can learn more about ourselves. Failures and our ability to forgive also teach us about ourselves. Being a psychologist or psychiatrist can often leave one empty after a session with clients. Being 'burnout' requires a theology of hope. Here, Wicks brings in the psychology and theology of hope to accomplish a deeper level of self-understanding, knowing, and clarity. True power comes with great self-awareness. Courage comes with clarity about one's strengths and weaknesses. With perspective comes clarity and prayerfulness.The second part of the book deals with being available to others. This is helpful for any forms of self-knowledge is never mean for personal consumption. God has gifted us with one another and we ought to use these gifts to care for the people that God cares for. Wicks says it well, that being with Christ means being with others as well. In relationships, we are able to cultivate the language of love. We learn to share our pain and fears within the support of a loving community.  We show compassion to one another. We learn to rejoice with those who rejoice; and weep with those who weep.Finally, availability also means being available to God. Wicks teaches us that true prayer has a ""uniting influence"" as we grow toward union with God. Being available for God means creating space within us for God. It means letting go of our idols and anxieties as we enter into periods of darkness. It means learning to withhold judgment on people and to seek God's mercy. As we deal with our inner wanting to run away from God, we will then be able to restrain our human tendencies and to experience God.So What?=======Casual readers may think this book is some kind of a self-help manual for caregiving and being present for people. On the surface it does look like that. Instead, I am pleasantly surprised at how spirituality has been weaved in through prayer and intentional spirituality that allows one to be open to God and the movement of the Spirit inside one's heart. Without shunning the reality of rush and anxieties in our society, Wicks from experience starts from self-care or soul-care. Without taking care of our own houses, how can we even offer to help others with their houses? This principle is demonstrated in the framing of this book. Slowly but surely, readers learn with increasing clarity three things. First, the need for self-care and self-awareness. This is the core part of being available. The sad fact among many people is that they want to help others without first helping themselves. Like the airline safety video that reminds parents to wear their oxygen masks first before helping their young kids, Wicks correctly points out to us that spiritual care is no different. The worst thing we can ever do to a person in a sinking ship is to invite the person on board another sinking ship! He covers a lot of ground with honest self-discovery and through our struggles, to know more about ourselves, our potential as well as our limits. Second, there is a need to look beyond ourselves and to be reminded that we are created for community. We help because we are participants in the world of people. This is the core of being human, not for ourselves but for one another. The Bible has lots to say about learning to walk together in pain and in sorrow. Third, we learn to deepen our prayer lives. This is perhaps one of the best reasons to buy this book. From psychology to community, we move eventually to the spirituality of prayer. I appreciate Wicks for sharing the wisdom from people like David Steindl-Rast, Anthony Bloom, and Henri Nouwen. Many of these writers are modern names we recognize. The annotated bibliography at the end of the book also forms a useful resource for those of us wanting to explore the spirituality of prayer in greater depth.All in all, this is a nice little guide book on understanding the person psychologically and spiritually. At some point of the book, readers can be forgiven when they sense they are reading a portion of the late Henri Nouwen's books.  If you feel busy to pray or too caught up with trying to meet needs of others as well as self, maybe, it is high time to pick up a book like this one to gain a better spiritual perspective of where we are and more importantly, who we are.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Sorin Books, a division of Ave Maria Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"The Church is the Body of Christ made of people, not a building made of bricks. Volunteerism is essential to the running of the Church. No Church can every hire enough people to run all the ministries. It either does not have the financial muscle nor administrative resource to mange or of them. Even for large churches, there is always a need to have a pool of unpaid individuals who feel a calling to serve and to follow after the footsteps of Jesus who showed the way to serve rather than to be served. Written as a guide for those who want to serve, this is more like a ""companion guide"" to another book entitled: ""The Volunteer Church"" plus a few more initiatives like:-  Giving past volunteers an additional motivation to volunteer again-  Gently persuade the fence-sitters to take the plunge toward volunteering-  Be affirmed once again on the merits of volunteering-  To empower volunteers to find the right fit-  To train others to volunteerVolunteering is like the decision on what to do with the coin. We can spend it in any way we want but we can only spend it once. When we volunteer, we invest our time and resources for a cause larger than self. The authors affirm that volunteering is a step of faith. It also grows our faith. Anyone who is bored with the routine and the monotonous lifestyle, volunteering is an excellent way to start something afresh and to make a difference.There is a guide on finding our fit via discovering of our spiritual gifts. Looking at 1 Corinthians 12-14; Romans 12; Ephesians 4; and 1 Peter 4, the authors give readers some assessment questions to help discover them. They advocate teamwork highly and provide ten hints for leading teams. Storytelling is also important to cultivate a culture of volunteerism. It is about sharing and growing together. It is about learning to spread the joy of service via recruiting. Recruiting is so important that everyone ought to be doing that. Thus, volunteering is not simply one to one relationship. It is like discipleship where one teaches another to do the same, to recruit, to train, and to influence others. Readers also learn of tips on how to avoid burnout.Readers will also read about stories of people who serve but are under-appreciated and unnoticed. Some many even presume that servants such as Sunday School teachers are paid to do what they do. Yet, the benefits are often not monetary but of something more valuable. It is about unity. It is about serving one another in the Name of Christ. It is about growing spiritually and helping others to do the same. Essentially, it is about doing and being Church. There are also health benefits to volunteering!Written as a quick guide to volunteering, Anderson and Fox have distilled the essentials in a tiny footprint. Volunteering is the life of any church and I would strongly recommend all laypersons, leaders, and anyone concerned about unity and teamwork to get this book.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Zondervan Academic and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Who is St Teresa of Avila? Why should we know about her and her works? What has a Sixteenth Century Carmelite nun to do with prayer? Who are the people who have influenced her spirituality? In uncovering the story of this amazing saint, award winning novelist and school teacher Vinita Hampton Wright has put together a min-biography of St Teresa of Avila to help us appreciate her early life; her decision to choose the religious vocation instead of marriage; and how her own life led to the classic writings on prayer. At the same time, there are difficult physical circumstances that plague Teresa. When she was a teenager, she had severe anxiety attacks, malignant malaria, and a serious bout of illness that even paralyzed her for three years. With sufferings of health, she plunged herself into deep prayer and meditation. In particular, she gravitated toward the teaching of Peter Alcantara's Treatise on Prayer and Meditation. Soon, she developed her own sense of abandonment to God and started her work on The Interior Castle and The Way of Perfection.Part One is a primer of St Teresa. After a mini-biography to show us the person behind the famous works, it is hoped that readers would then find Teresa a bit more familiar with so as to pray alongside. In Part Two, we follow after Teresa's rhythm of morning and evening prayers. This rhythm was developed as Teresa was reflecting on the Letters of St Jerome and later, St Augustine's Confessions. From this pattern, Wright distills it for modern readers through a liturgy as follows:Begin with a Quote from St TeresaA prayer of PreparationA powerful Gospel SentenceOne Minute of SilenceConfession (Penitential Psalm in morning; Standard Confession Prayer in evening)First Reading from the Prophets or NT EpistlesRead a PsalmRead a portion from the GospelsSilenceSay a Prayer from the Saints of oldA Prayer for the Day or Night from Teresa's writingsEach day contains a particular theme that we can learn from Teresa's spiritual journey. Wright arranges the Daily Office as follows:Sunday = God the Majestic and MercifulMonday = Saved from sin and the evil oneTuesday = What the Soul NeedsWednesday = God is With UsThursday = Always HumilityFriday = Patience with our PrayersSaturday =  In Union with GodPart Three of the book offers a full liturgy for readers to be able to use directly. It is hoped that with more frequent use and practice, we can learn to come up with our own liturgies that we can use personally as well as for the community we belong to. Part Four gives us additional information about how St Teresa's life and works have contributed to our understanding of prayer.One of the main problems with modern readers is how we manage our expectations. Are we expected to tune our prayer lives to become more like St Teresa's? Without Teresa's foundation of learning from the Church fathers, are we able to pray like her? Is this book more about theology or technique? In our modern lifestyles, due to the many distractions like technology and busy schedules, we are not able to be as attentive as the saints of old. Prayer is spiritual warfare, which is where we all need to take note. Teresa notes that we need to begin honestly and humbly:""The devil can do us great harm by making us believe we possess virtues that we do not possess. When we receive God's grace, we feel we are doing nothing and have a greater obligation to serve. When the devil deceives us, though, we think we are giving and serv- ing and that the Lord should reward us. Our humility is weakened and we neglect to cultivate it since we think we already have it.""How do we use books like this? Let me put forth 3Hs. First, be Honest with where we are. Some of us might be apprehensive of using a human book like St Teresa's works to pray. We may even claim that our only Prayer Guide is the holy Spirit. Our only Prayer method is the one taught by Jesus. Well, if that is the case, confess it and proceed from there. Second, be Happy about the method to be used. This means recognizing that the prayer method Teresa adopts is essentially about following hard after Jesus Christ. What we seek is also what she sought after earnestly. The methods should not be minimized simply because a human being had written it. Are we belittling the ways of God? If God can even use a donkey to speak with Balaam, surely He can use any human being, including St Teresa. Finally, be humble for humility is the key to the heart of God. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.The disciplines in the book is core to cultivating an intentional prayer life. This is the single biggest reason to read this book. Use it well and we can be more intentional in our prayer life. Perhaps, the more we establish a prayer routine in our lives, the more we learn to see beyond techniques, beyond people's needs, and beyond our everyday concerns. We begin to see more theological truths, God's purposes, and why there is more hope in God, even when the world around us is spinning away in utter oblivion.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Paraclete Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Whenever people think of the Middle East conflict, they would shake their heads as if there will never be any solution to the conflict. It is one of the most, if not the most, difficult problems in this world. For Christians, it is one huge theological puzzle of disagreement. At the heart of the disputes are the questions surrounding the nation of Israel.  Who is Israel?  Is Israel still God's chosen people?  How should evangelicals see the Israel of today?  Is there any theological basis to support Israel with military weapons?  What should we make of the relationships between Israel and the Palestinians?For scholar and theologian, Walter Brueggemann, far more important than political maneuvers for or against Israel is the plight of human rights for Palestinians. It is not right for US lobbying groups to continue to support Israel's bullying tactics by sending them military weapons and at the same time downplaying the human rights of the Palestinians. Worse, it is bad theology to just interpret the Bible as if it is a command to prop up Israel regardless of what she does to her neighbours. For Brueggemann, the well-being of all must be foremost.He starts off by showing us a way to read the Bible ""responsibly."" He cautions us against simplistic reading that equates modern day Israel with the ancient chosen people of God. He does this by comparing and contrasting several things. The first is the issue of land where the biblical version of the land covenant is a conditional one. When the Torah is obeyed, the ancient Israelites will live in peace. From history, it is well known that Israel had lost the land to invaders and their enemies. The second is the issue of how strangers are to be included in the land. It is about immigration policy. One people in one land does not mean all must be Jews living in one place. Any exclusionary claims by any group is downright unbecoming of a society that claims to welcome the stranger. Who do we include? In the West, we need to grapple with the historical ups and downs of how blacks and slaves are being included in the mainstream society. The Old Testament is more nuanced that we may otherwise believe. Straight-line thinking is too simplistic. In fact, the modern version of human rights is an extension of the Ten commandments!Anyone expecting Brueggemann to give a direct Yes/No on whether to support the Israel of today will be frustrated on the lack of clarity. He neither supports nor rejects Israel directly. He mainly helps shine light on the complexities surrounding the many facets of Israel, Jewish society, and especially the Old Testament promises made to Israel. Honestly, if the problem of Israel and the Arab neighbours can be easily resolved in one book, it would have been settled long time ago. I am glad Brueggemann makes no promises with regards to settling theological or political disputes. He cannot. However, as an Old Testament scholar, he is able to point readers back to what the Old Testament is saying and what it is NOT saying. Any modern day applications of the Old Testament have to be tested and challenged with biblical scholarship and wise theological understanding. This is what the author has done.By pointing out the historical contexts of the Old Testament references to Israel, Jewish relations, and Zionism, readers can understand with greater clarity of the original purpose and meaning. The Israel of old is a people of God called to be God's witnesses, God's blessings to all nations, and God's chosen people. Whether it is the land covenant or the ancient promises, we need to understand what is conditional and which is not. Failure to understand the differences can lead to wrong applications. The book is also realistic with regards to the failures of Israel in how they have treated the Palestines and how they have denied basic human rights to refugees and their Arab neighbours. It is all about fear. Sometimes, there is a tinge of simplistic and foolish application of biblical truths. This happens when lobbyists in the West uncritically support Israel on the basis of seeing the new Israel the same as the old Israel. Erroneous theological understanding leads to erroneous political application. Politically, the Middle East controversy is a dispute over land and boundaries. Religiously, it appears like a conflict between the Jews and the Arabs. Theologically, while both people group share the same history from Abraham, they differ immensely in their interpretations of history, their perspectives of faith, and the understanding of what it all means in the eyes of God.So what is the way forward? Clues can be found in various chapters of the book, especially the question and answer section after the conclusion. My personal feel is that the time lag has not been adequately comprehended. People have not spent enough time trying to understand the original contexts of God's covenant to Israel. There are three reasons why people do that. The first is an overly simplistic reading of Scripture. Just because we see God promising to bless Israel in the past, we cannot just take those words and paste it onto the present. We must consider the contexts and the conditions attached to the promise. We must see the reasons why God said those things then. We will also need to read the New Testament and to bridge both testaments. Second, we need a big picture narrative of the Bible. This means not just settling on some prophetic verses in the Old Testament and the related verses in the New Testament. It means learning to see the gospel of Jesus Christ in all of our reading. When we fail to see the person of Jesus Christ in the Scriptures, how can we call ourselves Christians in the first place? Jesus didn't enter Jerusalem on a high and mighty horse with chariots and all. On Palm Sunday, he entered Jerusalem on a lowly donkey. He didn't order angels to come rescue him when he was tempted. Neither did he send flashes of lightning to electrocute his murderers and executioners. Jesus died as a sacrifice for many. Without a big picture of the entire Word of God, we would be left applying only selected portions of Scripture, leading to a biased state of application and theological knowledge. Third, only the ways of God are reliable. Men may think they know best. They can try to resolve their disputes through military means. The fact is, the more we shoot missiles and fling bombs at others, expect more of the same from them to us. Jesus has said that we need to do to others what we want others to do to us. Will there ever be true peace? Not when humans are full of themselves and filled with pride.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Westminster John Knox Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"This highly popular book is now into its third edition. With a very vivid cover image that shows a hand grasping a piece of rock, we can picture in our minds the desire of one who longs after God, by grasping the Rock, which is Christ. The writer of the foreward, Kevin Vanhoozer, a Professor of Theology at Wheaton College, makes five summary points about this book. First, it is a book that avoids twisting the biblical texts. Second, it is grasping via understanding what the text really says. Third, it helps readers move from literal understanding to practical application. Four, it encourages readers to hold on and to hang on to the text via relevant applications. Five, it is the way, the truth and the life in Christ. That is what the essence of the book is all about: Grasping God's Word, and letting the Word of God grasp our hearts that lead to action.Five Step Interpretive Process Throughout===============================The latest edition also updates the bibliographies, illustrations, cultural references, since the last one in 2005. There are some slight differences. Rather than a literal reading approach, this edition aims to make the book closer to ""God's great story."" Instead of a four-step process for the NT and a five-step process for the OT, the authors have streamlined them and make it a five-step process for ALL biblical genres. These five steps are:SUMMARIZE ancient contexts for modern audiences;MEASURE the differences and similarities of Bible times and contemporary timesLISTING of the theological principles in the passageCONSULTING the biblical map and how it fits into the overall storyGRASP the text for our contemporary times for practical application.The constant conviction is that all of these can only be done fruitfully if we learn to see the Bible and the reading of the Bible with an eye on God's overall story.Reading, Interpreting, ApplyingThis book is a 'hands-on' attempt to help readers do three things:- Reading- Interpretation- ApplyingThese three things are interwoven into the book's five parts. In Part One, the authors use five chapters to show readers how to read the Bible. It touches on an important area of Bible translations, in particular, English translations of the Bible. Due to the ever increasing offering of Bible translations in the market, this is a useful guide to understanding the different strengths and weaknesses of each translation, and what each seek to achieve. The authors make a special effort to explain how the Bible come into its current state. We read about the history of the translation process. We see several translations compared side by side. We learn about the main categories each translation lies. It also shows us the 'interpretive journey' needed with the tools such as using the biblical map, understanding the ancient world, and how to read the Bible in sentences, in paragraphs and in discourses, with an awareness of the genre written.Part Two deals with extensive bridging of ancient cultures and modern times. Through questions, the authors show readers how to read the text with understanding. Like author's background, relationship with the readers, circumstances of the passage, and many more. There is also a chapter on how readers can unwittingly read their own circumstances into the text, something in which a student of hermeneutics will call 'redaction criticism' or 'reader response criticism.' I appreciate the gentle manner in which the authors are able to guide the reader in this respect.Part Three moves into meaning and application, and sets into play the hard work done in Part One and Two. In fact, I assert that good due diligence in the initial reading and contextual understanding will make the interpretative and application process easier. Meaning is key in this part. The central issue is actually communication. Who is the writer writing for? What is God trying to tell them and us? What is the meaning in the text and the contexts? The authors really do a good job in making sure they cover as much ground as possible.Parts Four and Five basically applies all the theory and teachings done in the first three parts of the bok. Part Four is devoted to the four genres of the New Testament, namely, the gospels, the letter, Acts, and Revelation. Part Five focuses on the five genres of the Old Testament, namely, the Law, the Narrative, the Poetry, the Prophets, and the Wisdom books.That is not all. The appendices at the end of the book is a bonus for all readers, especially students. It has a chapter on the formation of the canon, dealing with inspiration and inerrancy matters as well. The authors make some good comments about some of the controversies generated by some modern books such as the Da Vinci code and Elaine Pagels's books on the gnostic gospels.This book is indeed a welcome addition to a needful area of learning to read the Bible well with an eye on hands-on approach. Some books tend to focus too much on the literal meaning of the text but lack the contemporary applications. Others are too practical oriented that they fail to help readers appreciate the historical and biblical worlds sufficiently. This book brings about a good balance of literal reading of the content, an insightful understanding of the contexts, and a bold application of the texts. I warmly recommend this book for Bible teachers, pastors, and leaders in the ministry of teaching and ministry.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me free by Zondervan and NetGalley without any obligation for a positive review.

"Pastoral care is a critical part of any Church ministry. The word ""pastor"" is synonymous with ""shepherd."" Unlike some places that sees the pastor as the leader-CEO, the true biblical basis of a pastor is to shepherd the flock. How we practice pastoral care however have changed, partly because of changing needs. In this book, the way is to adopt a ""postmodern approach"" toward the practice of pastoral care. Calling it an ""intercultural approach,"" pastoral care in this book means not just listening to the stories of the people but also to create meaning of them. It means learning to piece together the broken pieces of life. It means learning to help people tell their stories. It means cultivating trust. For Carrie Doehring, it is the heart of pastoral care where people are willing to open up their lives to caregivers. It is about creating opportunities for ""care conversations"" and relating real-life to theological truths and biblical principles. Doehring goes a step further to advocate for a care that brings back individuals from a de-centered sacred bearings due to suffering and painful circumstances. How can one show compassion and understanding toward those questioning their faith and religious values? This calls for a ""theological, cultural, and psychological expertise"" that can help care for parishioners and people in such need, what Doehring refers to as ""the compassionate art of intercultural care."" Carers essentially enter into the lives of others, sharing in their pain, walking with them in the valley of questions and celebrating with them in the answers of joy. It is about intermingling one's lives with another so as to build a bridge that aids integrative moments and shared stories. It is collaborative exploration of new and strange emotional territories. The author attempts to use a ""trifocal lens"" which comprises of a precritical, a modern, and a postmodern approach.  As a first-order language, a precritical lens looks at the world from a divine perspective. The modern lens is a second-order language that adopts ""text critical methods"" and social sciences to include empirical analysis and rational judgment of knowledge. The postmodern approach is the third-order language that nuances all of these in the light of present contexts. This approach involves the meaning making and the response of individuals to the earlier two orders of language. She summarizes the book's structure in six parts.1) Listening and Responding to the Intermingling of Stories (chapters 1-3)2) Establishing the Contract of Care (chapter 4)3) Theological Reflexivity (chapter 5)4) Listening for Narrative Themes (chapter 6)5) Assessing Social Privileges or Disadvantages (chapter 7)6) Ongoing Plan of Care (chapter 8)Part One works on the listening to stories and how one can enter into the narrative of each individual. The word ""intercultural"" is preferred over cross-cultural or transcultural simply because there is an inter-exchange rather than some transplanted care that can become distant in nature. People want to feel unique and respected, not just a project for another to solve. They do not want to be theological puzzles for theologians but as real people trying to deal with struggles. People will remain where they are, unchanged as long as they do not feel trusted, respected, or cared for. The goal is to integrate one's care into another person's frame of emotions. Doehring's openness to psychotherapy, psychospiritual, and non-Christian spiritualities enables her to be free to include unconventional practices. She uses Buddhist practices as well as moralistic theologies. One example is the use of Buddhist teachings on suffering to learn how to deal with serious PTSD cases, like being able to accept that suffering is a ""normal part of life.""  She shares about the basic ingredients of caregiving relationships: 1) able to take the perspective of the other; 2) able to experience what the other person is going through; 3) able to regulate self no to be overwhelmed by the other. Embodied listening is about learning to understand the level of shame one feels and the crippling emotions experienced. Readers will be exposed to a range of listening skills and how to sustain a spiritual care conversation. Caregivers need to avoid premature judgment or being too enthusiastic about prescribing solutions. Caring is very different from curing.Part Two establishes a ""contract of care"" that draws up guidelines of accountability for the caregiver and the commitment for the one being cared for. Many rely on national and state laws to establish the code of ethics. Larger religious organizations would have their own set of principles and guidelines. What about the limits of confidentiality? What about sexual harassment and misconduct that are due to power positions in the clergy-client relationship? What about the limits and separation of pastoral care, psychotherapy, and professional healthcare? While it is important to create greater openness, there are also risks involved with regards to abuse and neglect. Readers will learn how to draw up a care contract that can be customized according to age, roles, resources available, and beliefs.Part Three is an interesting ""Theological Themes and Reflexivity"" for those of us who are comfortable with theology and the practice of pastoral care from a theological angle. It is about being God's agent of hope and encouragement, to share grace, truth, and love with people who need help in dealing with their fears, their guilt, their shame, and other debilitating emotions. Using film as a case study, we as movie-goers will be drawn into the ""relational space"" that the characters in the movie can help draw out. It is a chance for embedded theology to come alive through grappling with the emotional issues theologically.Part Four is about coping with loss, violence, and coping with one's narratives. Every individual is unique and brings along narratives of both certainty and mystery. Three key themes are described. The first is loss, a common source of human suffering. It can be material losses, relational losses, intrapsychic, functional, role loss, and systemic losses.  The second is violence where power dynamics play along both physical and non-physical means. We read about people at risk feeling psychologically overwhelmed or lack the ability to cope. Care must be needed to guard against premature triggering of traumatic memories. The third theme deals with other problems like dependence, codependence, addiction, substance abuse, and problems in coping with stress. For caregivers, they need to be able to respect the limited theological abilities of the people they care for. Doehring urges us to be aware of and to be respectful about the ""moral stress generated by life-limiting lived theologies - personal, familial, communal, and cultural."" Referrals are recommended after about three or four counseling sessions. Suicide is also an important topic.Part Five covers the systemic assessment to find ways in helping others deal with social oppression such as immigrant status, racism, sexism, classism, and the emotions that come with them. We can also identify resources that are available. Part Six is about planning the kind of care to liberate people from emotional enslavement via three overlapping care phases:Phase One - Building trust through compassion, and establishing safetyPhase Two - Mourning Losses and Fostering AccountabilityPhase Three - Reconnecting with the Goodness of LifeOne of the major problems in pastoral care is to be able to enter into the lives of people and not knowing when to stop or get out. Sometimes, caregivers can get trapped. With clear understanding of the risks of pastoral care, this book can be a powerful resource to prepare caregivers on what they can do; what they cannot do; what people can or cannot do; and what only God can do. Carrie Doehring is Professor of Pastoral Care and Counseling at Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colorado.  She is also a licensed psychologist in Massachusetts and Colorado. Ordained in the Presbyterian Church in Canada back in 1978, she is very familiar with the pastoral care environment in North American circles. This book gives us a wealth of knowledge and resources from Dr Doehring's vast experience in this field of pastoral care. Written with penetrating insight and deeply felt empathy with patients and individual narratives, she writes with academic prowess and pastoral sensitivity to the cases mentioned. At the same time, she hones her teaching skills to help readers understand her thoughts. The diagrams are clearly framed to enable readers to follow the different phases and models. Examples are rich and real. Some of the cases are so painful that readers may feel lost on how to deal with it. Thankfully, the exercises at the end of each chapter are designed to help us prepare for them as best as we can.Every pastoral counseling case is unique because every individual is unique. Life has both stories as well as mysteries and the key is to learn to respect the limits of both. In order to know what are the constraints of self and the limits of pastoral care, one must also be self-aware. This single ability is critical. If the pastor or counselor does not know him or herself, how best can they know others? If one does not practice self care, how can one care for others? This is one reason why I would recommend a complement to this book: Soulcare or care for one's soul. Studied side by side, the reader would be much better equipped than simply having a postmodern approach. One more thing. I am aware some reader may be uncomfortable with Doehring' use of non-Christian methods, especially the Buddhist or alternative therapies. For such cases, do not abandon this book just because there are references to them. If it does not work for you, just ignore those parts.There are a lot more material in this book that can benefit Christian leaders. Trust me. This book is worth reading, especially for those of us called to the pastoral care ministry.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Westminster John Knox Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"We need to make space for wonder. We need to find room to discover the divine. We need to be still in awe of God's presence. Confessing that he wrote this book for himself, author and pastor Paul David Tripp gives several reasons why awe is more necessary than ever. First, God's creation is already wonderful in itself as it reflects a beauty that can stimulate our senses. Second, for a fickle and wandering soul, we need something to keep our roving thoughts in check. Third, we need more attentiveness for the presence of God. Fourth, we need to ""recapture, refocus, and redirect"" our heart's attention to God over and over again. Fifth, with awe, one will be able to shape our words, thoughts, and deeds, according to the spiritual awareness of God. It is awe that many of us lack. When we think we have everything under control, where is there a need for awe?Tripp takes us through thirteen windows of awe, beginning with HUMANITY, where there are so many things we can share and appreciate together because we are all created with the ability to wonder. Even when we have all the answers the the everyday problems we face, without awe, we will be stuck in cycles of discontent. He thinks about WAR and becomes aware of ""awe wrongedness"" (AWN) which happens when we feel wronged, victimized, received the shorter end of the stick, unjustly treated. Wars happen when this AWN takes root. The world through the past century have endured two world wars, and many more scattered across various continents. Even today, wars are happening not only in the Middle East but in Eastern Europe, restless pockets of strife in Asia, unrest in Africa and the Americas. On MINISTRY, Tripp sometimes wonder if he has truly been called to ministry in the first place. If worshiping God is foremost, why then are people constantly getting stuck in doing things that do not resemble any act of worship? He surmises: ""Only a functional, heart-directed, ministry-shaping awe of God has the power to protect me from myself in ministry."" We are hardwired for awe, and when our heart goes through a REPLACEMENT, with us replacing God with other gods, our sense of awe becomes warped. We forget God. We suffer from AMNESIA, seeing without truly seeing, and hearing without truly hearing. Through self-centeredness, a grotesque sense of entitlement, discontent, relational dysfunction, control, fear, anger, envy, drivenness, doubt, coldness, and others, our capacity for awe gets decapitated.  TRANSGRESSION follows suit. We snigger at the laws of God. We belittle the importance of obedience. We swim in rivers of COMPLAINT and give critical and sarcastic answers to the five diagnostic questions about God. Instead, we move toward MATERIALISM and puts our trust in the temporal things of life. Failing to answer the two most important questions in our lives will put a damper to GROWTH. Thankfully, Tripp presents us with two ""awe portraits"" from Galatians 5. The first is to be careful of the works of the flesh. The second is to don the fruit of the Spirit. Spiritual growth comes with the suppression of the former and the increase of the latter.  As the author quotes at length the passage from Isaiah 40, he senses a WORLDVIEW awareness. He gains a bigger picture of CHURCH. Seeing PARENTING as a high calling, readers learn about awe inspiring moments that we can teach our children. We gain a renewed sense of WORK that puts in proper perspectives that it is our identity in Christ that gives us our worth, not our works. Eventually, Tripp boils it all down to one phrase: ""Awe is a longing.""In describing the journey toward awe-inspiring moments of life, the author is able to describe what it means to be grounded on earth but reflective on God. In doing so, he does not minimize the concerns of earthly being. He extends them with a heavenly longing. From natural observations of creation to the ways humans live on this earth, he encourages us to recognize the limitations of natural man and the dangers of living in materialism and that refusal to acknowledge our limits. The tragedy is not simply about the lack of awe but the presence of human pride that dispels any notion or awareness of the divine. Without awe, how can we long for something bigger than ourselves? Without awe, how can we reach that level of contentment and fill that spiritual vacuum in our lives? Without awe, hope lacks vitality.The Christian life is one of worship of God and in awe of His workings. He is Maker of Heaven and Earth. Unfortunately, even among Christians, God is increasingly seen merely as a Moralistic, Therapeutic, and Deistic Being. The absence of awe brings about an increase in skepticism and secular behaviour. I think we have much to learn with regards to getting a sense of the divine. I find this book a useful reminder not about how mortal and limited we are. The Psalmist in Ps 14:1 tells of the fool who says in his heart that ""There is no God."" It is a strong statement that those who reject the knowledge of God are fools. Can one be in awe of creation without having to believe in God? I would say that the capacity to awe in regardless of what faith we have. All persons regardless of ethnicity, religions, or language will have the ability to be awed. It is already built into us. For when God created us, God also gives us a free will to choose. The decision to choose is ours. The capacity to be awed is also ours. However, the fullest extent of being in awe of God and what we are created to be and do will depend.  Oh, that salvation for Israel would come out of Zion!  When the Lord restores his people,  let Jacob rejoice and Israel be glad!

"First published in 2008, this second edition has been released to update the book on what is really important in the New Testament. Organized around nine New Testament writers to show their concerns, we learn to study the New Testament intent inductively and not to insert our own concerns and purposes into the texts. We learn to recognize the biblical authors' main concerns and how we can apply the truths and principles into our modern world. Written collectively by 15 NT scholars and professors, the authors offer undergraduate students a colourful and enriching resource to guide their study of the New Testament. With a very extensive introduction about how first century audience would understand, readers learn about how the Assyrians and Babylonians were perceived, marauding invaders who were the cause of Israel's demise. They thought of the Persians who were the foreigners permitting the Jews to rebuild the temple. They were familiar with the Greeks who had a culture of religious tolerance and cultural pluralism. They knew the influence of the wars between the Ptolomies, the Seleucids, and the Hasmodeans. They were also familiar with the history of the Samaritans, the rise of the Pharisees, and the powerful positions of the Zealots, Essenes, and the Sadducees. Of course, they feared the Romans and lived in total submission to Roman rule.Using a Who-When-Where-Why format, each New Testament author's intent is summarised. Matthew's carefully crafted verses are described as calls for people to repentance for the kingdom of heaven is near.  Mark's intent is simply about telling the story of Jesus and how hope can be found in the Kingdom of God coming through Him. Luke's concerns is about accurate reporting that highlights the mission of Jesus. John wants to celebrate the light, love, and life of Jesus. John's letters bring out the doctrinal, moral, and love tests. In Revelation, John's concern is not just about the end times, but also about exalting God above al. The Apostle Paul is passionate about preaching Christ and to speak the truth of Christ to all the churches. All of his thirteen letters are dealt at length to demonstrate the contexts and the purpose for communication with the churches. Hebrews are concerned with the high priesthood of Jesus while James exhorts the people to persevere on in faith in spite of great trials. The Apostle Peter loves the Church and points the people to the Person of Christ. The last chapter on New Testament Canon summarizes the process of canonization and the authority of Scripture.There are at least five things I like about this reference book. First, the Introduction portion of each biblical author gives the immediate contexts at a glance. We get a deeper understanding of the person writing it, the time period, the place, the audience, and the purpose of the narrative or letter. Just this one-page summary is already worth the price of the book. Second, there is a concise summary of the passions that drive the biblical author. This enables us to read the New Testament with a big picture in mind. This is important for those of us who can be easily lost in the details. Third, the photos and pictures bring the book to life and give readers an idea of what the original locations and world look like. Though it may unwittingly straitjacket readers into seeing life according to that picture, it is merely a glimpse into the ancient world. I appreciate the maps conveniently located to help us visualize the places described. Fourth, the theological themes are succinctly summarized without being bogged down by jargon. I like the unique contributions by each NT expert who are able to show readers the distinct emphases of each New Testament book or letter. Finally, the key words and concepts give readers a quick overview of what had been covered in the chapter. Sometimes, readers may miss out a concept or two and by looking at the list again, one can be refreshed or prompted to go back to specific portions of the chapter.One more thing. The appendices are excellent quick reference guides for teachers and students to pick up and go. As a survey of the New Testament, I warmly recommend this book to churches and first year NT Introduction courses. In fact, the content is so clearly written that one can use this book as a personal reference guide when studying the New Testament.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Kregel Academic in exchange for an honest review.

"What is mankind's deepest need? For Neal and Matthew Lozano, the deepest need for us is to get back to the heart of Father God. With many households nowadays dealing with an absentee father environment, the deep need for a father figure has grown even deeper. Written in a very accessible manner, with tenderness of a father-son sensitivity, the authors affirm the call for each of us to accept the warm embrace of God. It prompts us to ask:- What song is the Spirit of God singing?- What message is God speaking to us personally?- What is preventing us from experiencing God more?Birthed some eight years ago, this book was only completed with the help of the author's son, Matthew. Both are now serving in the same ministry called ""Heart of the Father Ministries."" They have many free resources there. Both understand the spiritual hunger in people. The reason why Jesus came to earth is to bring us back to the Father He so loved. Using a journey metaphor, readers are invited to come alongside the authors' approach toward homecoming to God. The first section talks about ""The Way Home"" that begins with a promise that God the Father is not some harsh judge who dishes out punishment but a loving God who wants to embrace us. They ask:- Who God is?- What is God the Father like?- What is in the Father's heart?Using the Parable of the Prodigal Son as a starting point, readers are invited to see themselves in the parable that contains emotions of rebellion, resentment, repentance, and reinstatement. God's heart can break when we rebel. God is longing for us to be reconciled with Him. Adoption is His way of loving us even when we deserve to be slaves, He generously gives us the position of sons and daughters. In Jesus Christ, we are reconciled.Section Two goes straight to the Father's Heart. Rather than for people to constantly pop the question of who God is, why not consider the revelations God had given over thousands of years? See God revealed in the Old Testament. See God in the prayers of Jesus. See the heart of God demonstrated in the passion of Christ. The parables show how great and gracious is the heart of the Father. When we feel the deep love of God in our hearts, our response is pure love.Section Three mirrors the coming home of the Prodigal Son. Upon waking up from self-delusion, the errant son recognizes he had wronged his own father. He knows that the best is not somewhere out there in the world but straight back into the heart and warm embrace of the Father. It is love that propels one to lay aside high expectations or personal entitlement. At that point, only one thing is needed: Abba's Heart.Section Four describes what life in the Father's House looks like. It is a house with a new foundation that is sure and steadfast. It is the house built not with our human labours but with God's help. It is an open table where the children of God are invited to feast together. In the Father's House are not only many mansions, but authority to govern with God. The Lozanos highlight five principles of authority:1) Ruling with God means submission to the authority of Jesus2) It means we have a new identity and destiny3) We have a new responsibility as members of the kingdom of God4) Our works are essentially acts of faith5) We go forth in the power and Name of Jesus Christ.We learn servanthood. We learn forgiveness. We learn spiritual warfare. We learn to worship. In all of these things come this strange irony. Just like the fame poem, ""Footprints on the Sand,"" believers longing and serving in the power of Christ will gradually recognize that the One doing all the work and empowerment is actually God Himself. Just when we feel lonely, struggling painfully, or enduring moments of uncertainty, God the Father is always watching over us. For God will never leave us nor forsake us. He is God and will always keep His covenant with us. His love for us is unconditional and everlasting.Love is about hearts seeking out hearts for intimacy, for grace, and for delight. The authors recognize that for some readers, the father image may be painful and hard to fathom. That is why they begin with ""a broken heart"" that we are all broken in one way or another. We are loved not in spite of our weaknesses but because God says we belong to Him. Sensitively written, this book is a gentle introduction to believers needing inner healing and assurance that someone still loves them regardless of what they have gone through. In our day and age, it is so easy for the world to dumb down our personal experiences or individual uniquenesses. We try so hard to make a name for ourselves but sometimes we can become discouraged when there are no results or when results do not meet our expectations. God the Father is all-accepting because the gift of Christ is for all. Is there any greater love than one who would willingly lay down His life for us? That is the biggest evidence of how deep, how wide, how high, and how extensive is the Father's love for us.Rating: 4 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Chosen Books and Graf-Martin Communications in exchange for an honest review.

"Can anyone survive without having to buy stuff? The symbols of capitalism are everywhere. Every Thanksgiving, every Christmas, and every end of the year, we have the mad rush to stock up on goods and gifts. The parking lots would be packed. Shoppers would be frazzled trying to get the best deals with the limited funds. Many go on credit that could haunt them for the most part of next year. As people shop until they drop, as they let their fingers do more online shopping, inevitably, something else had to give. One of such is the decreasing level of quality relationships. By allowing themselves to become prey to an endless quest for stuff and more stuff, they fail to connect more with their loved ones and friends. We all know the common cliche, that a house is not necessarily a home, especially if our loved ones seem like strangers. Writer, blogger, and former missionary with the Presbyterian Church USA, Scott Dannemiller and his family tried for one year to live counter-culturally and resist the temptations of purchasing. He diagnoses the problem of modern America as one that has become ""preoccupied with money."" Through the book, he hopes to share with the rest of his countrymen and readers beyond that money and purchases do not necessarily make the world go round. Simply put, the world is becoming more transactional and less conversational. Must one become a cross-cultural missionary outside one's home country in order to connect more with people? After a self-deprecating introduction, the author plunges into his family's quest to stop the mad shopping craze so that they can start to connect with one another, and with people they meet each day.Part One begins with the setting out of objectives, guidelines, rules, and a statement of their year long project as a family. Dannemiller reveals his missionary experience trying to share the ""ministry of presence"" with people in Guatemala. In fact, their decision to live a year without purchasing stems from a series of factors. First, it was from their daily encounters with the Guatemalans who did not seem interested to ask about what they do for a living. He realizes how much his American culture has hemmed him into linking everything in life with money and purchase. Together with his wife Gabby, they decided to do something practical with their mission statement: ""To tirelessly seek God’s will each day by living lives of integrity, owning what we have, growing together in faith, and serving God’s people to build a world without need."" Second, it was more progressive than revolutionary. Even though they have decided a pro-people ministry, they find themselves locked into a cycle of purchase and goods, using a bulk of their resources on buying stuff for their family and ministry. Finally, Gabby asked: ""What if we didn't buy anything for a year?"" This set in motion the year long project. They set out the following rules:  They can buy stuff that are perishables (gas, groceries, hygiene products) but not those that last beyond a year.  They can fix anything that breaks (as long as the repair is not greater than the replacement costs)  They can donate gifts to charity (to build connections)These were not just rules, as the author found out. It challenges their marriage relationship. It needs a sustained commitment. It becomes a giant step of faith.Part Two continues with decisions surrounding everyday matters. Gift-giving has to be creatively done with alternatives to buying new presents. They had to think about whether to repair a torn sock or to replace them. They had to resist from the amazing deals that they get from emails or coupons in the mail. They have to make decisions about household appliances. They also learn about being grateful for what they owned and when things worked. Plus, there wonder if it is possible to celebrate Easter and birthdays without buying stuff. The tests grow even more difficult as the whole experiment takes on a more personal note, when it involves having to make decisions to deprive the kids of new gifts from others. Readers will appreciate how daily decisions about not purchasing can impact the family in many ordinary ways.Part Three reveals more upsides after overcoming various challenges. They become more creative on keeping within their rules while adapting to changes, like using frozen vegetables to numb one's pain after a surgery. They learn lessons about distinguishing between needs and wants. The biggest lesson of all is their experience of how relationships (not money) truly brings happiness. They de-clutter by giving away things. They start to be in control of themselves whenever there are sales pitches, flyers, and temptations coming at them. He learns how the Saudis observe prayer even in the middle of a retail mall.Part Four brings into perspective the purpose of the year-long program. What is the reason for trying to live through a year without purchase? Is it for mere spiritual growth? Is it to boost one's ego? The Dannemillers are convinced that it is about being equipped to serve the people of God better. They minister in the area of food and hunger, choosing the ""Society of St Andrew"" that minimizes food wastage by channeling them to the needy. They get to re-evaluate their year long project and see positive changes in the whole family. Three big things happened.  They had more energy for the more important things in life.  They had more money to spend for what really mattered.  They had a deeper understanding of the things that mattered.Not many people would be able to do exactly what the Dannemillers had done. For those of us who live on shoestring budgets, some of the things they had done are nothing new, like using hand-me-downs, and refraining from shopping sprees during festive seasons. People serving in ministries can also identify with the frugal lifestyles. Personally, the rules the authors have set up appear easy to follow initially. When the crunch occurs, like the major shopping times of the year like Thanksgiving and Christmas, the temptations do come fast and furious. Families with kids will face exceptional challenges. Overall, I think every one of us ought to spend a period of time de-cluttering and de-accumulating our stuff. We should practice a purchasing sabbath from time to time. The Appendix provides eight very practical helps to maximize the use of what we already have before going out to buy more things. For those of us who are not sure of where to start, this book would be a good diving board.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Westminster John Knox Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"How is it possible to gain when we are losing? Can one really be profitable to give everything away? It just does not make normal sense. Yet, for author and pastor of Summit Church in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, this is exactly what the Church needs. In the foreword, Larry Osborne agrees as he goes back to the game of checkers called ""Giveaway Checkers"" where the winner will be the one who had given away all of his checkers. Osborne also points out three key weaknesses in existing churches.Many churches have a ""truncated gospel"" that tends to be more head knowledge than heart.There is a long history of ""clergy-centered ministry"" that raises such a high bar for missionaries to be that many feel they do not make the cut.There is ""spiritual myopia"" among churches that see growth in terms of how many people they pack into their churches instead of how many people they send out.With this intriguing foreword, Greear begins with his counter-cultural approach to what it means to be Church. It is like the kernel of wheat in John 12:24 that falls on the ground and dies so that many seeds can be produced. He reminds me of one quip I have heard from Mike Stachura: ""The mark of a great Church is not its seating capacity but its sending capacity."" This applies what Jesus has taught all along in Mark 8:36 that questions us about what good will it be for a man to gain the whole world but to lose his soul. Why not give of oneself to the world and save many souls? Giving of oneself is the mark of a healthy Church. For God is a sending God who had sent prophets, priests, kings, servants, and Jesus to bring us good news. If we want to be Christlike, we must take mission very seriously and not delegate it only to a small group of people called the ""Missions Committee."" The biblical missions committee is the whole Church.Greear uses the image of three kinds of ships to describe the mission of the Church. The first kind of Church is like the ""cruise liner"" that basically offers sports, entertainment, children's programs, in-house activities that cater more to members' preferences. The second kind is the ""battleship"" that sees the mission as warring against the world that focuses more on spiritual warfare and members as soldiers fighting for the kingdom. This will invariably cause a focus on numbers. Greear recommends the third kind: ""aircraft carrier"" where members are constantly being trained and prepared via drills to be ready for any war. On such a ship, the goal is to be able to send aircraft to battle from a distance. Such a ship is likened to a mission sending agency or church. Looking at the postmodern world, the author is convinced that no amount of attractive church services can entice unbelievers to come; Multiplication is much better than mere addition; God accompanies every one who is sent out; a Church's greatness is always about sending, not keeping. One may wonder how Greear gets such an idea in the first place. This is revealed in Chapter Two where he begins his first years as a pastor at Summit trying to make a big name for himself. He remembers three significant moments. In trying to build the Church, he fails to see that the purpose of church is not to grow the church numbers or coffers but to win the city for Christ and to bless and serve them. It is not ""my kingdom come"" but God's kingdom come. It is about letting Christ's mission shape our search for jobs and vocations. It is wanting the presence of God to be connected with his heart for mission. Sending must be the DNA of each Church.Part Two of the book describes ""Ten Sending Plumb Lines,"" or ten ways in which the Church can become a mission-sending agency where every member is a missionary.Swimming in the Gospel: Mission is not about the sending. It is about the pool we are sent to. We build ships not for fun but for a purpose. The gospel is not just the diving board but the actual swimming after the dive. A heart change is necessary.Everyone is Called, not just the missionary. Whatever vocation each of us has, we need to re-imagine and realign them in the light of the gospel mission. Every Christian has a duty to make disciples and to use one's vocation for the glory of God.All week is important, not just Sunday: The Church needs to be more missional and not get stuck at the attractional phase.The congregation needs to move from Audience to Army: The people of God are disciples and missionaries in the making. People need to be challenged to be leaders; empowered to lead; willing to be sent out; and to see success not as incoming numbers but outgoing members to do the mission of God.The Church Makes Christ Real and Visible: Through love displayed; through service; through outward demonstration of truth in action.Making Disciples the Way of Life: What's the point of all the teaching, the talking, the training, and the programming if at the end of the day, there are no disciples being made? From pulpit preaching, Sunday School teaching, and all aspects of Sunday service, we must remember the primary purpose of being a Christian is to make disciples.Every Minister is a Missions Pastor: Discipleship is essentially about helping members go from the training field into the mission field. Every pastor needs to have missions in his/her ministry work. All are called to build a mission ethos into the Church.Live Multiculturally, not merely Hosting Multicultural Events: Like Acts 2 when the Holy Spirit touched the Church, churches need to be open to people of all cultures, by elevating ""the third race"" which is essentially the ""Christian"" identity. From language use to adapting food cultures, cultivate unity and acceptance of all ethnicities.Take Risks: We need a leap of faith, the ability to risk getting our feet wet so that the gospel can be shared. Send out our best for the sake of the next project or initiative. Not taking risks means automatic decline.Perseverance and Relentlessly Saying It: Coming up with a vision or some mission statement is one thing. Helping others understand and own it is another.The single big idea in this book is about every Church a sender, every member a missionary, and every program and activity as having a ""sending"" mentality. It is a wake-up call for churches that have long been stuck in a maintenance mode capacity or churches that have become dull with regards to missions. I understand that many churches may react against Greear's seemingly radical idea with questions like, ""What about our own needs?"" and ""Our Church is already shrinking, so how can we send our best people away?""For that, let me suggest how we can use this book. If a Church is struggling in terms of volunteers and lukewarm spirituality, the thought of fully applying the book will be rejected outright. For such churches, it takes a while to move from surviving mode to thriving mode. That does not mean ejecting the whole book altogether. For dying churches, this simply means praying, seeding, and hoping. For a Church that is running on maintenance mode, the programs and activities of the Church can be continued but with a new missions twist. With intent and purpose, ministers and leaders of such churches can prepare three to five year programs to move the ship around to the gospel purpose. For churches that have the resources but do not yet know what to do with the resources, use this book absolutely. Every church will need to understand their own situations and to do a situational analysis. Then appropriate the book according to the stages of growth. This means having a leadership core of likeminded people. It means being prayerful at every step of the way. It means knowing one's identity as in Christ. It means knowing what we exist for.I recommend this book highly for all church leaders and members.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Zondervan and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Many Christians know the Lord's Prayer. Many also recite it by heart each Sunday during Church services. What is so special about this prayer? Is there a context that can reveal the depths of the prayer? How did the early disciples anticipate the prayer? What about the environment where Jesus first taught the disciples how to pray? Believing that the environment itself presents profound opportunities to re-discover the truths and depths of the Lord's Prayer, author and pastor Danielle Shroyer took a 27 hour flight from Dallas to Jerusalem, spent two weeks in the Holy Land, by walking where Jesus walked, and prayed where Jesus prayed. Apart from a profound renewal of the spirit and the refreshment of the soul, there are plenty of revelations about the Lord's Prayer. So amazing was her experience that while she did not intend to write anything like this before the journey, after the journey, the whole experience was so overwhelming that she simply had to write this book, to showcase the amazing pilgrimage of faith, and her interactions with fellow pilgrims. Above all, it is a book that describes how she personally enjoyed God.She begins at Tiberias, at the cliffs of Arbel being moved not to words but to silence as she gazes at the horizons of Galilee, which reminds her of how Jesus begins his prayer with awe and wonder: ""Our Father, which art in heaven."" Thoughts on ""Hallowed be Thy Name"" feels different than normal. It teaches her to be captivated by God's presence more than being engrossed with God's presents. Some of us repeat the Lord's prayer like a meaningless and repetitive ritual. Somehow, the glimpsing of the terrain at the Holy Land tells the pastor-author of Dallas's Journey Church, that there is more than meets the prayer.The land, the sights, the atmosphere has that strange aura of mystery that brings together the senses of sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, and wonder. Even the air molecules have a certain fullness in them to be experienced in order to be believed. At the house Church of St Peters in Capernaum, Shroyer reflects on the very place Jesus went to when John the Baptist was arrested. Far from the city, this ""hometown of Jesus"" reminds the author of ""Give us this day"" and the simple lifestyle of the rural town. Asking for this one day to be received with gratitude, one learns before the petition to be grateful for whatever that already had been given: The day. At the seven springs, also known as Tabgha, the author experiences peace, quietness, and fullness. Even when we come to the place feeling empty and hungry, like the feeding of the 4000 there is a kind of feeding at that place that leads to joy overflowing, just like the basketfuls of leftovers. At the Church of the Beatitudes, she thinks of ""Thy kingdom comes"" as she marvels at the landscaped grounds, the octagonal designs, and especially the restricted places that mark out areas where visitors are not to step into. It brings to mind the series of beatitudes that expresses both ""openness and tension."" At the Church of St Peter's Primary which is built near the shorelines where Jesus had breakfast with his disciples after the Resurrection, it symbolizes the place of redemption, where Peter was reinstated. The prayer ""On earth as it is in heaven"" brings about heavenly blessings on earthy grounds. While the Lord's Prayer is also seen as a prayer of petition, it is more about holy structuring of the way we ask. If Jesus' time on earth is about bringing heaven to earth, we are called to continue in this ministry.When looking out the window of a sanctuary at Duc in Altrum, Shroyer observes the eight pillars, each symbolizing a named woman in the Gospels. The eighth one was left unmarked to represent all the women who served Jesus in the Church. It was such a tangible moment that leaves the author mesmerized by the way it brings together the community of women. Extrapolating from this, she thinks about the Lord's Prayer being a communal prayer, with an emphasis on ""us."" At the Western entrance of the Jezreel Valley of Lower Galilee is the city of Mount Megiddo. It boasts as a place having 26 layers of occupation. It has a rich history of of takeovers and occupations by various forces. It is a powerful glimpse into the past, leading Shroyer to think about forgiving others, as others had forgiven us. Caesarea Maritima in Judea was a primary administrative center under Caesar Augustus, which was also where Pontius Pilate chose to make his home. A significant place mentioned in the book of Acts, it was also a place where Origen wrote many of his theological works. Shroyer looks at the role of the early church and ponders about the way Church had adapted over the years. With the Lord's Prayer that ends with ""Forever and ever, amen,"" it becomes a fascinating opportunity to imagine how the Church will become toward the end. Other significant places in the book are Bethesda, Bethlehem, Gethsemane, and of course Jerusalem. At the end of the book is  brief guide to the stations of the cross, also known as the Via Dolorosa.Through Shroyer's very personal journal and sharing of the spiritual significance of each place in itself is an enticing invitation for readers to visit the Holy Land for themselves. I like the way each place is described at the beginning of each chapter. It helps bring historical contexts and the cultural significance of that day. At the same time, it readies the readers to anticipate the revelation of things to come. The biblical passages selected to parallel the descriptions of place enable readers to see the biblical importance. The places look foreign to readers who have never been to Israel, but with this book, we have a guide to help us navigate the geography and terrain of the places where Jesus walked and ministered in. With a keen eye on the Lord's Prayer, Shroyer weaves in her spiritual discoveries with the overall praying process. As I ponder about the way the Lord's Prayer can be so powerfully infused in the historical places in the Holy Land, I think about the many opportunities available to us in other ways. We can learn to extrapolate the experiences in the Middle East to the rest of the world. With the link between place and prayer, we can learn to appreciate the places we frequent and to pray with the eyes of Jesus, to be creative in pondering over the following questions:Where would Jesus walk if he is in this place today?How would Jesus pray when in my particular situation?In what manner can the Lord's Prayer inform us in praying for our land?""Where Jesus Prayed"" is no ordinary book. It is a book soaked in appreciation for the rich history the Holy Land carries. It is a glimpse of how Jesus had lived, how he ministered, and what prompted him to pray like he did. While tour books and guide magazines can give us highlights of each tourist attraction, it takes a person with a spiritual awareness in order to look beyond the sights and listen beyond the sounds. This book does exactly that, and I would strongly recommend that Christians wanting to do a pilgrimage at the Holy Land, bring along with them two books. The first is Charles Dyer and Gregory Hatteberg's ""The Christian Traveler's Guide to the Holy Land."" The second is this book by Danielle Stroyer.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Paraclete Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Five contributors, five views, five counter-responses per view, but only one shared concern: How to reach out the the youths of the 21st Century better and more effectively? Inspired by a 2001 book published under the title ""Four Views of Youth Ministry and the Church,"" the intention is to update the views as our world becomes more complex. Instead of going forth to present another model, there is a shift toward a firmer footing on theological considerations. Instead of simply the ""what"" and the ""how"" of doing youth ministry, the view is about the ""why"" and ""where"" of application. We are living in a world of newer challenges. Instead of having young people coming into our churches, we have an era where young people are leaving churches in droves. We have the rise of the Nones. The five academics, practitioners, and authors agree about the need for ""theological, psychosocial, and ecological grounding"" for the work of youth ministry. Greg Stier (Gospel Advancing View) is founder and president of Dare 2 Share ministry which focuses on equipping youths to do evangelism, out of which discipleship would flow. Fernando Arzola (Ecclesial View) as Associate Professor of religion at Nyack College sees formal teaching as the key strategy for nurture and discipleship of youths. Ron Hunter (Family Focused View) is director of Randall house as well as the Director of the D6 Conference. Brain Cosby (Reformed Youth View) is Lead Pastor of Wayside Presbyterian Church and visiting professor at Reformed Theological Seminary. General editor, Chap Clark (Adoption Model) is Professor and Chair of the youth, family, and culture department at Fuller Theological Seminary.The first view is Greg Stier's ""Gospel Advancing View"" which basically believes that Jesus himself was a youth leader! The ones called to change the world are all youths. The goal is not evangelism but nurture of teenagers who would do the work of witnessing and the sharing of the Word. It is essentially discipleship where the vital elements are: 1) equipping for relational ministry; 2) sharing of stories; 3) persistent gospeling activities at youth meetings; 4) empowering and focusing on the 10%; 5) gospeling everything; 6) Prayer. Criticisms come fast and furious leaving Stier to acknowledge that his model while is high on the ""go"" portion, may be deficient in the ""grow"" aspect.The second view is Brian Cosby's ""Reformed View"" which seeks to put youth ministry under the umbrella of distinctively reformed theological doctrines via the ""means of grace"" of prayer, Word, sacraments, service, and gospel community. Faithfulness is more important than success. If the Bible provides the ""content and method,"" the means of grace provide the how to go about youth ministry. The criticisms tend to be about the overwhelming slant toward Reformed theology in an increasingly nondenominational world; the danger of disconnecting the church from the youths if one was to shove theological content down the throats of the young; doctrinal polarizations; etc.The third view is Chap Clark's ""Adoption View"" which believes that we need a community of faith to raise a young in faith. He goes through a historical overview from Mike Yaconelli's experiment model to Doug Field's Purpose Driven Youth Ministry. He cites Mark Senter III's three statements about youth ministry which make a lot of sense. 1) Youth Ministry begins when adults enter in; 2) Youth Ministry happens when adults help the young to mature in Christ; 3) Youth Ministry ceases when the adult-youth discipleship relationship breaks down. The idea of a family adoption model shows us that youths do not grow on their own. They need an interested adult or mature spiritual person to guide them. The responses are gracious and humble as the other respondents applaud many things learned from Clark. Some have even added new dimensions to understanding the adoption model! Clark then summarizes his view as ""inviting our young into the calling, life, and work"" of the kingdom.The fourth view is Fernando Arzola's ""Ecclesial View"" tries to put youth ministry back under the purview of the Church. The concern is that modern youth ministries tend to be separated from the main church ministries and are in danger of missing out on the rich history and traditions of the church. The Orthodox perspective needs to be reappropriated, not abandoned. Youth Ministry must includes the four creedal characteristics: 1) Oneness; 2) Holiness; 3) Catholicity; 4) Apostolic. Thus, youth ministry is less about entertainment but ecclesiastically grounded. While heavy in theology, the criticisms are on the practical aspects of how. In response, Arzola maintains that the lack of applications should not undermine the focus on theological grounding.The fifth view is Ron Hunter's ""D6 View"" which is short for Deuteronomy 6. The key emphasis is for parents and teachers to consistently teach, model, and build relationships with the young, a form of generational discipleship. It is a team effort. Parents must be coached to be coaches. Students need ""vital concepts, character building, and biblical values."" Parents are the primary spiritual caregivers. If Arzola is heavy on theology, Hunter's view is heavy on family focus.So What?========Each view has both strengths and weaknesses. The responses of each contributor to each proposed view are rich and varied. Like iron sharpening iron, not only did the five authors learn from one another, they helped nuance the complexity and the changing needs of youth ministry. Readers can benefit from the academic, the practical, the issues, and the historical lessons we can learn from. Although the editor has explained the exclusion of other prominent youth experts like Doug Fields and Kara Powell, I still believe that there is room for a sixth view. A dedicated website has been set up for readers to check out as and when there are updates.Youth ministry remains one of the most, if not the most, challenging ministries in any Church. Sadly for some, this segment has largely disappeared. Some churches bring in ""superstar youth pastors"" and some passionate volunteers to run the ministry. Others use big budgets, sophisticated programming, but still find it challenging to cultivate spiritual maturity among the youths. The goal of this book is not to convince us of any one view, but to provide five basic ingredients for us to learn of, so that we can discern and develop a combination that is appropriate for our congregations. I believe that this book is needed for at least three reasons. First, youth ministry is big. Just because the youth departments of many churches are not growing does not mean that there is a shrinking youth population. There will always be young people. We must not forget that children will eventually grow up, and when they do, will there be a ministry that can help them grow? Second, youth ministry is complex. A pastor friend of mine tells me that youth ministries need to be re-invented every two years. While I may dispute the exact number of years, I would concur with the need to look at re-inventing ourselves regardless of whether the tool is working or not. With a complex youth ministry, there is lots of room for five different views, even more. The range of options available to us will suddenly become broader. For youth ministers and volunteers, this book will give a good overview of the different views so that they can have maximum number of resources available for their use. Third, youth ministry is vital. This cannot be over-emphasized as the young will form the leadership core for all of our churches. There is no running away from aging. Even the most faithful and fervent leaders will grow old. The gifted will gradually age and fade away. What remains will be those who have been discipled in Christ. This book is not about whether we agree with all, with some, or with none of them. It is about being humble enough to acknowledge that youths all over the world are important. We need one another. Thanks to the five authors, readers will benefit from the plethora of knowledge and experience that the Church so badly needs.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Baker Academic and Graf-Martin Communications in exchange for an honest review.

"Is absolute separation of Church and State truly possible? If yes, does that mean politics are only for secularists, atheists, and people who willingly suppress their religious beliefs before entering the political arena? If no, how can religion be relevant in the complicated arena of politics? Former United States Senator, John Danforth looks back on his years of political experience and believes that religion and politics can do better by ""balancing power, not practicing sacrificial love."" In order words, religion has an important role to play in this broken world of politics and power. The task for people of faith to work with government becomes more urgent as the nation becomes gridlock with infighting, policy shifts, national debt, immigration complexities, and so on. Many political leaders seem stuck with so much to do and lack the knowledge and will of what to do about it. According to Danforth, here is where people of faith can do their part in helping to fix what is broken. The author also notes that people of faith, particularly Christians need to recognize that God is sovereign over all, including politics; Love is to be central in our living; and working together and connecting with one another are universal traits of a good and democratic society. That is why he urges people of faith to be actively engaged in all spheres of life, even politics. Not politicizing religion, but living as responsible citizens who help to shape societal values through genuine care for the welfare of the nation. Let me summarize the book in six key points.First of all, it is important to know what to do and what not to do. Do not confuse religion with topical issues. Do not turn faith principles into some political platform. Do not equate a religious stand with a political party. Danforth puts forth four fundamental concepts to begin this collaborative work.Keep politics in its proper place and recognize that the State is not God.Advocate for the common good, not just the good of any one religious stand.Work for national unity and reconciliation.Be willing to work toward a common agreement with a spirit of compromise.Far too many Americans are fixated on the first ten amendments of the constitution, which are basically on individual rights and freedoms. The concern of ""We the People"" must take precedence over ""I the individual."" He advocates for people of faith to participate in the spirit of serving the people rather than fighting for individual rights.Second, be clear about the role of politics and religion. Politics in its proper sense holds the nation together. It needs to respect the cultural diversities and uphold the rule of law. While religion can enrich politics, we cannot let religion dominate politics. A good politician recognizes the complexity of the environment and not settle for simplistic solutions. That is why Danforth believes that ""in sum, politics is a world of competing interests and trade-offs."" He uses two key principles in distinguishing politics from religion. The first principle is that politics aim at balancing powers on earth while religion acknowledges that we are all under a Higher Power. The second principle is that politics aim to assign rights for individuals as fairly as possible while religious beliefs like Paul's exhortation to the Philippians urges us to look more to the interest of others than ourselves. Rather than to condemn or to dismiss political involvement altogether, religious people have a lot to contribute for the improvement of the political climate and process.Third, a nation thrives when virtues and values become central to the way citizens live. Danforth believes that religions is the ""most persistent and effective teacher of virtue."" He compares the violence that frequently happens at European soccer stadiums and the relatively restrained environment of Cardinals' fans in America. He traces the development of ""virtuous citizens"" with the environment that we grow up with. Those living in a house with present fathers will grow up better. We must cultivate a big picture mentality by recognizing that we have a role to play in protecting humankind. We need to build trust between the people and government. He cautions us against adopting ""libertarianism"" policies that have underlying egoism values. This self-interest philosophy is contrasted with the Christian message of loving our neighbour.Fourth, we need to cultivate a sense of ""one nation."" Our social cohesion and community spirit are key to nation building. We need to find ways to battle individualism and to honour the practice of community living. Politics by nature is a collective activity. Instead of constantly asking ""What's in it for me?"" we need to ask more of ""What can I do for my country?"" By sharing a common bond, people of faith can build relationships via ministries of reconciliation as exemplified by Matthew 5:23-34, the part where we learn to be reconciled to one another before offering our gifts to God at the altar. Churches and congregations can lead the way by showing the unity and love needed in nation building. Danforth learns from Martin Luther King Jr on how we can bring together a racially diverse nation. Poorer churches can be turned into community places of help, and churches playing their roles in helping to connect communities. Like Paul's teaching in Romans 12:16, Christians can learn to associate with the lowly and to share resources.Fifth, people of faith can choose to be creative and encourage orderliness in a world where chaos can run amok. Chaos can come in many forms. From the breakdown of government to the broken processes and systems that bind communities together. The way to bring order is not totalitarianism but co-creating, tilling, and keeping of God's garden. Policy changes cannot be haphazard but slowly done after much deliberation and discussion. This is where the leadership maxim is appropriate: ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" Sadly, modern political environment has become more fragmented, polarized, and dysfunctional. Some practical things the author suggests are the improvement of collegiality among families of politicians; encourage travel together through appropriate financial packages; and to work to create a government that works rather than to put stumbling blocks to make government look bad. Accept that politicians are human too, not super people who never make mistakes. Christians can play the role of active reformers not simply on the basis of policy making but people relationships building.Sixth, learn to walk the fine rope of when to compromise and when to stick to basic principles. This is perhaps the most tricky of all as Christians often come with staunch principles. According to Danforth, compromise may sometimes be necessary in order to move positive changes forward. There is no need to use absolute principles as a hammer to get things done. Compromise must be honourable to all. It needs to be respectful. Danforth takes aim at erroneous ideas of conservatism that tends to be more stubbornness rather than noble principles. Whatever it is, people of faith have a responsibility to encourage the formation and running of an effective government.As a Republican and a Christian, this book represents the hard work and personal quest of the author who believes that God is neither Republican nor Democrat. Faithful people can be found in both camps. They can use their gifts for the betterment of the nation without degenerating into name calling or irresponsible lobbying. Danforth believes that as long as people of faith stay on the peripherals or outside of politics, it is difficult to influence positive changes. The way forward is:- Work toward structural changes rather than ideologies or policies- More people who believe and who respond to a higher calling- Faithful people who believe that mending a broken nation is possible.Can religion and politics be truly separated? No. It's not possible. Politics by its nature will infiltrate all levels of society, including the religious realms. Will religious adherents take everything the government throws at them? Marxism, Communism, Islamic regimes, and even state-led Christendom, have all done that. Unless Christians all become hermits, flee to the secluded places of the earth, and totally disengage from all levels of society, it is not possible for Christians to practice their faith without at some point of time contending with political powers on issues of faith. The question is not whether to keep religion and politics separate. The question is HOW to engage at a healthy level for the good of all. This book certainly gives readers an inside look at how government functions and more importantly, how people of faith can assist and encourage the formation of a functioning government that not only works but works for the people. In doing so, they are participants of the prayer that let God's will be done in heaven as well as on earth. For the benefit not just for Christians or people of faith, but for all citizens. Politics is not dirty. It's sin that makes people dirty, not politics.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Random House Publishers and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"One of the biggest challenges between the academy and churches lies with expectations. The former thrives in an intellectually challenging environment while the latter tends to be focused on most things practical, managerial, logistical, and of course, pastoral. This gives rise to a whole set of difficulty when churches try to recruit pastors and when theological school graduates try to find a place to serve in churches. What about something in-between? What about an expectation that elevates the best of both worlds and minimizes the worst of both? It would be an ideal combination. According to authors Hiestand and Wilson, pastor-theologians fit the bill. In fact, arguing from historical trends, they claim that the pastors of yesterday are very much theologically astute and unashamedly scholarly. The need is urgent as our modern era seems to have a ""theologically anemic"" church and an ""ecclesially anemic"" theology. Pastors must not only be equipped but encouraged to pursue the theological vocation vigorously. The key problem is a culture that splits the theologian from the pastoral making it incomprehensible for both to exist in any one person. Even the renowned British theologian, NT Wright had to quit his job as ""senior pastor"" so that he can pursue his gifts in theological education and as a scholar. Wright confesses after serving 6 years as a pastor: ""But my continuing vocation to be a writer, teacher and broadcaster, for the benefit (I hope) of the wider world and church, has been increasingly difficult to combine with the complex demands and duties of a diocesan bishop. I am very sad about this, but the choice has become increasingly clear."" It tells of how hard it is even for one of the best theologians in the world to be a pastor of a regular Church. If it is hard for Wright, what about the rest of us?This book is essentially about them making a case for the increasing role of the pastor-theologian as a single person, not two. In Chapter One, we learn the need for a clear ""new division of labor"" where pastors and theologians need to be seen as one unit. This means the academy must learn to address more concerns of church at the layperson level and at the same time, churches to allow their pastors to pursue scholarly perspectives and theological excellence. The new vision for the pastor-theologians contains two critical elements: Need and Identity. Needs do not always flow from identity, and the converse is also true. The modernity problem is that contemporary parish ministry is not conducive for anyone desiring to do ""sustained theological reflection and scholarship."" This is not the case in history as many of the most important theologians of the Church are pastors. People like Augustine, Basil, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Calvin, Edwards, Wesley, and others. This is dealt in depth in Chapter Two of the book, which looks at the historical development of theology in the Church. In the early years of the Church, due to persecutions and the newness of faith, much teachings center on ""exhortative rather than theological."" By the second century, the rise of heresies and pagan philosophies led to an increase in the number of theologians like Irenaeus of Lyon, Cyprian of Carthage, and Origen. The fourth to the seventh centuries produced some of the most dazzling array of theologians like the first doctors of the Church. By the first 1200 years, monasteries and universities marked a new era in theological training and institutional networks. Third, the authors lament the ""great divorce"" of the theologian and the pastor. Using the backdrop of the Enlightenment movement in Europe and the secularization, urbanization, democratization, and anticlericalism in North America, readers learn that complexity of cultural shifts play a big role in affecting how theologians and pastors are perceived. In Chapter Four, we discover the problem of how ""bad religion"" impacts theological thought and ethical beliefs. Hiestand and Wilson put the blame squarely on the anemic theology in the Church. The root cause: Erroneous division of labour that separates the theologian from the pastor. Chapter Five expands on this ""ecclesial anemia"" with the authors highlighting two challenges: a) The challenge of both theologians and pastors enabled to ask the same questions; b) the need for open theological engagement for common issues that matter to all. Without this common front, the division of labour and perceptions will continue. Chapter Six brings out the need for the pastor theologian through a ""threefold taxonomy."" The ""local theologian"" is one who constructs theology for the local Church. The ""popular theologian"" writes for both his church congregation as well as beyond. The ""ecclesial theologian"" is perhaps the one who would cast the widest net in constructing theology for other theologians, pastors, churches, and the believers at large. Rather than allocating a chapter for each of the three stated taxonomies, Hiestand and Wilson concentrates on the third that is largely ""lost."" It is this third kind of pastor-theologian who will be able to bridge the gap between the Church and the Academy. Such a person is first a pastor, then a theologian in the sense that his responsibility to his flock frames the construction of his theology. Just like John Calvin whose pastoral vocation provides the context for the writing of his Institutes. They write that the difference between an ecclesial theologian and a local theologian lies in the former's theological writing ministry. The former writes for other theologians and pastors. Chapter Seven lists eight characteristics of the ecclesial theologian.He ""inhabits the ecclesial social location"" or otherwise known as the ""vocational pastor""He asks appropriate ""ecclesial questions""He aims for ""clarity over subtlety""He ""theologizes with a preaching voice""He is a theologian for the ChurchHe ""works across the guilds""He partners with the ""academic theologian""He is able to ""peel back"" common beliefs, reshape the theology that is consistent with the gospel and with the timesChapter Eight sets out eight strategies on how to develop the pastor theologian as an ecclesial theologian. The first strategy is about training in which the authors propose the pursuit of a PhD. In such a pursuit, the student is able to network and publish for the masses. The second strategy is to create a theological culture starting with the Church staff. The third strategy is to network widely. The fourth strategy is to protect and to use one's study time well. Hiestand and Wilson even suggest using a ""blowtorch"" for such a purpose. The fifth strategy involves intensive and extensive reading/writing of theology. Strategy six seems to be strange as it urges one to refer to one's workplace as one's study. It makes sense when I think about it because that is essentially merging the two roles of pastor and theologian right from the beginning. I like strategy seven which makes the case for building an intentional ""study-and-writing"" leave. Strategy eight is like discipleship where the existing pastor-theologian hires an intern to do the same. The last two strategies of getting buy-in from the church leadership and the need for love to trump proclamations of truth seem too important to be left to the last.So What?Is the pastor-theologian possible in this day and age? It will be like pushing a big rock up three hills. The first hill is the church mindset and culture. Just reading books like this is not enough. Church members need to not only see the need for theology in the Church, they must recognize that without theological depth, the Church will continue to flounder and managed according to principles learned from the office, from external organizations. After all, if members of the church spend six out of seven days in the world, there is a good chance that members often bring the world into the Church. That makes the challenge of culture changes even more difficult. In such situations, it is much easier for such members to understand the church in worldly terms than to understand the church in theological terms.The second hill is the financial and human resources. The Church must be big enough or has the financial muscle to hire more staff to address the many pressing needs in a typical church. If the Church is to give time and space for the role of a pastor-theologian, there must be a reasonable time and space allocated for the conventional and spiritual needs of the church such as visitation, pastoral care, program planning, Sunday services, and so on.The third hill, and probably most controversial of all, is we need some kind of a heresy for any church to start taking theology more seriously. There is a historic precedent for that. Remember the writings of the creeds? The Athanasian and the Nicene creeds were all written to counter the heresies against the Trinity and the Person of Jesus Christ respectively.It will be tough but not impossible to create space for the birth of more pastor theologians. In order for the ecclesial theologian to emerge, we need more local and popular theologians. We need more role models. We need more theological challenges that the laypersons would appreciate. As long as churches are bogged down by the day-to-day issues of meeting present needs and licking past wounds, churches will remain myopic about their direction and their ecclesial purpose. We need bold leadership to take a stand and create space for for both theological and pastoral vocations.The pastors of today are very different from those in the ancient times. They are expected to be more of practitioners rather than theologians; execute workmanship rather than scholarship; and to be interested more in the functional more than the intellectual. Most people do not expect their pastors to be theologians, though they would reckon them to have some theological training. Be pragmatic. Be approachable. Go simple. According to Gerald Hiestand and Todd Wilson, co-founders of the Center for Pastor Theologians, this need not necessarily be the case. Using the historical revivals and ancient examples of theologically rich pastorate in the past, they assert that ""the pastor theologian"" today is a ""rare species."" With this book, it is hoped that we have planted the seeds of the emergence of a two-in-one future pastor-theologian in every Church.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Zondervan Academic and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"From Prayer Readers to Prayer Radicals. This is what this book is about. It is not just prayer per se that makes it powerful. It is about God. Prayer is everything about God. Such a focus beyond ourselves, a longing for the Divine, and unreserved desiring after God is the heart of radical prayer. Author Manny Mills goes a step further by saying that radical praying fulfills ""the Great Commandment and, in doing so, equips and unleashes individual believers like you and me to slavishly know and serve God as His loving witnesses to this lost world."" The author is Manny Mill, CEO of Koinonia House, who graduated from Wheaton College and works behind prison walls both inside and outside the US.Mill starts at the beginning that we need to experience a crisis of ministry before we can build a conviction in prayer. A prayerless preacher is essentially a self-dependent person. Without prayer, one will be spiritually disqualified from preaching. Prayer is not about asking for things whenever we have a need. It is a relationship that we cherish and long after God more and more. Once we are convicted about prayer, we are ready for radical change. Helped by the prayer writings of E.M. Bounds, Mill gets a renewed personal application of sola scripture as the basis of all prayer. Prayer must become our mother tongue, our default language, and our natural behaviour. He begins to work on removing the distractions to prayer. His attempts at prayer walking trigger some concern about his health. He learns about three roadblocks to prayer:  Fear of Sins exposed  Fear of Pain  Fear of Losing ControlSuch fear can be overcome by love, just like his pastor friends, Eric and Marco, who led a gang member to Christ after battling evil forces with prayer and the Word of God. It was a powerful story of how Freddie the gang member openly pleaded guilty to his past crimes and miraculously spared of jail. While the presiding judge base his trust on the testimonies of the two pastors cum police officers, Mill points out the bigger reason: God's Mercy.  What does radical prayer looks like? There are several facets to that. The primary one is the relentless focus on God's glory. Using the Lord's Prayer, Mill shows us six basic petitions for our prayers. With hallowing God's Name as the primary purpose, the rest of the five are aimed at supporting this. Like praying for God's Kingdom come, that God's Name be hallowed. Or Receiving our daily bread for the glory of God. Radical Prayer is shamelessly persistent. It continues to ask, knock, and seek. It is different from badgering God as it is not about the intensity of our asking but the depth of our heart's longing for God to be glorified. Radical prayer is also powerful as prayer is asking for God's direct presence with us. We pray for the Holy Spirit to be with us, to anoint us for good works, and to pray in the power of the Holy Spirit. Radical prayer is love. We intercede for loved ones because we love them. We pray that God be glorified because we love God. Mill turns the Old Testament narrative of Moses bargaining with God, as a way in which God tempered Moses's emotions. That is most interesting as in our modern therapeutic and self-reliant world, we let prayer help us depend on God solely for inner healing. Radical prayer is also expressed in visible action. Actions of good works spring off from a position of prayer. Radical prayer is also redemption at work. Mill shares about George Whitefield's four petitions to imitate Christ via humility, passion, burning love, and ""single eye."" Radical prayer is total surrender, honest confession, selfless ""servitude,"" eager expectancy, and committed obedience.On and on, the pages overflow with pleas for readers to pray as they read. Not only can readers learn about the importance of prayer, the book makes me want to put the book down and just pray. If there is a single take away from the reading of this book, it is one thing: God's glory. The Lord's Prayer is about praying God's glory be done. The Old Testament reveals the character of God, that when we look at the ancient world and how God has shown his mercy, we are filled with praise of how mighty and patient he has been. The New Testament magnifies the person of Jesus Christ, to show us the way how Jesus himself had glorified the Father. With the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, we are able to focus on honouring and glorifying God in whatever we do. In prayer, we learn to do just that.Radical prayer is not about a series of steps or methodologies to intercede. It is simply about rearranging all of our scattered activities, laying aside of distractions, and learning to bring all things under the lordship of Christ. It is one thing to say we want to do God's will. It is yet another to be sincere and convicted that God's will be done on earth as it is in heaven. In the same manner, we can pray for God's will to be done not just in the lives of other people, but also in our own lives. Radical prayer helps us to beware of prayer hypocrisy. For when we tell other people not to worry or to be too fixated about asking God for things of this world or miracles for our loved ones, we must pray that God's will be felt in our hearts first. When God is deeply felt, when we start to pray, we will not be too distracted about the curing of the person but the caring of God for us. We can be orientated not toward the gifts but the Giver. We will get a fresh appreciation of what it means to pray, and how radical praying can become the most natural thing for the disciple of Christ to do.Rating: 4.25 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Moody Publishers and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"This is the latest Zondervan study Bible based on the NIV translation. With Dr D.A Carson as the general editor, more than 60 contributors from the evangelical world have come together to create a study Bible packed with study tools, maps, notes, color diagrams, and commentaries centered on a biblical theology. The 28 articles are written by well known persons such as Kevin DeYoung, Tim Keller, Andreas J. Kostenberger, Douglas Moo, Andrew David Nasalli,  Moses Silva, etc. Commentaries are drawn from experts such as TD Alexander, Craig L. Blomberg,  Richard S. Hess, Tremper Longman III, Mark Strauss, Douglas K. Stuart, Robert W. Yarbrough, alongside Regent College professors, Rikk E. Watts, V. Philips Long, and Bruce K. Waltke. With nearly 3000 pages of commentaries, notes, maps, pictures, photos, introductory material, and extensive footnotes, every page is filled with information for the avid student to ponder and to learn. Just dealing with what is printed in front of us is enough to make us forget the things that are not there.The Introduction to each Bible book is superb. It describes the author, the date, the audience, the place of composition, and the unique situations the writers were facing. This is quickly followed by a detailed outline with themes and theologies listed for easy reference. By the time the reader has finished the introduction, he/she would have a substantial amount of contextual material for reading and contextual comprehension. On top of that, verses are arranged in such a way that the footnotes and commentaries are easily accessible from the same page. Cross referencing is so easy to do. Compared to another popular edition of the NIV Study Bible, this book is denser, thicker, heavier, and had more contributors. Comparing the standard editions, the fonts for this Bible is a little smaller. Considering this study Bible has smaller fonts with more pages, in terms of additional study notes, this study Bible packs a wallop!Perhaps the most unique in this study bible is the emphasis on biblical theology. With a list of formidable biblical scholars at the helm, the commentaries point readers back and forth to understand the historical themes as well as theological framework of the whole Bible narrative. While laypersons may not detect it straightaway, those schooled in biblical theology will quickly recognize how careful the commentators are to not just describe the texts but how the particular texts being read are linked to the overall Bible story. There is one more thing that this study bible can benefit modern readers. It is the free digital access available at www.NIVZSB.com as well as the Olive Tree app for mobile devices. The same access code per Bible can be used for both the BibleGateway web version and the Olive Tree app. With both the printed and the online versions, one can benefit practically access the NIVZSB anytime and anywhere. Create an account at BibleGateway and when reading the NIV verses, click the ""STUDY THIS"" icon and the study helps magically appear.If you are considering a study Bible, I strongly recommend this.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of BookLook Bloggers in exchange for an honest review.

"We have commentaries available for every book of the Old and New Testament. From the verse-by-verse commentaries to the exegetical commentaries, most of these resources focus on the meaning of the texts, and how these speak to the modern day person. They are helpful in showing us the background and the ancient contexts. This commentary takes a different approach. It describes the manuscripts and how we can make sense of the sources and the original writings. All of these (if not most) are based on an ""eclectic method"" where various manuscripts are selected based on compilation of a main text with contributions form other collections. This particular volume sticks with the ""actual manuscripts"" which were all second and third century manuscripts, which is as ancient as anyone could get. According to Philip Wesley Comfort, a lifelong student of the Ancient Near East with special interest in the Hebrew Bible and the Septuagint, his commentary is based on ""The Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts.""What makes this even more unique is the way it recognizes how the ancient manuscripts treat sacred names, called the nomina sacra. On the originals, sacred names have a different font and ""special calligraphy."" Words such as ""Theos"" for God; ""Kurios"" for Lord; ""Christos"" for Christ; ""Pater"" for father; and ""Iesous"" for Jesus; all come with a special writing style. I can imagine the original readers and scribes of these manuscripts literally slowing down and carefully inscribing the word(s) with deep reverence and care. Even the words for ""Son of God"" or ""Son of Man"" are carefully written in a unique format. This contrasts with the way many modern readers casually treat each sacred name like any other word. With the main manuscripts chosen, Comfort guides the readers and places extensive footnotes on scribal additions and missing portions of the texts. Like most good commentaries, Comfort does his own direct translations. For each New Testament book, Comfort lists down all the manuscripts used. He considers the earliest manuscripts (second to fourth centuries) as ""most important"" manuscripts of the New Testament. This is indeed a treasure chest of information which is brief and to the point. Dating each manuscript can be a challenging task in itself which is why Comfort uses a rule of thumb to date the documents to within 25-50 years. Combing 127 papyrus, 300 uncial (manuscripts beginning with a '0' prefix), 2800 minuscule (numbered from 2 to 2818), and using the Nestle Aland text, Novum Testamentum Graece (NA27), readers can be overwhelmed by the large amount of manuscripts. At the same time, readers will be more appreciative of the hard work put in by these researchers in order to bring to us the best texts available. The accompanying commentary brings to life the meaning and purpose of the individual manuscripts, making it a primer for anyone interested in studying the original NT scripts further.On the synoptic gospels, we begin to see how significant the various manuscripts are in deciphering the Greek language, and how the variations affect modern day translations and understanding.What I appreciate most is how the author treats the manuscripts as a way to discover nuances and explore richer meanings of the text. This is in contrast to some scholars who basically adopts a binary approach of marking a True/False statement on everything they see. Such black/white methodologies will cause one to miss out on the various shades of gray and the colours of the creation. Having said that, we come across portions of scripture where there are verses or passages omitted. Here, Comfort brings in the best explanations available and where necessary, introduce other more modern discoveries to make a reasonable case for what the texts are trying to tell us. Of interest is the missing texts after Mark 16:8. With at least five possible endings, how do readers make of them? Comfort maintains that the most accurate copy of Mark does not go beyond verse 8. We should not lose sleep over these because the missing parts can be picked up in the other gospels. He gives us four reasons to put our concerns to rest. The Gospel according to John has many references to nomen sacrum, which gives the reading a whole new level of reverence. Even words referencing to Christ like the ""cross"" are written in the original manuscripts in a sacred manner. With careful reading of how the originals give special care to the writings of the sacred names and words referencing the divine, Comfort helps us look at Scriptures with a whole new lens. Working through the Pauline Epistles, the letter to the Hebrews, the General Epistles, and Revelation, we get a sense of respect for how the early scribes take time to emphasize the writing of the biblical texts.In contrast to modern ways of recording, we tend to emphasize on mere words and letters without paying sufficient attention to reading the texts in a respectful manner. With digital media, the problem gets worse as electronic bibles can be so easily downloaded into our computing devices and forgotten. With a printed Bible, we can highlight words, underline portions of Scriptures, and to write notes on the sides. Considering the expensive writing resources in the ancient times, it is no wonder scribes are particularly careful in how they use the papyrus and the kinds of ink to be used. Preservation and clarity seem to be their chief concerns. Spiritually, they have a profound respect and reverence for the divine Word, something that is relatively lacking in our modern age of convenience and commercialization. Thankfully, with this book, readers are given a chance to revisit Scriptures and to go beyond mere red-letter editions toward respecting the sacred names in Scripture. The spirit of how the Jews and the Old Testament writers treat the Name of the LORD (Tetragrammaton) is freshly introduced in how we treat the Name of the Divine in the New Testament manuscripts. Maybe, in future, some new English translations may do the original texts more justice. One example is the Names of God Bible which I have reviewed here.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Kregel Academic in exchange for an honest review.

"Is Christianity intellectually impoverished? Are the natural signs we see evidence of the existence of God or is ""God"" a convenient catch all description of the systems or mysteries of this world? What can we make of the age-old Problem of Evil question? Can we trust God even when we do not understand certain mysteries of life? How genuine is divine revelation?Despite the proliferation of books and resources that address the criticisms, there are still plenty of accusations that Christianity is intellectually baseless. One of the most vocal groups recently who continue to attack Christians are the New Atheists. Responding to these New Atheism, Professor C. Stephen Evans delivered three lectures called the Hayward Lectures at Acadia Divinity College back in October 2012. Since then, he has expanded his content and has made available to the general public via this book, which is part of a series of books to help Christians respond to contemporary challenges with well-thought out and reasoned answers. Evans begins with a chapter on who the New Atheists were and what they say.He calls out the ""Four Horsemen"" of the New Atheist movement as represented by Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett. These individuals claim that religion is ""unscientific,"" and blames wars on religions. Instead of engaging in philosophy, these writers publish volumes for the masses to get attention from the public that seem more than ready to believe them than challenge them. They assert that religion is not only false but socially harmful. They question the underlying principles behind religions. They want to argue that religions should not be protected in anyway by society. Evans believe that these claims should not go unchallenged, especially when the New Atheists are becoming aggressive and offensive. Rather than go on another round of name calling or rhetoric, Evans prefer to argue from sound principles why Christianity makes sense.He maintains that there is value in Natural Theology which uses everyday things and nature as evidence for the existence of God. It is unfortunate that some modern theologians do not use enough of this approach. Evans points out three reasons why it should be used in the defense of Christianity. First, such evidence are easily recognized by critics. Second, the ""burden of proof"" is not necessarily only for theologians to bear. It applies to critics as well. Third, the evidence themselves presupposed the existence of God. He then shows us how to explain the concept of natural signs by using the ""Wide Accessibility Principle"" and the ""Easy Resistibility Principle.""  The former is about the pervasiveness of the signs while the latter maintains that no matter what the evidence may show, people can still choose to find a way to resist it.Evans lists five signs that point beyond mere arguments:1)  ""Experience of cosmic wonder""2)  ""Experience if purposive order""3)  ""Sense of being morally accountable""4)  ""Sense of human dignity and worth""5)  ""The Longing for transcendent joy""All of these five signs may be used as arguments but far beyond that, they are opportunities for gratitude and a sense of appreciation for the beauty we have now. Evans gives us three clear criteria for determining how God reveals Himself to us. The first is the criterion of miracles chief of which is the Resurrection of Jesus. Dealing with opposition claims from people like David Hume, Evans highlights several powerful counter-arguments from theologians like Richard Swinburne and Craig Keener. The second is the criterion of paradoxicality, on things that exist but transcends our understanding. An example is the Incarnation of Christ which supplants human reasoning. While human reasoning deems such events as ""absurd,"" paradox allows the existence of such mysteries without abandoning the ability to reason altogether. At the same time, there is a caution not to allow the paradoxical to enter the bizarre realm.Third, for the existence of authentic revelation, there needs to have the criterion of existential power. Through personal testimonies of the working of the Holy Spirit, we acknowledge that it takes far more than reason to pledge the faith in a Divine God. People who have known God intimately do not need excuses or solid arguments to convince them of the truth. After all, they have already experienced and seen the Truth for themselves.This work is more philosophical in nature with arguments that center primarily on addressing key criticisms made against Christianity. In demonstrating that Christianity is not only reasonable but defensible, Evans has used the Natural Theology approach to argue for the case of Christianity. Though he starts off by mentioning the New Atheists, gradually he goes back to address arguments used by classic philosophers like Hume, Locke, Kierkegaard, and others. By adopting this approach, he is essentially pointing out that the New Atheists do not have as strong a case as the philosophers of old. More importantly, he shows us that Christianity not only makes sense, it is entirely believable and strongly defensible. My critique is that he could have allocated more space to dealing with the four horseman of the New Atheists. Other than that, the book is generally clear and readers should find it a helpful guide on how to use natural evidence of the world to appreciate the Creator of creation and the Maker of Heaven and Earth. By the way, what if we turn it around and ask: ""For every demand to see proof before believing, what about seeing proof before disbelieving?""Rating: 4 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Baker Academic and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"The fairy tales say it all. Many of them conclude with the handsome prince marrying the beautiful princess, and that famous phrase: ""And they live happily ever after."" Fact or fiction? Fiction of course, one may say. Why? Just look at the divorce statistics and a deteriorating respect for the marriage institution. There are threats not only to the institution of marriage but also to those already married, or contemplating getting married. How do we deal with the fears of marital conflicts? What are the pitfalls to be aware of? What about the prevention of divorces? What if couples can begin strong and their marriages remain intact throughout? Instead of waiting for the threats to come, this book arms readers, in particular brides, with the weapons of prayer, to fight all kinds of obstacles to a healthy marriage. Right from the start, author and speaker, Jennifer White launches with a call to battle. Marriage is not for sissies. It is for warriors in prayer. It is love on bended knees to God. It is also a book written with painful experiences. The author's first marriage collapsed. In wanting to protect her second marriage, she arms herself to the teeth with prayer, convinced that marriage is a battle worth fighting for. Learning from her failed first marriage, she enters her second with a determination not to let down her guard. The naiveness of Adam and Eve could have been avoided if they had not underestimated the power of temptation.The book is written in two parts. The first part is before the wedding and the second part is after the wedding. In Part One, we read of the nine steps to prepare for battle and to be ready to defend the marriage. First, recognize the significance of marriage as not something ""ever after"" but earnestly sought after. It is that determination to honour God whatever it takes to elevate God's Name and Glory. Second, we are loved for who we are, not what we touch ourselves up to be. Third, every marriage has an enemy: the tempter, the deceiver, the destroyer. See the bigger picture so as not to fall prey to the devil. Fourth, begin with victory and continue with that spiritual stance in Christ. Let God be the Provider and the Protector. Fifth, fight for the prize of truth. Use the spiritual weapons provided by God. Sixth, expose the enemy with the help of the Word of God. Seventh, remember that God fights for us. Eighth, plan for the victory celebration when entering the wedding day. Be determined to let the faith in Christ lead the way. Ninth, show up as a soldier for Christ ready to defend the marriage and to attack the evil one. Then, like preparing the dress, White leads us through the Armour of God passage to dress ourselves in preparing for battle. Together with the posture of courage and faith, supplemented by prayer, we will be ready.Part Two prepares for victory via basic training, partnering with God, and guarding the marriage. White shows readers the basics of what it means to be a ""forever bride.""  She provides many tips on how to be trained to honour the marriage and spouse; to see the marriage relationship from the eyes of God. It means learning to respect the husband. She shows us how to partner with God to defend with love for the husband and becoming the best spouse possible. Other aspects of protecting the marriage include being constantly nourished in the Word of God; being peaceable at home; learning emotional truths of each other; learning to pray; and many more. Toward the end, there is a chapter on abuse in marriage, where White gives some advice on what to do about it.Written by a wife for women, this collection of prayers help brides arm their marriages with prayer. Honestly, there is a strong overture of warfare and aggressive battle language that emanates throughout the book. It makes one wonder if it has been overdone. Marriage is precious and delicate. I suspect the intensity of the language of warfare is tied to the author's determination to learn from the missteps of her first marriage and apply the lessons to her second. While the descriptions in each chapter may be too overwhelming in terms of fighting and battling, I find the ""prayer prompts"" particularly helpful. That explains the title of the book. The prayers are the highlights, not the battle cries. For in prayer, we let God do the fighting for us, while we ready ourselves to respond to the promptings of God. The book cover is captivating as it summarizes in one picture what the book is about: Defending our marriages, in particularly, for the wife to declare her determination to protect the marriage with the tools as shown in Scripture.The danger for many of us is that we are not urgent enough about protecting our marriages. We may not believe in fairy-tale endings, but our lack of attention to the vulnerability of marriages be become our Achilles's heel. With this book, we are reminded once again that marriage is not to be taken for granted. If this book can stir a desire to protect and to be ready to defend our marriages against the temptations of evil, it would have worth every cent.Rating: 4 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of New Leaf Press and Cross-Focused-Reviews in exchange for an honest review.

"""You have a place in this world""; so begins the book that is marinaded with assurance and acceptance. It addresses the fundamental aspects of life, what are we searching for, where is home, and in particular, where are we. It is an invitation to journey through the dark woods and discover for ourselves the gifts that we so often miss out in our busyness of life. It is a quest for life not on the basis of following the rules and false promises of human schemes but on the basis of God alone. We do not stand on the premises of the Church in hope, but on the promise of God who is the True Giver of Hope. The gifts to be revealed in this book show us how to deal with emptiness, uncertainty, lostness, temptations, being misfits, and so on. What appears like curses can be blessings in disguise. This is what trusting and following Christ entails: Not what we expect to happen, but what surprises God has in store for us. This calls us for rearranging our inner dinner table to let God sit and the head and us being ready to dine with Him. It is a book for ""Dark Wood"" travelers. Often shunned in favour of security and clarity, Elnes brings us back to revisit the dark night of the soul, experienced by the saints of old.This is a very thought-provoking book that gives us the background behind the author's support of the Phoenix Affirmations which is now in its version 3.8. Consisting of 12 statements, it is a way forward to break the impasse between conservatives and progressives; fundamentals vs liberals, so as to practice the love of God, the love of neighbour, and the love for self in a practical way. There are many good thoughts and reflective moments. Eric Elnes is a Senior Pastor of Scottsdale Congregational United Church based in Scottsdale, Arizona. With a PhD in Biblical Studies from Princeton Theological Seminary, he has written a few books on worship, the Christian Faith, and is a key proponent of the Phoenix Affirmations. Wanting to be inclusive, he writes with a keen eye on seeing all kinds of opportunities to bring about greater cohesiveness among different groups. Every dispute is an opportunity to understand. Every spiritual crisis can be an opportunity for revival. Every difficult moment can be chance for growth. The subtitle of the book is very inviting, showing skeptics that it is ok to ask questions of the conventional, the familiar, and the common practices. At the same time, it is also ok to get stuck at various points of life. For all we know, these are ""gifts"" in which we can gradually unwrap so as to learn more about God; about neighbour; or about ourselves.All these are reminiscent of the underlying philosophies of the United Church of Christ, which is to practice Jesus' words in John 17:21 ""That they may all be one."" All in all, there is a lot of good things said in the book which can open up many AHA! moments. That said I would caution readers not to let their guard down. In a spiritual world, the Dark Woods can have opportunities for growth and contemplative learning. At the same time, it can be a dangerous place where the principalities and the forces of darkness lurk. Not every one can be as comfortable in the Dark Woods as Elnes has tried to make. For every positives, we must also beware of the snares. Discernment is important not only in the Dark Woods but also outside.Rating: 4.25 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Abingdon Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Christianity have roots in Judaism. They read the Torah or Pentateuch. They celebrate the Tehillim, (songs of praise), also known as Psalms.  Like the Proverbs and Jobs, the Psalms are part of the wisdom writings called the Ketuvim. As a convert to evangelical Christianity, the author often reflects back on her Jewish upbringing and fondly cherishes the rituals, the rules, and the meaning behind the Jewish spiritual practices. Out of that fond reflection comes the writing of this book which gives her a chance to revisit the riches of the Old Testament practices and how many of them can be appreciated in our modern world. In this updated edition, Winner adds in a greater awareness of pursuing God's justice in this world on top of just enjoying our spiritual life. She helps us reflect on how fasting can be related to caring for the poor, and how Sabbath keeping is to be integrated into the whole week by virtue of Sabbath not being at the beginning or end of the week, but the middle. She weaves into this book her own personal journey through experiencing her mum's passing, her broken marriage, a little older and wiser too. Having moved from Virginia to North Carolina, she has also moved from outside coffee shops to having coffee at home instead. In a way, this book is about moving from one place to another, in particular from Judaism to Christianity, and in the process trying to make sense of the commonality between the two. Perhaps, it is to expand the common space of understanding and to help those of us without a Jewish background to better appreciate the practices of Sabbath keeping and other important rituals. It helps us to go beyond the outer display of religiosity toward an inner appreciation of the essence of Jewish spirituality. The ""study edition"" format is about a twelfth chapter scattered throughout the other eleven in the form of study questions. For me, reading through this book is like eavesdropping the author's appreciation of her Jewish heritage from a Christian perspective.Beginning with the Shabbat, something that Winner misses most, she looks at the joys and freedom of celebrating this special day each week. Instead of seeing the day as a time to stop our active work, it is actually about us not interfering with the world that God had created. Instead of merely resting in God with creation, it is celebrating the Resurrection. Instead of the Sabbath as a forced day of rest per se, it is also about orientating ourselves toward God. It is the keeping of the Shabbat that shapes the week to come. The Kashrut (Fitting Food) is about observing Jewish dietary requirements, keeping kosher. It is more than simply eating but being attentive to what we eat. She notes the various laws against mixing dairy with meat; no eating of blood; and other dietary restrictions and contrasts that with New Testament teachings surrounding all foods that God had made clean. Establishing dietary boundaries is a very spiritual experience. We can eat seasonally. Cook attentively. Shop locally. When eating, dine as if God is present with us physically. She shares a fascinating survey of the Jewish dietary law from the anthropologist Mary Douglas who deals with the Deuteronomy and Leviticus passages. According to Douglas, the keeping of the dietary laws are in accordance with the theme of holiness expected of the Jewish people. On the Avelut, mourning, Christians can learn how to grieve. While Christianity deals well with the topics of death and resurrection, Judaism does better in offering ""the grammar for in between, for the mourning after death and before Easter."" The detailed rituals and prayers involve both personal and community participation. More importantly, we let these external exercises inform our inner need for closure in a way that befits our being. On Hachnassat orchim (hospitality), while Christians normally think of food and lodging for guests, the Jews make strangers feel at home. For some like Rabbi Yochanan, hospitality is more important than prayer. This is because it is God who first offered us hospitality and we are to do the same out of gratitude to God. It is not just inviting people into our homes. It is about inviting people into our lives, a rather difficult task, in our modern individualistic world. On Tefillah (Prayer), we learn about the many different ways people pray. In the Protestant world, much has been said about the rigidity of liturgical prayers and the shallowness of repetitive prayer. For the Jews, it is the liturgy that shapes the praying person, to learn to pray with our heart in our own hands. While we appreciate the state of emotions when we pray, liturgy is a way where we learn to pray in spite of emotions. Liturgical prayer is like using as many of the alphabets that God had given to us, while emotions tend to be a subset of these liturgy. On Guf (body), Winner observes how our modern world has diminished our natural bodies with dieting programs, facial surgeries and body boosters. While westerners tend to be suckers for all things experience and feeling, Jews take a different tack in doing things in accordance to knowing God had created them for our use, our enjoyment, and our pleasure. The true art of spirituality is to be able to pray anywhere our eyes can see, and to direct our gratitude and attention to God. There are thoughts about Tzum (fasting), what to refrain; parallels with Christianity; to fast on the one hand that another can be refreshed on the other hand. It is a moment to reconnect our selves with our bodies, to give us a breather from constant eating or binging. There is a chapter on Hiddur P'nai Zaken (aging) where readers catch a glimpse of old people like Abraham who bothers not with the physical ailments or concerns of today but to cherish the wisdom of the new phase of life. It is also a spiritual practice where we affirm our relationships in the family tree; be thankful for the years past; and to live forward by being more forgiving and more gracious. It is also preparing for one's eventual death, or some may want to put it, a meeting with God finally face to face. There are chapters on Hadlakat nerot (candle light); Kiddushin (weddings) and Mezuzut (doorposts).The beauty in this book is not just the stories of the Jews or the theologies of the Christians. It is the gentle telling of what the rituals mean to both Jews and Christians, and how they can inform each other on the glory and purposes of God. Reading each chapter brings back lots of memories about the stories I have heard in my studies of spirituality. Winner was one of my memorable Summer School professors as well. Her writing is crisp; the stories heartwarming; and the journey very personal. One can sense how much Winner misses the Jewish practices as she uses the actual Hebrew words to represent the rituals. Translating it to modern English takes away some of the beauty of the language. Thankfully, Winner supplements this with stories from the Bible, the desert fathers, the Jewish rabbis, spiritual masters, modern writers, and the way the Jewish rituals are performed and what they meant. I appreciate the insights given by the author which bridges the gulf of understanding between Christians and Jewish practices. Reading this book tells me how much I do not understand about Judaism, and the riches behind the religious practices of the Hebrews.The study sections at the end of each book not only summarizes many of the salient points, they also engage the reader to do his or her own application of Jewish practices into Christian spirituality. Often used in conjunction with a Bible passage, this discussion section makes this book an appropriate book for small groups to discuss Jewish practices for Christians. Many of these discussion questions contain stories that are ready case study situations. In a scientific world, we tend to be fixated on a question and answer format. Winner avoids these with open ended questions that groups can choose to discuss at length. This is a beautiful book. I highly recommend this book for personal and group reading.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Paraclete Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"What is prophecy? Is it only something limited to the biblical prophets? Do prophets still exist today? What do we make of the unconditional, conditional, and unfulfilled prophecies in the Bible? How do we understand prophecy in the first place? In this book, two authors, one holding a Premillennial disposition and another an Amillennial perspective come together to describe the common themes in interpreting biblical prophecy. At the same time, their diverse background allows them to interact constructively without necessarily compromise their respective theological stands. Alan Bandy is Professor of New Testament at Oklahoman Baptist University while Benjamin Merkle is Professor of New Testament and Greek at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary.Arranged in three parts, the book covers the basics and keys of understanding biblical prophecy (Part 1); followed by an application on Old Testament prophecies (Part 2); and the same for the New Testament (Part 3).  Closely related to prophecy is the word ""eschatology"" which is often perceived as foretelling the future. Readers will learn how the word can be nuanced in at least seven ways: Individual; Historical; Consistent; Realized; Existential; Comprehensive; and Teleological. For the authors, they use ""eschatology"" as an all-encompassing term to denote the ""cosmic, spiritual, and historical realities"" fulfilled in the Person of Jesus Christ. Prophecy needs to be understood within the confines of the Bible and the redemptive narrative. It is to be understood in terms of Gospel-Centric and Christo-Centric.  Most important is the need to read prophecy with ""contextual sensitivity to the history, literature, and theology of an individual writer, book, and passage."" This is then interpreted in line with the larger biblical narrative. Prophecy is also understood as ""progressive revelation"" where certain things were partially revealed to the people in the old Testament, and fully realized in the future. One use is to see the New Testament as fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. Readers are cautioned not to use the Bible as proof texts of some precise prediction, just like the Left Behind series of books and film. Others avoid prophecy totally and lose sight of the role of prophecy altogether. With a biblical, theological, and christological approach, we will be able to approach biblical prophecies with expectancy and much encouragement of God's purpose for us.Written with the interested layperson in mind, Bandy and Merkle works through what biblical prophecy is. It is primarily ""forthtelling"" which means speaking a word from God to address existing situations. It is also ""foretelling"" which talks about a future fulfillment. Readers are introduced to the role of the prophets and their unique ministries. They reveal God to the people. Their messages are not mere predictions but God's counsel to the existing climate, speaking for God in a particular context and time. They are less of fortune telling but more of reformers speaking specifically God's instructions to a people in need of the Word. Broadly speaking, prophets focus on one or more of the following prophecies: Of Repentance; of Judgment; and of Restoration. Prophecy can also be described in terms of prose and poetry. They do not just communicate information. They encapsulate the beauty of God and His love to a people through literary art, symbolism, and imagery. Not to be sidelined, prophecy is also about apocalyptic literature and symbolism.In order to help understand prophecy from a biblical standpoint, one needs to understand biblical theology as well. With this, readers can appreciate how prophecy plays a part in the overall biblical story. There is a unified message. The Bible is God's Word. Learning to understand prophecy also means distinguishing the genres of literalism, allegory, and typology. The climax of all revelation and prophecy is the Person of Jesus Christ and God's overall redemptive narrative.Having laid down the foundations of understanding prophecies, readers are treated to a wide variety of Old Testament and New Testament prophecies, and how the interpretive framework can be applied. On the Old Testament, we learn of prophecies that are fulfilled, partially fulfilled, and future fulfillment. Closely tied to this interpretation is the place of conditional and unconditional covenants. Restoration prophecies apply mostly to the state of Israel while Messianic prophecies refer to the fulfillment of prophecies in Jesus Christ. Another useful way to interpret prophecies in the Old Testament is to learn how the New Testament uses them. Jesus's words are often very instructive. For those of us who tend toward literalistic interpretations, it is important to recognize the contexts and languages used by the prophets to the people at that time. In other words, do not adopt a modern mindset when mining the truths of the prophecies. In those days, people don't have cars, airplanes, modern conveniences, the Internet, or the ease of Google! New Testament prophecies reveal much more about Jesus and the way the Kingdom will be fulfilled in God's timing. We have John the Baptist announcing the coming of the Messiah. We have the birth, the message, and the ministry of the Messiah. As much as Jesus fulfills the prophecies of the Old Testament, He too proclaims the coming of the Kingdom now and not yet. The Gospels and Acts record the redemptive history in Jesus. A bulk of it is recorded in Matthew 24. Two major prophecies include the destruction of the temple and Jerusalem in AD 70 and the second coming of Christ. The authors even give their own versions of the who and what of ""Left Behind."" The epistles showcase the prophecies of the Second Coming of Christ. There is ample last days language. Revelation talks more specifically about the return of Christ through symbolism and imagery. Many of them are self-interpretive, like the seven churches. The authors conclude by asserting the critical place of prophecy in biblical revelation.Well written and thoroughly biblically based, this book sure offers a lot for the lay reader. The authors leave no testament unturned as they go through both testaments to understand the many prophecies recorded from Genesis to Revelation. The first three chapters form the foundation of the whole book and must be read first. Only then can readers appreciate the approach taken by the author. Far too often, Christians are afraid to tackle the interpretation of prophecies is because of a faulty understanding of prophets and prophecies. Even church leaders are ill equipped to offer interpretive guidance. With this book, the basics are covered and the examples are provided. By categorizing the different forms of prophecies, readers learn to nuance the unique place of prophecies and ancient contexts. At the same time, we recognize the key role of Jesus Christ, for all prophecies will eventually point back to Him, the Author and Finisher of our faith. Use this book as a reference rather than a crystal ball to search for proof texts. Use it for framing our teaching of prophecy. For the lay persons, if you can even get through chapter 1, you would have learned quite a lot already.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Kregel Academic in exchange for an honest review.

"Exegetical commentaries are one of the best kinds of Bible commentaries ever published. While commentaries in general will have lots of contextual descriptions and insightful observations of the text, being exegetical means learning to journey through the Scriptures with the commentator as a wise and learned guide. Designed and written with the pastor and preacher in mind, such commentaries help to nuance the different meanings of the words used by the ancient writers. As the meaning of the individual words are being teased out, such commentaries help readers to remember the sense of the big picture. Without compromising on traditional viewpoints, this new commentary series supplies additional insights from the latest research and scholarship available. George H. Guthrie, Professor of Bible at Union University in Jackson Tennessee mentions three reasons for writing this commentary. The first is a personal one in which he studies Second Corinthians for his own ""growth, understanding, and edification."" In doing so, he invites readers to learn with him. True to his calling as a teacher, attempting to teach must be matched by learning. Attempting to nuance the knowledge must be matched by grappling with the text. Attempting to exegete well must be matched by personal work as well as wide scholarly references. The second reason is a conviction that the way to learn the text is continually, adopting a ""comma"" disposition instead of a ""full-stop."" The Bible is a living Word and that means the Bible had not only spoken to many in the past, it speaks to us in the present, and will also speak to others in the future. The past four decades had seen a flurry of research and scholarship on the second letter to the Corinthians. Despite the rich number of resources, it is believed that the Biblical text will never be fully exhausted. Our contexts change. Our interpretation paradigms change. Our cultural situations change. Even our understanding of various commentaries and works done can change. Third, Guthrie believes that 2 Corinthians is critical for the Church today because the issues discussed have so much relevance for the Church. Those of us concerned about Church ministry will benefit greatly through the study of 2 Corinthians. This commentary aids the process. The book is pastoral in nature, relevant to ministry, and deeply personal in our walk with God. With discouragement and sometimes despair dragging down workers in churches, this Pauline epistle has lots of encouragement and renders immense hope for all. Guthrie observes:""At times and places in the twenty-first century, we the church are wanderers, false teachers, faithful or faithless sufferers, fellow-workers with Paul, disillusioned ministers or congregations, opponents of the true gospel, polished and competitive and powerful public speakers, or powerless leaders who long for status and popularity and social significance like a dehydrated, dying person longs for water. Especially in the American church, we too easily drift into ruts of power, posturing, position, and presentation as the pragmatic backbone of ministerial effectiveness, and 2 Corinthians offers a sobering, loud, cautionary voice against such an approach to ministry.""I don't know about you, but that sure speaks of experience of working with people in any Church or Christian organizations. Broken people break one another, directly or indirectly. When we serve God, we do not do so from the position of personal preferences or discriminations. We serve from the premise of God's calling for us regardless of how people treat us.The All-Important Introduction chapter highlights many interesting points.- Need for a firm understanding of the historical setting- The person of Paul in the middle first Century AD- The unique position of Paul being a Roman citizen while at the same time thoroughly familiar with Greek and Jewish cultures- The city of Corinth as an important cosmopolitan center of commerce, politics, power, and culture- The unique problems facing the Corinthian church- Paul's relationship with the Corinthians- The reasons for the letterExegesis begins quickly in this book with the author using the nuances of the Greek language to argue that Paul is the single author of the whole letter. He even mapped out the number of occurrences of the Greek word (ἐγώ) and the verbal moods of the whole book to show that Paul writes from both personal as well as representing his ministry team. Guthrie hones in on the two primary dynamics of the letter: The context of travel and the content of the communications. In the former, Paul writes as a traveling evangelist trying his best to shepherd the flock, and at the same time share of his own spiritual struggles from where he was. In the latter, it pains him to see the heresies breaking up the church, and how certain quarters rejected him.The commentary is divided into four major segments:Opening and Prologue (1:1-1:11)Integrity of Paul's Ministry (1:12-7:16)Ministry of Giving (8:1-9:15)Confrontation of Malignant Ministries (10:1-13:13)Each passage begins with a summary in a grey box followed by an ""exegesis and exploration"" of the texts. Readers will be treated to a rich rendition of Greek and exegesis of the words crucial to understanding the message. Where possible, the Greek texts will be rearranged to showcase the literary structures (like chiastic) and the messages they contain. The alternate translations and nuances are particularly helpful. We appreciate a lot of the difficult choices Bible translators had to make when translating the originals into English. Guthrie does a lot of heavy lifting for us in expanding our understanding of the Greek language. Not only that, readers get a special treat when he compares and contrasts the different renditions by various English translations before putting forth his personal preferences. There is a gold mine of rich theology and content using the exegesis tool. At the end of each section, there is a brief reflection on what the passage, the exegesis, and the interpretations mean for us in our modern world. Although I would have preferred more applications and examples, I believe the intent of an exegetical commentary is not to put forth the applications for us item by item. It is by doing proper exegesis, we will be better equipped to interpret and to apply the passages to our modern era thought by thought.Students of Greek and exegesis will find this book a welcome resource. Pastors and teachers will benefit in terms of having a ready reference. Readers in general may even be enticed with a new found appreciation for the original Greek language.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Baker Academic and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"The author of the popular ""Emotionally Healthy Church"" has come up with another book on the same themes of healthy emotions that lead to healthy Christian lives. This time, instead of dealing with Church-related matters, he targets the leader's inner and outer lives. Scazzero is the founder of New Life Fellowship Church, based in Queens, New York. A popular speaker, he has influenced many with his ""Emotionally Healthy"" series of books. This book is no different. He begins with a personal retelling of his own journey to unhealthy leadership. Arranged in four dramatic conversions, he talks about how he first became a zealous Christian after being touched by God in his teens. He went for theological training and learned Spanish. He started his own Church called New Life Fellowship Church and was soon busy with the daily grind of Church work, developing leaders and planting churches. For all the external successes, he was ignoring his internal recesses of the heart. His second conversion is about his awareness of the need to address his emotional health more seriously. He wondered about the shape of things, whether it is ok for others to be cared for spiritually while his own spirituality was suffering. The crisis came to a hilt when his own wife, Geri quit the Church. Thankfully, he recovered only to be faced with a third conversion: ""From busy activity to Slowed-Down Spirituality."" Influenced by the teachings and writings of the Monastic movement, he began to work more with contemplative spirituality, to let God work him from the inside out. One significant result of that conversion was his publishing of the bestselling book, ""Emotionally Healthy Spirituality."" Learning about spirituality and teaching about it is one thing. Connecting them all with one's life is totally another. As a result, he skimmed through many essential duties instead of paying adequate attention to them. He needed a fourth conversion: ""From Skimming to Integrity in Leadership.""  This book is a result of this fourth conversion. The key motive in this book is to change the world with the gospel, not through the many activities and strategies to be employed, but with a transformation of the inner self. Something must happen first inside in order to be fruitful and faithful outside. The first part of the book deals with the Inner Life while Part Two deals with the Outer Life.Scazzero defines an unhealthy leader as follows:""The emotionally unhealthy leader is someone who operates in a continuous state of emotional and spiritual deficit, lacking emotional maturity and a 'being with God' sufficient to sustain their 'doing for God.'""In one word, this book is powerful. It opens up fresh understandings of our inner selves and the intricate connections to our personhood and our work as leaders. Sometimes, we may think that Scazzero is merely rehashing old teachings and archaic formulas of the bestselling Emotionally Healthy Church book. This book shows some familiarity but can also stand on its own for three reasons. The first reason is that it is targeted at leaders and leadership matters. Many of the questions, examples, and exercises are full of leadership scenarios, from boardrooms to staff relationships; hierarchies and church power structures. The title of the book would have given it away. This brings me to the second reason. Assuming that leadership is about the wise and humble execution of power, and that influence and giftings are legitimate faces of power, this book certainly would be beneficial reading not just for existing leaders but also for leaders to be. In other words, the book prepares readers to be leaders in their respective capacities. Leadership is not a title. It is about influencing others to adapt to change. Spiritual leadership is about facilitating change according to the discerning of God's Spirit at work. The third reason is about harnessing the power of emotions and to lead in such a way as to show others the meaning of servant leadership. For any church or Christian community to survive, new leaders must constantly be developed. If anyone is concerned about the church future, this book certainly ranks among the must reads.I am full of praise for this book and highly recommend it for general reading by laypeople and compulsory reading for all leaders now and the future. Past leaders can also benefit by sharing their stories and how the ideas in the book can be better put to practice.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Zondervan and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"We are all familiar with prayers and prayer requests. Church leaders often ask members what they can pray for. Members in various stations of need will share about their particular situations of how God can help them. As a Christian community, it is common to minister to one another regularly in care and in prayer for their particular needs in mind. We pray earnestly, faithfully, and in Jesus' Name. We pray and ask that God's will be done. What if we pray about something that is not specifically about what we or our loved ones want, but about ""anything"" that God wants? Scary isn't it? This is the key premise of this book, to learn to pray God's will be done above all of our needs. Putting it another way, we ask for God's will be done regardless of our specific needs. It is a holy surrender. This is the kind of prayer that the author seeks to teach.Jennie Allen is author, speaker, retreat leader, and an inspirational teacher passionate about sharing God with believers especially women. She is convinced that the way to freedom in God is total surrender. She holds a Masters in Biblical Studies from Dallas Theological Seminary and lives with her husband and four children in Texas.Readers who are not prepared to pray such a prayer will probably feel it's time to put down the book and read another one. Those who are not sure or are open about this are in for a treat as Jennie Allen shows us the standard three-phase way to change1) Recognizing that ""Everything"" can Hold Us Back2) Learning What It Means to Pray Everything3) Praying and Living AnythingThe first phase is significant as it is a commitment to abandon seven things. We need to abandon unbelief by casting out plastic gods. Abandon pretense by moving from doing the least good to the most good we are capable of doing. Abandon shame by letting God take charge of our missing buttons. Abandon our insatiable need for approval and recognition by knowing that God's approval and recognition is enough. Abandon the sense of entitlement which can easily enslaves us. Abandon fear by depending fully on God and not the fulfillment of personal scrapbooks accumulated over the years. Abandon our addiction to this world as we age and to long for for heaven.As we work on these suggested abandonments, slowly but surely, our hearts are tilled and the soil ready to pray everything and anything. We wake up to the reality of understanding God for who He is, not who we think He is. We see with new eyes on how prayer changes us. For without total surrender, our eyes remain shortsighted. We see God as much bigger than we think. We learn not to be suffocated by the thousand and one problems we face but to be lifted up to see from God's perspective. As the dominoes of doubt falls, we grow in faith and trust. We learn to say Yes to God more and more, and hear echoes of Yes from him.Finally, we are ready not just to pray anything but to live anything for Him. This is the power of surrender and complete dependence. Allen leads us through understanding our purpose on this earth. We learn about overcoming doubts. We realize profoundly that even when man thinks everything is out of control, God is sovereign and in control, regardless of whether we recognize it or not. Our faith grows in boldness. As we are liberated to be who we really are, we learn to see things differently as a life given completely over to God gets transformed. In the process, in some very strange way, we learn of how God turns everything over to us.""Anything"" is one of those books that tickles your curiosity, whets your literary appetite, and then after you have tasted it, you are hooked. It is a very beautiful way of expressing Jesus' call to discipleship. I think of Matthew 16:24 which says: ""Then Jesus said to his disciples, ""Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me.""There is some parallel in Jennie Allen's three phase approach to praying anything and everything. In the first phase, when we deny ourselves, we can use the seven abandonments to free ourselves from earthly entanglements, especially those that enslave us. In the second phase, as we take up our cross, we learn what it means to see from the perspective of the cross of Christ, that we must decrease while God must increase. We cannot remain at the earthly level of natural strength. We depend on God for heavenly hope and divine strength. Otherwise, we are easy targets for discouragement and depression. The third phase of truly liberated living for Christ comes when we follow after Jesus like a hound. As I think about it, there is a lot of sense in this form of prayer. Far too often we pray with our own ends in mind. What about praying with God's end, God's purpose, and God's will in mind? If we do not know how, start with Jennie Allen's book.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Thomas-Nelson under their BookLook Bloggers Program in exchange for an honest review.

"What is most remarkable about this book is that it highlights the altruism of Guinness without being preachy about it. The way the decisions are made also reveal the importance of the foundation of religious faith. It is this faith that enables the Guinnesses to look beyond simply meeting the needs of their family or their Protestant faith. Even non-family, their employees and their dependents benefit from the generosity of the Guinness. With foresight, the Guinnesses have passed down the family business for more than four generations. With faith, they have maintained the business with a firm faith in God, supported the clergy financially, invested in the Irish society at large through employment, welfare, and many other causes. I gain seven things from this book.First, generosity begets generosity. It is wonderful to see that the founder was himself a recipient of a charitable amount of 100 pounds by Dr Price. From the benevolence of Dr Price, the Guinness family becomes a benefactor for many others.Secondly, quality and excellence are witnessing devices. Note how the Guinness family continue to improvise, and innovate in their business methods, production technology, and marketing brilliance. Whatever we do, do it well, and the good work by themselves will bring honour and glory to God.Thirdly, the Guinness demonstrates an astounding welfare literally unheard of in our times of cost cutting and frugal employee benefits. By giving, the Guinness company has created immense goodwill and loyalty from Irish society. It reminds me of the bountiful grace that we have received from God. Perhaps, the more we realize how much grace we do not deserve to give, the more we are able to give freely, fully, and generously.Fourthly, improvement is a way of discipleship. Maintenance is never good stewardship. Every generation needs to take the business or any venture to the next level. Whatever the quantum or quality of change, each generation is expected to do their best for their generation.Fifthly, I will look at the Guinness beer with new eyes of faith. Each time I see the label, or drink a pint, I will think back on the faith of Arthur Guinness, the benefits and altruism showered on Irish society, and the indelible story of grace and generosity that is not only worth telling and retelling, it is worth learning and applying it in our own worlds of influence.Sixthly, one needs to be wise to learn to say no when necessary. Note how second Arthur refuses to indulge in the waywardness of his brother, Edward. In response to requests for money, second Arthur uses not from company funds, but often from his own pocket. Mismanagement of money among family members is a common occurrence. Most importantly, one learns to say no on the basis of their faith. Second Arthur lives out his dependence on God as follows, ""Fortunately, Arthur was a self-examining evangelical and did not allow offenses to take root in his heart. Instead, he sought to offer all of his pursuits to God."" (90)Finally, there is a real tension between serving God in everything, and serving God in a traditional full-time capacity. This tension is best resolved through a sense of personal call. The Guinness family is known for three professional lines, namely, the Brewing line, the Banking line, and the Clergy line. In all of these, faith is a foundation.This book is highly recommended. If you are a business leader or owner of companies seeking to serve God through your work. buy this book and share it with your colleagues. If you are a professor, pastor, or teacher, read this book and share it with your congregation and communities you are in. If you are someone looking to make a difference in life, this book will not disappoint you.""You cannot make money from people unless you are willing for people to make money from you.""

"Emotions play a huge role in our daily lives. While feelings are natural part of being human, how much should we allow them to affect us? Is it wrong to let our feelings determine what we do? Should we feel guilty about having such emotions in the first place? Are emotions something to be suppressed like a liability or to be received as a gift? The reality is, our culture tends to give greater weight to objective thinking instead of subjective feelings. More importantly, the Bible asserts the importance of both head and heart. Gerald Peterman, Professor of New Testament studies at Moody Bible Institute is a self-confessed recovering stoic, who grew up thinking that the intellect is more important than the emotion. Such an attitude led to suspicions of emotions. This book journeys his shift toward a more balanced and affirmative use of both mental and emotional faculties.Peterman points out some of the way our culture had downplayed the role of emotions. In matters of faith, it is generally accepted that faith is more about thinking and thoughts. In the hymns we sing, there seems to be a general tendency toward escapism such as Joseph Scriven's ""What a Friend We Have In Jesus"" where weak emotions are to be rejected. The words ""we should never be discouraged"" seem to put discouragement as a bad emotion to be avoided. Likewise, Horatio Spafford's ""It is Well With My Soul"" tries to numb emotions like ""whatever my lot"" to force a wellness in the heart. In our thinking about love, we tend to see love more in terms of what we do rather than what we feel. This goes against the teaching of Scripture that does not deny emotions but embrace them. Just check out the Psalms.He then discusses how emotions work, what it is, and why they matter. He gives various steps toward a healthy emotional life. Interestingly, he even gives a cognitive theory of emotions as some food for thought. The rest of the book talks about joy as the fruit of the Spirit; the predicament of feeling shame and guilt in spite of being forgiven; the problem with anger; love; fear; contentment; holy longing; and sadness, among others. Joy is in spite of circumstances but the reality of the human self is that circumstances do affect. How then do we deal with that? Peterman brings in the idea of maturity that does not deny the existence of negative emotions but embrace them in the light of the Spirit's gift of joy. Peterman makes a distinction between guilt and shame, where the former is about a belief of having done something wrong while the latter is more about embarrassment. In Scripture, forgiven means learning to deal with both guilt and shame objectively in the love of Christ. I appreciate Peterman for taking the time and space to deal with these emotions empathetically instead of simply sweeping them under the carpet of Christian talk. It is only when we experience the gravity of guilt and the sensitivities of shame where we realize the significance of being forgiven. Anger is also an emotion that troubles many people, including believers. One reason why anger is such a difficult emotion to deal with is because people seldom talk about it. As a result, they are unable to express it, or when it comes out, it comes out in a manner that hurts. Anger can also be directed at God. Like the way he handles guilt and shame, he points out that there is a difference between anger with God and anger about God. The latter is more cerebral while the former takes it deep and personal. Through lament, we can express anger in a way that does not sin against God. We learn to complain like Job and Jeremiah; temper our anger with Scripture; and to seek appropriate help. The topic of love covers both action and emotion. In action, love is about an intentional activity or a disposition to want to love people. In emotion, we can learn of the love of Christ through prayer and spiritual formation, to love people in the way that pleases God. This is contrasted with fear in which Peterman dishes out both good and bad aspects: Good in the sense that it prevents us from harming ourselves carelessly; Bad in the sense that it inhibits ourselves from taking appropriate risks. After dealing with the basic emotions, Peterman presses onward with contentment in earthly living and holy longing for heaven. Sadness is also a natural emotion that usually comes in times of loss. It is ok to be sad as long as we are not sucked into a spiral of depression. The last chapter deals with spiritual and emotional transformation that can only be possible with God.This book is a literary journey of emotional ups and downs from a spiritual perspective. Packed with experience and empathy, Peterman engages emotions with both intellect and affection without losing sight of the biblical perspectives. He explains each emotions by both definitions and contrasts. Sometimes, emotional words can be used vaguely that people are unsure what they actually mean. Every chapter, regardless of positive or negative emotions, have a section on how to cultivate a healthy emotional life. This is based on the conviction that as redeemed people in Christ, we have been empowered to be overcomers in Christ. The questions for discussion form a useful platform for small group discussions and Bible studies. I sense there is a certain order with regard to the way Peterman arranges the discussion of each emotion. The first two chapters are more technical in nature, with a cognitive overview of how emotions work. Tackling the human emotions first, he leaps off toward the ups of joy and float along the downs of sadness, guilt, and shame. He engages the discussion of anger from both a human and spiritual perspective. He addresses the place of fear from both angles before dealing with human longings for things beyond. If the first part of the book is about temporal living, the second part of the book tends to be more about the things regarding eternity. In all of these, we are to be transformed and renewed in mind. This book is Peterman's attempt to help us renew our minds and our hearts transformed, with God's Word guiding us.There are already very few book on emotions. There are even fewer that talks about emotions from a Christian perspective. Thankfully, this book is able to address this need.Rating: 4.25 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Moody Publishers in exchange for an honest review.

"There is always a special need for commentaries that laypersons, especially teachers of Bible classes need. Not many people have the time and money to go through intense seminary education or Bible training. Without a proper guide, it is easy to let subjective opinions on Bible passages lead the way. This is not good for students. It is also not good for the Church. Without oversimplifying things, Churches still need Bible resources that are easy to refer to but also dependable and faithful to the biblical contexts. Using the New Revised Standard Version Bible, the two letters written by Paul to the Corinthian Church are examined in this book and presented to the public for easy reference and reading. The usual stuff is there. There is the overall map of the region the Apostle Paul writes to. There is the introductory material to give readers a short description of the contexts, the theological themes, the major issues of the day, the authorship and audience, and the unique place of Corinth. This is followed by a map to outline how the letter develops.A) Overall SummaryThe two letters of Paul are not only described in themselves, they are also contrasted with each other to highlight the same author but different emotional conditions. While the former is one of firmness, the latter reflects a brokenness. This can be seen as a metaphor for Christian ministry. There are ups and downs, good times and bad, pleasant moments and unpleasant circumstances. It is all part and parcel of the work. In expressing these in letter format, we learn about how human Paul is and how much the gospel plays in his own life and teaching. In it, he is not only a theologian and a pastor, but also a pilgrim and friend.Calling it one of the easiest of Paul's letters to outline, First Corinthians is mapped according to three major ""People"" sections. They are:One Corinthians 1-4 (People of the Cross: Challenge)One Corinthians 5-14 (People of Corinth: Guidance)One Corinthians 15-16 (People of the Resurrection: Hope)Some of the major issues include the arguments surrounding the status of Jews and Gentiles; the controversies over Gnostic beliefs that divide bodies and souls; gender controversies; infighting and politicking; and others.In contrast to Paul's confident and bold teachings in First Corinthians, Second Corinthians presents a very personal and vulnerable side. Five key issues dominate the letter.Paul's difficulty with the leadership in the ChurchMonetary gifts for ministryTithes and TeamworkHeresyPaul's ReturnSecond Corinthians is mapped accordingly:Second Corinthians 1-7 (Call to Trust Relationship)Second Corinthians 8-9 (Collection for the Saints)Second Corinthians 10-13 (Challenge to the Corinthian Church)B) Structure and StyleEach passage are first printed out in full, usually bold, before Proctor offers his interpretation and comments on it. With clear title headings, bold prints and clear references, readers can use the volume as a convenient resource to zoom into any passages or texts when needed. Sometimes, the commentary reads like a sermon in which the author attempts to strike a mental conversation with the reader. The descriptions are relatively brief and to the point, without theological jargon or much Greek grammatical references. With a systematic point by point structure, it is very easy to follow Proctor's arguments.Structure wise, this book follows the passage by passage format instead of the conventional verse by verse manner. This not only saves space but allows the author to summarize the whole passage in his own way. This frees him from being stuck at a verse by verse method that can sometimes appear disjointed. That said, the chosen pericope can be a limitation itself, so readers will benefit if they read the actual Biblical texts prior to referring to this commentary.The copy I had has a distinct lack of cross references to other scholarship material and theological resources for further research. Perhaps, these will be included in the final version but readers will need to find out for themselves. Proctor does a good job in training readers how to stay with the text and not be too quick to walk away from it. He reminds readers to see from two angles. The first angle is how the Corinthians would read the letter and the second is what it means for us in our modern era. Believing the Bible speaks to us today, Proctor provides challenges to both our vertical relationships to God as well as our horizontal relationships to one another. He brings in references to historical creeds. He uses imagery brilliantly when he talks about leadership matters in the Church, that leadership is like being farmers and gardeners who take care of the land and garden without lording over them. It requires the virtues of patience, perseverance, and passion. Paul's openness is made bare often and this commentary pays special attention to Paul not only as a theologian but more so as a pastor.All in all, this is a passable commentary and should appeal to Bible study leaders and Sunday school teachers. For preachers, I would recommend other supplementary material especially those that do more exegesis.Rating: 4 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Westminster John Knox Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Riding on the popularity of the first edition, this missions primer is a must have for anyone desiring to plunge into the other volumes 2-8. Readers may be wondering why a second edition needs to be published after only ten years. That is because there has been a dramatic rise in ""ideas, practices, challenges, and opportunities in mission,"" with several ""insider movements"" to be shared. This is supplemented by four additional sets of materials: 1) case study; 2) numerous sidebars; 3) Academic resources for professors and students; 4) Visual resources.There are tonnes of resources in this book. The key terms help explain and define common terms to guide newbies into the world of missions. Words like ""10/40 window,"" ""diaspora,"" ""contextualization,"" ""ecumenical movement,"" ""All Nations,"" and so on are explained with clarity. Quips are included to give the readers a sense of how missions are being integrated into the mission of the Church. Theology is extensively dealt with from a biblical perspective from both the Old and the New Testament. The word mission is not simply limited to cross-cultural ventures into foreign lands. It includes both local and foreign, inside and outside the Church, both business as well as non-profits, and many more. For the words ""All nations"" are very inclusive. Many of the sidebars can be used as a discussion starter, even a whole study in itself! I appreciate the one on ""Meditating on Discipleship Failure"" which is a blunt look at how Jesus' disciples had failed consistently during Jesus' time, and how we can avoid falling into the same potholes. Theology and mission are tightly intertwined and not to be treated as some kind of a specialized option. The mission of the Church and world missions are integral parts of the Missio Dei (All that God does to build the kingdom).Historically, the authors assert that missions have not ended with the end of the biblical times. Instead, it has grown and expanded. The history of the Church is directly related to the history of missions. In the Premodern Era (AD 30-1500), believers often risk their lives to spread the gospel to faraway lands. From the Pentecost moment, believers were scattered from Jerusalem throughout Rome, toward North Africa, Asia Minor, and other lands. John Mark Terry and J.D. Payne give seven factors that spurred the growth of the church, but also persecution. After the Pax Romana, the decree to make Christianity the official religion in AD 313, the status of Christianity became enshrined in the Roman Empire. We learn about the Era of Discovery and Colonialism (AD 1500-1900) which bring out both the best and worst of doing missions. As the good news gets preached to many lands, missionaries often had a tough time, many being killed for their efforts. There is the rise of mission societies and organizations to address the lack of urgency among mainline churches. The authors include the era 1900-2000 to discuss the 1910 Edinburgh mission conference, rise of Protestant missions and their evangelical counterparts, Pentecostalism, and Vatican II initiatives.For missionary candidates or those seriously considering mission work, there are three chapters that speak to that need. It provides helpful guidelines on discerning the call. Here, the authors share their testimonies about their own experiences. Another helpful aspect is to look at the misunderstandings of what the missionary call means. What is important is that we are all called to missions, but it is the specific overseas cross-cultural missions that will require a specific discernment to the call. Assuming the candidates are called, the chapter on ""Missionary Preparation"" covers training, character traits required, spiritual disciplines, ministry skills, pastoral care, professional expertise, and learning to anticipate and adjust to changing circumstances. Another chapter covers the other aspects like choosing a missions agency, short-term mission trips, tent-making, and many more.With regards to the actual missions, ample space is allocated for both the sent as well as the sender. This is important as mission involves both. The missionary is responsible to serve out there in the field while the sending agency or the Church is responsible to maintain a line of support. The chapter on personal preparation is one of the most important to prepare missionaries for person and family issues. This also includes language learning, teamwork, singleness, and dealing with loneliness. Strategic and ministry issues like understanding what church and mission is, how to channel limited resources to the areas of calling, and money matters. There are instructions on building relationships with target groups and to maintain connections with the sending church or agency.On the contemporary world missions, we see a lot more new material with regards to constant engagement with pluralistic worldviews, different kinds of communications, relational skills, conflict management, missions trends and paradigm shifts. There is a lot more wisdom with regards to short-term missions and how to ensure that mission teams do not become a burden to the locals or missionaries. More churches are doing their own missionary sending instead of relying on traditional mission agencies. Partnerships are more common. The part on technology is unfortunately too brief. I would have hoped for more in this Google generation.I am quite pleased about this book. Just combing through the chapters has highlighted to huge amount of work and considerations that needed to be done. Missions is not simply sending a person out. It needs preparation, training, knowledge, experience, and teamwork. Anyone who wants to be a good disciple must encounter and be involved in missions in one way or another. Unconvinced? Try reading this book, and then tell me again.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Baker Academic and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"The author of ""I Am a Church Member"" has done it again. In that book, he talks about six implications of what it means to be a Church member. In this latest book, he has decided to move from inside the Church to what a Christian can (or will) do outside the Church. It contains what the author calls ""nine traits of outwardly focused Christian."" Thom Rainer then sets the tone early in the book to encourage readers to move from a ""I Want"" Church member to a ""I Will"" disciple. Beginning with a list of ""Top Nine Ways Churches Drive Away First-Time Guests,"" he helps readers to see that a ""I Want"" mentality represents an inward focused Christian while a ""I Will"" means an outwardly focused Christian. It is also an opportunity for Rainer to move from the previous focus on attitude in membership matters to a new purpose in right actions.The first trait is a ""I Will Move"" which represents a resolve that right actions must follow from right attitudes. Right attitude means unifying, sacrificial serving, praying, and rejoicing Church member. Right actions mean putting all of these into tangible deeds.The second trait is ""I Will Worship with Others"" which puts the community before self when going to Church. Using the Early Church in Acts as an example, he encourages readers to move from ""begrudging participation"" to ""joyous commitment."" Worship is not about personal preferences. It is about going beyond personal choices of the small little details of a worship service and embrace the big picture of what it takes for a whole community to worship God together.The third trait is about ""I will grow together with others"" which is a call to move away from Lone-Ranger Christianity to a community oriented person. When Church members do ministry and mission work together, they grow closer together. There is a link between healthy communities within the Church and the overall health of the Church. It also helps the Church to reach out to those who are shy and less prominent. Rainer includes some tips about encouraging small group developments.The fourth trait is about service in ""I Will Serve."" Healthy churches have a broad base of serving members. Using Jesus' example as one who serves, he highlights one example of how churches can challenge members to refrain from complaining or asking anything from the church and to focus on participating and serving in any possible way. The time has come for churches to encourage more members to say ""I will serve.""The fifth trait is outreach in ""I Will Go."" Beginning with a story of a declining Church, Rainer points out that the reason is how a Church becomes a country club instead of a mission center. Such churches have forgotten that they are to live out Acts 1:8. He even deals with some common objections like not having the gift of evangelism; the job is the pastors; or one being an introvert etc. Outreach can be as simple as prayer and inviting friends to as exciting as going to a far away land as ambassadors of Christ.The sixth trait is not just about giving but giving generously. The heart of spirituality is not collecting but giving, just like Jesus who gave of himself. For where our treasure is, there our actions will be also. The Church must teach about money and cheerful giving.Trait seven is a resolve not to be a Church dropout. Having come across so many people who had dropped out of Church due to burnout. Rainer maintains that it is not unavoidable. Serving in Church needs to be done out of an overflow of love for God and for the people. Once it becomes a set of do's and don'ts, it is the beginning of a season of burnout. He makes the following claim: ""An inactive church member is an oxymoron. A church dropout is a disobedient Christian."" Wow.The eighth trait is a warning not to let human standards take over biblical guidelines. Calling it a ""I Will Avoid the Traps of Churchianity,"" Rainer shares five major symptoms of Churchianity:  Church being a spectator sport  Church being more about me  Church being about dwelling in its flaws  Church having low expectations  Church being cliquishFinally, the ninth trait is about ""I Will Make a Difference,"" a rallying cry for churches to be convicted that the Church can make a difference inside as well as outside. It can be a contagious movement. It starts with prayer. It results in a movement where more and more people will say ""I Will"" rather than I Won't. Change begins with us individually.This book is dynamite when it comes to exploding myths and apathetic behaviour. Which church does not have problems? If a person leaves Church A because of some problem, the same person will find that Church B too will have her own unique set of problems. Perhaps, the key is not about pin-pointing problems but seeing ourselves as part of the solution. This book mentions nine ways to do just that. For any church that are looking to do something different, encourage more membership service, and having a more vibrant Church, putting at least one of the ideas in the book will plant the seed of positive change. As time goes on, with joy, many of the traits will naturally flow. When it happens, it is the Holy Spirit touching the hearts of people and the people responding in obedience to the prompting of God.  Great book to give to your leadership, deacons' board, Church board, board of directors, or to your elders.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of B and H Publishing and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"How much do we love the Church? Do we spend more time criticizing the things she does? Have we constructively built up the Church over the years? Do we really believe in the Church that we are prepared to adapt our ways according to changing times? In this book, after a conversation with United Methodist Church ministers, Adam Hamilton and Mike Slaughter, Jacob Armstrong have come up with a model called ""The New Adapters"" model to bridge and help old established ideas with adapting to new reality in changing times. His vision of such new adaptation comprises eight broad proposals. Firstly, the vision must fit the mission field. This means that we cannot allow our own preconceptions to determine the ministry we want to be in. Rather, we need to know the community first through ""learning, knowing, and loving the community"" that we are in. This calls for an attitude of ""Praying and Listening"" so as to bridge our past ""megaphone model"" with the current ""direct marketing"" model to our community. Armstrong provides six questions to help do the listening. Secondly, the mission of the Church must include ministry to the poor. We must resist the temptation to stick to the wealthy, the influential, and the powerful. For such efforts tend to make us rely less on the providence of God. Preaching good news to the poor was Jesus' announcement prior to his ministry. Such ""focus on the poor"" can help bring any inward focus toward outreach. Churches that ignore the poor do so at their own peril. Thirdly, create new spaces for new people. Let these new spaces bring people from buildings to programs. Spaces are not just physical places but opportunities for people to work and live together.  This means not making visitors and strangers fit into our mold but to allow compassion and love to adjust according to the needs of these visitors and new people.Fourth, the Church exists to worship God. Whatever programs or mission of the Church, there is no discounting the importance of worship. Here, Armstrong has a dual pronged approach. Not only must the worship be adapted to the new people, it has to be sensitive to the old. Armstrong comments:  ""Many churches have what I call a closed loop. We have a way of doing things, a way of talking, and a way of worshipping that doesn’t allow for new people to connect. Without even knowing it, we exclude those we truly want to reach.""I agree. Sometimes, churches are so comfortable meeting existing needs that they fail to look at the needs of the unreached. The key word is intentionality about how the worship service is planned, how it is delivered, how it is conducted, and how it is been contextualized so that both the existing and the new people can participate well in it. One tool is the ""twenty-first-century-lectionary"" that follows the important days of the Christian calendar, and to preach not only the Word, but in a manner than ministers to people in need. Fifth, conflicts and criticisms will eventually come, no matter what ministry one is in. People may cast doubts or vigorously object the the new directions taken. New adapters will need to stand with courage between cynicism and cowardice, so that their ventures are done in faith. Six, no ministry can survive on one key leader alone. There needs to be continuity. Even Moses had to give up his leadership to a younger Joshua. Using teams, one can enable the ministry to flourish without being overdependent on any one individual. Seven, when it comes to ministry in the Church, there is no turfs to defend. New adapters cannot be stuck in protecting territorial rights to any ministry, but be able to collaborate in a way as to break new ground for every ministry. Collaboration is not only limited to missions or starting new churches, it also means inner transformation. Finally, Armstrong advocates the need to focus on raising up new and younger leaders. This is essentially investing for the future of the church. This calls for empowerment by the older members to encourage and build up the younger members. New leaders need not be young. Old leaders need not be excluded. What is needed is a united cooperation for the future of the Church.This book offers a new hope and excitement as far as preparing the Church for a new generation is concerned. Existing congregations will eventually die out. The gospel will not. In fact, the Church too will continue to grow in various places. This does not mean maintaining physical structures or spaces. It means a new sense of belonging to the old old story of the gospel. It means learning to adapt without compromising on our faith. It means learning to cultivate the inner selves without being constricted by external trappings. Church structures and styles are never cast in concrete. They need to adapt. The gospel remains the same but people will have different needs from generation to generation. In reading this book, established members of churches may see change as a threat to their status quo. This is inevitable which is why new adapters need to be sensitive to these groups by regularly communicating and getting them to buy in. At the same time, while change is necessary, one needs to discern what areas can or cannot be changed at any point of time. While on the one hand, everything can be adapted, not everything must be adapted according to our own personal preferences. Whatever changes have to be consulted with the team, with the congregation, with the Holy Spirit in prayer and listening.I find this book very promising in that it is yet another attempt to persuade old minds toward new ways. It has to be done carefully with respect and honour to the past. Yet, there is a need to exercise faith so that the ministry will fit the vision. This book is not only a good read but a powerful challenge for the rigid, the comfortable, and the change resistance to take a step back and be open to adaptation. Remember, adapting does not mean compromising. It simply means listening and responding to the soft promptings of God through the Holy Spirit. Shaping ideas does not mean conformity. It means learning to relate in love.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Abingdon Press and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"How many of us actually know who our neighbors are? It is well known that Jesus commanded his disciples to love our neighbors as ourselves. Yet, it remains one of the most challenging aspects of modern Christian living. Sometimes, we try to rationalize away that our neighbors are mainly in our workplaces or social areas, and minimize the literal physical neighborhoods. That was something dealt with by Jay Pathak and Dave Runyon in their book, ""The Art of Neighboring"" which is about building genuine relationships with our physical neighbors. They identify fear as one of the key barriers to actually loving our neighbors. For how can anyone love their neighbor without first loving them? Some don't know how while others simply feel weird about it all. For these struggles, many people simply give other excuses for not even trying to know their neighbors. In the same vein, Amy Lively reinforces this need to reach out to our neighbors with a whole book dedicated to three key aspects, or should I say, gives me three compelling thoughts.First, it is about overcoming one's fears of reaching our neighbors. Having personally experienced the weirdness of just trying to reach out, she shares about her earlier years learning from some Christian neighbors who were not intrusive but were still very influential in their welcome and care. Often we get trapped by fears of negative reactions by people who prefer us to mind our own business. Yet, what if our very neighbors are in some crisis or trouble that we will never know until we ask? What if under the external facade of wealth and well-being is a soul struggling with loneliness and discouragement? What if we have unconsciously judged our neighbors by their covers? One way to overcome fear is to let curiosity leads the way. Notice what they have been doing through the day. Smile at them. Pray for them. Be aware of their presence. They are social people, not some puzzle for us to solve. Lively also shows us that it is easier to invite our neighbors to our homes rather than our churches. Who knows. It could very well bring them a step closer to the faith. Another way to overcome fear is to recognize how diverse our communities are. Weirdness comes about often because we are different. Once we recognize that differences are common aspects of a diverse community, we can learn to live with differences and acceptance. More importantly, the battle is often within ourselves, not outside. For we can have our heads full of ideas, only to be stopped by a heart full of resistance.Second, the focus is not conversion but conversational moments. It is about making friends. One reason why Christians fail to make good neighborly connections is their self-imposed pressure to convert people. That is not necessary for conversion is God's responsibility. Ours is conversational moments. We do the greeting. We make friends. We strike up ordinary conversations about life. We begin with natural relationships. Let God lead the rest. Do kind deeds and be a good neighbor. We may not be eloquent with words but we can certainly show kindness in ways we are able to. We can pray. Lively puts it bluntly:""The two most important things you can do to make your neighborhood safer are to get to know your neighbors' name and to get out of your houses."" (117)Indeed, if we do not even get out of our own houses, how are we to even know our neighbors, and our neighbors to know us? In an increasingly online and virtual society, it is tempting to stay indoors so much that we forget about the outdoors. Even our most obnoxious neighbor, God still loves him or her. If those of us who spend countless of hours working or serving in Churches can broaden our perspectives to see the world as our parish, why not our neighborhoods? The spiritual gifts that we have, surely they are not limited only to church stuff? How people respond is not our responsibility. How we respond to God's calling for us to love our neighbors is ours.Third, stepping out is a step of faith. For we speak and reach out not on our own strengths but God's. We can become like walking Marthas constantly busy with our own work that we forget that we are not living in the desert with nobody. We forget that we live in neighborhoods with people that Jesus loves. We forget that ours are not the only messy houses around. Many others have their own mess too. It is a risk that can be rewarding. Even though the results are often unpredictable, the risk is worth is simply because Jesus thinks it is worth it. After all, He died for us.So What?========Amy Lively gives us a book of ideas and encouragement to overcome our fears and to step into our neighborhood with courage. There are many ideas but most of it all is a call for us to simply set down our fears, settle down our anxieties with prayer, step out in faith, and serve our neighbors in whatever appropriate manner. For all we know, a bit of kindness can unleash open hearts and minds not only to keep our neighborhoods safe but also fun to be in. ""How to Love Your Neighbor"" may not be a book written by a bestseller or poise to bring in millions of dollars in royalty payments. It is written with a desire for believers to make a difference in their neighborhoods by simply getting to know them, to recognize their presence, and to love them as best as possible.  Above all, it can put to rest those uneasy butterflies in our stomachs, those weird thoughts that are crippling our outreach, and those fears that often defeat us before we even open our house doors.Frankly, overcoming our fears is already a major step forward in learning to love our neighbors. Many of us simply do not know our neighbors. Some may not even know their names even after so many years. That can change. Fears can provide us unlimited excuses, but only love can motivate us to open our doors of our timid minds, to step out in faith with a willing heart, and reach out in love to needy souls. If we can get to know one neighbor, just one, it would have been a soul that has been touched by God's love. Read this book and be encouraged to step forth in faith! Confucius once said, ""The journey of a thousand miles begin with a single step."" I say, the journey of loving a thousand neighbors begins with a simple greeting of a neighbor we meet.Rating: 4.25 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Bethany House Publishers and Graf-Martin Communications in exchange for an honest review.

"Dads are usually the busy guy. Expected to work hard and support the family, they are also expected to be the spiritual head of the household. One of the key spiritual disciplines is to read the Bible regularly. There is no substitute for regular reading. What if this regular reading can be supplemented by 260 daily devotions, 7 articles to help build up the children, and a easy reference for dealing with questions kids often ask? This is what this devotional Bible is aimed at. The main text of this Bible is of course, the Bible, more specifically the New International Version (2011). This devotional version was first published in 1997 after a chance encounter the author had with the publisher. Tasked to write devotional notes to accompany various selected portions of the Bible, Robert Wolgemuth, a well-connected name in publishing circles took six whole months to write out the accompanying material. Eighteen years later, Zondervan has released a second edition updated not only with the latest NIV edition but also a new foreword by Kirk Cameron.The devotions are scattered all over the Bible, each with a Bible passage for the day followed by a verse for the day. Due to the nature of devotions, there will greater freedom of thought and application, and that invariably means the devotions may not necessarily exegete the passages as accurately as a Bible scholar. At the bottom of each devotional, there is a link to the next devotional reading, anticipating readers' needs. Unfortunately, some may think the devotionals distract the reader from actually reading the Bible itself. I think such anxiety is unnecessary. Once the devotionals are read, it will not be referred back as often. In comparison, the Bible texts are more likely to be read, re-read, and re-read, for a long time to come. Devotions in the book are temporary. The Word of God is forever. The devotional themes include:- Relationships like brotherhood, communications, and family- Behavioural traits like patience, giving, and diligence- Family activities like Church going, Christmas activities,- Decision making for young kids, teenagers, and young adults- and many more.I appreciate the section called ""The Bible for Dads"" which provides a short summary of every book of the Old and New Testament. The ""Questions Kids Ask"" section also anticipates common questions and provides a clear answer. The ""Fruit of the Spirit"" topical index brings together the important themes with appropriate biblical references.Sometimes, I feel like it may be better to have the devotionals all in one section rather than to scatter them throughout. This would prevent flipping the pages back and forth to go from one devotional to another. In this way, readers can focus on devotional reading when they want to do devotional reading, and Bible reading when they want to read the Bible texts. An alternative method for this is to use an ordinary Bible with a devotional book side by side. That is not the intent of the publisher of this Bible which is to let the devotional supplement the Bible passages. Perhaps, this is a matter of personal preference. Thus, this devotional Bible format may work for some but not others.One critique I have for this Bible is the color of the font. I would prefer the texts to be a black rather than brown, for black would have provided a better contrast for the eye.Father's Day may have been over, but it is still not too late to get a devotional Bible. While theme-based bibles may not exactly reflect the real intent of the Bible itself, from the perspective of a Bible literacy promotion standpoint, anything that encourages one to read the Bible a little more regularly will tilt my recommendation to YES. Another positive feature in this Bible is the actual title. In the family home,anyone finding the Bible anywhere in the house, the kitchen table, the living room, the study, the bedroom, or in any other room, would straightaway know: ""Hey, this is dad's Bible!""Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of BookLookBloggers program in exchange for an honest review.

"Conflict is inevitable. Sooner or later, even the most cordial of relationships will encounter rough patches. The fact is that conflicts in themselves are not necessarily bad, especially when we can learn to respond constructively when they occur. In Dr Linda Mintle's words, it is simply summarized in four words: ""We Need to Talk,"" which is exactly the title and the central theme of the book. Called a ""relationship doctor,"" Mintle is a popular speaker, a licensed marriage counselor and family therapist, and also chair of the Division of Behavioral Health at the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Liberty University in Lynchburg, VA. She deals with the topic of conflict sensitively but with firmness. Her three basic assumptions are:1) Conflicts are part and parcel of any close relationships;2) Under the right conditions, conflicts can help grow relationships;3) In unhappy relationships, conflicts can escalate and one needs to learn how to deal with them.Conflicts always involve a power struggle and the key is to manage power imbalances as best as possible to balance between emotional needs, personal integrity, people's well-being, and the stress of life. In order to resolve any conflict, trust must be cultivated. Keeping secrets, being unreliable, history of betrayal, are all examples of how trust can be eroded. In order to build trust, show grace with providing second chances on the one hand and to draw boundaries on the other. Learn of Jesus' humility. Cherish differences without having to pander to every wish and fancy. Beware of the four horsemen of the relationship apocalypse: 1) Criticism; 2) Defensiveness; 3) Contempt; 4) Stonewalling. Anticipate a clash of styles and to learn strategies on how to deal with each. Be realistic with what is solvable and what is not. Like a family, one can disagree but still remember that we are all family. Families must learn to fight fair and to deal justly. There are also gender differences to be aware of. Distinguish the needs behind the desire for sex. One popular belief is that men and women have opposite views of sex and affection. Men puts sex before affection while women sees otherwise. Rather than focusing on these two, Mintle suggests both genders find ways to get validation and love in order to meet both of these needs. Mintle also gives 20 guidelines with regards to social media usage and sex.Conflict styles also vary. Mintle pays special attention to difficult people that provokes high conflict levels. ""High conflict"" personalities tend to be too emotional about issues and often see things in black and white. Due to their rigid mental styles, they can become manipulative when they do not get things their way. They tend to yell and lose their tempers. They need help in controlling their anger and enabling lots of forgiveness. Use the serenity prayer as a guide.With lots of practical tips, this book essentially helps us to clear the decks without dismissing the most difficult players. We learn to recognize the different kinds of styles and the various approaches to deal with conflicts. Sometimes it is good to minimize conflicts. Other times, it is best to deal with the situation at hand. With a positive outlook, confidence and humility need to be used simultaneously. The chapter on ""Dealing with Difficult People"" alone is worth the price of the book. Mintle has given us a powerful resource on how to live together with well-being of all in mind. Perhaps, for those of us who want to do something about everyday conflicts but don't know how, we need to pick up this book, learn from it, and to be equipped on how best to calm down and to promote a constructive dialogue.

"The word ""community"" has been thrown around quite a lot by many institutions, social help groups, corporate environments, as well as non-profits throughout the world. While trumpeting the merits of working together, the fact is that as people rush from place to place, and to work from dawn to dusk, tempers can easily flare when things do not meet our expectations. From rude behaviours in the workplace to aggressive drivers at the highways, all it often take is an unexpected event that can easily lit our fuses. For those with short fuses, the result is a terrible emotional outburst that can do a lot of damage. There are road rages and boardroom battles. There are even angry exchanges on social media that if picked up by the mainstream media, turn a petty dispute into an all-out war of words. This is what makes this book an extremely practical one. It is the author's contention that just by giving up our right to be angry is a significant change that can enable us to live better. On the area of ""righteous anger,"" Hansen maintains that it is not supported in Scripture. He writes: ""We humans are experts at casting ourselves as victims and rewriting narratives that put us in the center of injustices. (More on this in a bit.) And we can repaint our anger or hatred of someone—say, anyone who threatens us—into a righteous-looking work of art."" On and on, Hansen advocates peaceful speech, gracious behavior, and a sustained emphasis on self-control, self-restraint, and self-denial. Using examples and teachings from peace rights activists like Dr Martin Luther King Jr, theologians like CS Lewis and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, pastors like Tim Keller, and popular writers like Philip Yancey and Henri Nouwen, Hansen makes his case that there is really nothing for one to lose but everything to gain as far as not being easily offended is concerned.He deals with the important subject of injustice, while affirming the fact of injustices happening, he advocates that the way ahead is to let our actions be motivated by love. Whether it is tough love or otherwise, it is critical not to let anger have its way, or to let our human emotions take control. Rather, it is to let God work through us by stepping out of inner anger toward fighting injustice not with fighting, but with firm loving. The motives matter a lot. If it is simply a reaction, it may become a wrong trying to correct another wrong, which is wrong in itself. Readers are reminded that behind many angry acts is actually a person whose pride has been hurt.Being angry is a choice. We can either choose to give in easily to anger to allow it to fly beyond rage, or to exercise self-control by giving up our right to be angry. This is the key message of Christian radio host and author, Brant Hansen. This one change of perspective is the rudder that turns the ship of uncontrolled anger and cultivates an unoffendable spirit. Very readable and tremendously applicable to modern day living, this book speaks about anger from a Christian perspective. In the Bible, we learn ""in your anger, do not sin,"" which means that behind every anger moment is an opportunity for sin to grow. Believers must learn to look beyond the offending event and remember that the person who had hurt us is not the enemy. The enemy is somewhere else trying to make us sin against that brother or a sister, or that person that Jesus had died for. When we gain the bigger perspective of God's love for the world, we will learn to see from God's point of view and to live according to the teachings of Christ. Love your enemies. Pray for them. Love them the way Christ had loved them.Rating: 4.25 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of W Publishing Group, Thomas Nelson, and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"This is the ninth volume in the ""Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament"" series (ZECNT) from Zondervan. The earlier versions cover the gospels of Matthew and Luke, the book of Acts, the Pauline epistles to the Galatians, the Ephesians, the Colossians, Philemon, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and the letter to James. What makes this series useful are the:-  More extensive Greek exegesis which is particularly helpful for those who have studied Greek-  Helpful main ideas with each pericope-  Graphical layouts and tables-  Contextual connections throughout-  Exegeting and explanation of the texts-  Application IdeasMost unique of all is the reminder throughout that exegesis must come before interpretation. This makes the commentary a very helpful reminder in itself to avoid putting the cart of interpretation/application before the horse of understanding what the text says originally. In this volume, Karen H Jobes, Professor of New Testament at Wheaton College helps us to exegete and understand the Greek texts and apply them to practical living. On the one hand, pastors and teachers would like to have a more in-depth treatment of the Bible. There are some commentaries that seem more ready to comment and talk rather than to wait and ponder over the meaning of the text, to let the text speak for itself.  This is no easy task.Thankfully, with Jobes's experience, expertise, and enthusiasm, we have this volume that looks at the three letters of John in a non-redactional way. It is less of the reading into the text and more of reading out of what the text is saying. She notes that the three letters need to be read in conjunction with the gospel of John. After listing the various existentialist and evangelical approaches, Jobes settles on an approach that lets the gospel of John and the letters inform each other. Rather than to limit the polemics in John to forms of Gnosticism or Christological heresies, Jobes prefer to expand it to a ""variety of false beliefs."" This allows one to have a broader picture of the challenges and the relevance of 1, 2, 3 John today.The epistles of John are particularly important because it stresses the importance of knowing God. Jesus is relevant today as well as tomorrow. In Jesus, we have a cornerstone that will stand the test of time. In a world of conflicting ideologies and pluralistic philosophies, the letters form a spiritual anchor for faith. There are major themes emphasized like our attitude toward sin, love as the glue of interpersonal relationships, and other non-polemical views like shepherding believers, and arguing for a correction to what faith in Jesus means. Jobes compares the gospel and the letters frequently, showing us of a common authorship as well as major themes that are repeated. Not only that, the letters project a certain circular or spiral movement, where themes are never forgotten as John moves from one point to another. It is not a step-wise flow of sequential thought but a series of repetition to ensure that readers get the key points. That makes outlining the letters quite a challenging one. The big idea is essentially knowing God via the Word incarnated; knowing God via symbols and metaphors; knowing what God delights and what God hates; knowing the interconnection between knowing and loving; knowing God in relationships; knowing God through right teachings; knowing God through the expression of love for one another; knowing God as God is revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.Each carefully selected passage opens with a ""Literary Context"" that introduces the location and contexts of the text. It is then followed by a ""Main Idea"" to declare to the reader where the commentator is at. The ""Translation"" portion itself is worth the price of the book as Jobes diligently structures the texts according to literary patterns, chiastic arrangements, and key words. The Explanation of the Text offers lots of fodder for thought and analysis. Readers are encouraged to engage the author as much as possible by asking why certain Greek words in that passage were selected in the first place. Reading it reminds me of my Greek teacher who had helped me move the texts from exegesis to devotion. Other highlights include the ""In Depth"" boxes that offer supplementary material and the ""Theology in Application"" which is one of my favourites. This commentary is the best one I have found on the epistles of John. It has the scholarship depth and the theological faithfulness. It is readable and practical. I would strongly recommend this as the key commentary to use for any preaching and teaching of the epistles of John.Rating: 5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Zondervan Academic and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.

"Must the opposite of violence be a violent counter strike? Is war necessarily a tit-for-tat exchange of bullets and missiles? Can alternative methods like peaceful response be feasible, even possible in the first place? These questions are answered with pacifist conviction by renowned author and professor, Ron Sider, whose previous book, ""Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger"" had gripped the hearts of evangelicals many years ago. What that book had done to many Christians in terms of their wealth and giving responsibilities, this latest book will push the limits with regards to peaceful offerings and intentional ""nonviolent action."" Underlying any ""just war"" or ""pacifist"" theory is a philosophy of justification whether war is the key response in the first place. What about peace as the underlying action? For any entrance into war does not mean the consequences are limited on a military scale. There are other damages inflicted on all sides, morally financially, ethically, physically, mentally, and many more as the years go by. Soldiers who survived the wars may end up having scars for life. Unable to get back to the normal life, many become marginalized in society. Such effects must not be underestimated. Rather than to a backward thrust, like the consequences of war as a main justification, Sider in this book leads from the front. He issues a clarion call for all to use nonviolence as THE way forward. Our vocabulary for action must extend beyond war and weapons, violence and vehemence.He begins with well-known examples of nonviolent actions through the centuries. During the time of Pharaoh, the Hebrew midwives responded to violence through civil disobedience, which saved the life of Moses. Pope Leo I responded to the vicious acts of Attila the Hun with a cross and a papal crown. In central America, peasants and common people overcame the violence of dictators through general strikes. India's Mahatma Gandhi led peaceful protests that rallied millions of citizens to do the same.  America's Martin Luther King Jr did the same with peaceful rallies against racism in the 50-60s. Philippines' ""People Power"" movement toppled the Marcos regime not with tanks but with people, not with violence but with peace. From America to Asia, Africa to Central America, Europe to the Middle East, examples abound with regards to the practice of nonviolent action that deserves to be taken more seriously. With stories after stories of how peaceful actions lead to the bloodless overthrow of regimes, changes of political forces, and new waves of hope, Sider consistently asserts that there is a better way instead of physical violence and military options. He proposes peacemaker teams that comprise representatives from all sectors. He admonishes the Christian public, especially the ""just war"" proponents for forgetting that war must always be a last resort. For peaceful actions are more successful than many had thought. Giving statistics and stories to back up his arguments for peace, the next step is to increase the common space for all to work with together. It there is ever to be a war, it must be a war against war.Peace is a given. Christians are called to be peacemakers in the first place. In fact, the biggest tragedy for many policy makers is not to give peace a bigger piece of the pie. It is the lack of willingness to persevere in non-violent actions that has led to an ease in pushing the war option. Contrary to what some readers may think, Sider is not some hermit calling for people to retreat back into their caves. Rather, he is calling people to arm themselves with determination to fight, with the weapons of love, the passion for peace. He wants more Christians to fight fear with faith, war with peace, and hatred with love. For most of the decisions to go to war, the problem is not only in the decision, but the lack of will in pursuing the peace option. Negotiations can be very complicated. What about violent terrorists that refuse to listen to rationale arguments? What about fanatics who have abandoned reason altogether? What about the warped and wanton evil that are happening around the world that demand a strong response? Will peace be the answer for that?Personally, I believe Sider's point is not perfect. For there will be cases that war and violence may be the only way to end wars, like the Atomic bomb that accelerated the end of WWII in the Asia Pacific. Ethical problems will continue to rear their heads with regards to some violence in order to bring about peace. While peace should be the primary ""weapon"" of choice, to abandon the military option would be foolhardy, in an increasingly dangerous and violent world. Like the case of a lion. Without teeth, the lion is easy prey for hyenas.Rating: 4.5 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Brazos Press and Graf-Martin Communications in exchange for an honest review.

"Many Christians believe in the importance of studying the Word of God. They love and revere the Bible. They spend hours studying it and do devotions with it. They organize Bible studies to understand more about God. Sometimes, there is a danger of being too subjective by letting our own philosophies and feelings dominate what the biblical texts say and mean. What are the interpretive principles behind understanding and applying the Word of God?This is an abridged version of an earlier book entitled, ""Introduction to Biblical Interpretation."" In a nutshell, the authors had earlier proposed a hermeneutical triad that comprises of historical contexts, literary genres, and theological implications (I call it HLT) in their nearly 900 pages length original. This edition is not only simplified but the contents reduced by 50% in order to cater for a less academic audience. From exegetical examples to bibliographical listing, advanced material to technical content, the authors are hoping that the book will benefit more lay readers and general audiences, especially the more eager learner of interpretive methods. With clear outlines and suggestions for learning, each chapter is refreshed to be more reader friendly and easier to reference. At the same time, all biblical interpreters are charged with this one single task: Interpret the sacred text with reverence and accuracy.I like the way the authors begin with the need for humility. This is so important as having knowledge can puff up rather than edify the body. It means learning as being equipped to do good work. It means listening to the text and sharpening our spiritual perception. It also means that we are changed from the inside out. The Hermeneutical Triad is the author's way of helping us submit humbly to God by being respectful of the historical contexts; being sensitive to the literary genres, and being actively engaged with the theological implications of whatever passages we are studying. Each chapter comprises key guidelines for interpretation, key words to notice, and assignments to put what we read into practice. The entry outline helps readers to keep track of where they are going in this abridged but still sizeable volume. I like the simplified description and the brevity of each section. The supporting tables and illustrations drive home the pointers the authors try to make. I appreciate the conclusions accompanying each chapter because it is good pedagogy to summarize and to repeat important points. Overall, this follows the general teaching paradigm:- First, I tell you what I am going to say- Second, I say it.- Third, I summarize what I have said.There are less distractions and more focus on putting the HLT interpretive model to practice. This helps any student, layperson, reader, or Bible study leader tremendously in putting limited efforts into maximum effect. For seminarians, professors, preachers, and teachers, this edition is a good introduction for a general audience, but needs to be used in conjunction with the original unabridged version for maximum benefit. That said, the usefulness of this book should not be underestimated. For the HLT interpretive model is a very practical one and should appeal to a wide array of Bible study enthusiasts. One more thing. I love the title. For it is the very reason why we study the Bible and learn from books about Bible interpretation in the first place.Rating: 4.75 stars of 5.conradeThis book is provided to me courtesy of Kregel Academic in exchange for an honest review.

The nicely cushioned pads are removable and replaceable and the heads/ear pad holders pivot easily to help secure that ‘perfect’ fit.Additionally, these HM9s come with three interchangeable cables. These include  1) a 1.2 meter – about 4 ½ feet – flat cable, 2) a 3 meter (about 10 feet) – flat cable , and 3) a 1.2 meter cable with a microphone and control switch that worked perfectly with my iPhone. Flat cables are becoming increasingly popular as they are able to resist getting tangled or knotted up. The set also comes with a ¼” adapter that I was able to plug into my guitar amp to use the HM9’s as studio monitor headphones. A hard carrying case is also included.When it comes to the quality of the sound, they are hard to beat. For those to whom technical details are important: The drivers are dynamic, 40mm; Rated impedance is 40 ohms; Frequency range is a respectable 10 Hz to 24 kHz; Sensitivity is rated at 104 dB at 1 mW; and the Maximum input power is 1000 mW. For most of us, the technical stats matter less than the actual performance – i.e., How do they sound? The answer is simple: Superb!Listening to hard rock, classical, folk or jazz, the sound is ‘real life’ rich, smooth and complete. As an amp-connected studio monitor, you can hear your own instrument pretty much precisely as those listening would hear it – exactly what monitor headphones are for. The HM9’s are quite comfortable and light enough to be worn for extended periods of time while, at the same time, being substantive enough to support a nice sense of using a headset of real substance.There will always be a place for wireless devices, but for serious listening to a serious music experience, this wired HM9 set from Brainwavz is truly top notch.Disclosure:This item was provided to me at no or greatly reduced cost in exchange for an honest review.

"I was excited to find this cover was large enough to fit over a large outdoor table and six chairs. The tie-downs at the bottom seemed secure. What I did not anticipate was it's reaction to strong winds. The cover became a sail - sending the table and chairs blowing all over our newly built deck - doing quite a bit of damage to it. Also, the force of the wind (not extraordinary - 20-30 mph during some of the more billowy winter days.

"In my home, we use quite a bit of vanilla - both as a liquid extract and as beans. Really good vanilla beans are often a challenge to find. Those sold in supermarkets are often dried out and impossibly expensive. Given the invitation to try these Tahitian beans from Sigmeau, I jumped at the opportunity. I was not disappointed.Vacuum-sealed in clear plastic, these beans are still moist and conspicuously fresh - though appropriately aged. Their flavor is rich and sweet - and I have used them (in small pieces) in home-made vanilla ice cream as well as adding a small piece to our sugar bowl! The fact that Tahiti is suggested makes them taste even ...well... exotic!I do not believe it is possible to get real quality vanilla beans at a bargain price - On the other hand, most of my uses require only small pieces of the beans - so I expect these to last quite a while (stored in an air-tight container after opening the original plastic packaging.)These vanilla beans are absolutely succulent!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZLQ9FMFBE1ZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016W4JK6M#wasThisHelpful","R2ZLQ9FMFBE1ZW","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of and use many motion-activated and light-up-when-dark solar lights around the house. This is the first one I have tried which offers the right options! (1. Lights when dark at 50% of the maximum lumens, 2. As #1, but comes to full power when motion is detected close by, and 3, Remains dark at night until motion is detected, then glows at full power.) It is absolutely the brightest and most versatile solar lamp I have found!The power source are two (included) 2200mAh batteries (18650.) They arrived about 1/2 charged and because the standards for 18560 rechargeable batteries are not firmly established around the world, other brands than those included may be either too long or too short to work with this lamp. I tried to use 2600 mAh Foxnovos - to hold additional storage power, but they were about 1/4"" too long too long to fit the lamp.The back of the lamp opens ( a screwdriver is included!) to a compartment housing both the batteries and the function-selection switch. I advise leaving it open while you try the several functions before screwing the cover back on and mounting the light. Mounting screws and a mounting screw-template are also included. The unit is waterproof-rated at IP65 and should do OK during our rainy season.Although the lumen capacity is listed as 400, it actually generates 550 lumens. The 32 LEDs create, without a doubt, the brightest solar light I have used and I am delighted with it.

"This is a satisfyingly well-bound book, printed on (increasingly rare) premium paper that presents information often only suggested in brief paragraphs in the Sunday newspaper magazine supplement.I have always had an interest in strange things - people and places alike. In this Atlas of Cursed Places, Olivier Le Carrer has compiled a well-researched, appropriately illustrated with maps (as one would expect to find in an ""atlas') and somewhat over-written accounts of 32 locales all over the world, of which I had previous awareness of only seven! I learned quite a lot in reading it.Each of the 32 places described in this volume have been  (and currently are) regarded as being 'cursed' by sometimes large groups of people. Some are well-known (the seven I was familiar with :-) and others, not so; at least as much by most North Americans who have never indulged in a study of the subject. The scope is world-wide and as most of us tend to be rather provincial in our scope of knowledge, there are many interesting surprises in this book.This is NOT a 'leave-it-on-the-coffee-table' for people to notice decoration. It is a well-researched and fascinating catalogue of some unusual places with unusual and sometimes unlikely 'histories' - and mythologies. They are all interesting stories.  This book is not a light-read and requires some sustained attention, tolerance for some arguably excessive verbiage as well as a reasonably literate vocabulary to really enjoy.Having just finished it, I must say that I learned quite a lot and found that new learning satisfying. Subtracting 'recreational' reading, learning is the object of spending time with a book in my opinion. In that way, I can recommend this guide. If you are looking for a one-over-lightly treatment of the subject of ""cursed' places, this is not the right book for you.One star deducted for sometimes numbing over-writing, I can honestly recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject who has the time and ability to sustain focus enough to absorb some genuinely fascinating information.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFJGJMAD68Y0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631910000#wasThisHelpful","RFJGJMAD68Y0O","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wear graduated prescription glasses. The upper part of the lens improves my distance vision, the middle is for computer distances and the lowwer part is for reading. I like them, but there are times when the thing I need to read or do is not made clear enough. At those times, I need more magnification and while my iPhone has a magnification APP, it is not always handy. This magnifying glass from Aoneky really does the trick.I have used it to read tiny print, dismantle small electric devices and examine the fine markings on old coins. The possible uses for a good magnifying glass are limitless - and this IS a good one. No distortion.  Held at the correct position between the object to be magnified and the user's eyes (a quick process that involves moving the glass closer and further away until the optimal clarity is achieved) the well-crafted solid glass lens, held firmly in a nice metal frame with an attractive wooden handle, does the job easily and reliably.Of course, it is not a prescription lens, so - for best results - if you wear prescription glasses, try keeping them on while you use this magnifying glass.Nicely constructed, clear lens and attractive in-and-of itself.

"Made of a single-layer of VERY soft cotton/poly blend, this hoodie is exactly what I was hoping it would be. Out of the washer and into the dryer - no wrinkles.

"I have been a fan and frequent drinker of Pur Protein Shakes for several years now - they are great! But, sometimes, a solid energy-boost protein-laden snack is a lot more convenient - especially when there is no refrigeration! Given the opportunity to try and to review these bars from Pure Protein, I jumped at the opportunity. Although they have less protein per serving than do the shakes 20 vs. 35g, they taste quite good and fill the gap between meals nicely for me.The pack I received came with three flavors. Chocolate Deluxe, Chewy Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Peanut Butter. The nutritional differences among the three bar flavors are significant negligible - the taste is the different and they all taste just fine to me. I note that they do have significantly more carbs than the shakes do, but for someone wanting some extra energy to run on, carbs are a good thing (in moderation, of course.) When you get right down to it, the name Pure Protein is actually more appropriate for the shakes than it is for these bars.What they are called notwithstanding, they taste good, have a very palatable texture and provide some  protein boost with minimal sodium and sugars. I have less concern about the ""Alcohol Sugars"" than some other reviewers have as the amount is small and my research on the subject did not throw any red-flags for me. The substance is, actually, neither alcohol nor sugar but rather a standard thickening substance used in many foods.Yes, you can get more protein in other products - or more fiber or more carbs... but, for a great tasting snack that is NOT a meal but is a 'between meal' boost and treat, these Protein Bars have earned my top rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZY6BJVFZA9GY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01126O3OY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZY6BJVFZA9GY","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I confess to being a BRAINWAVZ fan. I have used several of their products and have found them all to be reliable, well made and even the lower-end ones produce better than adequate sound. In this new S3 IEM set, they have outdone themselves. At a price that may seem kind of high to people accustomed to low-end earphones, they have produced what I feel is their 'top-of-the-line' set. These earphones include an in-line microphone and control and function as factory-made Apple headsets do with my iPhone.The flat cables are less readily tangled and render the entire set less bulky. The included hard-case makes storage a piece of cake. The range of ear-adapters included will allow these S3s to fit just about any imaginable human ear perfectly, and the sound ... well, I hesitate to offer a direct comparison, but suffice it to say that using the same pieces of HD recorded music, they performed at least as well as earphones I have that listed at 3-4 times their price. The overall harmonics sound true at all ranges and hold that clarity up to and including play at the highest possible volume. Outstanding!Although a relatively small component of these earphones, the microphone deserves some special mention as well.  Most of us know that in-line microphones are, at best, somewhat adequate. None deliver the 'hand-held-on-a-hard-line' sound that we really wish for. The microphone on these S3s come a lot closer to really good voice pick-up that any headphones (including those provided by Apple with my iPhone and iPad.) This was completely unexpected and turn out to be a significant issue for those of us who routinely use the phone between listening to music through the earphones.Structurally, there are no fancy earpieces that need to be figured out (an annoying recently popular design in may earphones.) These Brainwavz earphones simply plug into your ears - and fitted with the correct ear tips, they stay right there until you remove them.By design and by performance, these S3 earpohones are among the very best I have used - at any price!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P6K9SDSG3JPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0162C1P9O#wasThisHelpful","R2P6K9SDSG3JPH","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea of combining a moisturizing/'plumping' product with good sunscreen protection is certainly an appealing one. Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid,  Mannose and Neurosensine are found in many wrinkle 'removers' but rarely in combination with decent sun protection. Redermic C UV Moisturizer tries to do both. I got fair results with it - Fair in that the moisturizing/plumping ingredients DO (temporarily) make age wrinkles less conspicuous and the SPF-25 is generally adequate as far as it goes, but contains no active sun'block' ingredients, like Zinc Oxide. Anyone really concerned with sun protection - like myself as a melanoma survivor - would not rely on simple sunscreens any longer. Complete sun protection requires the addition of a compound that physically blocks the sun in addition to the more common ones, such as those found in this product, that offer essentially chemical protection. Sunscreen and sunblock are NOT the same thing.The product is easily applied and is less obvious than many other products. It does, however, dry into an almost solid, but thin, mask that is not particularly comfortable on the skin. The cost is significantly higher that using other skin plumping moisturizers and sunblock purchased separately but, for the sake of convenience, this is a handy product.For those who can afford it and are not satisfied with the results they are getting from other products, this Redermic C UV Moisurizer is definitely worth a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79CTEQBHQPV4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094KUK98#wasThisHelpful","R79CTEQBHQPV4","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an aging man with hair thinning on the back/top and along my forehead, my vanity was triggered and I decided, after reading many reviews, to give this Pura d'or shampoo a try. I use it in the shower every day and, as directed, leave it in my hair for a few minutes while I was the rest of my body. I was not expecting much. Even prescription Rogaine has limited results for most people. So, I was very surprised that after a few weeks, I could actually feel and SEE the difference.ould see the back/top of my head using mirrors and thought it looked less 'balding' but suspected I was kidding myself. So, I approached the truly objective and always truthful evaluator I live with - my wife - and asked her to honestly tell me if she could see any difference. AMAZING! She confirmed that my hair looked fuller and thicker - that there was a visible increase in hair on both areas where it had been conspicuous thinning. I am delighted and see no reason to discontinue using this Pura d'or shampoo.I am not an expert about these things - and certainly cannot guarantee that everyone who tries it will have the same results - but I can (and just have) shared my own experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY9GQYMI8ESE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FH692PQ#wasThisHelpful","R1TY9GQYMI8ESE","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried a good many photo editing programs over the years. Everything from the ridiculously (and, for my purposes, unnecessarily) complex Adobe Photoshop programs to the simple, intuitive and free Picasa from GOOGLE. Being an impatient sort, I have would up continually returning to Picasa because of its ease-of-use. Finally, though, I began to get frustrated with the gap between what I really wanted to do with photos and the limitations of that free program. Years ago, I tried an earlier version of Paint Shop Pro but was overwhelmed by what it was and what it could do. I guess I have outgrown that impatience as I have begun to take my photography more seriously.I have loaded and am using this new PaintShop Pro X8 Ultimate - and, though there IS a learning curve and I realize that I will not be facile with all of its features and capabilities for quite a while, I am invested in devoting myself to using and learning it. I am encouraged by the fact that I have been able to begin with very simple actions and edits and can 'grow into' the impressive range of editing features this program offers as I either need or want to learn them.The details of this program's features have already been detailed in other reviews so I shall not reiterate them here. Suffice it to say that, overall, this PaintShop Pro compares quite favorably with Adobe's Photoshop Elements and actually has more features.A note about 'intuitive' software:Unless a person is a highly skilled photographer and photo editor, ANY program beyond the most basic is not going to be experienced as being 'intuitive.' This program, like other more advanced editing suites, is technologically complex - and, speaking for myself, none of it is truly automatic, or 'intuitive' to me. To use this program, if it is a step up for you, will demand a commitment of time and attention IF you hope to make good use of the multiplicity of editing options it offers. If there are 100 steps to learn the entire program, I write this review from step 5 or 6. I am not discouraged - On the contrary, I am challenged and excited to produce photos close to the way I can imagine them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJL4R7ECNK73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0123C60D8#wasThisHelpful","RAJL4R7ECNK73","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With this new ""Crafter"" Beard Boss kit from Remington (PG 6170), the standard Remington trimmer (the one sold as MB404 and the MB4045, which adds a pop-up trimmer to essentially the same device), some substantial improvements have been introduced. Both the 4040 and 4045 are very good trimmers - but there is always room for improvement and the Craftsman trimmer has done so. The shape of the trimmer is different - narrower near the head and, thus, a bit easier to aim with precision and the battery life is 3X as long as it is with the two other trimmers I have mentioned.  With 180 minutes of real use-time on a full charge, I can go for months of 1X week use without needing to recharge it.Also, the Crafter kit is simply loaded with accessories/attachments. Though many of them are geared, specifically, to use with longer beards, the range of possibilities the attachments provide is truly impressive. In addition to the more usual one or two length guide-combs, the Crafter sports six of them. Also included are two attachments I have never seen on a trimmer before _ a nose and ear hair trimmer AND a small ('mini') foil shaver! The pop-up trimmer on the back-side of the 4045 (which seems convenient but is quite awkward to position and use) has been replaced with a more useful and ergonomically facile detail trimmer blade head that can simply pop on to the handle just like the other blade does.I believe Remington's claim that this trimmer is waterproof and safe to use in the shower - but I will not be the one to test that particular feature as I find that I do a better job trimming my hair and beard if I do it in front of a large mirror without water falling all around me at the time :-)Together with the Titanium blades, Remington has produced a solid and versatile hair and beard trimmer. For the do-it-yourself groomer, it is an unarguably complete set of tools.

"There are literally thousands of USB-Lightning cables available these days. What differentiates them? Function, of course. In the early days of Apple's switch over from the 30-pin to the Lightning (8-pin) connector, there were many after-market accessories and cables that were bogus and simply did not work. These days, most do work and the key variable, once functionality is established, is simply price.At this price point, I don't think you can go wrong with four of these cables from Kash Technologies.As soon as mine arrived, I tried out all four of them - each on two different devices - an iPhone5 and an iPad Air 2. In each instance, the cables worked exactly as well as those that came with the devices directly from Apple. No warnings about not compliant - no loose connections.An Apple user really cannot have too many charging and data-transfer cables. You never know where and when you might want/need one. THis four-pack is welcome.As to those who have had problems with me - perhaps the issues have been resolved by Kash - and since they offer a 100% guarantee (Lifetime) it is in their interests to get it right the first time; or, perhaps there are compatibility issues with specific devices and software (iOS) versions.

"This is an accurate, attractive and easy-to-read scale that sits quite low to the floor and requires no 'tap-first' action. By contrast, our previous scale looks rather bulky and rather difficult to read.There are not many things to evaluate about a scale. In fact, there are only two: Design and function.Design:The clear glass top of this Taylor Digital Bath Scale covers a marble-appearing application. It is noted that same reviewers have found the brand name, which is also printed on that marbled layer, a flaw in the design. I had no such reaction as pretty much ALL consumer products bear the name of the manufacturer. Would a Hamilton Beach blender only be appropriate for someone named Hamilton Beach? Silly. The surface is smooth and larger that we are accustomed to - but that is a good thing for those of us with larger feet!The grey marble appearance is, I thought, both neutral and attractive. It is hard to imagine a bathroom design with which it might 'clash.'Function:One simply steps on it and after a couple of seconds, the weight appears. It will read out in either pounds or kilograms - Mine arrived with the default setting on pounds, but that can be easily changed. Our previous scale had been professionally calibrated and this one gives the precise same readings, so its accuracy seems true.It is low to the ground so there is a very minimal 'step-on' to the scale and it requires no tapping to activate as many other scales do.The digital read-out is quite large and I can easily read it without glasses.It is powered by two (quite common and inexpensive) CR2032 batteries.In Summary:I honestly have nothing critical to say about this scale. I find it to be both attractive and accurate. I cannot comment on the durability of the glass top. Someone will have to drop it (or something on it) to est that out.

"Inexpensive solar lights are a real boon to those of us who want some outdoor lighting - automatically at night only. I use them on the deck and they do a great job of keeping the nocturnal critters (raccoons and skunks) off the deck that adjoins our bedroom at night! These little lamps (little in size, but quite bright!) from InaRock are just right!Although both pieces of the lamps are plastic, they are easy to mount and seem adequately sturdy. They come with some screw-mounting hardware. I used velcro to mount them to vinyl posts on the deck. The 6 LED lights in each lamp create far more light than the size of the lamps would suggest and they are far brighter than others of this size that I have used.I did make and do recommend one adjustment before turning them on. They come with reasonably low power (600mAh) batteries - each unit uses only one of them. They are expected, with these batteries, to provide between 6 - 8 hours of lighting. I like mine to glow all night - from sunset to dawn. This was easily achieved by upgrading the batteries to 1500mAh ones that I keep a fully charged supply of. After a 10 hour night, they were still glowing just before the sun came up!All-in-all,these lights are a good deal. Simply constructed of adequately durable plastic and powered by a single 1.2V Li-ion battery, they have a decent waterproof rating and should last for a good many years. I am glad to be able to recommend them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R348EZBHW20V8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0155II1CA#wasThisHelpful","R348EZBHW20V8S","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Black & Decker has been an important and reliable manufacturer of power tools and small appliances for many years. Unfortunately, their strength as drill and taster-oven makers are not apparent in this particular product. The 3W LED light, itself, is nice and does provide clear and adequate lighting for general lighting a desk space or for reading.The issues are with the reality of the lamp’s design and structure.As were others, I was surprised to find a plastic lamp at this price point. It IS heavy and feels solid for its size but is smooth, black plastic and shows each and every touch and smudge, The power and brightness level-setting button works sometimes – and sometimes it does not. The greatest frustration, design-wise, is the inability to rotate the light from the top joint. There is no rotational capacity whatever so to adjust the angle of the light, the entire lamp must be moved. I see that this is the case on at least one other LED lamp that B&D makes and I suspect that their lamps are designed by people who may not actually use them.The bottom line is this:It is difficult to recommend what appears to be an over-priced, inadequately designed lamp. So … I won’t. Black & Decker can and should be expected to do better. It would never have earned the good reputation it has producing things like this lamp.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O60OD0D9U09Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KRW793M#wasThisHelpful","R2O60OD0D9U09Y","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of magnetic cellphone holders in cars. UNlike the 'clamp' variety, one hand does the trick and there are no moving parts to get stuck or break. Until Vafee introduced this magnetic mount, the others I have known and tried have 'arms' on them that allow for the phone (or other device) to be mounted 2-4"" away from the base. Also, the bases tend to be much larger than the rather petite stick-on base on this holder. I wondered what difference these two differences would make and was enthusiastic about trying this new holder from Vafee out.Also, this magnetic mount is smaller and, as a consequence, less obvious than any other I have ever seen. This is a plus that may also be a minus.I discovered the following:Because the mounting base is so small, it works perfectly for phones alone or with light-weight snap-on cases. With a heavier case (Otter, etc.) I do not think that the base would safely support the combined weight over time. The lack of an 'arm' means that the choices about where the magnet holder can be attached are limited. It works best, I found, on a fully vertical or near-vertical surface where there is room to maneuver the phone with the (very nice) rotating ball feature that allows for easy angular adjustment. Side window mounting is out as is any position requiring the phone to be even an inch or two above or below the base of the mount.The magnet, itself, is quite string and allows for the disks that we attach to our devices/cases to be significantly thinner than most other magnetic mounts require. This is a real bonus in that the disks are so slim that they can be easily mounted inside a phone case with no noticeable bulge in the case or problem with the case's correct fit on your phone.Bottom line:There are some placement limitations because of the lack or an arm that are compensated for by the smooth rotation capacity and sheer power of the battery itself. (I note that ALL car-mount holders have placement limitations that vary according to their design.)This is a very strong magnet with good adjustment/rotation capacity that works best with lighter-weight devices. As a fan of the lighter-weight snap-on type cases for my iPhone, this works quite well for me. If you have the right kind of dash and a reasonably light-weight device, this magnetic mount from Vafee will not disappoint. THis mount is small,strong and subtle and, with the right kind of mounting surface, angle and weight of device, works impeccably.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NF7J366M1EEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SC8XZO#wasThisHelpful","R1NF7J366M1EEQ","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hummingbirds where we live (in a superb north of San Francisco) are plentiful in some years and seem to have moved elsewhere during others. We keep a feeder out, even in slow years, just in case they care to stop by and visit outside our dining room window. In this drought year, when few hummers have come by, we decided to hang this truly stylish feeder and the accompanying spinner out. Three days later, they were back - as usual, in couples! Maybe it is ""magical thinking,"" but this feeder and spinner seem to have been taken as a hearty welcome home to the hummingbirds!The feeder is truly lovely.  Heavy, antique-like glass, fashioned with true sturdiness. Once filled, there are two pieces that screw on which, once inverted, provide the feeding station. The bottle hangs from an attached metal loop which can be a tad awkward until you get use to hanging it by a hook from your favorite tree.The spinner gave me some pause, as I wondered if the 'glitteriness' of it might cause some shy hummers to fly off. I need not have been worried. Unlike some others, I chose to not hang the spinner to or along the same axis as the feeder - Rather, I hung it a couple of feet away. The fifth neighbor who stopped by to comment on the eset and ask where I got them came by just this morning.The feeder may be a bit unusual in that there is no 'perch' for the birds to sit on, but hummers feed perfectly nicely while in flight so there is no need for one. This is a fine set - Distinctive and attractive to both humans and hummers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9J7BYA1LEI5Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBOXIXI#wasThisHelpful","R9J7BYA1LEI5Q","A30J7WQV0ZNRXG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30J7WQV0ZNRXG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Now in my late 60s, many things about my body have changed. One of the more annoying of them is the ease with which I bruise - from what-were-once mild bangs and bumps to getting stuck bu a thorn on a rose bush while pruning - dark purple splotches now appear and take weeks to fade. Looking at these spots on my arms and the backs of my hands makes me feel that I am no longer getting older, but that I am, in fact, old. I hate that feeling! I had been searching for a product that might help and have tried many (vitamin E and C preparations, various ointments and creams, etc.) None of them did much.

"This is a great watch for a great deal, but man it is huge.  Honestly, it's too big for my wrists (which are on the smaller side of medium).  Part of the size is the diameter (which is quite big), but also the sheer height of the watch.  The thickness from the back of the watch where the battery goes to the top of the bezel is, no kidding, as thick as my thumb is wide.  It stands up off the wrist over half an inch, maybe three-quarters of an inch.  But it looks really nice and would be a real head-turner if you can pull off big watches.  The colors (gold band around outside) and numbers are, if anything, even more striking in real life.  It has a nice turning bezel.  The band is super hefty and stout and actually pretty comfortable -- seems very well made.  The watch has quartz movement.In sum, I would highly recommend this watch (especially for the great price), but only if you are looking for a very big watch and can pull it off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Z6Q6EA1GFJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K5F5ZU#wasThisHelpful","R16Z6Q6EA1GFJI","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this case and it's exactly what I was looking for.  I have tried and tested a lot of different phone cases and have not found many that really suited my tastes.  I like thin as possible, but also want protection.  This case basically provides that at the quality we have come to expect from OtterBox.  It is a pretty sleek case with a nice clear back.  The rubber edge is actually pretty thick to protect from falls, and the beveled edge helps protect the screen.  The quality really stands out in the button covers: they give a nice, firm, easy click (in contrast to cheap cases, which usually mess up the button covers).  As stated in my title, though, only two real complaints...  The first is that the case is very expensive at currently $40.  Much of the competition runs in the range of $15-30.  Second, despite costing so much, the case does not include a screen cover.  Ideally, I think, this case should come with a nice impact-resistant glass cover of high quality.  It's not hard to buy one aftermarket, but it would be a nice touch.Other than that, I can highly recommend this case.

"I'm generally a positive reviewer on Amazon.  I get asked to review lots of items (in exchange for a complimentary product), and generally I pick things I like and want, and this results in positive reviews.  Sometimes, however, I'm very disappointed by a product and I say so honestly.  This is one of those times.  I have a bulky ""protective"" case on my phone and was hoping to get a sleek, slim thing in this Ozaki case.  Unfortunately, the whole product was very disappointing.  It's not *all* bad, some might like it, but this case did not work for me at all.The ""backing"" of the case is a really thin, cheap plastic.  I was expecting a rubbery type of quality plastic, but the backing of this case felt more like the *packaging* of a screwdriver you get at Home Depot.  It is a hard plastic (no rubbery texture to it at all), with a little flex -- but the flex comes from the fact that the plastic is so thin and cheap.  The backing did fit nicely on my phone -- I will give it that.  In fact, once I slipped the backing on, I temporarily thought this case could work out anyway.  Then I got out the plastic front piece.  It's a single piece of plastic that lays down over the face of the phone.  To their credit, they supplied an alcohol wipe pad and a soft cloth -- very good touch.  I cleaned my phone thoroughly.  Then I tried to put the screen cover on.  There was no way on earth to get this thing to lay down neatly without bubbles.  I followed the instructions, I tried everything, and eventually I gave up.  Even worse, the one time I got *really close* to getting the screen cover on with no bubbles, it was just slightly crooked and the edge would catch on things and get pulled up.  Basically, the design does not work.  Either they need a screen cover that actually sticks to the phone, or they need a backing that has a lip to pull over the screen cover and hold it down.  The design of this case has neither.  To be honest, I took this case off my phone and threw it in the trash.  It was that disappointing.  I would not recommend, even though the company generously supplied me with a free item in exchange for review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCKFE8NUHE6JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QWTLZ2#wasThisHelpful","RCKFE8NUHE6JP","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We used blankets for camping, fireworks, picnics, trips to the park, and festivals.  The problem is that it gets dry in the summer and there are stickers everywhere on the ground -- either that, or wet ground.  This blanket handles it all with ease.  The backing is a rubbery type material that is very water resistant (if not waterproof).  It holds out the moisture and is smooth enough that it doesn't pick up stickers.  The same goes for the top side, the blanket side.  It's kind of a smooth fleece material that feels similar to a chamois shirt.  It's not too ""furry"" like most fleece, so it doesn't pick up stickers.  Still very comfortable, though.  Best of all, the whole blanket is designed in such a way that it's easy to just hose off and leave to dry, especially after camping in dusty conditions.

"This lamp didn't work out for me, but it's not entirely bad.  In this review, I'll try to spell out what's good and what I didn't like.  I'm probably a tough reviewer with desk lamps because I use them constantly and am very particular about what I get, but here are my thoughts:Pros:► Looks good► Has a sturdy base to keep it from tipping►  Two different settings help produce ideal amount of light► Has a decent amount of adjustability -- enough for meCons:►  I can't stand halogen.  They burn way too hot.  Not only is the bulb itself a hazard near my toddler, but the light emits heat by my desk (already a problem in Texas summers) and use a ton of energy.  Halogen is, in my opinion, the third worst bulb option on the market.  Fluorescents now come in such a huge variety of shades and types that only the most stodgy light bulb users find anything to complain about.  And LEDs are superior in every category, while using about one-eighth the energy.► The construction is a little weak on parts of this lamp.  For example, the points where the arms link together are fixed with some fairly weak screws, and the stem at the bottom wobbles a bit.► The hood gets blazing hot.  This is connected to the halogen thing -- a problem that simply does not exist if you use LED bulbs.►  The price is, quite frankly, outrageous.  There is no way this lamp is worth $40.  I would peg it at about $10, maybe $15.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UDAJYXN9Z293/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV41QKS#wasThisHelpful","R3UDAJYXN9Z293","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far the best humidifier I have ever owned.  I have previously used (and reviewed) three other humidifiers, all at a significantly lower price point.  This PureGuardian H8000B combines all of the best qualities I have found in others and adds some excellent new features that make it well worth the price for people serious about having a good humidifier to treat their home.  Here are the highlights of what I think this product gives you over the competition:►  Among the best features is the Smart mist sensor, which automatically adjusts output to reach the desired humidity level.  This is super nice.  Over time you will develop a good sense of what humidity level is right for your house, and this helps achieve it at maximum efficiency and with little fuss.►  Like some other PureGuardian humidifiers, this one uses Silver Clean technology to ensure that it fights mold and mildew on the water tank and does not spew it into your air.► It has a variety of other features to adjust run time, speed, output, etc.  Very versatile.►  The humidifier is very quiet despite a very powerful mist output.►  The extender chimney thing is really nice, as it allows the mist to be dispersed higher above the ground into the air, both preventing moisture from accumulating on surfaces, and generally to help spread the mist throughout your house.  Also, I always find that it's good to set ceiling fans on reverse spin (sucking air up, instead of blowing down -- there's a sliding button on the side of most fans for this) to help pull the mist up into the room and circulate it.►  Finally, the humidifier looks great whether on a table or on the floor.Overall, I highly recommend this humidifier.  Although it's expensive, it does the job and does it well, and helps keep our house at a comfortable humidity level.

The nylon material is nice and well-made without being too heavy.  It looks good.  And the two-tier design makes it better withstand gusts of wind.  I'm also very happy with the size.  I hate overly small umbrellas that don't provide enough coverage, but nobody wants a super giant umbrella that looks comical and makes everybody else on the street dodge and duck when you walk past.  This umbrella is large but not too big -- just the right size for me, actually.  And for $24, it's a great deal.

"I have about half a dozen of these battery packs now (in both cars, in my office, and a couple around the house), and this is my favorite one now.  First, I mainly just like the size, feel, and look of this one.  It's about iPhone size, but nice and sleek.  The capacity is fairly large so I can charge several devices with it.  And it has two USB ports (many have only one).  One of these USB ports is 2.0 amps, which is good for bigger devices like tablets, and the other port is 1.0 amp, which is good for most phones.  I actually charge my phone through the 2.0 most of the time, because I think iPhones take 1.5 amps and this makes it pull that full charge.  But the 1.0 amp works also.  The battery pack also has an on/off switch.  I saw that a few other reviews consider this a con, but not me.  It's great when, for example, you're using it in the car and want to turn off the battery pack's draw from the car.  Then just turn it back on when you get back in the car.  There is a nice indicator light to let you know approximately how much juice is left.  I can charge two iPhones from this battery pack when it's full and that's all I've ever needed.  Very pleased with the product, and the price is reasonable.

"What can I say, I love this charging cord.  There are two main things I like about it.  (1) It has both micro-USB and Apple Lightning adapters, increasing its versatility.  I use it for both all the time and it works great -- no connection problems ever.  I can charge my battery packs with the micro-USB, then plug in my iPhone to the Lightning charger.  (2)  I love the color and even the look of the cord.  My electronics drawer is stuffed with plain black and plain white cords, but I can always find this one because the bright green makes it stick out.

"This is my third pair of electronic earmuffs.  Each one has different advantages and disadvantages, and that's true of these Peltor RangeGuards as well.  My other ones are the Howard Leight Impact Sport OD Electric Earmuff, Green, and the Peltor Sport Tactical 100 Electronic Hearing Protector.  I will be comparing these other models to the RangeGuards throughout this review.  I hope it doesn't get too confusing: my intention is to help people doing some serious shopping to get an idea of how different models stack up against each other.  The short version is that I think the RangeGuards are the best VALUE and better overall than the Howard Leights, but not as good as the Peltor Sport Tactical 100s (which cost $75).  Read on for detailed explanation.I assume that most people shopping on this page know what electronic earmuffs are for, but just in case here is a brief description.  They are designed to block out loud noises like gunshots while amplifying normal-volume noise like voices.  This means you can wear them at the shooting range but still hear your buddies talk without removing your ear protection.  You could also use them for the same purpose at something like NASCAR: voices amplified so you can hear your son asking for an ice cream cone, but car engines dampened by the muffs.  In both cases, it's a huge advantage.  I have found them especially useful hunting.  You can actually hear, say, doves taking off or flying in with the amplified sound, but of course your ears don't get hammered by the shotgun blasts.These RangeGuards have an array of good features for the price.  The headband folds and adjusts easily, and it's actually pretty comfortable.  The battery slots is easy to access.  There is an audio input jack for the headphones.  You could play music through it, but I think it's intended for things like bionic ears.  The on/off button works well, and there is an auto-off feature so you don't drain the battery when not in use.  I can usually feel the button even with gloves (thin gloves anyway).  The sealing pads on the RangeGuards are really well made and work effectively on a wide range of heads (as far as I can tell).  Everyone who has tried them has gotten a good seal, which is essential for them to work right.  By contrast, my Howard Leights have hard, thin sealing pads that never seem to work right.  RangeGuard wins on that count: its pads are plush and seal well.  My only complaint is that they are plastic, which can get a little sweaty (and make your ears inside rather hot).  Leather would be nice, but hey, these are only $45.So why do I say they're not as good as the Peltor Sport Tactical 100s?  Mainly I think they are built a little more lightweight.  They are smaller and more low-profile than the Sport Tacticals, and I think they might have smaller speakers and perhaps a lower-grade mic.  Granted, the difference is not THAT noticeable, just minor.  The Sport Tacticals are $75, though, and the RangeGuards are $45, so that probably indicates the difference.  I also notice that various parts on the Sport Tacticals are nicer, like a more padded headband, and apparently beefier construction of the muffs and headband.  But I still think the RangeGuards are an excellent, affordable option, and the perfect electronic earmuffs to keep on hand for guests you take with you to the range.  Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NQVOX2XFJ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R9NQVOX2XFJ0","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great heat gun that comes in handy for a lot of different home improvement projects.  You can use it to remove tape or adhesives, to strip paint, to help dry paint, to dry things in general (like air-sensitive wood glue), to melt ice out of your gutters so they flow again (a big one!!!), and so on and so forth.  I just got this thing recently and haven't yet been able to apply it to all these tasks, but I have used it for two different things (both rather ingenious, I like to tell my wife).  The first is that I used it to ""melt"" (really to soften and bend) plastic tubing for a backyard playscape project I constructed for my daughter.  It worked wonders.  My wife was amazed and everybody asks how I did that.  I tell them brute strength.  It was the Makita.  Shhh.  I wasn't sure if it would work for the second project, but it did.  Our dishwasher quit working and I didn't want to pay the repair guy.  So, long story short, I looked up DIY online and figured out how to replace the control panel and mother board, duly ordered the parts, and went to work.  There was only one really technical aspect to the project.  You had to ""solder"" a piece of plastic together.  I used the heatgun, and despite a few false starts (I'm no expert), it ended up working.  No way I could've done it otherwise.As for the product itself, it's well constructed in general and works as advertised.  The body feels solid and the handle is comfortable.  I like how the nozzle puts out air in a small area.  You can buy other nozzles (I haven't yet -- want to).  The dial is a great concept, but I found that it wiggles during use and can easily bumped off the setting.  Just be mindful, especially if you want low heat and suddenly it's blazing hot.  In short, everything worked great and I'm happy.I would really rate this 4.5 out of 5 stars, but I give it 4 for two reasons.  First, the dial wiggles a bit during use.  It needs to hold its setting a little stronger.  Second, the main one, is that I would like to see a better/stronger/more versatile stand to affix the Makita in certain positions, at various angles, so that I can use both my hands to hold whatever it is I'm putting under the heat.  Granted, it comes with some rubber feet, but I think more would help -- maybe even some kind of tripod like thing that stands upright.Other than that, this is a great product at a reasonable price.  It has all kinds of DIY home improvement uses.  Honestly, people, buy this thing if only to melt the ice in your gutters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDM6W2S3Y1IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009ZHK0J0#wasThisHelpful","R3CDM6W2S3Y1IZ","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is probably my fourth set of clippers and ranks toward the very top, with the benefit of probably being the best value of any clippers I own.  Below I will give you a rundown of the good features of these clippers, but first my own personal reason of why you should buy a pair of clippers at all, whether it's these or another model.  They can save you a ton of money.  I have been cutting my own hair for years (and do a very good job of it) and each time, every 3-4 weeks, this saves me about $20, maybe more, over what I would spend at the barber.  The savings are even more extreme if you factor in the cost of pet grooming.  We have two spaniels that need regular haircuts and I do both of them myself (with Wahl clippers, incidentally).  Each time, this saves us $50-75 per dog every few months.  Clippers will very rapidly pay for themselves.  Properly taken care of (oiling before, during, and after use, and keeping them clean), they will last for years.  Even the blades on our other Wahl Elites have lasted ages and shown no sign of reduced cutting ability.  Definitely buy clippers if you have any inclination to save this unnecessary expense.  You will not regret it.  OK, now the features of these particular clippers.►  I have been using the Wahl Elites in the rechargeable lithium model, which I love (I think Wahl updated the lithium version they sell, but similar thing to the one shown in the comparison chart on this page).  My review is somewhere on Amazon.  The clippers are excellent and totally reliable -- they are my regular go-to clippers, even though I own a pair of Andis clippers that cost me around $140.  I mainly like the cordless lithium design, but these Wahl Elites in the corded version are a MUCH better value and probably slightly better in terms of motor.► The Wahl elite blades are MOST EXCELLENT.  They are very sharp, produce a very even, clean cut, and last for ages.  As I mentioned, I oil these things religiously (get a big jar of clipper oil if you use them much) and that helps them last longer.  They are very high quality blades that do great on a wide variety of hair textures, both thick and fine.  To top it off, the blades have a 5 year warranty.► The motor on the corded version sold here is fairly quiet and smooth, even better than the Lithium.  They have a really solid, expensive, low rumble sound similar to my Andis.  I'm very happy.  I think the motor on this thing is probably the best of any product Wahl sells.► The cord is super long (8 feet) and that helps in all sorts of ways.  Cheap clippers give you a short little cord that always get in the way.  These clippers, for only marginally more, give you a super thick, long cord to make sure it never holds you back.► The blade guides offered by Wahl are top notch, in my opinion.  The reason is that they slide securely into place and hold their position, unlike many other cheaper offerings that clip into place and fall of at the worst moments.  This model also gives you a lot of different blade guides (14) to make sure that every length is covered.  The range of lengths is really outstanding with this model and is better than probably any other clipper at the same price point.► For fine adjustments of cutting height, there is a blade adjuster that lets you retract the cutting edge in small increments.  This is perfect to help smooth the transition between, say, 1/4"" and 3/8"" on the side of one's head.  Works really well.  Just practice with it and you'll figure it out.  Great feature to help get ""between sizes"" when you have a limited number of clipper attachments.► The motor tends to run fairly cool and I have not experienced any excessive heating with the limited usage I give it.  To keep the blades cool, I recommend some cooling spray for clippers.  I think there are a few different brands.  This stuff basically cools down the metal at the same time as it lubricates the blades.  I use it when I clip the dogs and it keeps me going for a long time without letting the blades get hot (which would damage them, since the metal gets soft at high temperatures).Well, I think that's about it.  Overall I'm very happy with these clippers and would highly recommend to anyone.  While I think my Andis clippers are higher quality, they cost like $140.  While I use my Wahl lithiums the most, the motor is not as good as these, and the model # I have cost quite a bit more.  Dollar for dollar, these Wahl Elite 79602s might be the best clippers you can buy.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GYS5OZQ78W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKVNSLC#wasThisHelpful","R15GYS5OZQ78W7","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using aftermarket toner replacements for almost a decade now and have found most of them to be fairly reliable.  This one is no exception.  In fact, I would rank this V4INK toner toward the top of the replacement toners I have used.  Quality can vary fairly significantly.  A few toners by another brand produced very uneven ink coverage (poor contrast; white lines when pictures were printed, etc).  Another one left splotches and marks on the page.  You never quite know what you're getting, but I have still always bought replacement toners because the cost is so much better than the outrageous $45 that Brother chargers for its brandname toners.I'm happy to report that the V4INK stands up well to my tests so far.  It prints very clear, bold, high contrast text.  The blacks are super black.  There is no running or splotching on the white page.  I actually got to subject this toner to some extra serious testing because I was running my Brother laser printer on a SERIOUSLY worn out drum cartridge that had caused print quality consistently to decline.  I put in the new V4INK toner and gave it a try.  New life came out of my drum cartridge!  The blacks were actually bold and clear!  I only printed a limited number of pages this way and finally changed the drum.  The V4INK continued to perform well.  The biggest test came when I printed an old book that had been scanned into PDF form.  The pages were not only grayish from the tint of the scans (a real ink hog, but oh well), the book also contained many photographs.  In the past, printing such books has produced very uneven results, usually streaks on the photos.  But the V4INK performed very well and produced super clear, sharp photographs as well as consistently good contrast on the text.  What more can I ask for?  I doubt a Brother cartridge could top this for twice the price.Long story short, I'm happy with this toner cartridge.  It's a bit more expensive than some other offerings (which go as low as $12), but it also seems to be somewhat better quality, approaching the $45 Brother cartridge.  Since it's a TN450, it is supposed to print up to 2600 pages at 5% coverage.  I find that 1500-2000 is more common under normal usage.  Since it might take some weeks for me to print that much, I will have to report back about its longevity.  For now, I'm just happy with its performance with a variety of printing tasks.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UH21IEJOYWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQ5YBHW#wasThisHelpful","R28UH21IEJOYWM","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very solidly built light that does exactly what it's advertised to do.  As you probably know from the product description, this light casts an intense red light instead of white.  It does so by means of the LED bulb itself, not from a red lens, making the light truer and brighter than ""filter"" options for normal flashlights.  The purpose of the red light instead of white is that it is less detectable by animals whose eyes detect a narrower spectrum of light.  Red light and green light, theoretically, is invisible to animals, and therefore it is favored by hunters who either use the light for spotlighting, or who trek through the woods at night and want to do so without scaring away animals in the vicinity.►  Now a little more about the light.  The construction is very solid and the light feels very heavy duty in the hand.  The body is constructed of 6061T aluminum and is water resistant.  This does NOT feel like a cheap flashlight: it feels like a flashlight made to handle a beating.► The light is covered with nice texturing all over to aid grip under all sorts of conditions.  The twisting cap at the bottom is textured to help screw on and off for accessing the battery compartment.  The middle of the handle is textured for grip.  Even the head of the light is textured.  This not only makes it look cool, it gives the grip you need whether using with gloves or bare hands.► The light itself is good, but I say this with some reservation.  350 lumens is pretty bright compared to ordinary flashlights, but it will your effective shooting to maybe about 30 yards or so.  This is just a guess.  The light can reach farther, but I'm not sure it would illuminate the target well enough to stretch beyond about 30.  The second reservation is that the red light is fairly hard on human eyes.  ""Hard"" in the sense that, even though we can see it, our eyes have to strain to process this color for very long.  The light would be best for quick bursts of use when you want to shoot or whatever, but not for prolonged periods ""staring into the red.""► The other parts on the light work well and have caused zero problems for me.  The switch on the bottom works perfectly.  The lanyard is a nice touch.► A final word is in order about the batteries.  I think the 18650 batteries are awesome.  For those new to them, they are basically a giant, long battery unlike anything typically available in the local Home Depot.  They are specially for flashlights.  The advantage of the 18650 battery is that they last a long time, have high energy output (meaning they can power brighter lights), slow discharge in storage, little memory (meaning you can recharge at any time and not damage battery), and in general good qualities.  If you don't mind charging batteries instead of buying them, you should definitely get a flashlight that takes 18650s.  They are way better than AAs or anything of that kind.► Speaking of batteries, please note that there are two options for this light.  One, slightly cheaper, consists of the flashlight only (no batteries).  The other, slightly more expensive, includes batteries and a charger.  If you already have 18650s, you obviously can get the light alone; otherwise buy the more expensive (I think $28?) option and get the 18650 battery and charger.  It's easy to use and you will like it.  Additional batteries are available for a very low cost all over Amazon.In general, I think this is a very worthy hunting light if you want to minimize your detection by animals at night (whether for shooting or for walking), but be aware that you are getting an unusual red light.  Otherwise, highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMAQVDR8I72U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYWBSVM#wasThisHelpful","RMAQVDR8I72U3","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This squirt gun is decent enough for what you get.  The main selling point is that it sprays four streams of water instead of one, allowing for more soakage I guess.  My daughter enjoys it.  Unlike many squirt guns, however, the spray comes from the action of running the pump, not from pumping air into a tank and pulling the trigger.  This has advantages and disadvantages.  The disadvantage is (1) that it requires two hands to use; and (2) that you cannot spray a steady stream; each pump gives you a quick burst, until the next pump does it again.  The advantage is that the power of your pump determines the power of your squirt, and this often means that every squirt is pretty powerful.  By contrast, an air-tank gun does that thing where it starts out powerful until the pressure peters out.  The build construction and durability is about what you'd expect.  I actually think the pump mechanism will last longer than many tank-based squirt guns because it's not so important for the seals to hold over time.My main complaint is actually NOT the pump action design, which I kind of like.  Rather, it's that the tank is way too small to make very good use of the four barrels, which are the main selling point.  It's only 35 ounces.  You'll blaze through this in no time.  I understand they are trying to keep this light enough for kids to enjoy, but a slightly bigger tank would be a really nice touch.  Everything else could stay the same.  Otherwise, I'm happy with it.  Hard to go wrong for only $16.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTKZ5A94Q33Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MXT4TDK#wasThisHelpful","RVTKZ5A94Q33Y","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're really happy with this little LED lantern.  It's perfect for hanging in the tent (which is how we've used it), for emergency purposes, or even for a spare glovebox light.  It's small, lightweight, well built, and casts a very strong light.  The workmanship (such as the threads and aluminum body) is very good.  As far as I can tell, the cylindrical glass cover is pretty stout and should last a long time.  I tested the magnet and found the same as other reviewers did: as long as the metal surface is smooth, it sticks.  But some textured or covered surfaces (like a fridge) do not hold the light very well.My only big reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the battery is so specific.  Now, to be fair, I have a charger for 16340 batteries, but I had to special order some ONLY for this light.  For many people, I imagine it could be hard to keep such batteries on hand and charged up.  Since it is a relatively small light anyway, it would be nice to have it offered in a AA version for people want who total versatility.  But this is a small complaint.  Newer battery sizers as well as rechargeable batteries are becoming more common, so most will be able to adjust.

"This is a very nice armband case for a truly excellent price (many competitors cost twice this much or more).  I consider this case to have all the essential features for use in such activities as running, hiking, exercising, or walking around all day (if you want your phone on your arm), but it has two shortcomings that I explain at the end.  First the good:► The case itself is a nice, flexible, durable silicone rubber that holds the phone snugly and feels comfortable on the arm.  Because it's so flexible, it's easy to get the phone in and out, but at the same time it holds it securely.  I have done a lot of running with this case, wearing it on my upper arm, and it has worked great.► The band is equally good -- and this matters just as much.  It is basically a giant strap of elastic, but the material is softish and absorbs sweat pretty well, so it stays comfortable even while exercising.  The Velcro is REALLY strong: there should be no problems with it coming unattached.  The strap also has a lot of adjustment room.  You can cinch it really tight, or you can let out a lot of strap for big arms.  Well done Mediabridge.► There is, thankfully, a headphone jack at the bottom of the case for those of us who wear headphones while exercising.Now for the two things that I think could be improved.  First, most importantly, the top of the case covers the light sensor on the phone, which in turn affects the brightness of your screen.  At first, I thought this would be a problem.  Since the case covers the sensor, the screen gets dim, but the phone is usually used on the armband when outdoors where it is bright.  To fix this problem, just go into your phone settings, click ""Display and Brightness,"" turn off ""auto brightness,"" and turn up the brightness manually with the sliding bar.  It's really easy.  Just have to do it real quick each time using the case.The second thing that could be improved are the button covers for volume and screen on/off (on right side).  There ARE little raised pieces of rubber to help you find the buttons, and these actually work correctly, but when running with sweaty hands or when trying to move quickly, it's kind of hard to feel where the button is through the tiny raised button covers on the case.  This is a small complaint, but more prominent, or perhaps textured, button covers would be nice.These things aside, I think this is a great case.

"These are very nice and useful ice cub trays that work just as advertised.  As explained in the product description, you get two trays with eight molds each, for a total of 16 cubes.  For only $11, this is a really good price.  The trays are advertised especially for whisky and other alcoholic drinks, and I use them this way myself, but they are also great for a glass of water and seem to last longer than lots of small cubes.  One other positive point about using these for whisky.  A single large cube works much better than multiple small cubes.  Why?  Because it melts slower and prevents your whisky from getting watered down too fast.The material is a flexible rubber that makes it easy to pop the ice out when it's ready.  My only complaint (and it's a small one) is that I wish there was some kind of rigid plastic frame on the bottom to keep the tray from flopping.  The same flexible rubber that makes the cubes easy to pop out also means you have to exercise a bit of care when they are full of water, or else the tray will flop and spill a little.  Just place your hands firmly underneath as you slide it into the freezer and it will be fine.  A rigid piece on the bottom might prevent this from happening while also allowing the cube molds to be soft rubber.  Other than that, I love the tray.Overall this is a very excellent product and I highly recommend.  Great for whisky, great for glasses of water, great in general.  My visitors always remark on the cool big ice cubes I serve them.I received a free product in exchange for an honest and impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28QVMAY6DBCKK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R03ZCZS#wasThisHelpful","R28QVMAY6DBCKK","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sugar and Slaves is a study of the English planter class in the West Indies during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries.  It fills a void in seventeenth-century English history that is crucial to understanding the origins of the British Empire.  The book is divided into two parts.  In the first half he deals with the establishment of the English West Indian colonies of St. Christopher (1624), Barbados (1627), Nevis (1628), Montserrat and Antigua (1630s), and Jamaica (1655).  He then discusses the subsequent histories of each island in the seventeenth century by drawing upon travelers’ accounts, demographic records, inventories, land patents, maps, and plantation records.  In the second part of the book he uses the material topically to discuss in sequence the themes of sugar, slaves, life, and death in the islands.  His purpose is to answer three complementary questions: how did English planters in the West Indies respond to the novelty of life in the tropics?  to the novelty of large-scale sugar production?  and to the novelty of slave labor?His answer to the first question is that white planters found great difficulties coping with heat, exotic flora and fauna, food and drink, disease, hurricanes, and distance from home.  On the whole the English failed to adapt their dietary habits, clothing styles, and architectural preferences to suit the tropical climate.  Mortality was thus frightfully high and by the eighteenth century most planters became absentee owners of plantations that were often dreadfully mismanaged on the ground.  The introduction of sugar production in the 1640s led to the most distinctive transformations of the West Indies.  The high demands of labor for sugar cultivation and refining meant that planters looked increasingly to African slaves rather than indentured European servants.  Barbados, the Leeward Islands, and Jamaica became the first locations of large-scale slavery.  These labor demands, Dunn argues, set the West Indies apart from the North America colonies, despite their similar origins and the similar structure of the plantation economies.  Dunn also suggests that high mortality, unfavorable climate, inappropriate housing, and unfamiliar food made living conditions particularly difficult for the English planters, despite the wealth of sugar growing, and eventually forced the institution of slave labor to develop as an alternative to European indentured servants.  The wealth of the colonies, however, created huge gaps in wealth among white workers, especially the poor, whose mortality rates and living conditions were just as bad as African slaves.Sugar and Slaves is a well written and valuable account of the English West Indies during the seventeenth century.  It is essential reading to all students interested in the origins of the British Empire and the peculiarly strong West Indies sugar lobby that would later play such a profound role in the British parliament in Westminster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R121EF1DU2BBEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807848778#wasThisHelpful","R121EF1DU2BBEX","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Empire Project is a wide-ranging study of the British Empire that surveys the period from 1830 to 1970.  Darwin is widely regarded as one of the leading historians of the British Empire, and this book has been called his life's work and magnum opus.  Describing the British empire as a ‘system’, rather than an ‘empire’ in the traditional sense, allows Darwin to analyze under a single framework both formal and informal empire as well as the full range of Britain’s constitutional, diplomatic, political, commercial, and cultural relationships.  The starting date itself is highly significant and underscores Darwin’s conception of a ‘world-system’.  It is true that by beginning the book in 1830 he omits the early phases of British imperialism.  But the preceding period ‘was less the classical era of British world power than its turbulent pre-history’, Darwin writes, ‘when prevailing conditions remained very uncertain’.  Only in the 1830s and 1840s did favorable conditions converge ‘for the growth of the loose decentralized construct that sustained British world power into the 1940s’ (p.18).  The system that emerged was characterized by the interdependence of its parts, based on four pillars that upheld British power.  British naval and military preeminence held together the strategic points and ensured British access to trade and resources; British commercial strength connected overseas territories to a global trading system centered on Britain; demographic growth provided migrants to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and thereby strengthened Britain’s connection to its settler colonies; and a global network of communication, centered on Britain, facilitated the spread of news, information, and personnel, and allowed Britain to promote the unity of the system.  Because this system was diverse and the power exercised over it was diffuse, Darwin focuses on what he calls ‘imperial politics’ – the ‘almost continual debate over the terms of association by which the various member states (including Britain itself) were bound to the British system’ (p.8).At the heart of Darwin’s study lies a reconsideration of the global context within which the British imperial system existed in the period between 1830 and 1970.  Darwin argues that the British empire, as a global world-system, first expanded and later declined and fell according to the opportunities and challenges presented by geopolitical events occurring around the world, many outside the empire and beyond British control.  Geopolitical change determined the fate of the British world-system in part, he argues, because the empire lacked a master plan and developed instead as a haphazard collection of disparate elements, presided over by London but guided largely by the schemes devised by private enthusiasts (like Cecil Rhodes) and by ‘men on the spot’ whose ambitions for expansion sometimes complemented and sometimes flouted the policy of the British government.  ‘British expansion’, he argues, ‘was driven not by official designs but by the chaotic pluralism of British interests at home and of their agents and allies abroad’ (3).  The success of the British world-system, since it depended upon bringing together its disparate parts, thus required specific conditions – a balance in Europe, a ‘passive’ East Asia, stability in the colonies, a globally competitive British economy, and an unaggressive United States – the absence of which would cause the imperial system to break down.  ‘The key to British power’, Darwin argues, ‘lay in combining the strength of its overseas components with that of the imperial centre, and managing them – not commanding them – through the various linkages of ‘imperial politics’: some persuasive, some coercive, some official, some unofficial’ (13).The international dimension in Darwin’s study holds interest for the present discussion because it attempts to shift the geographical focus from the internal developments of Britain and the colonies – whether formal or informal – to the wider world, and particularly to the regions outside the empire whose developments impinged directly on the fate of the British world-system.  ‘British possessions,’ he writes, are only ‘parts of the larger conglomerate’ (6).  The links between colonial territories and other parts of the system, and the ‘exogenous’ forces of the global environment, exerted a constant pressure on the terms of the British connection.  ‘Their collective effect’, Darwin writes, ‘was to create an “external” arena of extraordinary turbulence before 1900, and of volcano-like chaos in the twentieth century’ (8).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HASGJB7519S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521317894#wasThisHelpful","R9HASGJB7519S","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this solar light a month or two ago and am pleased to report that it works very well.  I placed the light under a tree (but not in shade) so that the light shines upward on the trunk and underneath the tree at night.  Everything about the light was simple to use and simple to set up.  I never even opened the instructions: everything was totally intuitive.  Within five minutes I had this light up and running, and it has worked great ever since.The light consists of two parts when you get the package: the stake, and the light unit with solar panel attached.  Simply stick the stake in the ground, insert the light, adjust the angle as needed, and it's ready to go.  There are fly bolts to adjust angle of the light and solar panel.  Loosen to adjust; tighten to hold things in place.  There is an easy on-off switch and an adjuster for high or low intensity light (I chose low).  It was all super easy.The tree I placed this light under is tall and upright and therefore allows plenty of light to get to the solar panel.  I faced the panel directly south and it seems to get a very strong charge every day.  On the low intensity setting, I find the light still running in the dusk hours of morning.  The only caveat to this is that on one or two super dark, rainy days, the light seemed to get a weak charge.  Even in the early parts of the night, the light was pretty dim.  By morning, it was off.  But, on a normal day, even on a partly cloudy day, it seems to get a charge strong enough to go all night.  The high intensity setting is very bright and might not run all night.  I have avoided using it because it might bother the neighbors.Now for the rain and waterproof issue.  Let me begin by saying that this light can handle rain and keep running.  That said, for some reason, when it rains, the light turns off and usually stays off until everything is dry.  I can't tell if this is because of a tiny leak that shorts the connection, or because of an auto-off feature that turns it off in wet conditions.  At first, when this happened, I was worried that the unit couldn't handle outdoor use.  As it turned out, however, the light bounces back to full strength as soon as it is dry again.  This is good enough for me: it keeps working.  Who cares if it temporarily shuts off in wet conditions.Overall I'm very happy with this light and love the attractive glow it casts in my landscape.  It also adds a measure of security near our back gate.  The price is fair.  So far everything works as advertised.  I will report back if there are any longevity issues, but, to be honest, I don't expect it will have too many problems.  You can always replace the battery when it wears out.I received a free product in exchange for an honest and impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGVMDOLSKE244/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MIZM206#wasThisHelpful","RGVMDOLSKE244","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these lights with the intention of hanging them beneath my pergola as low-key, ambient outdoor lighting for those times when I have friends over in the evenings.  It turns out that this kind of usage is perfect.  The wires on these lights are very thin and therefore probably not the best for using as Christmas lights, since they might not stand abuse quite as well.  But to hang and use occasionally in the same place, they work very well, and the thin wires make them more discreet.  I simply hung them on hooks on the inside bottom of the pergola, ran the cord down the pole, and I can plug them in with an extension cord whenever I need to.The design and workmanship of the lights seems very good.  In any case, they are working great so far.  The color is really unique and attractive.  As seen in the picture, it's kind of an amber color, not ""soft white.""  It casts an orangish/yellowish glow that is very nice.  Definitely reminds me of outdoor seating at a nice pub or restaurant.  This was a welcome relief, since many LED Christmas lights are so blindingly bright that you wouldn't want them for ambient light; but these ""warm white"" lights are perfect.  So far my wires are holding strong.  Even though they are outdoors permanently, they are holding up.  Note well that my lights are NOT in the sun, but are shaded by vines and the pergola structure.  Can't speak to how well they would hold up if exposed to the sun all the time.Finally, I think the price is reasonable.  They cost $20 for 20 feet, but I think that's OK.  You can certainly get LED lights a bit cheaper, but these have the advantage of (1) unique color; and (2) very thin wires that look more attractive when used as decorative lighting (as opposed to Christmas-light stuff).  Even if mine only last a few years, I would still consider it a decent price.  Just think what lightbulbs cost and you can see that these are no half bad at all.Overall five stars for a great product, unique color, and reasonable price.I received a free product in exchange for an honest and impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDNE4A04BEMUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JK4VLP0#wasThisHelpful","RDNE4A04BEMUQ","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Darwin is one of my favorite historians of the British Empire, and this book, one of his first, is an under-appreciated classic in the field.John Darwin’s book is a study of imperial policy in the Middle East during the four years following the end of the First World War, a period that illuminates the spirit of imperial policy over the next several decades.  The region had held fundamental strategic importance to Britain since the early nineteenth century as part of the buffer zone that protected India.  Darwin is keen to correct the once-dominant view that the First World War was a great watershed in imperial history, the prelude to an era in which the rise of colonial nationalism and the decline of economic and military strength forced a gradual retreat from Britain’s former dominance.  According to this interpretation, the weaknesses caused by the war showed themselves in the nationalist movements that Britain faced in Ireland, India, and the Middle East in the four years after 1918.  Resistance to British rule seemed evidence of a coming era of revolution, or at least of radical change, in the relations between colonial powers and indigenous peoples in Africa and Asia.  These new symptoms of imperial weakness were often attributed to the debilitating effects of the Great War on Europe, to the diffusion of the political ideas associated with Woodrow Wilson, and to the influence of revolutionary Bolshevism.Yet, as Darwin shows, there was little evidence that the British deduced from these developments that the structure of their imperial system had become unsafe.  The British Empire had, after all, survived the war with its political structure largely intact, while the same war had served as a graveyard to four rival empires.  It had weathered internal and external strains that proved too much for its competitors.  Above all, at the end of the war, the British Empire displayed a striking capacity for further expansion in Africa and the Middle East.  “In their response to the challenge of Egyptian nationalism and in their estimate of Britain’s strategic necessities in the Middle East, it is possible to see at work some of the most influential assumptions that guided British policymakers in imperial questions up until the cataclysm of the Second World War.""Darwin’s discussion focuses on the official mind – the ideas, thoughts, and motivations of those in London who were charged with the administration of foreign and imperial affairs.  He argues that, after 1918, as in the two previous generations, Britain’s foreign policy was essentially defensive in character, geared not toward expansion but rather to the conservation of her trade and diplomacy that remained centered on India.  The reason for this continuity lay in the economy of effort that was expected of British administrations.  Policymakers could ill afford to ignore the dangers of allowing the burden of empire to press too heavily on the resources of the metropolis.  After 1918 the domestic constraints on British policy were joined by a new aversion to war and by a growing awareness of the fragility of Britain’s economic position in the world.  Conversely, however, ministers were equally hesitant to loosen the bonds of political control where they already existed, especially in regions of the world where British paramountcy had long been regarded as fundamental to the defense of empire.British leaders brought these concerns to their formulation of policy in the Middle East in the four years after 1918.  Disorder and a nationalist uprising in Egypt, and resistance to British rule in Turkey, Persia, and Iraq, forced the British to negotiate a new set of relationships to maintain and strengthen their rule.  The general British policy was one of making political settlements with nationalist and resistance movements for the purpose of creating regional stability, which would exclude foreign challengers and allow Britain to uphold its strategic interests.  Here lies an adaptation of the Robinson and Gallagher thesis of imperial ""collaboration"" with indigenous elites who could strengthen the British position in return for support from the imperial power.  The British policy in Egypt serves to illustrate how such policies were achieved in the crisis after the war.  In Egypt after March 1919, the nationalist uprising had threatened to withdraw local support for alien rule.  The British policy that eventually emerged was one of limited concession to Egyptian nationalist demands, designed to enlist Egyptian cooperation at the minimum risk to imperial interests.  As Darwin explains, “what they sanctioned was not a revolution in Anglo-Egyptian relations but an adjustment; not a general withdrawal of imperial influence but rather its rationalization: the shrugging off of commitments that had become over-extended during the war and which, as Milner had argued, were undermining the real purpose of the British presence.”  The British thus discarded those superfluous elements of their presence that would only raise the political burden of guarding their strategic interest in Egypt.  In the long run, therefore, the crisis in Anglo-Egyptian relations had less ominous consequences than many ministers had feared.  The Allenby Declaration that emerged from the crisis, and which gave greater control to Egyptians, effectively created a political stalemate between the palace and the Wafd that allowed the British both to control political fortunes as well as to exclude foreign competitors.  The essential strategic objectives of British policy were upheld; the costs of achieving them fell to levels far more acceptable to British voters after 1918.Darwin’s study is concerned above all to establish an essential continuity of British policy between the periods before and after the First World War.  Britain’s imperial strategies continued as before.  The motives remained fundamentally the same.  How then should historians interpret the seemingly contradictory policies pursued in the period between 1918 and 1922?  For Darwin the answer lies (somewhat ironically) in the war itself.  It forced Britain to interfere more widely and intensively than ever before in the society and economy of the whole region.  “This great expansion in the imperial presence provoked, after the war, local responses which varied greatly in their character and tempo.”  Simultaneously, the change of domestic British politics compelled ministers to reduce the scope of their strategic and military ambitions, and to therefore rely more greatly on local support.  In sum, as Darwin explains: ""The problem that tormented the policy-makers was not, in their view at least, whether the imperial system could survive, nor even how best to prepare for its gradual enfeeblement.  It was the more immediate problem of how to contain the side-effects of the war on the internal and international security of the imperial system.  All their solutions, whether in Egypt or the Middle East, assumed the necessity of preserving the Empire.""  Or, to put the matter another way, it was an attempt by policymakers to ease the costs and burdens of empire after a phase of extraordinary effort, and to give Britain more room for maneuver in its dealings with both colonial politicians and their own domestic opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SF1KJ3VKG0WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312097360#wasThisHelpful","R1SF1KJ3VKG0WM","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic water bottle for kids, with a slightly complicated spout/straw design.  I give it 4.5 stars overall.  The best feature is the nifty, mechanical spout, which snaps down closed and is opened with the teal button on the front.  My 21-month-old daughter loves playing with the spout and laughs every time it snaps open.  The design works well, mechanically speaking.  The only problem is that, like many Contigo products, the design is complicated and difficult to clean.  I would recommend that you use it with water only.  Milk or juice could be really hard to clean out of the crevices.The bottle itself is great quality and is BPA free.  The lid unit is fairly heavy duty.  One major difference between this bottle and, say, a Camelbak, is that the straw is hard: you don't bite down to open it, but rather suck water through it like a straw.  We love the design, too.  Overall we're very pleased with this bottle and will keep it in mind for future purchases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275SGK030DHZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TLNXCLQ#wasThisHelpful","R275SGK030DHZK","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a useful, attractive guidebook printed in all color with many attractive maps and photographs.  It basically gives an overview of the whole state, highlighting the most popular and acclaimed tourist attractions.  If you are looking for a guidebook to ""secret"" or hideaway places, this is not it.  This is the one-stop, single-volume guidebook for people who want to buy a single book and use it to hit the top sites in one trip.I picked up a copy to plan for an upcoming trip and have found it to be a very well-done guidebook, better than many others I have used for different places.  I have already made an extensive itinerary from this book alone.  When I showed it to my mother-in-law, who has been to Alaska multiple times, she agreed that I have been getting good advice!So how does it work?  This travel guide covers the whole of Alaska and is divided by region.  This means that no one place has lots and lots of detail, but pretty much every part of the state is covered.  For example, it has regions on ""Juneau and the Southeast,"" the Anchorage area, Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, Denali and the Interior, Arctic Alaska, and so on.  Each individual place has a number of key cities or sites -- sometimes over a dozen -- worth visiting.  This has really helped planning because it means that you can plan all the sites to visit in one place before moving to the next and repeating the process.  The sections on individual cities and places have about the right amount of detail.  They give you the essentials, recommend certain hotels/lodges, and provide a little extra detail here and there.  Some might complain that there is not enough detail.  But the nice thing about the travel guide is that, once this book has pointed you in the direction of a key site, you can look up more online.  I find it handy for this reason alone.There are also a number of other sections on other things.  For example, the book recommends the best hikes and paddles, explains other popular outdoor activities, makes recommendations for traveling with children, and even offers sample itineraries that can be modified as needed.  Along the way it throws in sections on Alaska history, brief notes on wildlife and nature, and explanations of the landscape.  Again, these sections are rather thin (they have to be to keep the book reasonably short), but they give you just enough.  There is another section that explains different ways of getting around.  Best of all, there are nice guides to budgets and costs to help you find the price range you desire.The photographs and maps are beautiful -- ""luscious"" is the word I told my wife.  They are rich and bold.  They make you want to go there.  Even a native would probably find this to be an attractive and useful book.One of the nice things about all Lonely Planet travel guides is that they cater to middle-class people, like me.  This is not the guidebook I would purchase if I wanted to backpack Alaska like a gypsy.  Nor is it really aimed at rich travelers.  It seems to be aimed especially at middle-class Americans who have a decent budget for their trip but who are still budget conscious.  It would be great for college kids taking a trip, honeymooners, young professionals, or even families.  The book makes efforts to show different price ranges of hotels and excursions to help you tailor the trip to your budget.  As far as I can tell, the recommendations for hotels and pricing is all pretty up-to-date and reliable.  Glad that this is a new issue for 2015.Overall, I highly recommend this guidebook and look forward to using it more during my upcoming trip!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10U9HST3LHVV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1742206026#wasThisHelpful","R10U9HST3LHVV3","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like other products from Winkine, I'm very happy with this backpack.  It has a cool, retro appeal, comes at a fair price, and has a style that will work for a lot of different uses and settings.  The first thing I thought when opening it is that it kind of looks and works like a rucksack.  The bag has one main pocket that's perfect for books or a laptop.  The bottom is flat, making it better able to carry papers and books without bending pages or smashing fragile items.  It also has a number of smaller pockets.  There are two smallish pockets on the sides to hold water bottles or small items, a small zippered inner pocket (perfect for phones, pens, or other small items), and mid-sized outer pocket on the front that measures about 7x10 inches.  One of the most unique features is the top flat that closes the main pocket.  As you can see in the pics, the zippers run down the sides, and the flap attaches with velcro.  I think this adds special appeal, but it also has a small downside -- namely, that you cannot fully seal the main pocket.  This is my reason for 4 stars.  It's not a bad design, necessarily, and in fact it is kind of cool, but I realize that many buyers will want a main pocket that completely seals, whereas this one has zippers that partially close and a velcro that attaches.Beyond this, the bag seems well constructed.  It is made of a fairly heavy canvas material.  The straps are simple but sturdy.  It has a funny smell when you first open it, but this fades within a few weeks.  Overall I think this is a very nice and unique bag for a good price.

"I got this food for my English Springer Spaniel.  He always provides a litmus test for dog foods.  He has severe food allergies and gets bad reactions to (almost) any food that is not grain-free.  Even some grain-free choices have caused rashes and itching.  So far he has done very well on this food.  He also likes the taste and shows other signs of good health (although it's admittedly hard to tell much difference after one small bag).  I always stop on over to DogFoodAdvisor and see what they have to say.  This food scores pretty high, a rare 4.5 stars out of 5, putting it up there with the most expensive grain-free foods (obviously where it belongs!).

There are very few ""bad"" ingredients.The only real downside to this dog food is that it costs a lot.  $67 for a mere 24 pounds puts it among the most expensive dog food I have ever fed to my dogs.

"If you're chuckling about the title of my review and wondering why I give this ball 4 stars anyway, it's because the ball itself is pretty nice.  It's constructed of durable rubber.  The ball has a lot more soft, rubbery ""give"" to it than comparable products by Kong and other brands, and this makes it a better option for playing fetch, because it won't hurt the dog's teeth.  So far, neither of my spaniels have managed to damage the rubber.  That's surprising: one of them is good at picking off little bits of tough toys with her fangs.  Another advantage over traditional tennis balls is that it's rubber and therefore easy to clean compared to a cloth ball.  And the price is great, in my opinion.But yeah, the squeaker.  Man the squeaker.  It is so loud and so annoying that we couldn't stop laughing -- the kind of half-mad, half-amused laugh you only experience when something is so annoying that it's funny.  The sound was so incredible that it sounded like one squeaking rabbit was laughing about another squeaking rabbit that was dying.  Anyway, the squeaker quit working about 15 minutes after it left the packaging.  My dog is not even a strong chewer: he's kind of a pansy and takes hours to get through an edible rawhide bone.  But he destroyed the squeaker in 10 or 15 minutes.  Buy this as a nice rubber ball for a good price (not expecting a squeaker), and you'll be happy.

"The Exploitation of East Africa is the third volume in Reginald Coupland’s study of East Africa in the nineteenth century.  It arose out of his earlier research, first on East Africa prior to European contact, and then on Sir John Kirk, a member of the Zambezi expedition under David Livingstone’s leadership.  This is a well-written and compelling study that still commands attention despite being seventy years old.The first part of the book deals with the ending of the slave trade in East Africa, the principal object of British policy, Coupland writes.  Here, as elsewhere, Britain worked through local rulers.  He argues that history must award the honor for the final overthrow of slavery to Livingstone, who did the most to inspire the attack on slavery, and John Kirk, who did the most to carry it through.  And a measure of credit is due also to Barghash bin-Said, the Sultan of Zanzibar, who cooperated (partly against his own wishes as well as those of his counselors) because he had no other choice but to accept British paramountcy if he wanted to retain his position.  The three men faced great obstacles in their task.  Slavery was deeply rooted in Arab culture and preeminence in Africa; the well being of Arab rulers depended on the maintenance of slavery; and ending the slave trade entailed the loss of their biggest source of revenue and, by flouting the Arab tradition in favor of slavery, it antagonized bin-Said’s subjects and united opposition against him.  But there was no alternative in the minds of British policymakers, and the Sultan accepted an extensive treaty obtained in 1873.  On the basis of these agreements, the territorial integrity of Zanzibar became the cornerstone of British policy.Behind these three men lay the power of Britain and the “will of the people of England,” which “dictates the line action.”  The long campaign against the slave trade reached a new phase when Livingstone and other explorers revealed the facts to the world during the great period of East African exploration, 1856-1873.  The British people responded and ended the slave trade -- an assessment that is putting a positive spin on a complex process.  “It was the only real service,” Coupland writes, “apart from sporadic missionary efforts on the coast, which any of the peoples of Europe, Asia and America had yet done to the people of Africa, and it was a service of immeasurable value.”  Thus, after Livingstone revealed the facts, after the British people responded, it was the task of John Kirk to present Britain’s case to the court at Zanzibar and to convince the Arab rulers there to cooperate in ending African slavery.The second part of the book deals with the International Scramble.  Coupland argues that Britain had no territorial designs for East Africa.  This was the age of laissez-faire and anti-imperialism, when few people considered colonial possessions desirable for the British government.  British policy was driven by a desire to support and strengthen the Sultan’s authority.  The difficulties of so doing, which owed partly to the Sultan’s diffuse power in the interior, led the British to contemplate different schemes for controlling the territory, but no action was taken to annex East Africa despite the manifold opportunities for doing so.  What initiatives arose were the result of fear of German encroachment.  By 1884 the last chance had been lost and Bismarck had brought Germany onto the scene.  When Bismarck took advantage of the defeat of General Gordon in the Sudan by claiming territory, Britain refused to respond for fear of provoking a quarrel with Germany over a territory of negligible significance.  Thus in the partition of Africa the larger part of East Africa went to Germany, while British policy, slowly built up over the previous decade, had collapsed entirely.This is a classic work in the history of Britain's empire in Africa.  It is written with a degree of skill and eloquence that is rarely encountered today.  Although Coupland takes a favorable, paternalistic, and forgiving view of Britain's imperial ""mission,"" he at least makes the case with sensitivity.  In retrospect, most historians will agree that he cleared the way for much fruitful debate over the nature and causes of the events described in this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MGGFVJHM39E6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0571084060#wasThisHelpful","R3MGGFVJHM39E6","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Malcolm Hailey, who lived 97 years from 1872 to 1969, was the greatest colonial civil servant of his generation.  He was born in Buckinghamshire, educated in London and at Oxford, and began his career in the Indian Civil Service after placing third in the examinations.  He was often remembered in later years for his role writing the famed African Survey, but the greater part of his career – indeed, the more successful part – was spent in India, where he developed conservative, paternalistic attitudes which identified with peasants and small landowners against urban-educated elites, Hindu moneylenders, and the laissez-faire judgments of English courts in enforcing land enclosures.His formative experience as a colonial servant was as the first colonization officer in Shahpur district, where he helped build several large-scale irrigation projects and caught plague in the process.  In 1907 he began working for Indian’s finance department.  “There he demonstrated the qualities that would make him a first-class administrator,” Cell writes: “an apparently unlimited appetite for work, the ability to handle massive quantities of detail without losing sight of the main points, coolness under pressure, and willingness to delegate.”  Later he wrote the main report on General Dyer’s infamous massacre in Amritsar in 1919.  In 1922 he moved to the Home Office where he held the task of responding to the challenge of Indian nationalism.  Two governorships followed.  The first was in the Punjab, until 1928, where he presided over the concluding phase of the conflict with the reformist party among the Sikhs.  In 1928 he became governor of the United Provinces, often regarded as the highest position for a civil servant in India.  Then came his Africa service, dominated by his involvement in the African Survey.  Hailey’s task of writing a report – first intended to be brief and readable, and then to be thorough and exhaustive – caused a breakdown in his health and almost killed him.  His inability to finish the project was covered up to save face, both for Hailey and the Survey, but his reputation was solidified as an expert on Africa and he was often consulted about African affairs thereafter, though he remained peripheral to official thinking.His career as a whole spanned the era of the new imperialism, and this gives him lasting importance -- indeed this is the premise of the book.  He was born the same year as Benjamin Disraeli’s Crystal Palace speech, often cited as the dawn of the new imperialism, and he died in 1969, after the empire had passed.  “By the time of his retirement from India in 1934 Hailey was regarded as the twentieth century’s most distinguished civil servant.  He was not so much a great Africanist as a great man who devoted his last quarter century to Africa.”  “His entire career,” Cell writes in the ODNB, “like that of the empire he served, can be regarded as a series of gradual and reasonably well-prepared retreats, across decades and continents, before the insurgent, ultimately irresistible force of Asian and then African nationalism.”  Ideologically he was an imperialist to the end, but in practice he served intelligently, shrewdly, rationally, and humanely (on the whole).  He was a tall, grand, austere figure with a long beaked nose and a deep bass voice: one Indian boy who saw him riding in Lahore remarked that this was a man who was born to rule.  He was, indeed, seriously, even obsessively, devoted to his work.  “He was the embodiment of the so-called Protestant work ethic.  Brilliant, quick, with a mind able to go to the heart of complex problems while keeping in touch with massive amounts of detail, as a worker he was phenomenal.  As he grew older, however, the need to work, the dread of being idle even for a minute, became truly obsessive, as though he feared that if the machine ever stopped it would fall apart completely.”The book as a whole is very good and does well in putting together his life and influence against the obstacle of his uncooperative family, which refuses to allow historians to access his personal papers.  Its only shortcoming is that it lacks a conclusion in which to bring together the various strands of his life, to provide an assessment, and to comment on his greater significance to the history of British imperialism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXB41DIX0HRS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0521411076#wasThisHelpful","RXB41DIX0HRS2","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thomas Babington Macaulay, born in Leicestershire in 1800, was the greatest of all the English Whig historians.  Macaulay was the son of an anti-slavery advocate, Zachary Macaulay.  He was educated at Cambridge University, where he began in 1818, and during the course of his time there he became interested in the utilitarian philosophy being developed by such thinkers as Jeremy Bentham and Joseph Priestley.  After some early success as a writer, he was elected to Parliament in 1830.  He later served as a member of the Supreme Council of the East India Company from 1834 to 1838, during which time he reformed the educational system and, almost single-handedly, composed a legal code for the whole of India.  After returning to England he became successively Secretary of War (1839-41), Paymaster of the forces (1846-47), an again a Member of Parliament (1839-47, 1852-56).  He quickly established a reputation as a distinguished orator and formidable politician.  He was raised to the peerage in 1857 as Baron Macaulay of Rothley.During the interim, he composed his five-volume The History of England from the Accession of James the Second.  The book was an astounding achievement that secured Macaulay’s reputation as a great thinker.  It established history as a branch of great literature.  Macaulay’s principal contribution to the world of letters was to articulate the idea of progress, particularly as it pertained to England.  “The history of England,” he famously wrote, “is emphatically the history of progress.  It is the history of a constant movement of a great society.”  Or, to choose another comment he made about the outcome of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, “the history of our country… is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.”  The book became immensely popular in both England and Europe, selling 26,000 copies in 10 weeks.  It was translated into German, Polish, Danish, Swedish, Italian, French, Dutch, Spanish, Hungarian, Russian, Bohemian, and Persian.John Clive’s contribution to scholarship on the great Whig historian is to examine Macaulay’s early life and career.  The biography, in fact, ends before the publication of The History of England and does not attempt to examine the “Eminent Victorian.”  The subject is rather, as Clive explains, “the outsider, the ‘parvenu’ (as he once called himself) – awkward, ugly, impecunious – who by sheer talent and energy won the respect of the Whigs, and a seat in the cabinet before the age of forty…  Its aim is to trace some of the forces – familial, intellectual, political, and personal – which helped to shape the man and the historian.”  This is an admirable spin on the scope of his subject, but Clive would do well to bring the story full circle.  I know many reasons desire it.Perhaps the most valuable part of Clive’s biography is the Epilogue, in which he attempts to adjudge Macaulay’s legacy.  The key to Macaulay’s thought, Clive explains, lies in his emphasis on human progress.  Macaulay believed that the science of government, like all other sciences, was in a state of progression.  The job of the historian is to chart and to explain that progress.  Yet this common view of Macaulay is not complete.  Clive explains that, for Macaulay, progress could be interrupted, sometimes for centuries.  He further contrasted the progress of the ancient philosophers (progress of the mind) with the progress of “fruit” achieved by practical men like Francis Bacon.  He was an enigma in his religious beliefs as well.  He continued to live a life of temperance long after he gave up his Christianity intellectually.  He believed in the forces of progress – the French and Industrial Revolutions – but also believed that society progressed in stages that should not be rushed or accelerated lest the country be lost to radical initiatives or violent disorder.  He was often tempestuous in public and lacked grace with his peers, far from the ideal of the Whig aristocracy that he so often touted; and the smooth eloquence of thought that he projected outward – whether in Parliament, the press, or in his monumental works – masked a deep inner struggle that was rooted in his childhood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MZ836XOBJOTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394472780#wasThisHelpful","R1MZ836XOBJOTP","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book examines the work of a group of well-born women in Edwardian Britain who formed women’s societies to promote the values of imperialism.  These women founded the Girls’ Friendly Society, the Victoria League, the Primrose League, and the British Women’s Emigration Society.  At the core of the philosophy of this women’s empire league was the idea that women held a role complementary to that of men in working within the British Empire.  They were to extend the womanly role of nurturing by undertaking practical philanthropy and good works.  For this reason Edwardian women, like their more-well known male counterparts, held many assumptions about race and colonial capacities rooted in the imperial mentality.  Women’s empire leagues promoted their actions in the fields of education, emigration, and propaganda to promote imperial unity by establishing British standards of conduct in the dominions and colonies, especially in South Africa which, as Bush points out, provided one of the earliest opportunities for women to become involved in travel, propaganda, and relief work on behalf of imperial interests.  Though the leaders of women’s empire leagues were divided over issues of women’s suffrage, and while many supported traditional political concerns, they believed that imperialism transcended their differences and provided a means of involving women in the political issues of the age.The individual chapters deal with a whole range of issues in which Edwardian women became involved: the relationship between society life, upper-class feminine influence, and male politics; the association between female-led organizations and their male counterparts; the place of women’s imperial work within the already well-established networks of female philanthropy; the creation of a gendered imperial vision in which male and female roles were complementary; the relationship between the various imperialist societies and women in the empire; the centrality of education and propaganda to their missions; and the relationship between female emigration and imperial work, and contemporary debates about women’s employment, marriage, family duties, suffrage, and wider feminist politics.Participants in the women’s empire leagues also came primarily from the aristocracy and the upper middle class in Britain.  Their social rank strengthened the maternalistic impulse already evident in many of their activities.  They also shared upper-class social values, an appreciation of social rank and hierarchy, a deep belief in the privileges and responsibilities of race identity, a corresponding certitude about what other, less favored races needed, and a conviction that as women they had a special imperial contribution to make in matters of education and emigration.  The preoccupations of these elite women led them to establish large separatist associations dedicated to giving ruling-class women a platform for their talents and the means of extending and defending what they believed to be women’s special interest in the empire.The book also has a larger historiographical purpose.  Bush, who follows the lead of Antoinette Burton’s Burdens of History, contends that British social history and imperial history should not occupy separate fields of enquiry.  As such her book challenges both the lack of attention to race and imperial issues in much mainstream women’s history, as well as the masculine tendencies of imperial history, which tends to focus on policymakers, “men on the spot,” and the activities of other male agents of expansion.  In Bush’s account the empire not only provided an arena for social action – whether as travelers, philanthropists, emigrants, writers, or teachers – but also informed and gave shape to their domestic lives, including the political campaign for women’s suffrage and the understandings of womanly duty within the empire.  This book adds considerably to the effort to bring women into the mainstream of historical assessments that seek to show the role of women in building an integrated empire based on British standards and values during the Edwardian age.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZKLKQY0I1DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=071850061X#wasThisHelpful","R3TZKLKQY0I1DR","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been a fan of Aveeno lotion.  I usually buy the ""daily moisturizing"" for myself, the ""baby"" kind for my daughter, and some fancy smelling kind for my wife.  I find that Aveeno is the best of the mass-market lotions for a reasonable price.  I decided to try this new ""sheer hydration"" variation of their standard lotion to see how it worked.  The bottle says it absorbs in seconds and leaves a powder-like feel.  What did I find?  The lotion itself works fantastic and is much better on the hands than most other kinds.  It also does absorb pretty quickly.  As for the powder-like feel, I would say not so much.  I was hoping for a lotion that would completely absorb and leave no residue or lotion feeling of any kind.  I typically use lotion after working in the yard and then coming back to my desk to type: I want something that will eliminate the dryness without creating a greasy mess on my keyboard.  This lotion is not *greasy* per se, but it does leave a slight lotion-y residue that takes a while to fade.  So, 4 stars out of 5.

"This book is a work of synthesis drawn from secondary sources that attempts to describe the eighteenth-century empire in the context of historical scholarship that has typically been applied to later periods.  In particular, he writes, it attempts to examine “gentlemanly capitalism” in its eighteenth-century context.  Bowen’s aim is to identify common elements in the expansion of empire by synthesizing work on North America, the Caribbean, and East Indian affairs with the metropolitan British historiography that has often neglected the role and impact of the overseas empire.  The role of British elites, both in Britain and abroad, provides the unifying theme.  “British landowners, merchants, and financiers developed colonial economic interests and a strong imperialist consciousness,” and their role was often reinforced and legitimized by adherence to a common set of cultural values and assumptions.The author identifies three main kinds of elites: a political elite dominated by the landowning classes; a mercantile elite, which supervised and directed the growth of overseas trade; and a financial elite, based in the City, which provided much of the capital and resources to support the state as well as enterprise at home and abroad.  The attitudes, decisions, and resources of these elites “played a key role in helping to define some of the main characteristics of British imperialism in the eighteenth century.”  The elites of which Bowen speaks thus appear more diverse and less unified than the “gentlemanly capitalism” thesis allows.  “The empire in its financial context,” he argues, “should not be seen as being shaped solely by the needs of the City and investors located in the south of England” (100).  Cain and Hopkins thus place too much emphasis on the metropolis, and they ignore the influence of the elites in overseas territories who often maintained strong connections with Britain.  “Very few metropolitan investors were able to, or even wanted to, exercise direct influence on the pace and direction of overseas expansion” (100).  British elites came from different backgrounds.  They lived and worked in different parts of Britain (especially in Scotland) and the empire (especially India and North America).  Their influence as elites often drew upon different sources of wealth (whether financial, commercial, or industrial), power (whether political or military), and social rank (whether from the aristocratic class or from a merchant family with the appropriate trading connections).  But they were generally united by their common interest in supporting the extension of British trade and empire overseas.Bowen’s study, as a work of synthesis, includes an astute and careful discussion of how his ideas fit within the existing historiography.  Several of the more important contributions are as follows.  First, he follows the trend of other scholars, notably Bayly and Brewer, in emphasizing the “financial revolution” of 1688 and the emergence thereafter of the administrative and military structures that characterized the centralized government of the eighteenth century.  Second, he argues that Cain and Hopkins underestimate the importance of the Industrial Revolution, which “helped to increase consumption rates of goods and this played an important part in sustaining Britain’s position in the wider world” (39).  Third, he seeks to correct the imbalance created by the tendency among historians of British North America to pursue lines of enquiry that have rarely been applied to the West Indies much less the Indian empire, which is often assumed to be an “exceptional” case.  These narrow specializations have precluded an assessment for the eighteenth century of the general causes of imperial expansion.  Even Cain and Hopkins remarked in British Imperialism that “no acceptable interpretation of eighteenth-century imperialism” exists.  Bowen seeks to correct the national and regional focuses of historians by analyzing colonial territories comparatively within the context of the British elite that benefited from, and often guided, the course of overseas expansion.  In so doing, he applies to the whole empire the ideas of transnational and comparative international history that have been developed for different parts of the empire.  Scholars of colonial North America have developed “Atlantic history” and have emphasized the cultural, economic, and even political connections between the core and the periphery.  The British equivalent, pioneered by J.A. Pocock and made popular by Linda Colley, has emphasized the role of the empire in first creating and then sustaining the connections between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.  Bowen extends these themes to the eighteenth-century empire and seeks to analyze comparatively the role of elites as well as the expansion of empire in Britain, North America, and India.Bowen’s concluding section discusses the general crisis of empire after 1760.  He argues that an important shift occurred in which elites began to reappraise their position within the empire and thus their very loyalty to the empire itself.  This development occurred as the result of the attempt to forge a new imperial order based on greater metropolitan control.  It met with “mixed results.”  In North America it led to an ultimately successful resistance movement that cost Britain its most important colony.  In India it helped to solidify Company rule and placed British elites at the center of the revenue-collecting system that had existed under local conditions.  Nevertheless, despite the trauma of losing a colony, this imperial crisis did not lead to the emergence of radically different ideas and assumptions about empire.  “Instead,” Bowen argues, “lines of development that had become clear in the 1760s were extended and sharpened in the new conditions that prevailed during the 1780s and 1790s” (194).  The attempt to assert government authority became stronger.  This “represented one of the most important continuities during the period between 1760 and 1820,” the other being the growth and diversification of British business activity in the wider world.  The result was that the British Empire continued to expand after the loss of the American colonies, spurred by the incorporation of new groups into the ruling elite.  “Part of the empire might have collapsed, but the metropolitan elites who had established the original structure would now set about using the same foundations and many of the same basic materials to build a new and rather different imperial edifice” (196).In sum, this is a well written and generally compelling study of eighteenth century imperialism that asks important questions, and provides several provisional answers, on important issues concerning the nature and causes of Britain’s imperial expansion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVDRVQ3JF2ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0333622081#wasThisHelpful","R2AVDRVQ3JF2ZA","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Making Peoples is a survey of New Zealand from the eleventh century to the end of the nineteenth century. It covers Polynesian settlement and its development into the Maori tribes between the eleventh and eighteenth centuries, the encounter between the Maori and Europeans from the seventeenth century, and the foundation between the 1830s and 1880s of the “Pakeha” society, the Europeans who settled in New Zealand and maintained mostly European culture and traditions. In tracing this history, Belich seeks to show that New Zealand is a “historian’s paradise: a laboratory whose isolation, size, and “recency” [sic] is an advantage, in which grand themes of world history are often played out more rapidly, more separately, and therefore more discernibly, than elsewhere.Much of the novelty of Belich’s study derives from his attempt to interpret New Zealand history as the product of two of the world’s great colonizers, the British and the Polynesians. He argues that historians of the subject have focused too much on whether a new society, like New Zealand, was shaped most by “fragment” (the time and place from which most early migrants came) or “frontier” (the new environment, rich with opportunity). Were newly settled territories shaped by the social context of the metropolitan society from which migrants came? Or by the peculiar nature of the frontier, the peoples that settlers encountered, and the particular challenges that settlers faced in building a new society? Belich argues that it is equally, perhaps more, important to consider the “ethos of expansion” – the assumptions, hopes, and fears of the colonists – which helped trigger colonization, determined its direction and form, and influenced its development in the new land.Belich discusses early Maori history in the first part of the book. He argues that European ethnography was wrong to assume that non-European people were static and un-changing. Polynesian peoples were highly diverse and very adaptable, and their expansion into the islands of New Zealand was driven by the search for resources to sustain a complex society based on hunting and “gardening.” He also argues that, around the fifteenth century, New Zealand experienced a crisis in which the extinction of big game caused a transformation of Maori society, economic, politics, and warfare. These changes created the foundations of the society that would encounter the arrival of Europeans in the eighteenth century.In the second part of the book, “Contact and Empire,” Belich describes the first encounter between the Maori and European (mostly British) settlers. He underlines Maori agency in particular. The Maori showed adaptation and resistance to a whole variety of changes created by European arrival. A Maori “state” failed to emerge, but cohesion of Maori tribes was sufficient by 1840 to preserve some measure of autonomy and tribal rights in the face of rapid European settlement. The Treaty of Waitangi, which recognized Maori land claims and conferred upon the Maori rights as British subjects, represented one of the early Maori successes in adapting within a political system dominated by British colonists. The Maori later showed adaptability in military affairs. Evidence now suggests that the Maori became the first to use trench warfare as a means of countering (and avoiding) the challenge of modern, automatic weapons. Finally, in the third part of the book, “Making Pakeha,” Belich describes the creation of New Zealand as a British settler colony with mostly British institutions, habits, customs, and culture. In short, he describes the creation of the Pakeha in much the same way as he described Maori history in earlier parts of the book – their economic activities; their class and social statuses; their ambitions and fears; their beliefs and prejudices; and much else besides. The discussion is a thorough and somewhat unique account of European colonists in New Zealand, though not, for the imperial historian, original enough to warrant any degree of special interest. Its main virtue is that, in describing the development of “British” New Zealand, Belich interweaves the role and fortunes of the Maori people who both adapted and resisted according to the needs of the time.On the whole, this book shows all the virtues and all the faults of a broad synthesis that attempts to span vast periods of time and take account of multiple interpretations about several different social groups. The discussion is too broad and general for the specialist. It is too historiographical – and, in a sense, too ideological – for the casual reader of New Zealand history. Belich’s particular conclusions will probably fail to please many Maori specialists and “Pakeha” historians of modern New Zealand, as well as some imperial historians. But the value of the book is precisely that its ambitions so grandly attempt to integrate indigenous history with the history of European colonists, and to structure both in a framework of more general imperial interactions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GCI0B1IKUG51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0824825179#wasThisHelpful","R1GCI0B1IKUG51","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Its main virtue is that, in describing the development of “British” New Zealand, Belich interweaves the role and fortunes of the Maori people who both adapted and resisted according to the needs of the time.On the whole, this book shows all the virtues and all the faults of a broad synthesis that attempts to span vast periods of time and take account of multiple interpretations about several different social groups.  The discussion is too broad and general for the specialist.  It is too historiographical – and, in a sense, too ideological – for the casual reader of New Zealand history.  Belich’s particular conclusions will probably fail to please many Maori specialists and “Pakeha” historians of modern New Zealand, as well as some imperial historians.  But the value of the book is precisely that its ambitions so grandly attempt to integrate indigenous history with the history of European colonists, and to structure both in a framework of more general imperial interactions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GK3RBRXQJAL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0824818903#wasThisHelpful","R1GK3RBRXQJAL6","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a good quality light.  It's housed in stout metal, has solid threads (for accessing battery compartment), and includes a charger and 3.7v battery.  Note well: this is NOT a standard flashlight.  It is a UV light and is basically useless as a normal flashlight.  Its purpose is to detect things like forged banknotes, urine stains, harmful chemicals, scorpions (exciting game that would be!), etc.  I personally got it to check for pet stains, and, fortunately, found very few!  The light is super intense.  Do NOT look at the light for long or your eyes will be feeling it seriously.  Also not safe for kids.  But, at the same time, this is a sign that the light is very powerful and therefore has great utility for its intended use.

"For a long time I've wanted a GPS for my bike.  For a long time I've thought it would be SO MUCH better to just use my iPhone instead.  This MountCase came along just in time to save me from wasting my money on a dedicated GPS unit when I already have a phone that does way more and can download multiple apps.  As far as concept goes, this case is fantastic.Fortunately, it's also really nice when it comes to workmanship and features.  The first thing I noticed when opening the packaging is that it appears to be designed *by* bikers, *for* bikers.  The rubbery strap that attaches to the handlebar is made of solid material and is designed like many high-end bike components.  It uses hex screws, which are standard on bikes (meaning any biker would have the tools needed) and provides a solid hold.  There is plenty of adjustability for different sizes of bars.  On top of the strap is a raised piece, about 3/4 inch thick, where the phone snaps on.  This piece has a prominent red button on the side to release the case.  Everything seems very solid on this case.  I am probably one of the few people on this page crazy enough to take my phone on a real mountain-bike trail, but the case held strong and the phone never left its place.  I'm not saying I recommend this, but it worked for me.  Best on the road, definitely, and for commuting.The phone case itself is nice as well.  It consists of two parts.  The part that covers the face of the phone is a clear, rubbery material (including screen cover) that fits snugly around the edges of the phone.  Once you slide the phone into this part of the case, you thin snap it into the black rubbery backing, which attaches straight to the mounting unit on the bike.  The snap-in design, which you attach and remove with an easy twist, is very nice.  The black part of the case has four holes: (1) camera, (2) headphones, (3) power supply, (4) speakers.  With the clear waterproof cover attached, there are two little flaps that snap closed over the headphones and power supply.  Speakers would be covered.Do I have any complaints?  Well, sort of, but they are small ones.  First, the waterproof screen protector is so thick that it's sometimes hard to use (usually not too bad, though).  Secondly, the black part of the case has a protruding bump on the back where it attaches to the connector on the bike, and this makes it bulky and awkward for normal use, so you might want to switch it in and out when you ride, depending on how much it bothers you.  I find it's pretty easy to take the phone in and out because the material is soft and rubbery enough.  I'm speaking after using with an iPhone 6.  The 6 Plus might be harder -- don't know.  Finally, the packaging was a bear to open.  It looks really pretty (hard plastic boxes hooked together -- would be great on a store shelf), but it was hard to open.  Maybe the company could offer ""frustration free"" packaging for online customers, and save the pretty box for bike shops?Overall I think this is a very nice phone mounting kit for the bike and would highly recommend it to friends.  I will probably buy one for my uncle (an avid cyclist) for his b-day.I received a free product in exchange for an honest and impartial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K921SUBV2YGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJBGE7C#wasThisHelpful","R3K921SUBV2YGX","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is fine toothpaste.  Nothing to write home about, but comes pretty much as advertised.  The taste is good, it did not cause any sensitivity for me, and it seems to work well at strengthening enamel and whitening slightly (although that's harder to notice right away).  I always shrug about these whitening toothpastes.  With only a few exceptions, the effect is so negligible that it's almost the same as non-whitening, but I guess it doesn't hurt either.

"I've been thinking about Chris Bayly a lot lately owing to his recent, unexpected death.  He was one of the greatest historians of his generation, able to reach across the continents intellectually as well as personally, connecting Britain, India, and beyond.  He is mostly remembered for his pioneering work on modern India, but this book on the British Empire is one of his greatest works and will be read for many years.David Fieldhouse calls Imperial Meridian “the most important and influential single book published during the last thirty or so years on this hinge between the first European empires established from the fifteenth century and those of the modern period.”  The era between 1780 and 1830 fits uneasily into existing schemes of historical interpretation.  It has often been described as a period of transition from the old mercantilist empires to Britain’s liberal paramountcy in the age of free trade.  Bayly seeks to correct the Whiggish view that the period saw the newly liberal and industrialized West achieving almost casual dominance over a decadent East.  Some decline had occurred in the Asian states, Bayly argues, but nothing significant enough alone to allow European states to overcome them.  Conversely, there was nothing new and nothing particularly liberal about European expansion before 1830.  Rather, European imperial expansion was the outcome of warfare, and of the greed and ambition of public servants and private interests, very seldom the result of economic or political liberalism, as Vincent Harlow had argued.  Bayly describes this phenomenon as a “military-fiscal” empire, made possible by the improvement in efficiency of the British state and its commitment to fighting France.Several themes unite the study.  First, the author discusses European and non-European imperialism using the same sets of concepts.  Secondly, he follows Schumpeter’s line of argument that Britain was a kind of refurbished ancient regime, dominated by a small, agrarian-based ruling class that had never abandoned its authoritarian “atavisms.”  Thirdly, after 1830, the rate of territorial expansion slowed down, financial problems mounted, and the old agrarian ideology gave way to the new forces of liberalism and science.  Bayly divides the history of imperialism into three broad categories.  The first consisted of the Iberian and Dutch conquests of Asia and America from 1520 to 1620.  The second period spans the period from 1760 to 1830, “when European empires first seized substantial territory in south and south-east Asia, raced ahead in north America and Australasia, marked out the near east and southern Africa as spheres of dominance, and brought Atlantic slave system to its peak.”  The third period involves the “new imperialism” after 1870, when most of Africa and a scattered remnant of other territories finally came under imperial rule.  He argues that the period from 1780 to 1830, the one under review in his book, is ultimately most important because it saw the sophisticated and literate cultures of Asia and the Near East fall under European control for the first time.Nevertheless, as Bayly explains, the period from 1760 to 1830 fits ill in the broader theorizing about imperialism, which has been tailored to explain the final push for empire after 1870.  He argues that the best way to understand European expansion between 1760 and 1830 is to put the story in the context of European conflict and rivalry.  The need to finance European armies and preserve fiscal stability drove European states to seek expansion overseas.  A kind of “imperialism of military fiscalism” emerges as the main cause of expansion in Bayly’s study.  He argues accordingly that historians should modify their view that this period saw the beginnings of the imperialism of free trade.  “The dominant ideologies of the imperial projects of the period were informed by its military and aristocratic character.”  The period saw the peak of slavery and slave trade, he argues, both attempts to draw revenue from overseas conquests.  “Military attitudes, military finance, intentions, and structures tied together the fabric of the European empires of this period.”  Moreover, during this period European expansion drove non-European states to create and develop their own empires – it energized local patriotism.  “Lenin and Schumpeter got it right in part.”  But their ideas should be applied to the “second British empire” between 1760 and 1830, not to the present or the future in the later-nineteenth or twentieth centuries.Bayly's study is an original and field-changing contribution and should be read by all students of Europe, Asia, and modern imperialism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9MI3ANCEVPY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0582494389#wasThisHelpful","R9MI3ANCEVPY8","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's much easier to handle and use than a long bottle brush, and it works better than other brushes of a similar design.  The handle is comfortable and well shaped, the bristles are durable but also soft enough to hold soap and clean well, and the brush can even be run through the dishwasher if you want.

"Gregory Barton’s study of empire forestry argues that “imperialism and environmentalism have a shared past” that has been obscured by environmental history’s early development in the American historical context, where it was closely associated with Romanticism and the progressive conservation movement.  Many scholars have therefore considered environmental history to be in the service of the political Left, a radical and subversive field at odds with exploitative capitalism and “imperial science.”  Empire Forestry and the Origins of Environmentalism revises this view by extending the study of environmental history to the nineteenth century and by viewing it from a global perspective that goes beyond the American experience.Barton is able to make this contribution by viewing forest conservation as an early form of environmentalism.  Forest conservation was first implemented on a large scale in India.  The movement began in the first decade of the nineteenth century when British leaders demanded the protection of forests in India to preserve a ready supply of timber for the Royal Navy’s campaign in the Napoleonic Wars.  The forest committee inquiry established to investigate the availability of Indian “teak” revealed surprisingly limited supplies of timber.  The committee delivered a proclamation prohibiting all unauthorized felling of teak trees and declaring all unclaimed lands property of the Crown.  Simultaneously, the British government appointed the first conservator of forests in 1806.Forest conservation efforts lapsed for a generation after the Napoleonic Wars, but by the 1840s British leaders again pursued forest preservation to restore rapidly dwindling timber supplies in India.  The administrative and legal structures that became the Indian Forest Department began under the leadership of James Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie, who served as governor-general from 1848 to 1856.  Under his administration, the East India Company and the British government annexed eight states – in several cases to secure access to natural resources – and extended state ownership and regulation to the whole of British India.  Among the acquisitions were the forests of northern India.  The 1855 “Charter of Indian Forestry” enacted laws to protect the forests from private exploitation by making them the property of the Government, to be properly managed by scientific forestry.  This legal precedent was refined and clarified in a succession of acts over the next half century: the Forest Act of 1865, the Hazara Rules of 1875, and the Land Revenue Settlement of 1893.To return to the connection between empire and environmentalism, it is important to note that while the imperial government often annexed forests for strategic and international reasons, the forest service, according to Barton, generally pursued its aims without regard to the imperial government’s needs for power and revenue.  One must wonder if the forest service pursued conservation for the sake of conservation, or whether forestry in India was simply working in the service of the strategic needs of the imperial government, which in the final analysis held ultimate control over reserving land and financing and staffing the forest service.  Barton’s thesis may also need revision in the light of Richard Groves’s attempt to locate the origins of environmentalism in the eighteenth century.  Despite these two issues, Barton has written an excellent and interesting (if somewhat repetitive) book.  And it is hard indeed to dispute his main point that the “monumental achievement” of forest preservation in India “captured the imagination of the period” and inspired similar conservation movements around the world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2EU89MP8YMV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CJMUCI#wasThisHelpful","RZ2EU89MP8YMV","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short book is less a survey (as the title suggests) than a limited study of how the British government of India sought to control sexual practices in India.  He argues (correctly, on the whole, in my opinion) that British attitudes to race, sex, and class reflected and sustained the structure of power in British India.  Ballhatchet's attempt to substantiate and carry through the argument takes a modest but important step toward the goal.  The core of the book deals mostly with the effort to control the access of British soldiers to Indian prostitutes.  The problem arose because common soldiers could not afford wives and, being young and healthy and of virile body, had sexual impulses that they were apt to satisfy in one way or another.  The military authorities, disturbed by the high incidence of venereal disease, sought to regulate and control prostitution to ensure the health of British soldiers and prevent sexual activities from upsetting relations with the Indian community.  The rationale given was that such policies for the official registration and medical treatment of Indian prostitutes would protect British servicemen from the ravages of uncontrolled venereal disease.  What resulted was a pitched battle over British policy toward prostitution.  Missionaries and the evangelical community opposed the Government’s wish to give license to immoral behavior.  The military authorities, for their part, not only sanctioned prostitution but sought out “attractive” prostitutes to ensure that soldiers would vent their sexual energies within the desired boundaries and thereby prevent the spread of disease and the problems associated with ill health among soldiers.  Ultimately the military prevailed.Later chapters attempt to analyze the themes of social difference and sexual regulation more broadly.  They deal with the variety of sexual encounters across racial lines outside the military.  Mix-raced Eurasians, particularly when they were doctors, must be kept away from European women.  European women must be barred from working as prostitutes or barmaids.  Lady missionaries must keep a distance from Hindu men.  Indian princes must not be allowed to spend too much time in European company or to marry a European woman, lest their familiarity and ease around the “superior” race lead them to lose respect for the ultimate authority of the white race and the Raj.  What policies and attitudes resulted tended to reflect the hardening of racial attitudes in the nineteenth century.That British rule in India was justified by the doctrine of racial superiority and based on maintaining distance between themselves and their Indian subjects has long been well understood.  Ballhatchet analyzes a number of strands of this proposition that have been generally neglected, but, as other reviewers have noted, he makes little use of theory or of other work on these issues, and his book fails to fulfill the ambitions suggested by the title.  What he writes on the hardening of racial attitudes, for example, is much less thorough and developed than even so narrow a study as Thomas Metcalf’s book, The Aftermath of Revolt, which was published sixteen years before.  On the whole, this is an interesting study with a compelling argument that nevertheless fails to live up to its large ambitions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JPK4H70C2OR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312661444#wasThisHelpful","R3JPK4H70C2OR3","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently reviewed a similar doll by the same company (the Tea Party African American doll) and I have many of the same thoughts about this one, but I'm bumping this doll one star higher because it has a few advantages that I'll spell out below.  I have a 20-month-old daughter who is crazy about her baby dolls, which she carries all over the house, sits on chairs and couches, pats and plays with, and tries to put to sleep.  This has become one of her favorites and I think the reasons are aesthetic (she loves the bow, especially, which matches the kind she always wears).  Despite the concept of this doll being great, and despite a generally good design and workmanship, there are a few shortcomings that make this doll fall short of our hopes.► First a word about the general design. This baby doll is made of hard plastic. The main design is that you can pour water into its mouth and it comes out a tiny hole between the legs, simulating a real baby wetting its diaper. My wife said she had heard that this kind of thing is often useful to help toddlers learn that diapers need to be changed when they get wet, on the road to potty training. The dress is made of a nice material and is somewhat water resistant (i.e. doesn't absorb much). The bottles have a feature that makes them turn colors (to pink) if cold water is poured in (refrigerated water works very well, but normal tap water doesn't have much effect). The general appearance and proportions are nice, except for the material (more on that later).► But there are a few shortcomings in the design. The most significant is that it comes with a disposable diaper that presumably must be replaced every time it gets wet. I'm not exactly a stingy or cheap person, but it's a real pain to think that every time my daughter indiscriminately pours a cup of water down this doll's throat, I have to dig out a new clean diaper, at a fairly high cost. If she plays with the doll for hours like I know she would, that would be a lot of diapers! Ultimately, even worse than the diapers being disposable is the fact that the fastener is complete junk. It wore out within 10 minutes of play. We were actually going to let our daughter play with the doll and its diaper without water at first because we knew she would LOVE taking the diaper on and off (which she did! Kudos to Hasbro for that!). But the fastener didn't last. A cloth diaper with a velcro fastener that survives repeated, compulsive on-and-off play by a toddler is what's needed. Change this design flaw and I would instantly raise my rating to 5 stars.  I even tried to find preemie cloth diapers to replace it, but to no avail.  I'm not dishing out fifty cents (yep, that's about what replacements cost) every time water goes down this doll's throat.► There are a few less important design issues that could use some improvement.  I had complained about the headband on the African American doll.  This one doesn't have that problem (falling off and leaving a weird groove).  The molded-on bow is very nice.  My daughter loves it.  Secondly, the cups are less than ideal. I honestly don't know exactly what design they should take, but it's awkward and a bit messy to literally have to ""pour"" water into the babies mouth. Perhaps just a smaller, more controlled spout would do the trick? Third, the hard plastic material makes this a little less appealing to soft young toddler arms and hands. I understand that this needs to be plastic because it is made to withstand water and so on, but I hope Hasbro can improve the design by making it some kind of softish rubber or plastic material instead of the hard stuff it's made of right now. Finally, the leg and arm movements are very stiff and a bit unnatural. The legs are clearly designed to turn up and out to the side, at an angle that facilitates diaper changing, but this also means it can't stand and has weird leg movements. My wife pointed out that any toddler being potty trained (one of the selling points) would be able to stand, but this doll cannot.In general then, we think the concept behind this doll is great and, to be fair, my daughter loves it anyway, but the bad disposable diaper situation and a few other design shortcomings left us a bit disappointed about what could have been the favorite toy in the house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HT08V4S72E0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5COSQG#wasThisHelpful","R1HT08V4S72E0V","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tony Ballantyne’s book is a study of the idea of Aryanism, and of the networks and patterns of cultural exchange through which the idea was developed and disseminated.  Yet while the book is focused on Aryanism as a guiding concept, it is largely concerned with the broader theme of how to understand and conceptualize the British Empire.  Orientalism and Race is one of the first attempts to write a transnational history of the British Empire.  Ballantyne criticizes the tendency of most history “to be organized on the basis of a fixed geographical reference generally congruent with the nation-state.”  He conceives of the empire as a “bundle of relationships,” which brought disparate regions, communities, and individuals into contact through systems of mobility and exchange.  He is equally critical of the “metropolitan” focus of imperial history, as well as the tendency among scholars in Britain’s ex-colonies to write “national” stories without reference to the broader imperial context.  Most of what Ballantyne writes is, in fact, now very familiar to historians of empire.  The idea that Britain and its colonies were bound together by transnational “networks” based upon migration, family connections, trade, literature, language, and communications is now well established.Ballantyne’s principal contribution was to propose these transnational concepts by focusing on the idea of Aryanism.  Ballantyne demonstrates that the popularity of the Aryan idea arose in the British Empire in the nineteenth century as a product of the cultural authority of the Orientalism, which was produced by agents of the East India Company in India itself.  It was not a European idea: it was deeply imbedded in the Vedic tradition.  The Rig Veda, composed in 1500 BCE, first used the term to describe the incursion of tribes of pastoralists who identified themselves as ‘Arya.’  The term thereafter developed a meaning that indicated both a community and cultural sophistication.  The discovery of the idea followed the Company’s rise as a territorial power after 1765, when a new generation of Company employees first learned Sanskrit and began unlocking the mysteries of the Brahmanical tradition.  The “native learning” of such men as Sir William Jones enabled the steady flow of dictionaries, vernacular texts, and translations in European languages.  Jones himself confirmed through his study of language the genetic relationship between Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit, and thus mapped a new interpretation of global history that drew together the pasts of Europe and India.  The term “Aryan” was in turn popularized by Max Muller, whose translation of the Vedas depicted them as a foundation source for the study of “civilization.”  Thereafter the term was used to denote ethnic or racial boundaries, often within Europe more than abroad, thus fortifying both nationalistic and imperialistic ideologies.  Thus it came to be used to mark difference between “civilized” European colonizers and “primitive” native peoples, much in the way that post-colonial scholars have argued in the wake of Edward Said.How has the idea of Aryanism developed?  How did it come to play such an important role in nineteenth-century ideologies of race, particularly as they developed in Germany and culminated in the Nazi regime?  It is here that Ballantyne’s transnational arguments re-enter the story.  The concept of Aryanism, he argues, arose from various places at different times and cannot be centered in a single colony or metropolitan state.  He characterizes the empire as “a series of interwoven archives” that were “fundamentally implicated in the processes of colonialism.”  The author draws upon South Asia, Maori, and other indigenous archives to illustrate the point.  It is necessary, therefore, to conceptualize the British Empire, not as a strict binary between metropole and periphery, but as a “web” that bound together different parts of the empire in an organic whole.  The web metaphor, he writes, ""underscores that the empire was a structure, a complex fabrication fashioned out of a great number of disparate parts that were brought together into a variety of new relationships… The web captures the integrative nature of… cultural traffic, the ways imperial institutions and structures connected disparate points in space into a complex mesh of networks.  Moreover, the image of the web also conveys something of the double nature of the imperial system.  Empires, like webs, were fragile (prone to crisis where important threads are broken or structural nodes destroyed), yet also dynamic, being constantly remade and reconfigured through concerted thought and effort: the image of the web reminds us that empires were not just structures, but processes as well.""These forms of transmission did not merely transect the national boundaries of Britain or the individual colonies of the empire, but also reached out to other states, nations, and imperial systems, collapsing geographical and culture space.It is worth noting in conclusion that Ballantyne’s scholarship was somewhat less prescient in its assessment of the “New British History,” formulated by J.G.A. Pocock, and the “British World” scholarship, which was just gaining momentum in 2002.  Both of these subfields of British and imperial history are now important parts behind much new transnational history written on ""Britain and the world.""  Ballantyne writes that “Britishness itself now promises to engulf the whole empire,” and that “fundamental differences in the demographic, economic and ecological frameworks of the ‘new’ societies prevented the simple re-creation of models inherited from Britain.”  The use of “Britishness” as an organizing concept, he argues, returns to a celebration of Britishness reminiscent of Charles Dilke – an “impoverished” and “reductive” model for the history of multi-ethnic and polygot colonial societies far removed from the United Kingdom.  The imperial historian would now probably judge that Ballantyne misread the directions of historical scholarship: studying the British World is much more sophisticated now than the old ideas of Dilke and Seeley.  The broad consensus seems to be that “British” colonies of settlement could be far-flung and bear striking differences, yet still be bound by close connections and similarities in race, culture, economy, society, language, and political tradition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36C4LZN91OAZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0230507034#wasThisHelpful","R36C4LZN91OAZK","A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NEDIGZZ2ZFT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I originally came across this shirt 4 or 5 years ago in a SAMs Club for 25 bucks.  I bought all they had in XXL.  And found they fit me the way I like.....with tails tucked in and sleeve length.  And this for a 6'2"" 200lb 36 inch waist with athletic build.  I like room to move and I have wide shoulders.  And these fit me comfortably.  I will, more than occasionally, wear them with tails out and feel it looks just fine.  And one of my daughters, a very fashionable wealthy young lady, thinks I look great that way, at least when I was wearing the light blue color.I wear these shirts with and without a Dockers XL tall v-neck cotton Tee.  In summer without a Tee, this shirt is so very comfortable against the skin, oweing to its lightweight and nylon fabric.  But much of the time, going between cooler climates and warmer climates during travels, I'll wear Dri-Fit Tees underneath.This shirt is well made and they show no signs of wear after 4 or 5 years.  But because I have so many of them, I don't really wash them that often.  When I do, I always wash in cold water and let them hang dry at room temperature.  If I'm in a hurry I'll dry them on a very gentle cycle barely dry.  They actually feel better that way from the dryer but I'll still dry them at room temperature because I feel less heating from a dryer is better for the material.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QI9EK9KASHVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R4RE4C#wasThisHelpful","R1QI9EK9KASHVG","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For me, a great travel lens.  Lightweight and 'insanely' sharp.  I'd love the 2.8 but just too heavy for me to want to carry around.  And the fast-focusing of this lens is just incredible.  I find the VR fantastic as well.  I can't say anything new here but I wanted to register my deep satisfaction of this lens.  As a 68 yr old retiree, I have no trouble carrying this lens with my D810 and Nikons vertical battery grip.I use this mostly for travel and landscape.  Portaits of my younger Grandkids when I'm able to keep them reasonably still.  Or when I'm in crowds such as a parade or at county fairs,  Old Home Days.  Right now anyways, I'm flying to Texas every couple months,  and throw this setup in my travel bag with an X100t and a RX100M3 for my pocket.

"I have both this 1.4 and the 1.8.  Though the 1.8 appears to me to be somewhat (but not by much) sharper than the 1.4, that really only applys to my D7200 (and D7100).  But the bokeh on this DX combination with the 1.8 is not nearly as good as the bokeh of the 1.4 with my D810 (a very high resolution camera).So I don't use the 1.8 on my D810.  Using the 1.4 on such a super high resolution camera like the D810, to me, makes more sense.  Otherwise what's the point of having an D810.  The bokeh is incredible.  The subject looks to me to 'pop' out of the background - to separate from the background.

"Believe it or not, I don't think my mouse traps were working anymore.  So I stopped setting the traps and fed the rodents until they became use to feeding on the un-set traps.  Then I set the traps again and immediately caught a one or two of the pests.  But this became a cycle I soon tired of.  Now I don't seem to catch anymore on those traps even though I knew they were up there in the attic because my cat was going nuts on the second floor clawing and whining away at the attic door.Enter this electronic pest zapper.  I was offered the opportunity by the company to try it for an honest review.  Within two days I caught 2 mice.  So I'm very impressed.  And will be ordering a couple more.  These are so much better than the mouse traps I had been using and especially better than those sticky traps (the sticky traps would occasionally 'catch' birds who would haplessly fly into my garage - for which I would then have to make a trip to the veterinarian).I'm having my electrician hard -wire these to the house so I don't have to deal with batteries.  This seems to me to be a more humane way of dealing with these rodents.  And very convenient way of disposal, non-messy and clean.  So far, this is working very well for me and I'm very impressed with this rodent zapper.Customer service seems to be very helpful and concerned for the customer and seems to want to make every effort to ensure a good user experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HH60EPKZF84U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PQJXZIY#wasThisHelpful","R3HH60EPKZF84U","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As far as I am concerned, this lens is another marvel of engineering from Nikon. Beautifully well built solid piece of glass. I'm using it with the Nikon vertical battery grip (and an D810) for portrait stuff with its extra shutter button and additional battery capability. And to help offset the additional weight of the 900 grams of solid glass and metal. Doesn't feel so heavy with this setup, to me anyways. Because the weight seems distributed better and it does give me something more solid to hold on to - and contributes to a more steady feeling in my large hands.For what I want to shoot with this lens - portraits, still lifes - this is going to become my favorite prime. And perhaps, someday, every ones classic if it isn't already. But for sports and action, I will pass using this lens as the AF seems to me, not conducive - or just not fast enough.Because in continuous focus, the AF seems too sluggish to me.  I may try this on my 7200 which will give me a 200mm focal length but I'm not sure about that yet given 200mm is more of a sport length.  I do like the DC, though a very few find it gimmicky, in that, as their argument goes, this kind of blur can be better obtained in PP.  I don't agree, on an entirely creative level, and because I prefer as much SOOC as possible and less time on my computer.  Further - and I guess maybe because of my age - I take a lot of portraits of more mature subjects.  And the DC gives me a way to make softer images (taking away the winkles), in a subtle manner, SOOC.  Though with my grandchildren, I can just fire away at a neutral setting DC because of their winkle-free skin.So that's the way I use, and will continue to use, this lens.  Some may not like DC, or even consider it a throw-back, perhaps even a gimmick, but I like it because it's there - it's an additional tool - for my older subjects.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KT01X9VGA4V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I5J4#wasThisHelpful","R3KT01X9VGA4V2","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this setup and bought the dividers as well, and a couple of foam pluck inserts as well.  Along with the organizer and a couple of TSA locks, nameplate too.  I've got other Pelicans as well but invested a bit more on this one because it has great utility.  If I'm flying for 3 days, I use the LOC insert.  The laptop holder fits my MacBook Pro 15"" (late 2014 model) quite well but snug with no problem.  When I fly overseas, I use the inserts instead for camera gear and leave the LOC insert at home.  The utility of this thing is fantastic.  And it's built like a tank.  But to be honest, you're not going to get too many clothes in this than a 3 or 4 day stay.  I'm fortunate that I have a place stocked with everything I need at the other end of my flights.  So usually I'll just carry some odds and ends or stuff I don't have at my other place.One of the things people are concerned about with this case is ...can you carry it on the plane.  This case dimensions just makes it.  The only time I've had difficulty carry-on is when I'm not flying First Class because I have to fly a single-cabin plane.  If I don't get on early in a single cabin they generally ask me to leave it at the gate check.  Then I have to say something like let me try hon.  But flying first I never ever have a problem.  Because I'm first to board I always get this thing on.  Point is, from my experience, fly First and you don't ever have to worry.  ""You gets what you pays for.""

"These are fantastic for my large hands.  I put one on my XT1 (black) and my XT1 (Graphite-Silver).  It fits both perfectly and seamlessly.  I have been using the grip along with the thumb grip as well.  Though I don't feel it is necessary to have both.  But the combo works well for me.  I can more easily shoot with one hand if so desired.  I get a good grip on the camera with just this hand grip and feel confident that I'm not going to drop the camera.  Without the grip, for me, my hand doesn't feel like I've got a good hold on the camera.  And it doesn't add much weight to the camera as well.  By the way, I use one camera with just the 56mm Fujinon lens.  The other I use with the 18-135 Fujinon.  Waiting for the 90mm Fujinon.  Then I'll ditch the kit lens.  Point is that with these heavier lens, the metal hand grip works great and adds to a better balance for me.  Why two camera bodies?  I don't like changing lens often because I'm afraid of getting debris on the cameras sensor.  And so this just works out for me.

"I've owned more expensive BT headsets in the past - actually the more distant past when they were more expensive.  But prices have come down as the technology improves.  And this device is every bit as good as the more expensive headsets I've bought in the past and it is all and everything I need in the present. And I get more use out of this BT headset than any of my other headsets.  Because this has more utility for me with its ability to use not only in my car but also next to my easy chair in the living room.  I really like the way I can pick up from the dock and it automatically connects to my phone without having to pull out my Galaxy Note 4.  And it looks good in one of my older vehicles that does not have BT.  I prefer using the headset with docking station in my living room more so than the car.The headset is very comfortable once you match the correct ear gel with your ear.  I use the larger gel because I'm a larger person.  The audio is very clear and I'm able to walk around the room away from my phone with no hissing or breaking connection.  I have also paired this with my wife's iPhone 6 very well and tried it with a Galaxy 5 with no problem.  My personal feeling is you're getting a lot for the price you pay. I was given the opportunity to try this product by the Mpow company with a free sample and I have been happy that I was chosen to review the BT headset.  The price of these products have come down in recent years and the technology has improved considerably.  You're getting so much more today at this price point that you were a couple of years ago.  In my humble opinion.  And last, but not least, this company customer service is exceptional and responds quickly and ships quite fast.

I believe that if you're looking for a device such as this that uses suction,  this will do you well and gets the job done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ZRB7V3GH75B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDG84I6#wasThisHelpful","R15ZRB7V3GH75B","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like gadgets.  So when I was offered a chance to receive and review this device, I jumped at the chance.The first thing I noticed is its size and weight.  It's small and very light....which I like.  And its surface is that black kind of matte finish with a micro kind of fibre type feel (just my description).  So it feels good to hold and  it's non-slippery.  You can fit this device anywhere.  And it takes up absolutely no space whatsoever.  I hook it up to my camera bag (with the two tiny holes on top).  So it's always with me as my camera bag is always with me.This device is very sensitive and records well 5 to 10 feet away.  I was surprised at the clarity of those recordings.  It starts to fall off a bit after 10 feet but still records well up to 15 feet away in the next room.  At about 10-15 feet away I would generally have to turn up the volume on my receiver.  But otherwise, it's ideal at 5 to 10 feet away.  In a larger room with no interference, it picks up very well at larger distances.Too me, who likes to record life around me with a camera, it just seems nice to also know that I have the ability to record audio almost instantly should I desire to do so.  And unless you tell someone you are recording (which you should do) I don't think anyone is going to notice.  What I have been doing with this is using it as a backup drive for my photos but as a recording device I know it has that extra utility for me should I need it.  And I'm all about being prepared for everything.  And this gives me that added ability because of its extra utility, both as a thumb drive and a audio recorder in a small, lightwieight and unobtrusive but very effective device in all areas.  I like this a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9Z04R7TUPO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MZL75TG#wasThisHelpful","R3T9Z04R7TUPO","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought a couple of these recently instead of the WD Passport Ultras 2Tb maybe because of looks and metal enclosures as well as the price being pretty much the same.  I also have a few of the WD My Passports 2Tb (Black) (USB3) from a couple of years ago when they were much more money (about 50% more).Side by side, these slims don't seem any different in size to me except for the weight.  The slims seem heavier to me.  I was kinda surprised that the slims don't have some kind of rubber feet or something to cause them to not slip or slide on my desk top.  So they are not condusive, in my mind, to stacking them on top of each other.  It's a nit-pick I suppose but I'm going to try to find something to place on the bottom for 'feet'.The thing is I have this demonic cat that likes to climb on to my desk and knock things on to the floor or carry things off in her mouth to places hard to find.  And I had stacked these up and she knocked one on to the floor (carpeted).  But It still works just fine.Overall I like this product, and have never had any trouble with these WD portable drives and are the only ones I will ever buy.  They all (WD My Passports) seem very reliable and well made.  I could have just as easily gone with the black Ultras as well as these.  But these I'm using mainly for my photography and video camera backups.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJXSAQLQECGMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO3031A#wasThisHelpful","RJXSAQLQECGMQ","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own this case in both 'varieties ', the wireless as well as the non-wireless charging covers.  Both are well made and stand up to a lot of abuse in my opinion.  Granted, they don't offer the same protection as an otter box but I have dropped my Note 4 in the non-wireless case from 3 feet onto a hard-wood floor with no damage (the phone landed on a corner).  The case is very attractive in the charcoal color that I have.What I particularly like about this case and one big reason I prefer it over previous Verizon cases, is not just the functionality offered by the quick access to apps when the cover is closed, but the simple fact that it doesn't turn my phone on automatically every time I remove or place it in my pocket.  Before, when I would use the Verizon case (with kick-stand) with my other Galaxy's (S3, S4, S5),  I would always inadvertently hit the home button when sliding it in my pants pockets - turning on the phone, making calls, opening apps.  And the way around that was to use the lock screen which I don't really like to do.  But with this cover, I just close it and slide it (in my pocket).  I don't know....it just works for me.The reason I have both covers is because I travel a lot and don't want to carry anything more than I have to, meaning the wireless charging device.  So when traveling I carry a spare battery with the Samsung charging case.  And I'll switch that battery once a day as I am a heavy user.  And it's very easy to switch in this case.  And the case does not degrade with that much opening and closing.I use the wireless casing when I'm not traveling (when I'm at home-base).  And for that I use a couple of Samsung wireless charging pads.  (The white pads by Samsung advertised for the Galaxy S4.  Not the mini black pad).  You just place it on the pad and it starts charging.  I didn't like the mini-pad because you had to be a little more concerned with how you placed the phone.  But the larger white pad fits the Note perfectly and I just lay the phone down square and I'm done.I hope my review was helpful to anyone interested in this case.  If it was, please check in the comments below.

"I have the earlier model, x100s, but decided to upgrade to this newer model because of some of the upgrades, that, to my mind, make the camera just a little more enjoyable to use.I especially like the new Electronic Rangefinder Display, improving the viewfinder.  Basically this is an optical view with a magnification of the center focus frame.  It's like a little electronic picture inserted within the optical view of the magnified focus area.  This is what actually attracted me to this upgrade, making manual focusing easier for a sharper shot.Having built in Wi-Fi now is also a big plus for me.  With the ability to remotely control the camera.  The exposure compensation dial has been improved to +_3, rather than just 2 on the previous model.As a compact camera it's bigger than most.  But I enjoy using this x100 more and more because of its retro look and feel.  With the aperture ring, EV dial, and shutter dial, I feel like I always have more and immediate control of my camera.  And as long as you don't mind this particular fixed lens focal length and 'zooming' with your feet, I'm having a lot of fun with this camera.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBF8GHHPG87I2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NF6ZHNG#wasThisHelpful","RBF8GHHPG87I2","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm glad I had the chance to review this charger after I accepted the companys request to try it out.  Because I like gadgets, especially when they offer me such great utility as this simple but effective 3 port USB charger for my car.In fact, I didn't even know I needed it until I received it and started using it.  I'm all about being prepared for anything.  Because I travel a lot and, by necessity,  use a lot of different cars, this comes in handy and can be thrown into my travel bag.  It charges my numerous Android devices and spare batteries (like the Samsung GS4 battery charger),  as well as my Sony battery charger for my Sony RX100M3 camera.So my setup this past week for the device while in Texas was to, first, plug in to the DC (or cigarette lighter) of the car.  Then plugged in the spare GS4 Samsung battery charging case into the USB port on this charger.  And the Sony cameras USB battery charging case into the remaining USB port on this charger.  Finally I plugged my Samsung GS4 into the dedicated micro USB Android charger cable located in the center of this USB charger.  My phone was 'paired' to the cars Bluetooth so I could then use the cars phone application to make and receive phone calls.Using the Bluetooth is important in this type of application because of the tightly coiled cable of this charger does not allow one to just pick up the phone and place the phone to your ear while still attached to the charger.So, in the end, this is - pure and simple - a charger. And does what it does well.  I like it.  And its one more thing to have in your bag of gadgets when travelling.  It takes up no room.  Is lightweight.  Attractive. And functions perfectly for me.I sincerely hope this review was helpful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T1IH0TL4VSAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7E78FW#wasThisHelpful","R3T1IH0TL4VSAC","AJED3FAM7RGEB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJED3FAM7RGEB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I paid full price for this product. I bought it before I read the reviews... ..something I rarely do. But I like Logitech products, and especially the Harmony line of remotes, which I have several good years of experience with. If I had read the reviews first, I would not have bought this product. And I'm glad now that I hadn't read the reviews first.This product, since installing two days ago, has worked flawlessly for me. And so easy to program. Programming may have been made easier for me as I also currently use my trusty, tried-and-true, Harmony One which I will never give up (the activities and device settings can be copied and transferred over).To begin using the keyboard, I had to first install the Harmony app from the Play Store to my Android Samsung Galaxy S4. (I have yet to install to my iPad Air).From there, it was simply a matter of following the screen prompts.....one of which included uploading all of my current Activities and Device settings from my Harmony One account to my Harmony Smart Keyboard Hub and Android phone. And Viola! I was in business, up and running immediately! I was totally surprised at the ease and very pleased.I have continued using my Harmony One along with the keyboard and the Harmony app on my Android GS4. But I can now actually replace all my remotes. I have 8 devices connected to my Home Theater and soon to add an Xbox One or the 360. But when I added the Amazon Fire TV (a very superior product for what it does...and  Amazon  certainly got it right), I decided to get the Logitech Harmony Smart Keyboard because the Fire TV uses radio signal rather than IR which is Harmony One exclusive. And the keyboard makes editing data very easy. So I'm playing with it now and very happy with it.The keyboard is not too large and yet a good size for my extra large hands. It has a good feel to it and is built well and somewhat rugged. And it works quite fast. Very responsive. I do wish there were additional buttons on it. For instance, a eject button for my BluRay but I'm sure that can be programmed thru the Android app.I like the Android app. It's very convenient to have on my Android and I don't find it very difficult at all to program. It's very intuitive and a joy to use. If you want to control your home theater from your phone and have a keyboard to enter data and don't mind programming the keyboard thru your phone, this is a great alternative to one of the Universal Remotes. In fact I prefer this setup right now used in conjunction with my Harmony One (I've had the One for a few years now and it just keeps going and going. Though I recommend changing out the original battery as mine was found to be swelling recently and needed to be exchanged - I have a recent review of the replacement battery and how to do it).If my review was helpful, and I hope it was, please indicate by pressing the 'yes' button below.

"I bought two of these to have a spare and because I forget to put the One on the charger.I could not get the original battery out.  It should come out easily with one finger by lifting it from the front edge and then it just pops out.But I was told the original battery swells.  Indeed it does.  If you can't get this battery out, it more than likely has swollen and I recommend definitely replacement.Have a pair of needle - nose pliers and a flat head screw driver.  Slip the flat head in the back center of the battery (there's a small opening that allows you to do this) just enough so you can lift the battery up gently.  Hold that position with the flat head by one hand.  Take the needle pliers with the other hand and insert one side of the needle next to the flat head screw driver, in the space created by the flat head screw driver.  Squeeze the pliers shut and wiggle, gently, the battery side to side while pulling the battery out.  The swollen battery will come out.  With a bit of effort.You will be surprised by the appearance of the battery.  It will be swollen on top and bottom.  The new battery will slip in nicely and will also slip out easily from then on.Though the activities and device settings were still on the One, none of the buttons worked.  The TV would not shut off or turn on for example.  I pushed the help button and  pointed the One at the TV.  That fixed the problem.  Everything worked fine from then on.  Though the day and time settings had to be set once againThe new battery was 3/4 charged when I received it.  And the operation of the new battery made the effort worth it.  The new battery looks exactly as the original.

"I'm not one to spend a lot of time in the kitchen.  Primarily because I am somewhat inept in the preparation of food.  And I'm not proud of that.  But I like good, well prepared food.  Especially my Polish wifes food.So when my wife showed me how easy it was to peel potatoes with this kitchen utensil,  I was amazed.  I've never liked peeling potatoes,  ever since my Army days as a lowly Private.  But I am actually able now to peel potatoes, not only correctly but quickly.  And I love potatoes.  Now only the skin comes off and not half the potato itself when I peel like it use to.This does an excellent job of peeling potatoes.  She showed me also how to use it with other vegetables and other than peeling.  And it worked very nicely for that too.  No mess at all.  For such a small inexpensive utensil, I believe it's worth its weight in gold.  I don't mean to go overboard with my review here but for being disabled as I am, it is somewhat empowering to now beabled to help my wife in the kitchen with something so simple as peeling a potato.If my review was helpful in anyway,  and I hope it was, please choose yes in the comments section below.

"I absolutely enjoyed this movie (watching it on-demand Xfinity).  As spy movies go, this could be one of my favorites.  The acting from the male leads was very good.  No one was phoning it in.  Kenneth Branagh as a Russian bad guy was truly menacing and continues to be one of the great actors of our time.  Chris Pine's transformation from comfortable, but undercover, CIA analyst, too a fully 'operational' field CIA agent, was interesting.  Chris Pine has a nice screen presence that makes him an actor to watch.  Kevin Costner as an unflappable and hardened CIA agent continues to impress as a great personable actor.The movie had elements at times similar to a 'Mission Impossible' movie and at other times, to a 'Bond' movie.  There is plenty of action and it all really picks up during the second half of the movie.  It had me on the edge of my seat.  I recommend this movie to anyone liking action movies with a lot of modern spy technology and modern day spies.If my review was helpful, and I hope it was, please choose 'yes' in the helpful comments section below.

"I gave this watch to my 10 yr old Grandson as a gift.  And he was, and still is, fascinated by the movements of the inside of the watch which are observable thru both the top and underside of the watch.  In fact I liked it as well and considered keeping it a while longer for my own observation.  I think it is unique for a boys watch.  Everything moves very smoothly and for that reason it appears to me to be worth more than it actually is.  And I liked the way the watch was already up and running upon first opening the attractive and sturdy case.  The first word from my grandson was, ""wow.""The watch itself has good weight to it and feels solid and 'handsome.'  I think, for the price, its a great gift to give to a young boy.

"(Update Dec 6th 2014)I highly recommend this book for the RX100M3 by Gary Friedman.  I bought it and love it (http://friedmanarchives.blogspot.com/2014/12/lots-of-announcements.html?m=1)I bought this camera because of its faster lens (f/1.8 to f2.8), which means, to me, more light entering onto the cameras sensor which, in turn, means to me slightly better images than previous models. Which translate to a shallower depth of field available. And that's exactly what I like and want in this model, and precisely why I bought it, even though I also have the previous M2 model. One thing I want to note here before I go on. The Aperture seems to move quite fast from 1.8 to 2.8 thru the smaller zoom range. In that, a case could be made that this lens is more of a steady 2.8 thru out the zoom range.So then what exactly did I get with this upgrade from my M2 to my new M3? Well, you've got the newer Bionz X processer. The new 180 degree LCD (for Selfies if you are so inclined). The pop-up EVF (which is an innovation in and of itself, and a help with image stabilization when pressed against my face). Zebra pattern and focus peaking which is available on my RX10 and now the M3.I feel the 24mm-70mm lens (though not the same reach as my previous M2 model - 28-100mm) is a good walk-around lens. And since I have been using this same zoom range for a long time on my DSLRs, I feel very comfortable with this zoom range in a very capable and now compact camera. When I use this for portraits at the long end of 70mm I expect to shoot mostly 1/2 to 3/4 body shots to full body shots. As opposed to the previous models zoom range of 28-100mm where I used it up to head and shoulder shots at the long end.This camera has the same Bionz X processor that Sony has in their A7 line of cameras (one of which, the A7R, that I have). That was another plus for me in buying this camera. As far as image stabilization, it is important to compact cameras today and thus, to me. And I find that holding the camera up to my face while using the EVF gives me the 'feel' of a more stabilized shot. And my pictures look better to me. This is important to me because now that I am in my 60's, try as I might, holding the M2 or my smartphone without an EVF - is not as steady as I'd like it to be or as I remember it was when I was younger. And I need image stabilization in lower light. And this EVF on my new compact M3 seems to provide that for me. The only 'unofficial' (perhaps non-technical) test I could do with this camera was to zoom it out to 70mm, and hold the shutter half-way to see how much 'lock' I had on the image. Then I tried it with my M2. My observation was that I did see an improved difference with the M3.There is a slight difference in camera size from the previous model (which I also have). The thickness of this model is about 2mm more. And the weight is about 8 to 9 grams more. What this also means in terms of fitting a leather case to it is that my previous models Sony leather case will not fit this camera. You're going to need the Sony LCJRXF/B Premium Jacket Case (Black). This new case will fit all previous models as well as this model. Just as the Sony LCJRXC/B Premium Jacket Case (Black) would only fit the M2 as well as the M1. Some people think that the case for the M2 will also fit the M3. It will not. I have tried it. I also recommend the custom camera grip by Richard Franiec (camera accessories by Richard Franiec). This goes for about 35$ and is worth its weight in gold - to me. It is far better than the Sony grip that I used on the M2 for 15$. Its made of metal (anodized aluminium) is sleek looking, feels good quality and solid, and gives you a good grip on the camera while still maintaining the cameras pocketability (because it doesn't protrude past the lens assembly). Of course with the camera grip added, the M3 will not fit in the Sony Leather camera case. So it is either one or the other. So to get around this I ordered another OP/TECH USA Soft Pouch Digital D-Micro (Black) for my M3 which I also have for the M2. And it fits great.If my review was any help with your decision to purchase, and I hope I was of some help, kindly choose 'Yes' in the comments section below. Thank You.

"In my opinion,  this sign works.  I was regularly getting almost daily animal deposits in the same area of my yard.  I put this sign up and they stopped.  The sign itself is strong and looks built to last.  And it's hard to miss the meaning of this sign by dog owners.  In fact they all look at it, point at it and smile and keep right on going.  One dog even looked at it, inspected it and decided to keep right on walking which leads me to believe some dogs know better than some owners.I pounded the sign with a rubber mallet until the wing-like structures on the metal pole were just beneath the ground.

This one does not have the rubberized feel of a previous brand but neither is this slippery for me even though it has a smoother finish.  And it does seem to slide in and out of my cargo pants front pocket easily.  All in all, I do like the appearance it gives my phone and the extra grip I now have when using the phone during calls.  I feel like I'm holding something more substantial in my hand.  And it is easier to slide on and off the phone by the simple way it separates.  And once connected to the phone, it stays on, secure and tight.  It's got a good fit.Battery usage is excellent and does not disappoint.  It works as expected and gives me another day of power usage after my iPhones internal battery dies.  And I do like the use of the micro USB cord for charging (it first powers the phone before next powering the extended battery), especially since I have a lot of other devices that use the same micro USB.  Which makes for more convenient traveling, which I do a lot.  Recently flying to Dallas, I was rerouted to Houston,, needing to rent and drive a car for four hours to Dallas, and still had enough power for my phone from 7am until 4am the next morning.  So there is a certain amount of security knowing I have got plenty of power and not have to worry too much about it.I can recommend this product without any reservations.  Some have mentioned that they didn't think it offered enough protection in a fall.  It feels to me that it offers as much protection as most other battery cases.  This will protect your phone in most situations in anything but the most dire or extreme circumstances.  And all this in an attractive case.  With great utility.If this review has been of help to anyone, and I hope it has, please use the yes button below in the helpful reviews comment section.  And if you have any questions, please leave a comment and I will get back to you.  Thanks and enjoy.

"I built some gear cases and wanted to protect the edges and hold the longer sides together firmly transit.  I searched long and hard to find these, actually buying smaller ones first and then ordering these.  They are very large, 1.5” inches on a side, each of the 2 sides are exactly the same.  I believe they complement both the looks and the sturdiness of the boxes.  When paired with the matching corner protectors, they create a very sturdy box solution.  These are very thick steel; they protect the box and help hold it together by binding each of the sides along the edge, helping the box hold together during rough handling.After working with some expensive commercial travel boxes, I decided to build my own.  Using these case side clamps along with corners I was able to fabricate my own boxes out of ” ply that are just as sturdy as the professionally made very expensive boxes.  Of course I added secure latches like these too Reliable Hardware Company RH-1688/0371-A Large Low Profile Butterfly Latch and Keeper, to compliment the looks of the box.  These are the pieces I used for the corners Reliable Hardware Company RH-1027-8-A Medium Size Zinc Road Case Ball Corner - Set of 8.  With the combination of the great clamps, corners and side pieces I now have a very solid case for my generator.  I added the worn look to the wood prior to staining it.

They are very large, nearly 2 inches on a side, each of the 3 sides are exactly the same.  I believe they complement both the looks and the sturdiness of the boxes.

"I broke my last phone case (dropped it) I wanted a new one that would provide an edge around the front to allow me to lay it face down on my desk and not scratch it.  This phone provides that feature.  It also protects the glass in case of a drop onto a flat surface due to this feature.  I like that all 4 corners have the fully wrapped hard plastic shell around them to protect those too.The back, while it appears to perhaps be rubber feeling is the same plastic as the main case; it’s just colored and has a slight texture to it.  It is not as grippy has the cases with a rubber back.  I keep my phone in a pants cargo type pocket and the raised edge around this phone make it easy to get out of the pocket without the worry of dropping it.Watch out for the colors as you order. I had thought I ordered back, but received red due to the way the colors show on the main screen.  It’s still a fine color so I won’t worry but do make sure you get the color you intended.4 stars, I would have preferred a rubber type of back for a little more grip.  The case fits well, has a safe plastic feel and the fit and finish for the button covers is nicely done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11F07TL7RSBE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0131KMB70#wasThisHelpful","R11F07TL7RSBE5","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who uses a CPAP knows that the masks age, turn a little yellow and risk tearing with time.  I have an awful distaste for the way the insurance industry charges 3x what something costs so I decided to look around and find my own way to replace my mask.  I found this item, ordered one now and have been very happy with this mask.This mask is an exact factory made replacement for my ResMed Mirage FX Mask, it arrived in the factory packaging.  It is the standard size and available for much less cost than when purchasing one through my insurance provider.  Because I have an HDHP (High Deductible Health Plan) I have to pay either way so I might as well pay a third the price!When I get a replacement, I save the older one as a backup and also keep one in my travel bag.  That way if anything goes wrong, tears, gets lost in travel etc I still have one around.  I know you are supposed to replace these every 6 months, but I have used one for over a year with no problems.  It did age, get a yellow tint to it.  I try to wash them weekly and replace every 3-6 months.5 stars, an exact replacement to keep me sleeping well at night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IKWYUTDHN0MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0104NTKFS#wasThisHelpful","R3IKWYUTDHN0MW","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My state requires a minimum 3/32” of tire depth, and I like to watch my own tires to make sure I’m well in the safe zone.  This tool allows me to accurately determine the depth and it has a very nice pass, marginal and fail color coding system with green, yellow and red bands on the gauge.Simple to use, hold the depth rod over an area you want to measure and press down on the color coded section to see how far down it goes.

"For the price it’s hard to beat this flashlight holder.  No, I would not use it for an every day carry situation, or something you had to use on the job, but for keeping your flashlight in the car from scratching things up (or getting scratched) it fits the bill perfectly.This holder is made from decent material, though it’s on the thinner side.  The main thing I didn’t like about it is that the elastic on the side only covers about the middle third of the holder.  Both the top and bottom portions are open.  Since the bottom is open the flashlight can twist in the holder and then it’s not staying protected.  This is one big reason why I wouldn’t use it as a daily carry holder.4 stars, amazing value, but not the best design with the open sides.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16OLF9C6U1FN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056IGYFG#wasThisHelpful","R16OLF9C6U1FN","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I bought my 2500 HD truck it came with a Class-5 hitch which is larger than the traditional Class-4 hitches most trucks have.  I didn’t realize that also meant that my safety chain hooks would be too small to fit into the holes built into the hitch.  To resolve that problem, I found that these D-rings look and work perfectly on the back of the truck.  Now I can easily and quickly install my safety chains and know they provide just as much safety as needed without modifying my truck.These are heavy duty D-rings and I’m really happy with the powder coating on them.  I’ve attached a picture to show how they look on the truck.  To be fair, these pictures were taken after a 15,000 mile trip, towing the entire way up and down the Alaska Highway!  These pictures show how little wear and how solid these D-rings are since the usage on a trip like that only consists of a few scratches.5 stars, great looking, functional and heavy duty!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGBAR3TRFQ4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K2BH4W#wasThisHelpful","R2QGBAR3TRFQ4A","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When planning a multi-week trip in our trailer, I determined we would really like to have USB power inside for charging devices.  Another desire was to be able to watch the system voltage a little more closely than the 4 segmented bar system the trailer came with.  This panel was just the ticket and has accomplished everything we hoped for.The voltage is very handy for enabling me to see how the batteries were working when we were dry camping for a few days.  The USB power outlets worked out great enabling us to charge phones and tablets too.  The 12v power outlet was used for powering a portable speaker system when we wanted to crank up the tunes.  This panel worked great and is a very solid setup, though the volt meter read about .1v lower than my multi meter shows, not a biggie but nice to know for your reference.The panel was easy to install.  I found a place near my main power distribution system.  I mounted the panel facing into the hallway, not facing the bed and I’m glad I did that.  The LED lights can be bright and I didn’t want the facing me all night.  I drilled 3 holes using a 1-1/8"" hole saw which is just the right size to mount the panel into.  It came with 4 wood screws that worked great to hold it nicely in place.  Before mounting I built a wiring harness so that I would only need to plug the panel into a single outlet in my distribution panel to power all 3 devices.  Now I have it installed, fused and working in the system just as if it were factory installed.5 stars, provides power, voltage and a very clean simple install.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20H129G8GGK1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MODXVO8#wasThisHelpful","R20H129G8GGK1D","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After using my FT-8800 for a few years, the Mic started giving me trouble.  At first it was the occasional report of static, some kind of noise and other misc things you can’t ever seem to trtace down.  I would unplug it, relieve the tension and it would work better.  I also worked through my ground system to make sure it was solid and yet the problem remained.  After some time I decided to replace the Mic wires, but then found that I could buy a replacement Mic for less than just the wiring harness and avoid all that hassle.This Mic is working better than my original Mic.  It appears to be factory original, but a few things have changed, and have been improved!  The wiring is a little thicker, more robust and I hope avoids the issues my original had.  Additionally the PTT button has a little better definition between on and off, more of a solid feel to it and I really like it.  The rest of the features, the lighting and so forth all appear to look and function exactly the same.Ad far as sound quality, I’m getting great reports and have been told many times I now sound better than I have in years.  It’s very nice to have a solid system again, especially for those nights when running a Net.5 stars, if you feel your Microphone could be having an issue, try replacing it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN87FQK2WAFCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PPIGMW#wasThisHelpful","RN87FQK2WAFCK","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Many flashlights have a large enough cavity for both a 18650 battery or a 3xAAA battery holder.  The 3xAAA battery holder has a larger diameter than the 18650 battery so it fits tightly in the flashlight and the single battery fits loosely.  If this is your case, then these small sleeves act as a way to hold the single battery tightly in place.These work well and trying to find tubing and my own way to resolve this just didn’t happen when visiting the big box home improvement stores.4 stars, they do what they are designed to do, but pretty pricey for just a small tube of plastic.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R168OTKWRTRS2U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QA8GFO6#wasThisHelpful","R168OTKWRTRS2U","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the last few years I’ve bought about a dozen different flashlights trying out the options and determining features I like.  This flashlight is my favorite light of all the under $50 lights I’ve tried!  Given that you can get it for about $16 (with discount code) it’s an amazing value too.  This light is very well made, the machining is very smooth, the tail and top caps come of and go on extremely smooth and easy, and I really like the matte black finish.  The light also comes with a nice leash, the kind I like that doesn’t have any metal parts which can make noise or scratch the finish.  It also comes with 2 spare O-rings just in case you mess one of yours up.  I apply petroleum jelly to my threads to keep that from happening.This light is very bright, I estimate about 450 lumens.  I like the feel of it in my hand; it’s a very handy size.  Small and light, yet enough power to last hours and provide an amazing light.  The bulb end has a nice large reflector which has the added benefit of causing the focused beam center portion of the light to stay tighter farther away than any of my other lights.  I really like this light, without the need to have an adjustable focus it provides a very focused center and a really evenly lit surrounding fill.Here’s the best part about this light, the lowest 2 settings are nice and low, it seems too many worry about the brighter side of the range and don’t actually provide lower options.  The Low is really low and great for checking the house at night to make sure things are off but not blasting light all over the place.  The Moonlight setting is really low, you can use it to keep your night vision and yet provide a small touch of light.  This is one of my favorite settings and something I’ve only seen on $60 and higher lights.  If I could make any changes it would be to increase this moonlight setting to about 1 lumen rather than ½, but that is a very minor difference.I’ve really come to love the 18650 battery for flashlights and this particular light really shines as far as features for the size and useful lighting modes the way I use lights.  The method used to change the default lighting mode when the light is first turned on is fairly easy to use, and doesn’t get in the way of my normal use of the light.  That means I can set it to the mode I like my lights to start in (brightest) and not worry from there.  You do this by getting the light to the brightest state, turning it off and then back on in less than 2 seconds.  That sets the startup mode.  Then once the light is off for more than a few seconds it’ll start up in whatever default startup mode you had last set.5 stars, my new favorite under $50 light, I love the low lighting options when camping to assure I have light overnight if necessary.  Carefully read the text of the listing, I found a $7 off code in there that significantly lowered the purchase price of this flashlight.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F3YNXST7FQRQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSV8BKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1F3YNXST7FQRQ","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used my battery analyzer (Opus BT-C3400) and have tested this battery. It is delivering very close to what the listing claims, which is nice to see since so many batteries don’t deliver anything near what they claim.When cycling and testing the battery I received, it is right at 3475 mAh. The battery I received weighs 85.7 grams.  Knowing that these batteries deliver the power as claimed, it helps you fairly compare the price, value and performance that you need. This battery size can be harder to find, so knowing one that delivers as promised and works well is a great find.  I highly recommend that you stay away from the very poor UltraFire batteries, I have yet to see one of those deliver even half of what they claim.The batteries I received are labeled exactly as shown, they clearly state 3500mAh, so you can easily keep track of them with all your batteries.  These also have a button on the top and are labeled as made in China.I ordered mine through MXJO and it was delivered quickly.  One thing to be aware of is that this listing is for a single battery, which the title does say, but the picture shows two so it could be confusing.The only negative I have is that within the text of the listing, it claims these are the newer 4200mAh batteries and they are not.  Due to this mis-information I have to lower the rating to 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J0A0U734P1T9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PJM2S2M#wasThisHelpful","R3J0A0U734P1T9","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very nice light, especially at this price.  Considering the build quality and value, this is one I've now bought several of to have handy.  I really like the 18650 battery, the power and size are very convenient.  This light lasts over an hour on bright and gives a very nice light that entire time.  Take it down to low and you get several hours of a pretty bright light there too.  If I had any complaint it would be that the Medium and Low lighting levels should be much lower, so that the battery would last several days at low.To make a light useful for a tactical situation, the light MUST turn on to the brightest setting when first activated.  This light does that, there are others that don’t so look for this feature.  This light will then step through the 5 press sequence (high-med-low-strobe-SOS) by half pressing, without clicking  the power buton.  Once you turn it off for more than a few seconds, it’ll reset and come back on at the brightest level.These seem to ship with either a bright green or black button.  When I bought a single light paired with batteries (UltraFire batteries are junk, avoid them) it came with a green button.  When I bought a couple of these without batteries, they came with black buttons.  Your mileage may vary on the button color you receive?  They do stand on the button end, which I like so that a room or tent can be lit from below.This light is very bright, I estimate about 350 lumens.  I like the feel of it in my hand; it’s a very handy size.  Small and light, yet enough power to last hours and provide an amazing light.  It’s like turning in a 75 watt directed light in a room.  One thing to be careful of is the o-rings.  The first time you take it apart, use thread lube such as petroleum jelly on the threads to keep it turning easily and thus not mess with the O-ring.  I've had an o-ring get torn up already during my testing.  I was able to get a replacement at my local ACE hardware, which was very convenient.When you leave it on, it’ll warm up over time, but I;ve found that the heat varies based on the batteries used.  If I use these batteries Panasonic CGR18650CG Rechargeable 3.6V Li-ion 18650 Battery 2250mAh, package of 2, 3008x2, the light stays cool, barely warming up at all.  If I use these batteriesFlePowTM 2 Pack 18650 Lithium-ion Rechargeable Batteries (Button Top) 3.7V 2600mAh Rechargeable Li-ion Flashlight Batteries with Protected PCB Board, the light will get rather hot in my hand.  Perhaps the higher capacity batteries are flowing just a little hotter but not enough to make the light much brighter if that’s the case.  It make sense to me to get the lower power batteries and not waste the power creating heat.  I’ll have to run a duration test with both to see how it works out!5 stars, it’s a great light, for a great price.  Not the best made but the value is amazing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y3MEPWX9MK09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OK85KGM#wasThisHelpful","R2Y3MEPWX9MK09","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very nice light, I really appreciate the value, in fact I’ll be buying more, but NOT packaged with these terrible batteries.These batteries are rated at 3000 mAh, but when I have cycled them with the BT-C3400 changer, they actually only have about 975 mAh, not even a third of what is claimed.  Why bother with this size of a battery if you’re going to use one that has less capacity than AAA’s.  If that’s the case just yse a 3xAA light.  Crazy because the batteries sold with this package deal devalue the actually very nice light.The charger is ok, it doesn’t actually float up the batteries at the end of the charge so it’s not quite getting their max charge but it does cut off correctly and does work.The flashlight is a really nice light.  I have tested it with several different batteries, both flat top and button types and it works with all of them.  The batteries fit nicely, no slop and the threads are cut well.  I applied lube (petroleum jelly) to keep the threads from fighting you and that works nicely.  The light has a very solid feel to it and can be used as a nice tactical light because after it’s sat for a time, on the first press it always goes to the brightest setting, which is just what you want.  Then you can soft press and get to any one of the 5 press sequence (high-med-low-strobe-SOS).  This light does not focus, it does have a nicely sized beam, not too big, pretty nice for general uses around the house and camping.  It’s very solid and feels good in my hand.  It’ll fit in your pocket too, though a AA light is smaller if that’s what you want.  The clip is well attached and I’ve used to for clipping to backpacks and it stays nicely.I’ve left mine on for a considerable time and while it warms up a little, it isn’t getting hot which I really like.  I’m estimating that the light is about 350 lumens based on relative comparisons to other known light sources.  While it’s not what is claimed in the listing, it is still a very nicely bright light and great for a light of this size with a single battery.4 stars for the overall rating, the light is a 5, the charger a 3-4 and the batteries a 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SDPXCX7XQNZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8XV6KK#wasThisHelpful","R2SDPXCX7XQNZR","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

When cycling and testing both of the batteries, they are right at 2350 mAh and 2375mAh, very nice for the price.  This gives them more than twice the power of the UltraFire batteries I have that the Analyzer shows only have 975mAh on a good day.  Concerning the disappointing Ultra fire batteries, why bother with this larger form factor if you only get the same power a AAA would have, crazy.The batteries I received are light green, say CGR18650CG on them, and have a very slightly extended button on the top.

"This is a very nice light, especially for the money.  To get right to the point, it has one serious flaw that makes it a poor choice for many usages.  When you first turn this light on, it goes to the state that is one press past where it was when you last used it.  Due to the 5 press sequence (high-med-low-strobe-SOS), this means it advances 1 state with each on/off sequence.  While this may not bother some, for use in an emergency situation, such as a carry light with a weapon, this feature means it’s not acceptable.  Your light MUST turn on to the brightest setting every time, no matter what to be useful as a tactical light.I love flashlights, batteries and trying out many of the different types available and if your purpose for having this light is to use for camping, and general lighting around the house, it’s a very nice solid light.  In fact it has many great qualities; it will run on a 3xAAA batteries, or 1x18650 which is very flexible, though it doesn’t come with a sleeve for the 18650 option.  All sizes fit and work well.  It’s plenty bright (~350lm), tough and the slide mechanism is solid, smooth and holds position.  I like the feel of it in my hand, it’s a very comfortable size.When you leave it on, it’ll warm up over time, but the fins on the telescoping head to a great job of dissipating the heat.  The zoomable feature is nice when you really want to look closely somewhere without lighting up the area around that object.  My light focuses well, so that you can clearly make out the shape of the light emitter on the wall.4 stars, it’s a great light, but the firmware used to control the lighting options needs to default to the brightest state at every power on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKE4RVWRNO5AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SGMLBEI#wasThisHelpful","RKE4RVWRNO5AX","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This tool has become a very used device in my workshop.  I am continually cutting, stripping and soldering wires in the size range of this tool.  For larger wires, I use a different tool and for really small stuff I have one just for those, but for the mid-size wires that I seem to use most often, this tool really does the job.The handles have a wider portion on the outer edge to give you more force when cutting the solid wires, I find it fits my hands well, I wear large size gloves and this tool is not a problem to use, plenty sharp.  It’s designed range is 10-20 AWG for both solid and stranded and that’s what I use it for.On the negative side, there’s no mechanism to lock the tool closed.

"My trimmer continues to work great after several years now.  I had thought I could run to my local big box store to get a new spool cover when mine finally wore out, but they no longer carry these.  I was very fortunate to find this online, it's better to pay a few bucks and keep using my trimmer than be forced to buy a new one due to a broken lower cost part.This is an exact replacement unit, it fits my Grasshog GH7000 exactly.  Notice that this is the cover only and does not include a spool to wind your line on, you need to keep the spool you have been using and mount it on this spool cover.  When you are looking at these units, there is a similar one that only has one hole on the side for the line to exit, this is the double line unit which is what I needed.  This version was slightly harder to find.I hadn't realized how worn our my previous spool was until it literally exploded one day while spinning.  Thankfully this unit is available, and again I'm very happy with it.  You might consider buying 2 of these which is what I did so that next time I'll have my spare on hand.5 stars, works great and extends the life of a nice trimmer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33XR0R9KGOPAK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00526V0OC#wasThisHelpful","R33XR0R9KGOPAK","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the tools I should have bought many months ago.  I learned the hard way that properly setting up a heli is the key to really allowing me to get past basic flight and move into some of the finer aspects of flying.This tool was used by a master pilot to show me how to fine tune and adjust my heli.  It flew so well and perfectly balanced that it was easy to see that I too needed one.  With the one I purchased I have now been through the setup proves and have completely setup my own helicopter to work and fly in a very balanced fashion.Some have previously mentioned that there are no instructions concerning how to use this.  Well, using this tool is VERY simple.  You turn it on. Hold it level on the surface you are setting the heli up on and press the ZERO button to define that orientation as zero.  From that point on as you measure blade pitch and movement it'll show you in 10ths of a degree what the angle of the blades are.  My batteries arrived working great, no issues there.  My gauge is also accurate and working well.To accurately setup your helicopter right depends on the Flybarless controller you are using.  Some have you go through and tell it what 6 degrees of pitch is and then it uses that as a baseline, others use different values and methods, so it's not really possible for there to be instructions with this tool to tell you that.  Look at your Flybarless controller and determine what it needs.  You will need to follow those instructions exactly to get everything setup as necessary.One hint, when you are tuning up your heli, start at the bottom and move up.  In other words start with the servos, make sure the arms are as level as possible.  Look at the links, make sure they all start the exact same length (I use a Micrometer for that).  Then move up to the Swash and make sure it's level.  Most FBL controllers have a way you can adjust each servo individually to help with this process.  Then you move up and set the pitch on the blade as per your FBL controller and so forth.Once you have your heli tuned, it shouldn't be wobbly or move in a piro, both upright and inverted.  That's a nice way to check your setup.5 stars, this is a great tool and mine is working well, I am very happy with it.  You can spend a lot more and get one that might be accurate to a 100th, but a 10th is plenty enough for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QDK9TWI2V5HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZGKRKG#wasThisHelpful","R3QDK9TWI2V5HL","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this so much that I bought a second.  One for home and one for my travel bag.  I'm actually surprised by the negative reviews I see here because this works so well for me.  This is one of those personal grooming things you really want to work well, and this tool does the job.  I was hesitant to get something without a motor.  After using it, I can tell you that it works great, quietly and efficiently.  No pulling or pain involved, though you do need enough coordination to be able to hold it on one hand and twist with the other ;-).There are 2 version here on Amazon, one comes with a carry case, the other doesn't and the cost is slightly less.  For my travel bag I bought the one without a carry case since it'll be in my bag.  They both come with a small brush and a plastic tube if you choose to store it in that. This version arrived in the plastic snaps shut display package, with the unit, in a plastic tube and the cleaning brush.This thing is small and really efficient.

"When I bought my Gaui X5 kit, it came with this VBar FBL controller.  My previous builds used the BeastX controller so learning this one took some time to carefully step through the setup.  Make absolutely certain you go through each step in the setup sequence.  Reversing just one option will cost you deeply in repair parts and time.This is the Mikado controller and uses the Mini vBar express software, or the VStabi Mikado software.  It comes one of those very small CD's and is also available for download from the Mikado site.  In my case I wanted to bind with DSMX satellite receivers and it wasn't an option in the Mini Vbar software as purchased.  I had to buy the $50 upgrade online from Mikado.  I paid in Euros and saved a bit, which you can easily do and have your credit card adjust for you.I play it safe due to all of the carbon on the X5, I use two satellite receivers, one in each of the 2 RX ports that come on the Vbar controller.  The fact that this controller supports DSMX directly, and 2 of them at that, is one of the reasons like this unit so much.There are Pros and Cons to the VStabi software you use to set the system up.  The Pro is that it's got instructions and explanations for the features right there on the screen, just hover over the option and it'll be explained in a pop-up window.  The Con is that you do need a Windows PC to run the software and configure your Helicopter.  That means you either need to use the PC at home, or haul a laptop to the field.  One other thing to consider is that when you mount the Vbar in your helicopter, you need to leave room to get the USB cable to the unit so you can set it up.  It's a little tight in my setup and can be a pain to get the plug in.  To help with this, I found these little adapters which I use to get into the unit: Motorola Right Angle Charger Adapter Mini-USB - SKN6182While the setup takes time to carefully go through all of the options, when flying this unit is rock solid stable in flight and provides an immense range of options including Governor (which I have not used yet).  I have now flown with several different Flybarless controllers (BeastX, VBar and Ikon) and this is the best handling with default options out there.  The interface has less options to worry about and just works how I prefer.

When turning the main shaft, I could feel it acting ""clicky"" where instead of a smooth action, it was clicking between indentations.  I had about 150 flights on the helicopter and it felt as if the bearings were worn out.  To keep the bird flying smoother and to help prevent vibration damage to other parts, I went ahead and replaced the main bearings with these.  Instead of ordering new bearing blocks (those come with the bearings pre-installed), I found that these bearings are the exact replacements for the 450 size bearings.  I was able to pop the older bearings out of the blocks using a light tap on them with wooden dowel.  It worked perfectly for seating these new bearings also.Replacing these every 150 or so flights (or after a particularly bad crash) seems a reasonable cost for the enjoyment I get out of all those flights!  I will check my new bearings after 100 flights and perhaps these will last longer since I'm crashing less (don't want to jinx anything by saying that!).5 stars, perfect replacement main bearings for my 450 Align helicopters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30409GCI8V09V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000O507JU#wasThisHelpful","R30409GCI8V09V","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I decided it was time to step up from a Flybar system and go Flybarless, I had many concerns.  One is the reliability of the gyro in the system (due to experience I know some gyros work better than others), and another was ease of setup and install.  With the many permutations available out there for FBL controllers and receivers, it looked like a real mess for wiring it up and keeping it working.  Then I discovered this combined Flybarless controller and receiver in one.  It really has worked well for me and I have been very happy with how it operates.  Having a clean install really makes a big difference, especially when you crash and end up rebuilding.  A clean install minimizes damage and helps assure you get things back in working order quickly.I will warn you up front, the first time you go through the setup, it's better if you have someone who is an experienced heli pilot go through it and check your work.  If you have someone who has setup a BeastX before, it's even better.  There are some subtle things you really need to watch for.  Not with this unit but with another type I got one setting wrong, started to spin my heli up and boom, it nearly exploded when things were backwards.  A mistake is costly so double check and ask friends if you don't know what one step might be saying.  It's critical that each and every step in the setup process be followed and checked.Ok, enough of the scary talk, this really is a nice unit, and easy to setup and modify.  You can do it at the field, in your house, however you want and simply due to the status lights and how the system works.  This system does not require a computer and connection to setup, it'll work with just your radio.5 stars, I liked it so much that I converted another one of my 450 helicopters to flybarless and went with this setup again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HTFDK4LMJF3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XHQ270#wasThisHelpful","R1HTFDK4LMJF3T","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using these batteries for a dozen flights now to fly my 450 size helicopter (Align TRex 450 DFC).  These batteries are working well and giving me nice flights.  If they can continue to perform at this level after 50 flights, I will be very pleased.  (I'll update the review when I reach that point)  I bought a couple so that I've got a sample of 2 just in case one acts up.The box that these come in says:  HobbyCool Model: YTB4022003S 3S 11.1V 2200mAh 40CThese batteries are doing a great job of delivering full power over the flight.  I get a complete 4 minutes of great 3D flying with these, slightly less power at the end but over all a fairly flat power curve.  They don't bog down like other lower cost batteries under the load and in both time and energy level are working great.  Coming with the Deans connector is a nice bonus for me since that's what I'm using.With heavy 3D flying they are staying cool and that tells me that they are delivering a true 35C as that's what it takes to keep a 3D 450 flying well.  They are delivering without over-heating and without puffing.  They do warm up slightly, which is expected.So, here's how I would rate my batteries currently.#1, Pulse batteries deliver the most power over the entire flight, more raw power the entire time, but at twice the cost, you have to make a choice.#2, Hyperion batteries deliver well and last longer than another of my other batteries so far.  These guys are holding strong, still delivering at 2 years and 75 flights.#3, These batteries are about in the middle of what I am flying, doing well. Big cost advantage!  Only a dozen flights so I need more time with them.#3, Hobby King Zippy Compact, these feel about like the Amazon ZAP batteries and are doing the same at 50 flights now.#4, I've tried many generic batteries and from here down I end up giving them away since they can't handle the 3D flying anymore.  Turnigy, Sky Lipo, Blue copies and others.  While they might be fine in planes or cars, they can't keep up the continuous head speeds needed for 3D heli flying, which really needs to get access to 35C.4 stars, great batteries, not 5 because they aren't quite delivering the same performance as my pricier batteries.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MLEZMV0UPN9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B3HLN5U#wasThisHelpful","R3MLEZMV0UPN9F","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been using these batteries for a couple years now to fly my 450 size helicopters.  They are nice in many ways relative to the other 2200, 2250 and 2500 size 3S batteries, but not perfect.On the very positive side these batteries to a great job of delivering full power over the full flight.  I get a complete 4 minutes of great 3D flying with these, slightly less power at the end but over all a fairly flat power curve.  They don't bog down like other lower end batteries under the load and in both time and energy level are working great.  Another nice feature is that I've been able to get over 100 flights per battery and they are still delivering.With heavy 3D flying they warm up and on the negative side, have gotten a little puffy.  At first I was worried about the puffiness, but it's been months now and they continue to fly fine.  It could be that due to flying in Phoenix Arizona where it tends to be hotter they are more puffy here, but I've also heard from friends who use these in cooler climates that they puff for them too.  Some batteries puff, others stay flat, these are the type that get puffy, again not bad but not like when you buy them.  Mainly you need to know this if you have a tight fitting fuse you slip one into.  I have some gliders where if the batteries puff you can't get them in and out anymore.All in all, nice batteries, Hyperions tend to sell for a little more than the off brands but due to their flat power curve and then number of flights you can get out of them, they end up being worth it.If you are still crashing often and destroying your batteries, stick with lower cost ones until you can get past that learning phase ;-)One other thing to know, you'll need to solder on your own connectors.  These do not come with a connector on the power leads.  On the balance port it has the unusual Hyperion wiring, which to me is a negative because most of my other batteries use standard connections, this means you'll need to keep a balance adapter just for Hyperion.4 stars, great batteries, not 5 because they do get puffy and cost a bit more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P3YZG8EOSM2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003YI7CE2#wasThisHelpful","R3P3YZG8EOSM2H","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a heavy duty nicely made L14-30 female receptacle that is designed to handle 30 amps at 240v. Each of the wires slide into an individual tube when you assemble the unit, to keep possible stay wire pieces from arcing. There's also a screw down stress relief section that tightens down on the cord to keep the cord from tugging at the connections if you were to pull on it. Each of the tubes where you insert the wires are clearly marked with W,G,X,Y for the 4 wires usedThis receptacle is well made and doing the job nicely.  I firmly tighten down the #10 wire (which needs to be used to support the 30 possible amps).  It's designed to hold this size wire.I primarily use this to supply power to my welder.  The welder sits on a cart that I built with a power distribution center on it.  I run a cord from the cart over to the wall where I have an L14-30 female to plug this into.  It works well and I really like the locking connection, it keeps things plugged in if there's a little tension on the cords.The main reason for selecting this plug when I designed my welding cart is because it works with most of the 240v generators out there.  Generators use this plug because it can handle 30 amps at 240v for about 7500 watts of power (30 x 240 = 7200)  Use extreme caution if you backfeed info your home with this plug.There are 2 main concerns to watch for if you plan to backfeed power.#1, is that you MUST disconnect the main feed on the house main panel to make sure you are not trying to power up your neighborhood, and that you don't risk shocking a power line worker who might be trying to restore your power.  If the power does come back online and your generator was to be connected, you would fry your generator.#2, is that to back feed a generator with this plug, you end up with a connection setup with 2 male ends.  Those ends can be very dangerous if they have power.  Connect your wires before turning on the power at your generator to keep from having any shock risk.  If your only use for this plug is to backfeed, I suggest using this adapter instead. Reliance Controls PB30 L14-30 30 Amp Generator Power Cord Inlet Box For Up To 7,500 Watt Generators  My reason for selecting this plug is that I use the same power outlet for powering my welder and have it available if I were to need to backfeed the home.This link takes you to the plug I used which is also well made and they work great together.Leviton 2711 30 Amp, 125/250 Volt, NEMA L14-30P, 3P, 4W, Locking Plug, Industrial Grade, Grounding - Black-White  Both of these pieces are available here on Amazon at a significant discount over the local big box stores.5 stars, a well-made lasting design for a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWQNDT90LY81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FKBZ5O#wasThisHelpful","RQWQNDT90LY81","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While these staplers do last a lifetime, I've had to buy several now because when my kids moved out and went to college, mine suddenly was no-where to be found!  They knew what they liked and wanted them at college with them.I really like this stapler, a full stick of staples easily slides in and you actually get to use all of them!  The end where you staple has a pivoting base plate where you can change the staples to close in or out as desired.  It also opens up for stapling posters to a wall board for classroom displays.  The rubber base is nice and keeps it securely in place when in use on the desk.  There's a small red indicator on the side to quickly look and see if you need to add staples, though I find I open it up and look inside anyway.It'll easily handle a dozen standard weight pages which is about all I generally staple.5 stars, this is a great stapler with the new models working just as well as my 20 year old one.

"I bought this kit to play around with some hardware designs I have in mind for a few projects around the house.  I've been a programmer for many years, I wanted a simple way to get into some hardware projects and needed a platform.  This is just the ticket for what I have wanted to do.The SainSmart board is a copy of the Arduino Mega 2560-R3 and costs considerably less, which enabled me to get this nice kit and have a bunch of fun options for playing around with.  You want the Mega board since it allows much larger programs and has many more options.Warning, for the newbie, this kit does not come with any instructions, only the hardware you see in the pictures in a nice plastic box.  Still, it's a great value and if you are willing to do a little reading online, finding the examples and tools out there is simple, search for Arduino, Learning and Examples. The programming is simple, essentially a subset of the C language.  There are some new words to learn such as a Program is called a Sketch.As far as the hardware goes, everything I have tested so far is working great and having all of the pieces necessary to work through all of the sample apps has been very nice.  Sadly one corner of my box was broken during shipping, but I like the box none the less and a small piece of tape over the hole will keep me from losing the nice yet smaller pieces of the kit.Yes this is a copy, yes this is less expensive than the name brand Arduino board, but the reality is that it's an open source design and this copy lets you get going for less.  The main thing when buying copies is if the instance will work with the IDE, and this SainSmart R3 design works with the main Arduino IDE (integrated Development Environment) from the start, no issues, the drivers auto install.Here's the great part about working directly with the IDE.  There are lessons, steps and examples provided on the main Arduino.cc site and they work exactly with this board.  No worries about trying to decipher the version that is found on the SainSmart site (which I had fun doing too), just go directly to the Arduino site, look for and get that version, those instructions are well done and easy to follow.  The IDE includes the source code built in, just go to File | Examples and you will see hundreds of examples, including the exact lesson samples all typed in for you and ready to build, upload and modify for your learning.Here are some getting started steps, just in case this is your first dive into Arduino like it was for me.  Sorry I can't put links in the instructions, Amazon removes them.Replace the word slash with a backslash and this is a useful link to start with arduino.cc slash en slash Tutorial slash HomePage1: go to the Arduino site, download the IDE for your particular system (there are Win, Mac and Linux versions).  I picked the v1.5.6 version which as of this date is the most current.  Don't mess with the Nightly builds, too much chance for things breaking there.2: install the IDE you just downloaded, which will also install the drivers.3: plug in the Mega to your USB cord (included in the kit) and then into the computer and it should show up on your system and the drivers should auto install.4: now run the Arduino IDE installed in step 2.4.1: In the IDE, select Tools | Board | Arduino Mega or Mega 2560.  Now you have the right board and the IDE knows how to treat it.4.2: Select Tools | Port and notice the ports shown.  Unplug your Arduino.  Now go back and check the ports, the one that the Arduino was plugged into will be missing... make a note of that one, plug back in your Arduino, then go back and select the port it's on.There you go, you can get samples, build projects and upload code to your Arduino Mega.  Pretty quick steps to get you going, but hey this is a review, not a guide ;-)Congrats for your wise choice and good luck building fun projects.4 stars, not 5 simply because some minimal instructions should be included to help the new users figure these basic steps out.  So far, the hardware is all working at 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRZ2DACAR4TSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFDW486#wasThisHelpful","RRZ2DACAR4TSI","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I needed some new fingernail clippers and have found recently that the Trim brand clippers I’ve been using for years have gone downhill.  I really liked the size and function of the older Trim brand and thus I’ve been searching for a suitable low cost yet quality replacement and am pleased to have found these.  These clippers are nearly an exact match for the Trim brand, but they are quality made and functioning very well (at least the 2 I received).

They are Asian made, with a character that means Beauty on the top.These have a nice feel and quality cut to them.  The cutting surface is very sharp and lined up well so that you get a smooth quick cut that is accurate and doesn’t leave a frayed edge as the poorer quality clippers can.The tension on the unit gives a very nice feel and I like it.  About the only thing I can see as a bit rough is the file.  The file surface is very rough and can really only be used for a rough file, you need to finish up after using it with something that has a softer feel to give me the smoother finish I like.

"Unfortunately I can't write a review outlining the charge current and abilities of this device because mine failed with less than an hour of total time on it.I started by plugging in an iPhone, it showed up, worked and appeared to begin charging.  I left the phone charging for a few minutes and all seemed well.  I plugged in a tablet that needs 25 watts to run (with the battery out) and it wouldn't turn on, so I know that it doesn't put out 25 watts (no surprise, it's only rated at 21, hey but why not check?).I decided it was time to monitor the charger so I plugged in my Samsung Galaxy Tab3 and left it to charge.  Initially it was charging and went up a couple percent.  Checking in roughly 15 minutes I noticed something unusual.  Even though it said it was plugged into a charger (display said it was charging), the power level was going down.  What?  I went back and tested the charger with other devices, including the original iPhone and the charger is no longer recognized and is no longer putting power out at all.  Somehow while charging the Android tablet it failed.Super bummer, I was looking forward to fast charging a couple devices at once.Though I rarely return anything, this one is going back.  It didn't work for more than a few minutes and does nothing at all now.2 stars, I am NOT happy with this.  Not 1 star because, well it did work for a few minutes.*** update: I was contacted by the vendor for a replacement unit.  I'm going to change this to 3 stars for now pending review and validation that my broken unit was an unusual occurrence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLQ88GQ4BQ01/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8YYFR4#wasThisHelpful","R2MLQ88GQ4BQ01","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a solid and well-built rack  with a nice area for kitchen books or decor! Nicely designed, it goes together very well and is firm and secure. We are very happy with the looks; it's a really nice addition to our kitchen and gives us a nice homey feeling. The color is powder coated and gives a nice antique look, matching our cabinets and hardware very well.  We have darker cherry cabinets with bronze handles and they match this nicely.Besides looking great, a benefit of this rack is how much cabinet space you free up for other things. We like hanging gout pots and lids together (with the lid inserted through the pot handle and then the pot handle hanging.  Some like to hang both pieces separately, that’s up to how you like yours to look, it’ll work either way.  I like to grab a pot and get its lid too.In our home the wall studs are 16” on center, so the 32” spacing that this came pre-drilled for worked perfectly for us.  If you have a wall with 24” centers you’ll need to drill some additional holes on the back side (make sure you drill on the back not the front, the front side has threaded holes for the added supports).  I strongly recommend you firmly attach this directly to studs due to not only the weight of the rack, but the weight of the pots and other items it’ll be holding.  I used a stud finder to assure a direct stud install. It would be sad to drill several holes in your wall.  Make sure it’s level by carefully measuring your first hole to floor distance and matching that on the 2nd hold.5 stars for a very solid and secure rack that performs well and looks great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFTE010RYL0D5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003XJG1AS#wasThisHelpful","RFTE010RYL0D5","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a software professional who spends his days working on Android optimizations, this book was a very exciting find and I enjoyed reading it to gain an insight into another view of this world I spend my life in.  While I reviewed a hard copy, it's an incredible deal as a Kindle download.  Here's my overview followed by my synopsis.Chapters 1-5The first few chapters cover the History and evolution of Android, and some discussion of the chips used to power the systems, along with a market evolution and discussion.  Chapter 5 includes an interesting discussion of Intel x86 vs Arm and then does a nice job of covering x86 architecture.  The practical need to build an x86 version for best performance is discussed along with the mention of a binary translator which assures all ARM code will run on x86 systems (pg 46 for picture and description).Chapter 6 Steps you through installing the Android SDK and covers emulation if you don't have destination hardware for testing your builds.Chapter 7 gets into the main reason for the book, how to create and port an NDK application.  Starting with a discussion of Java and using JNI to call C code, then stepping into NDK application development and the use of the Android NDK tools, Cygwin and steps to build your app and then NDK compiler optimizations, including coverage of the Intel specific switches (great summary to keep handy).Chapter 8 covers debugging and using ADB.  Very briefly there are mentions of the Intel GPA tool, JTAG debugging, device driver debugging, a brief discussion of the differences between ARM and x86 (CISC vs RISC) and one paragraph on hyper threading.Chapter 9 is the largest chapter in the book and where we get to the details performance optimizations.  They cover types of optimization, such as optimizing for speed, code size or power consumption.  Tools are again discussed, including GPA (18 pages) and VTune (10 pages).  Steps are shown for using the tools but little into understanding the data and charts.  There's 40 pages on doing a thread analysis and linking that back to the tools also.Chapter 10 looks at vectorization, IPP and steps through a sample as optimized several ways for comparison.Chapter 11 looks at using HAXM and optimizing your virtual devices.Chapter 12 finished the book by discussing performance testing and profiling apps along with platform turning.The examples and data shown were captured during Medfield timeframe so there's new hardware coming out that dates this now.  It is better than anything I've seen in the public space up to now.5 stars, I highly recommend this book as a great reference for learning and doing performance tuning, for improving your apps and taking advantage of x86 features that can set your program apart from others by superior performance.  As with all things programming wise, you'll have to understand and build on this but it's a great reference and start for your tool box of goodies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPY4FZIFRJJ22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1430261307#wasThisHelpful","RPY4FZIFRJJ22","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have pondered just how one could write a review about a book that discusses prophecy and revelation?  I decided to write about how I felt and what the book caused me to ponder as I read it and pondered the information.  I won't be giving any spoiler alerts in this review.  After all, the prophecies have been written for generations, so a spoiler seems unlikely.Reading scriptures is a very personal experience, based on one's own experiences in life, we each seem to interpret things differently and find our own messages while reading.  What I really liked about reading this book is how it opened my eyes to see things in a new way.  Reed has spent considerable time and effort carefully and precisely reading through the scriptures to gather the data that he uses to calculate the numbers and information he presents.  While one can debate an individual prophecy and determine for yourself if you feel that one has or has not happened, it takes some confidence in your research to put up those decisions for thousands and thousands of prophecies!  I admire Reed for this work and appreciated the value gained in his insights.Overall this book presents a new ways to look a prophecies, a new way to view the information, and even a new way to organize your own view of the information.  I found myself referring to the text many times as I go back and see for myself just where on Reeds timeline he has placed things.  There's always room for debate on just where one might place something but the overall theme that they are presented in order of the scriptures presentation gives a solid starting place which can be adapted as you feel for the particular prophecy you are studying.  I enjoyed that the information was presented up front and clearly identified as to how the work was done and felt that this scientific approach adds value to the work.  I have enjoyed my purchase and feel it's a great value given the work involved and the insights it has given me.  Thanks to Reed for his work.As someone who enjoys reading their scriptures, I give this work 5 stars and have really enjoyed the value and insights it has given to me personally.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7LRBTN1FTP5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRKW7RG#wasThisHelpful","R7LRBTN1FTP5J","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pretty picky with my cases.  I like the corners of the tablet protected in a drop, and the cover to have a grippy feel so that it's easy to carry and comfortable to hold.  I also like the cover to flip all the way open behind the tablet.  I saw a friend with this case, gave it an evaluation and ordered one.  Upon receiving it, I'm even happier, this is a great case.This listing is for the same case in 3 different sizes, make sure you select the size you need.  The case I ordered is designed specifically for the Galaxy Tab 3 @10""  It fits perfectly snug and has nice corners to protect my tablet in case of a fall.  The texture of the exterior of the case has a nice feel and helps keep it in your hands.  It's not too slick, not too sticky, really just right for my tastes.  It's soft with a slightly rubbery feel, and has a honey comb pattern.  The case top flips up, and you can stand up the tablet in 2 different positions by forming a triangle with the case and the tablet.  You can also flip the cover all the way around to the back and there's a convenient hand hold where you can slip your hand in through the stretchy grip and give yourself an easy way to hold the tablet without fear or dropping it using only one hand.  Freeing your other hand for tapping and using the tablet.While it's thick enough to protect the tablet, and there's a nicely padded side that is against the screen thus not marring it, it's also not too thick.  I don't like covers that are so thick they feel like a big book when I carry my devices.About the only negative with this case, and frankly there's little the case designers could do as this is a design issue w/the tablet, is that with the tablet is standing up for use in the case, you can't change it because the charge port is at the bottom.  Since my battery lasts nicely this hasn't been an issue, but if you like to use yours plugged in, this is something to know.Ok, enough of the praise, I'm really happy with this and give it a full 5 stars.  The balance of design and a nice prices even makes it all the better.  FYI when I ordered mine it wasn't on Prime, now it's an even better price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19JFR7LOULNBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3E11XY#wasThisHelpful","R19JFR7LOULNBG","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We spent the day at Disneyland using our phones to take pictures of our grand-daughter. The cell phone needed a boost and this auxiliary power did the trick. We are very happy with this tool and happy to have it around in a pinch. I've found that it can take a couple hours to fully charge, but it can charge up my iPhone 4S pretty quick.Here are the specifics. There is a micro USB connector used for input. On the input side it's rated at 1.5A (a 1.5A charger will charge it quickest). There's a full USB connector used for output. On the output side it's rated at 2.1A. There are 3 LED's internal to the case that light through the colored back cover right next to the output USB slot. When all 3 are lit, it's fully charged. Each blinks in sequence as charging, representing a third charged each. Very simple and requires no buttons or user actions to operate. The lights operate in reverse to show remaining capacity as you use it to charge your devices.To test the capacity, I ran my iPhone 4S down to 33%. I then plugged my iPhone 4S into the 5 Star America battery to charge it back up. It took about 35 minutes to get my phone back up to 67%, and it took about 90 minutes to get back up to 95%. I was able to use the backup battery to do this twice with my iPhone when I started with a fully charged backup. This is a great option, as I often drain my iPhone when I use it in tethered mode to get my laptop online and send/receive some files, sync mail and so forth. Tethering is one way to quickly drain my battery and having a backup power source really helps.As for using the backup battery, it's convenient that it has a full USB port since I can use it to charge any device that can take power from a USB port. I've tested with an iPhone 4S, and a Samsung Galaxy Tab3. The battery looks like a phone due to the black plastic front and its iPhone shape.4 stars, I am happy with this light, slim, easy to pocket and use battery.  Depending on your needs, you might consider a larger capacity (if you are charging tablets for example), but for a quick boost in a small package this is a nice option.  I was provided a sample for evaluation","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KSZJJLKRAQUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EZ71LMA#wasThisHelpful","R3KSZJJLKRAQUW","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice, medium duty trunk that is a great size for storing misc items in your truck or garage.  These are about the size of an apple box which is perfect for my needs since they will stack on my shelves and fit with my existing storage solution.  The dimensions are: Exterior 24"" x 15"" x 13""+ Interior 20"" x 12"" x 11.5"".The lid has a grid pattern on the underside to add strength.  The lid works well for supporting my weight, I use them as chairs or tables in camp.  The lid has a grooved U-shaped channel around the entire area where it mates with the base.  This gives a nice dry seal as long as the trunk is kept upright.  One interesting design choice is that the lid has the latch pieces, not the trunk base.  They snap onto the base and hold well.  There is a hole at the side of each latch that can be locked if desired.  To secure lock these would take 4 small locking devices.  A simple screw chain link would work if all you were after was a double check feature.  There are 2 hook shaped extensions on each end of the trunk to allow for securing them during transit with a bungee or rope.  They also have a nice pattern molded into the base and lids that keeps them nicely stacked and secure so they don't slide around.I have been using the Rubbermaid Action Packers for many years, they hold up well but there's a few things I would prefer were different.  When I saw these boxes and realized they addressed my concerns I picked up a couple right away to see how they worked out.  These are more square at the ends than the action packers, which allows for easier packing and loading.  While the material thickness is similar, I feel these Plano trunks are more solid.  The Plano box doesn't have a large grip area, and while it works well and I can get my whole hand in, if they are loaded heavily it'll cut into your fingers some.  Gloves are a good way to deal with that.For placing gear in mine, in particular I can fit a keyboard flat at the bottom of these Plano trunks that would not fit in an action packer.  The allows me to pack up my keyboards, laptops, tablets, stands, USB hubs and various other computer supplies as I work remotely on occasion.5 stars, I'll be getting more of these and improving my garage storage due to these nicely designed units.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROICJDZCA78ZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007TOJ9DY#wasThisHelpful","ROICJDZCA78ZQ","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was unable to find this receptacle locally at either Lowes or Home Depot, thankfully Amazon came to the rescue!  This is one sturdy piece of hardware, which is required due to the forces involved in connecting such a large plug to it.  The wires connect to the plug in individual tubes which are then clamped down with a screw that tightens up a plate attached to each terminal.  The tubes are a great way to prevent any flashing or arc inside the unit once it's in place.  I could get a nice #10 wire into each terminal easily.  As an FYI, I tried fitting a #10 and #12 into a hole to see if that would work and I could not get that to fit.  The insulation on the 2 wires caused it to be too wide to slide down into the opening.  Thus, this needs to be at the end of a run, and not in the middle as a junction.The tube design for this receptacle is exactly the same as the design used on the matching L14-30 plug as found here: Leviton 2711 30 Amp, 125/250 Volt, NEMA L14-30P, 3P, 4W, Locking Plug, Industrial Grade, Grounding - Black-White and this female plug Leviton 2713 30 Amp, 125/250 Volt, NEMA L14-30R, 3P, 4W, Locking Connector, Industrial Grade, Grounding - Black-WhiteThe receptacle comes with 3 screws and matching holes for attaching it to a box or surface.  When I bought a cover plate for my 4x4 box, I could not find one with 3 screw holes, but found several options with 2, 1 on each side.  To get what I had available to work, I drilled a hole in the receptacle and it's working well to hold to the cover plate.  I bought the 1"" deep rise face plate to get the plug some room in the 4x4 box so that the wires have space in the box.  It fits well and looks nice.  I would upload a picture, but Amazon no longer supports user pictures for whatever reason?  Too bad I really liked that feature.4 stars, the receptacle is working great, but having to drill holes and modify it to get it to work in a standard mounting bracket seems like it shouldn't be necessary.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XNGC22QCLKCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003B8T0E0#wasThisHelpful","R2XNGC22QCLKCV","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These finials have an opening on the base that is slightly larger than 5/8"" x 5/8"", more like 11/16"" each way, which gives you plenty of room to slide them onto 5/8"" square stock.  They are nicely made but I decided to grind the bottoms just a little more square before using since the halves of the mold on some didn't line up as square as I liked.  These are decorative pieces but made of thin enough cast iron that my guess is a firmly kicked soccer ball would likely break one off.  In fact, one of my 10 arrived broken due to being tossed around during shipping.  Have a spare or two on hand in case one gets broken.  These aren't industrial strength but for the price, it seems a good deal.This particular design is 5.75"" tall and 2.5"" wide at the base, looking at the design from the wide side.  From the thin side, the tip is about 3/16"" thick, and the base just above where it attaches to the square section is 3/8"" thick (double the tip thickness) and there's a smooth taper to the change in thickness.I am happy with the look and feel of mine.  I appreciate the assortment of options too.4 stars, great price on a beautiful decorative accent for my garden fencing.

"There's some confusion over 6"" vs another size for this wheel and I want to clarify that this is in fact a 6"" wheel and it does fit on my 6"" bench grinder nicely.  I have a Delta 6"" grinder and this wheel is working great for me.  I had to mess with the washers when mounting it to get it centered into the space so that it didn't rub on either side.  That is to be expected really and anytime I change out whatever I have in there this is necessary.This wire wheel brush is much stiffer than the previous one I had, and does an amazing job.  The wire bristles are very densely packed in and provide a flat surface to work with.  One really nice benefit is that after I'm done cleaning up my steel, I don't have little metal wire pieces all over because this model does not let them fly as my previous 2 wheels did.  That is really a big thing for me and I also feel causes this wheel to be much safer.  The face of this wheel is considerable wider and flat too.  It looks almost like a stone when once it's spun up it's so flat.  It's different than my previously ""softer"" wire wheels and took me a bit to get used to, but the bottom line is that I prefer how this one is working.  It does better at cleaning up my edges than my softer wheel did.5 stars, I'm very happy with the fit and durability of this wire grinding wheel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UVLNDH361CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004YMDI#wasThisHelpful","R36UVLNDH361CD","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We enjoy DoTerra essential oils and wanted a nice diffuser to get some of the great benefits into the air in our home.  This diffuser does the job and does it well.  You fill the basin with a little over an ounce of water, add a few drops of the oil you want to diffuse and turn it on.  Presto, a small misty draft will rise from the center column and begin to fill your room with the wonderful smells you desire.  The first press turns on the lights and the diffuser.  The second press turns off the lights, but leaves the diffuser on.  The third press turns it all off.  Nice feature if you don't want the LED lights on.There is an inner cap that covers the water first, and captures droplets and keeps too much vapor from rising up.  Then there's a colored cover placed over that to get the vapor rising.If I fill mine to the indicated level, and turn it on, it'll run until empty just fine.  If I overfill it, it'll turn off sooner for whatever reason?  I would prefer that the reservoir held enough water to last nearly a night's sleep.  The 3 hours isn't enough if you were trying to use it as a vaporizer for example with a child sleeping through the night.4 stars for a great diffuser, but it only holds about 3 hours worth of water.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23O0AC7AOA79F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008RODQEI#wasThisHelpful","R23O0AC7AOA79F","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this meter so that I could compare engines and determine generator setups that would be quiet enough for me to work with.  I didn't want to spend much so I picked this option, and it turns out to be a nice choice.  The meter is very simple to use, it has 2 different modes.  In the primary mode it shows you a constantly updating reading, about once a second.  In the other mode (which you press the Max button to activate), it shows you the max reading since you pressed the Max button.  This gives you the ability to show the loudest over some period of time.There is an auto-shutoff feature which is handy, and you can disable it by pressing and holding the Max button on until UOF displays, then the unit will remain on (presumably until the battery dies).  There is a nice 1/4-20 hole for a tri-pod mount which is on the back side.  Using it keeps the unit level so you can point it in the direction of a stage for example to record a max value over time.There is a very nice auto-backlight feature that works very well.  Just pass your finger over the sensor and the screen lights up.  The backlight has a varying brightness depending on how dark it is, the backlight works great and is turned perfectly for my needs, a dependable brightness when it gets dark.As for the other goodies the seller shows as part of the package, I did not receive those (the radiation and UV testers).My main criticism for this unit is that it would be nice to have some kind of average reading, say the DB average every 10 seconds, vs the constantly updating value.  Even better would be a graphical display showing a time view.  Of course for $25 what can one really expect!?4 stars, it's a handy dependable unit but has no advanced features.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KALYN5N3MC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006M00142#wasThisHelpful","R26KALYN5N3MC","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a heavy duty nicely made L14-30 female receptacle that is designed to handle 30 amps at 240v.  Each of the wires slide into a slot.  There are 2 slots on each side, they are clearly marked with W,G,X,Y for the 4 wires used.This receptacle is well made and doing the job nicely.  I firmly tighten down the #10 wire (which needs to be used to support the 30 possible amps).  It's designed to hold this size wire.I primarily use this to supply power to my welder.  The welder sits on a cart that I built with a power distribution center on it.  I run a cord from the cart over to the wall where I have an L14-30 female to plug this into.  It works well and I really like the locking connection, it keeps things plugged in if there's a little tension on the cords.The main reason for selecting this plug when I designed my welding cart is because it works with most of the 240v generators out there.  Generators use this plug because it can handle 30 amps at 240v for about 7500 watts of power (30 x 240 = 7200)  Use extreme caution if you backfeed info your home with this plug.There are 2 main concerns to watch for if you plan to backfeed power.#1, is that you MUST disconnect the main feed on the house main panel to make sure you are not trying to power up your neighborhood, and that you don't risk shocking a power line worker who might be trying to restore your power.  If the power does come back online and your generator was to be connected, you would fry your generator.#2, is that to back feed a generator with this plug, you end up with a connection setup with 2 male ends.  Those ends can be very dangerous if they have power.  Connect your wires before turning on the power at your generator to keep from having any shock risk.  If your only use for this plug is to backfeed, I suggest using this adapter instead.

"This is a heavy duty nicely made L14-30 male plug that is designed to handle 30 amps at 240v.  Each of the wires slide into an individual tube when you assemble the unit, to keep possible stay wire pieces from arcing.  There's also a screw down stress relief section that tightens down on the cord to keep the cord from tugging at the connections if you were to pull on it.  Each of the tubes where you insert the wires are clearly marked with W,G,X,Y for the 4 wires used.This plug is well made and doing the job nicely.  I firmly tighten down the #10 wire (which needs to be used to support the 30 possible amps).  It's designed to hold this size wire.  I feed mine with a 10-4 flex cable, feels like an extension cord but much thicker and pretty pricey.I primarily use this to supply power to my welder.  The welder sits on a cart that I built with a power distribution center on it.  I run a cord from the cart over to the wall where I have an L14-30 female to plug this into.  It works well and I really like the locking connection, it keeps things plugged in if there's a little tension on the cords.This link takes you to the plug I used which is also well made and they work great together.Leviton 2710 30 Amp, 125/250 Volt, Flush Mounting Locking Receptacle, Industrial Grade, Grounding, V-0-MAX, Black  Both of these pieces are available here on Amazon at a significant discount over the local big box stores.5 stars, a well-made lasting design for a great price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13EL9OEYIPJO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002NATY#wasThisHelpful","R13EL9OEYIPJO3","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife wanted to use the larger monitor on the desk instead of looking at the smaller 14"" Untrabook screen while working on assignments.  To accomplish this we needed to adapt the DVI cable from the monitor to the Intel Ultrabook mini HDMI.  Using a DVI to HDMI cable worked well connecting to the monitor, then with this adapter I down sized the HDMI connection to the Mini HDMI size that the Ultrabook has.  This adapter works well and now my wife can use the full size monitor and have less eye strain through the day.  To be clear, of all the options that include cable etc, we bought only the mini adapter that adapts from full HDMI to mini HDMI, since we already had HDMI cables.There are other ways to get video from the Ultrabook to the monitor (USB adapters) but this simple and clean solution is working well for us.  You do need to make sure that the mini adapter is fully seated in the Ultrabook, and then due to all of the pressure the longer and heavier cable is exerting we put the Ultrabook aside and don't bump it.  It stays connected fine that way.5 stars for a high quality low cost adapter that had worked well for us for months now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2OQ5PML67K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004PW1XRS#wasThisHelpful","RI2OQ5PML67K8","A32B6A532454UD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32B6A532454UD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"During the process of building a new home I had the need to run some conduit lines.  I needed a few different sizes due to the places I needed to put the conduit, and the sizes I would be using.  Having used these Dewalt hole saws years ago when building a log home I bought some new sizes and found that yet again they are winners and worked wonderfully.  I love the dual action cutting edges, just in case I end up going through a nail in the framing as I cut a hole.To be clear, these are just the hole saw portion, you will need the proper Dewalt Mandrel to screw them onto and make them useful.There are a couple of tricks to learn when using these hole saws.  The first is; I've found that rocking the drill slowly seems to work very well and keeps the hole smoothly moving along.  I use a larger Dewalt drill with a large enough opening. The standard 7/16"" Mandrel used by these won't fit into the smaller 3/8"" drills that are typical for hand held drills.  I also found that using a 120v drill made it easier and avoided any bogging as I cut through wall top plates.  My 12v drills just can't handle these.When you get through a piece of 2x4 for example, the hole saw is filled with the small hole you just cut.  You have to get the core piece out before you can drill through another layer of wood.  You can use a screw driver and sort of pry it out from the sides using the slits that are cut into the drill.  Another way is to unscrew the drill from the quick change mandrel and punch it out from the center using a screwdriver and hammer.If there's any negative with these hole saws, it's that sometimes when they are new, they are difficult to get screwed onto the mandrel the first time.  The paint is just enough to make you think you might be cross threading it.  I found that screwing it on a little, backing it off and then blowing the paint residue off and going again worked.  After a few attempts you will finally get it all of the way onto the Mandrel.

"So I found depending on what you are drying results will be different.

To shorten drying time I noticed a difference in my bathroom rug that is an inch thick. I normally have to dry then hang dry outside for all day and then bring it in and dry 2 more times for it to dry completely after washing. I was able to skip outside drying all together and I did 2 dry cycles with some other items and it came out completely dry. Normal cloths there wasn't a difference in drying time or softness to me. However with my bath towels I notice that they were softer. I have used theses a week and did small and large loads. I did 4 loads all together.

These are fine fibers and getting these caught on a little finger or toe would not be great, seeing as how even hair can cut their skin or cut off circulation.

"The first question I want answered when looking at a review is does this item work? In the case of this product its a resounding yes.The second question... Is it hard to use?  Its actually quite simple but If your the type to skip corners it can cost you, it does need to be folded over three times, while 2 seamed to work I found a droplet of water.The last question? How does this product stack up against its competitors? The price and simplicity of this bag is much better then all the other dry bags I have used, But it is not quite as light as some of the much more expensive dry bags.

This is perfect.Pros:Inexpensive.Small.Lightweight.Good selection of colors.Sounds good.Has the option of FM radio.Comes with micro SD that is interchangeable with my cell phone.Can change the language, (Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, French, Deutsche, Italian, Portuguese, Espanol, Svenska, Cesky, Dansk, Jezyk, Polski, Russian, Turkic, Hebrew, Magyar etc....)Has easy directions and also quick start directions.Cons:Headphones are very hard and do not fit my ears at all.Headphone cord is very short.Just so you know:Overall I really like this. I have had 4 days now and I have used every night at work. I personally chucked the headphones they did not fit and they where not long enough. Other than that it was easy to figure out and use.

"I bought this 12-inch wall clock for my den/TV room. I decided on this particular clock based on the 100% 5-star customer reviews at Amazon.com. When I received it, I was extremely pleased with it. It has met all my expectations by adding a great deal to the decor of my den. The frame is a perfect color, and the antique Roman numeral face reminds me of those old-time schoolhouse clocks I remember from my earliest days in elementary school.The clock has an electronic movement that operates on one ""AA"" battery. It keeps perfect time, and I find the barely audible ""tick-tick-tick"" to be quite soothing.I really like this clock!

"This is a very nice accent table that we've set next to an easy chair in our living room. It's just the right height to hold a cup of tea or coffee while looking out the window at our gardens.

"Earlier this month, almost exactly one year after initially launching its ""Prime Instant Video"" app, Amazon finally released a version that Amazon Prime members can actually use on all their Android devices. And, for the first time, it actually works as advertised!Before the Amazon ""Prime Instant Video"" app came along, there were only three ways that I knew of for me to view Amazon Instant Video (AIV) content: I could either fire up my Amazon Kindle Fire HD tablet; I could view content on my PC through the Amazon.com web site; or I could watch through a video streaming service (like Roku) that carries AIV content. Now, with the advent of the latest version of Amazon's ""Prime Instant Video"" app, I can also view AIV content on my Android-based smart phone and my 10.1-inch LG G-Pad tablet....But there is a catch to all this. The installation process for the ""Prime Instant Video"" app is unnecessarily convoluted and complicated. First you must install the ""Amazon Appstore"" app on the Android-based device you intend to use; then you must follow the link to the ""Prime Instant Video"" app, which takes the form of an .apk file. Then, and only then, can you actually install the ""Prime Instant Video"" app on your devices.Follow me so far? It gets even more interesting once the app is installed. That's because it works differently on smart phones and small-screen tablets than it does on larger screen (10-inch and above) devices. On smaller devices, the app works as a stand-alone, with its own icon. Tap on the icon, input your Amazon.com user ID and password, and you instantly have access to all Amazon Prime Instant Video content (assuming, of course, you are a member.) On larger-screen tablets, the ""Prime Instant Video"" app works like a plug-in; you still must access AIV content through the main Amazon.com web site. The difference now is that Prime members have access to all Prime content and their own personal video libraries, which they didn't have before.Because members must input their user ID and Amazon.com passwords in all cases, streaming video is actually displayed in High Definition. The app actually works quite well on all Android devices.This whole issue of access to Prime Instant Video and my personal library of purchased content has long been a sore point for me. I always felt I was being denied full access to items I had already paid for, because I couldn't always view content when I wanted; and when I could, I couldn't always view it in High Definition (for which I have always paid extra). That issue is now apparently solved, but at a cost. Unfortunately, Amazon has made the process of obtaining the ""Prime Instant Video"" app unnecessarily difficult and unwieldly. For that reason, I can only recommend this app with reservations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BX009PWMMBS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N28818A#wasThisHelpful","R2BX009PWMMBS8","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(Updated, September 28, 2015)I am a long-time user of Microsoft Office. In fact, I have owned versions of Office since Windows 95 debuted twenty years ago.Late last year, I decided to purchase a subscription to Office 365. I opted for ""Office 365 Personal"" because it was the least expensive way for me to get the software I wanted with all of the features I needed.At the time I subscribed, ""Office 365 Personal"" came with the 2013 versions of Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Word. On September 22, 2015, Microsoft released the 2016 versions of all its Office programs; I have recently updated to these latest versions. I use Excel and Word almost every day, PowerPoint infrequently, and OneNote almost never. I found the 2013 versions just different enough in appearance and functionality from my ""Office 2007 Home and School"" suite that they created a bit of a ""learning curve"" for me. It didn't take me long to adjust to the changes in the newer versions, but I discovered that I liked the 2007 version just a little bit better - enough so that I eventually gravitated back to using my tried-and-true ""Office 2007"" programs almost exclusively. Now I plan to give the 2016 versions a good workout to see if they are the ones that best suit my needs on a daily basis. My initial impression of the new versions is pretty positive.I kept my ""Office 365 Personal"" subscription active, however, and I'm very glad I did. Earlier this year, Microsoft released ""free"" versions of ""Office 365"" for Android devices. There was a catch to this release though: Android versions of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote provided only limited (what Microsoft euphemistically calls ""core"") functionality... that is, unless users happened to have an active subscription to any one of the ""Office 365"" versions. Users {like me) who do have a subscription have all of the ""Office 365"" features at their fingertips.Is ""Office 365 Personal"" worth the money spent on a subscription? If you already own any previous version of Microsoft Office, and use it only on a PC, probably not. However, the program's value rises sharply if you want to use it on any kind of Android-based mobile device. Then a subscription becomes essential and worthwhile in order to take full advantage of everything ""Office 365"" has to offer.

"Last week, my primary Blu-ray disc (BD) player, a six year-old Panasonic DMP-BD75 model,  quit working. I really wasn't surprised it broke down; it had been under nearly constant use since I bought it, frequently operating (flawlessly, I might add) for  6-8 hours per day, 7 days per week, for its entire six-year life span.I immediately began searching for a replacement. When I discovered the Panasonic DMP-BD77 BD player at Amazon, I immediately ordered it. So far, it has proven itself to be a perfect choice to replace my old machine. It's slim, lightweight, and yet durable and reliable. It flawlessly plays every BD and DVD I insert into it. Like its predecessor, it displays stunningly life-like Blu-ray video, and upscaled DVD video that approaches High Definition quality. Audio quality is also superb. The BD-77 player  automatically selects the correct audio format contained on the playing disc; formats include DTS Master Audio Multi-channel, Dolby TruHD, and several other audio formats. The BD-77 comes with an excellent remote.The Panasonic DMP-BD77 is a substantial upgrade from the BD-75 model. It actually does boot and load discs much faster. There are improvements to the firmware, including the ability to do some limited customization (i.e., user video adjustments). The BD-77 is marketed as ""wifi ready,"" which means it contains some internal wifi circuitry, but not a built-in adapter. (Buyers of this player still must purchase a $50 external USB wifi adapter in order to get the full benefits of wifi, which include access to a limited number of video streaming sites.)So far, I am very pleased with my new Panasonic DMP-BD77 Blu-ray player. I've already begun using it pretty heavily, and it's proving itself at least as durable and reliable as its older cousin. Although it lacks the very latest technology (3D, built-in wifi), it performs its core functions very well. It might not be the absolute best choice for a hi-tech home entertainment center, but it certainly can hold its own as a good, solid, reliable, basic ""workhorse"" in most living rooms.

"Sunday, May 10, 2015, marked the 75th anniversary of arguably one of the most important events of World War II, an occurrence that actually may have done more to hasten the eventual Allied victory over Nazi Germany than any other, although that couldn't be known at the time.On that day, Britain's government, led by Neville Chamberlain, fell, and a man emerged from eight years in the political ""wilderness"" to take the reins of political power...That man: Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill.Sir Winston S. Churchill has been the subject of several fine biographies in recent years. ""Winston S. Churchill,"" by Sir Martin Gilbert, is the seven-volume ""official"" biography of Britain's greatest statesman; ""Churchill: A Life,"" also by Gilbert, is an outstanding one-volume Churchill biography. Other excellent biographies have been penned by Max Hastings, Roy Jenkins, and Carlo D'Este. The best Churchill biography, however, is arguably the three-volume ""The Last Lion,"" by the late American historian William Manchester (1922-2004).""The Last Lion: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932,"" published in 1983, is the first volume of Manchester's three-volume biography covering the long life and political career of Winston S. Churchill. The second volume, ""The Last Lion: Alone, 1932-1940,"" in which Manchester tells the story of Churchill's eight years in the political ""wilderness,"" appeared in 1988. And the final volume - ""The Last Lion: Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965,"" co-authored by Manchester and Paul Reid, hit the bookshelves in November 2012.VISIONS OF GLORY, 1874-1932 (Volume I)""The Last Lion: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932"" is a superbly crafted and highly readable account of Winston S. Churchill's first 58 years, from his earliest days as the neglected first child of Lord Randolph Churchill and his American-born wife, Jennie, to his entry into the political ""wilderness"" over Indian Home Rule in 1932.Manchester's portrait of Churchill is always balanced and objective. Winston Churchill was the troubled and troublesome first son of the promiscuous and socially ambitious Jennie Churchill, and her husband, the terminally ill Lord Randolph Churchill. Young Winston constantly craved his parents' affection and attention, but was usually shunted off to boarding school by parents who saw him as a burden on their social lives.As a young adult, Churchill embarked on a military career as an army officer. He was courageous almost to the point of foolhardiness. In 1900,  he was first elected to the House of Commons, where he remained for over a half-century. He switched political parties twice - once from Conservative to Liberal, and then later on, he switched back again. In his early political career, he became one of the youngest Cabinet ministers in British history, thanks in part to his natural political instincts. As a Cabinet Minister, Churchill ensured the enactment of some of the most progressive legislation in British history. But he also exercised appalling political judgment at times; he was quick to meddle in other ministers' affairs while neglecting his own, and possessed an uncanny ability to alienate not only his political foes, but his political allies as well.The first volume of this magnificent biography ends with Churchill ""entering the political wilderness"" (being exiled to the ""back benches"" of the House of Commons) for his unpopular stand on Indian Home Rule, and for his chronic habit of irritating nearly everyone with whom he came in contact. By 1932, the verdict was in: when Russian dictator Josef Stalin inquired about Churchill, a noted British wag laughed scornfully, then sniffed: ""Churchill? Oh, he's finished!""ALONE, 1932-1940 (Volume II)""The Last Lion: Alone, 1932-1940"" is the second volume of William Manchester's brilliant biography of Winston Churchill. It is the shortest of the three volumes, and probably the best. This magnificent sequel seamlessly picks up where the first volume ends and carries Churchill's story forward through what Manchester sees as the most critical years of his life: the eight-years that encompassed Churchill's longest period in the political ""wilderness,"" and ended with his rise to power as Prime Minister of Great Britain on May 10, 1940.In ""The Last Lion: Alone, 1932-1940,"" Manchester contends that the two decades between World War Iand World War II , and not his years as wartime Prime Minister (1940-1945), were, in fact, Winston S. Churchill's personal ""finest hour."" During this critical period, while Churchill was in the ""political wilderness,"" sitting forlornly on the back benches of the House of Commons, he was one of only a handful of British politicians who foresaw the dangers posed by the Fascist dictators. He had the necessary expertise to speak out effectively in favor of increased military preparedness as a means of countering the growing Nazi threat in Europe, and the courage to decry his own government's appeasement policies. Despite Hitler's takeover of the Rhineland, Austria, and Czechoslovakia during the 1930s, successive British governments continued to ignore Churchill and appease Germany. Only after Hitler ignited World War II by invading Poland, and it became obvious that all attempts to placate the Nazi dictator had failed, did the British people turn to Winston Churchill to lead them.DEFENDER OF THE REALM, 1940-1965 (Vol. III)William Manchester had begun researching the third volume of his ""The Last Lion"" triptych even before the publication of ""The Last Lion: Alone, 1932-1940."" By 1998, he  had apparently completed only a small portion of the manuscript for his final volume, which he had tentatively entitled ""The Last Lion: Defender of the Realm 1940-1965.""  He had become aware of the fact that he could no longer write due increasingly poor health, and so he asked Paul Reid, a close friend and an excellent writer, to complete the book. Manchester died in 2004, leaving a reluctant Reid to carry on his work.The results of Reid's efforts are simply outstanding. Relying on Manchester's copious notes and partially completed manuscript, as well as his own scholarly research, Reid crafted a monumental, highly readable, and historically accurate 1,182-page volume that recounts the final 25 years of Churchill's life. ""Defender of the Realm"" correctly concentrates on Churchill's time as Britain's Prime Minister during World War II, when he demonstrated all his greatest personality traits - courage, dogged determination, tenacity, and persuasiveness - in leading his nation, especially while it was under attack by the Nazis. Manchester and Reid also recount Churchill's relationship with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, contending that, while their relationship was initially close, it became less so as the war dragged on, American forces took a more prominent role in achieving victory, and Roosevelt saw less need for Churchill as a wartime partner.  The authors also recount Churchill's later life: his defeat as Prime Minister in 1945; his re-election in 1950; his retirement; his declining health; and his death in 1965, at age 90.I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Last Lion: Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965."" When I first began reading it shortly after its publication, I did so with a bit of trepidation. How would Reid's research, writing style, and historical accuracy measure up against the great William Manchester? I needn't have worried. I found it difficult to detect where Manchester leaves off and Reid begins. Overall, I think Reid's prose is a bit more wordy than Manchester's, and perhaps not as lively. But the book's historical accuracy is based on sound, thoroughly documented research, and is beyond scrutiny. I own ""The Last Lion: Visions of Glory, 1874-1932,"" "" The Last Lion: Alone, 1932-1940,"" and ""The Last Lion: Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965. ""  All three volumes  clearly demonstrate why William Manchester was one of the pre-eminent historians and biographers of his day, and also why Paul Reid was absolutely the best choice to complete Manchester's work. These volumes are written with obviously meticulous scholarship, insightful analysis, and crisp, sparkling prose; there is no better account of Churchill's life anywhere in print. Most highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29T7CQT6LKNTX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316227781#wasThisHelpful","R29T7CQT6LKNTX","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Caine Mutiny"" is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Herman Wouk. Written in 1950, it tells the story of a fictional mutiny that takes place aboard a decrepit U.S. Navy destroyer- minesweeper during World War II.This is an outstanding novel in every respect. It tells its story through the eyes of Ensign Willie Keith, a newly minted naval reserve officer who reports aboard the ""USS Caine"" as his first assignment. The ""Caine"" is a broken down, World War I vintage ""rust-bucket,"" with a slovenly  crew and an outwardly hard-nosed captain, Lt. Commander William DeVriess. Keith and DeVriess take an immediate dislike to each other, and are constantly at odds.Keith is glad when DeVriess is relieved as ship's captain by Lt. Commander Philip Queeg, who appears at first as an outwardly affable but by-the-book officer. Hopes initially rise that life aboard the ""Caine"" will get better, but it soon becomes evident that things are going to be much worse under Queeg's command. A series of incidents occur that show Queeg to be an incompetent commander; an overbearing tyrant who browbeats his officers and crew, blames everyone else but himself for his mistakes, displays cowardice under fire, obsesses about petty incidents aboard ship, and displays personality traits that reveal an unstable mind.Three of the ""Caine's"" officers - Keith, Lt. Tom Keefer, and  the ship's executive officer, Lt. Steve Maryk - all  eventually become convinced that Queeg is so mentally unstable that he should be replaced as captain of the ""Caine."" Maryk and Keefer initially intend to request Queeg's relief from higher headquarters, but back out at the last minute.Soon after that, the ""Caine"" finds itself as one of several ships riding out a typhoon in the Pacific. The ship is soon in mortal danger; Queeg issues a series of orders that will only make matters worse for the ship, possibly resulting in its loss with all hands. Maryk countermands Queeg's orders and relieves the captain. Keith and Keefer are present at the time and concur with Maryk's decisions.I won't give away any more of the story. You'll have to read this outstanding novel to find out what happens to the ""Caine"" and its officers and crew.I first read ""The Caine Mutiny"" when I was still in high school, some forty-plus years ago. I re-read it just a few short weeks ago, and enjoyed it just as much the second time I read it as I did the first. It's one of those good, old-fashioned novels that has a fascinating plot, extremely well-developed characters, and a style of prose that keeps readers engaged throughout its 500-plus pages. Above all, ""The Caine Mutiny"" book entertains. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF6QCAAL4WD5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NLFJ80#wasThisHelpful","RF6QCAAL4WD5W","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 1 ended in May 2001, it had firmly entrenched itself as one of my all-time favorite shows. With its superb cast and intelligently written, suspenseful episodes, it was one of only a very few shows that I would make time to watch every week.""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 2, which premiered in September 2001, was just as strong as the inaugural season. Once again, viewers are transported to the grave shift at the Las Vegas crime lab. Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and his crack team of field investigators Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), Nick Stokes (George Eads), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), tackle a series of cases that certainly challenge every one of their investigative and deductive skills. They are assisted by several ""lab rats"" - technicians who work inside the crime lab in their own specialties. Most notable among them are Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda), the DNA technician; Archie Johnson (Archie Kao), the electronics whiz; and Bobby Dawson (Gerald McCullough), the firearms and ballistics expert. Rounding out the night shift is Captain Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle), a hard-boiled, cynical detective who serves as the police department's liaison with the crime lab.""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 2 has several notable episodes, including ""Slaves of Las Vegas,"" where Grissom and his team investigate a murder at a fetish house run by dominatrix Lady Heather; ""Identity Crisis,"" where serial killer Paul Millander returns from Season 1 and once again proves himself one of Gil Grissom's most puzzling and sinister nemeses; and ""Cross Jurisdictions,"" where the Las Vegas crime lab joins forces with the ""CSI: Miami"" team in order to investigate and solve a series of grisly murders at both locations.These and other episodes of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"" Season 2 continue the very high standards of excellence established in Season 1, and confirm this show as the best police procedural drama of its generation... and perhaps of all time. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2UKW95ZTX2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000A2ZNL#wasThisHelpful","R3I2UKW95ZTX2N","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've slowly been replacing some old, worn out pieces of living room furniture with newer and more stylish ones. So far, we've mostly been successful, as we've added an excellent Avenue Six Curves Tufted Chair. Chocolate Fabric, and another bonded leather accent chair. We've also met with less success, as one chair we ordered turned out to be be unsuitable for our needs.The final addition to our living room is also the best: this Homelegance 9734DB-1 upholstered chair. This is a stunningly beautiful chair made from both bonded leather and bicast material. When we unboxed it, we found a beautiful, well-built, dark brown chair with a thickly padded, leather-like covering that was obviously very well stitched together. It looks great in our living room!This chair is extremely comfortable. The seating area is both wide and deep enough to accommodate my large, slightly overweight frame. The seat cushion has just the right amount of firmness to give me plenty of back and leg support, without being too hard. The back cushion is very soft and plush, and feels like a large, luxurious leather-covered pillow.Chair assembly was very simple. We took it out of the box, screwed the legs on, flipped the hinged back plate into its upright position, and added the seat and back cushions. (Both cushions are held in place with Velcro strips.) Then we sat down and enjoyed the comfort...I have one minor gripe: the Homelegance 9734DB-1 chair shipped with plastic legs rather than wooden ones. Although it's very hard to detect what the legs are made from, I do think a  piece of furniture of such obviously high quality as this deserves wooden legs rather than plastic ones.Despite this one very slight imperfection in an otherwise perfect chair, I'm awarding it five stars and my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R356GNZEVU3OYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U256FS4#wasThisHelpful","R356GNZEVU3OYK","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There are several backgrounds, card backs, and card faces to choose from. Card faces are of the traditional design and are especially noteworthy for their fine detail. Game play is silky-smooth on all of my Android devices, including my Kindle Fire HD7,  and is especially impressive on my new LG G Pad 10.1-inch tablet. Touch screen response is very good. I can either tap or drag and drop cards in order to move them, and I can undo and redo moves whenever I wish.The app keeps a comprehensive list of statistics for each game I play, letting me know win-loss record and percentage; average score; and average time to finish a game.""Solitaire MegaPack"" is hands down the biggest and best package of solitaire games that I've found for my Android devices.

"I've always carried all my mobile devices in some kind of protective case, so when I purchased my new LG G Pad V700 10.1-inch tablet two weeks ago, I also bought this Fintie LG G Pad 10.1 Smart Shell Case. It is an outstanding product in every way. It fits my new tablet perfectly, holding it snugly in place, and giving it the maximum protection it needs. With its ultra-thin design, it also looks great.The Fintie LG G Pad 10.1 Smart Shell case is obviously very well constructed from excellent quality materials. The back is made from a sturdy hard-shell plastic, and the flexible front cover is made from a faux leather exterior and a soft microfiber lining. When the front cover is closed over the tablet's screen, it's held in place magnetically; in this position, it automatically puts the tablet to sleep, thereby preserving battery life. When the cover is opened, it automatically awakens the tablet. The front cover can also be folded to form a stand for my tablet.I really don't think I could have found a better made, more effective case for my new tablet than this Fintie LG G Pad 10.1 Smart Shell case.

"Over the years, I've tried several Mahjong-style tile matching games on my Android devices, and  Ta Dah Apps' ""Mahjong Pro"" is clearly the best I've found to date.

"Over the past couple of years, I've been collecting DVD sets of my most favorite television series. At the top of my list of favorites is ""NCIS."" I recently acquired the show's 11th season on DVD; I now have every season available on DVD (to date) of this outstanding show in my collection.""NCIS,"" of course, is the long-running, very popular police procedural crime drama that, as of this writing, has completed its 12th season and has been renewed for a 13th.  It has aired on CBS on Tuesday nights at 8:00 since it premiered in 2003. The show revolves around the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), an actual civilian-run law enforcement agency of the U.S. Navy. It follows the investigations of the Major Case Response Team (MCRT) located at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC.  Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), leads this team, which is made up of Special Agents Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly); Eleanor Bishop (Emily Wickersham) (who replaced the departed Cote de Pablo midway through Season 11); Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), Chief Medical Examiner Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum),  and forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette.)I wish I could write that ""NCIS"" Season 11, which ran from September 2013 through May 2014, is every bit as good the show's previous seasons, but unfortunately I can't. From the outset, this particular season simply doesn't live up to the very high standards set in prior years.  To be sure, there are some good story arcs and excellent single episodes, but overall, I have the impression that the scripts are generally a bit lackluster, and the actors don't have as much of the fire"" they had possessed in earlier seasons. In short:  the show seems to be losing steam.I'm guessing that at least some of the reason for this may lie in the rather sudden departure of series regular Cote de Pablo, whose character (Ziva David)  was tremendously popular with viewers.  In previous seasons, de Pablo's character made for some of the most outstanding ""NCIS"" episodes of all time, and her departure seems to have left a void that may have ""wrong-footed"" producers, writers, and actors alike. Early in the season, an inordinate amount of time seems to have been spent casting about for a ""Ziva"" replacement; her eventual successor, ""Ellie Bishop,"" (played by Emily Wickersham) paled in comparison to ""Ziva,"" and proved unpopular with ""NCIS"" fans.There were some bright spots during ""NCIS"" Season 11. The story arc involving the hunt for terrorist Benham Parsa was both interesting and exciting. The two-part back-door pilot for ""NCIS: New Orleans"" (episodes entitled (""Crescent City Parts I and II,"" with guest stars Scott Bakula, Lucas Black, and Zoe McClellan) hearkened back to ""NCIS's"" best days, when episodes were consistently tense, taut, interesting, and unpredictable. In contrast, other episodes in Season 11 seem rather slow-moving and bland.As of this writing, another year has passed, and ""NCIS"" now has its 12th season ""in the can.""  Fortunately, my favorite show appears to have rebounded nicely during Season 12, once again showing some of its old fire and passion, and leaving viewers at season's end  with a suspenseful cliff-hanger that will keep people talking and guessing throughout the summer of 2015...Although ""NCIS"" Season 11 is a bit of a letdown compared to previous seasons, it's still good, solid entertainment that's certainly well worth watching.

"With a number of mobile devices now in our home, we spend a lot of time wiping fingerprints and other smudges from touch screen glass.

"I've recently started bicycling again, after being away from it for about 20 years. I wanted a brightly colored shirt to provide the high visibility I need while riding on the busy country roads near my home. I chose this particular road cycling jersey because of its very bright yellow color, and its reasonable price.The jersey is pretty well sewn together with a light but sturdy fabric. Stitching is good all the way around. Unfortunately, the sizes appear to run very small. I am 6 feet, 3 inches  tall and have a bit of an expanded waistline that I am trying very hard to reduce (which is why I've started cycling again).  I purchased this jersey in the largest size available (XX), which is the usual  size I buy for all my pullover shirts. I was barely able to squeeze into this one; it fit too snugly around my midsection, and made me feel pretty uncomfortable.It's too bad, because this really is a decent enough product.

"Looking for an opponent for a game or two of checkers? Look no further than AI Factory's ""Checkers."" This is an outstanding Android version of the ancient and venerable board game called ""checkers"" or ""draughts.""

"I am a hard-core Scrabble junkie. A few weeks ago I came across a copy of ""Scrabble Champion Edition"" at a neighborhood yard sale. I purchased it in the hope that I would FINALLY find a version that would work correctly on my Windows 8.1 laptop......I was not disappointed. ""Scrabble Champion Edition,"" which dates from 2006 and is listed as compatible only with Windows Vista, XP, Me, 2000, and 98, is the first (and only) version I've found that works flawlessly when running in Windows 8.1. The game installed in a matter of seconds. Graphics are OK; certainly not cutting-edge high definition, but still crisp, clear, colorful and appealing to the eye. (Video resolution appears to be set at 1024 x 768, and cannot be adjusted.)Game play is exactly what I expected. The program has two modes: ""Classic"" (no time limits) and ""Speed"" (time limits that can be adjusted by the user.) The game has eight difficulty levels ranging from ""Beginner"" (ridiculously easy, but great for kids) to ""Genius"" (ridiculously hard, nearly impossible to beat). I usually play at either the ""Intermediate"" or ""Veteran"" levels, and win slightly less than 50 percent of the time. ""Scrabble Champion Edition"" appears to follow the standard rules of Scrabble meticulously; it has never given me cause to think it ""cheats.""My one and only gripe about ""Scrabble Champion Edition:"" you must insert the CD-ROM into your computer's drive each time you want to play the game. This is an outdated and very annoying form of copy-protection that causes me to deduct one star from my overall rating of an otherwise perfect game.  Nevertheless, I still think it's the best Scrabble version that I've found for Windows-based PCs.

"With my keen interest in historical and biographical dramas, the movie ""Selma"" was a natural for me to want to see. I recently watched it through Amazon Instant Video, and came away very impressed. ""Selma"" is an altogether brilliant film that features standout performances by David Oyelowo as Martin Luther King, Jr., Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King, Tom Wilkinson as President Lyndon B. Johnson, Oprah Winfrey as Annie Lee Cooper, Tessa Thompson as Diane Nash, and Andre Holland as Andrew Young, as well as many others.""Selma,"" superbly directed by Ava DuVernay, tells how Martin Luther King led the African American fight to secure equal voting rights through a series of highly publicized, non-violent marches in Selma, Alabama in the early months of 1965, culminating in a 50-mile march from Selma to Montgomery, the capital of Alabama.  ""Selma"" shows how King was able to first overcome the resistance of leaders within the Civil Rights movement, as well as the opposition of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.Key scenes in the film include the killing of protestor Jimmie Lee Jackson by an Alabama state trooper; the civil rights marchers' first attempt to march from Selma to Montgomery, which resulted in state and local police, using heavy riot gear, making an unprovoked attack on unarmed demonstrators at the Edmund Pettus Bridge (an event known as ""Bloody Sunday"");  the murder of civil rights activist James Reeb by a mob of local segregationists; and two subsequent attempts by civil rights activists to march from Selma to Montgomery.""Selma's"" historical accuracy has been the source of some controversy, mainly from the way it portrays the relationship between King and Johnson as being confrontational. A key Johnson political appointee maintains to this day that the protests planned for Selma were Johnson's, and not King's, idea. Witnesses to a meeting between King and Johnson insist that no argument between the two ever took place.DuVernay maintains that her film is accurate, saying that ""...the notion of  the Selma protests being Johnson's idea was 'jaw-dropping and offensive' to African Americans and veterans of the Civil Rights movement."" Even if discussions between King and Johnson had become heated, I seriously doubt that King would have spoken to the President with the level of intensity (bordering on insolence) that's depicted in the film. Despite this controversy, I think ""Selma"" maintains a pretty good degree of historical accuracy, taking into consideration the need to compress and alter some events for the sake of a two-hour film. I certainly came away from watching ""Selma"" having a strong feeling for what the times must have been like in the Deep South of the mid-1960s.I enjoyed ""Selma"" tremendously, and have now watched it several times. (I now own a digital copy of the film through Amazon Instant Video.) It's one of the few films that I think is good enough to take an honored place in my Blu-ray collection as well.

"Over the past few weeks, I've been getting pestered with a lot of phone calls from my Internet service provider (Comcast), saying that my old cable modem no longer meets the company's minimum technical requirements, and that I was likely to see slower performance and increased instability of online services. Even though I was a bit skeptical about Comcast's claims, and my old modem was still hanging in there, I went ahead and upgraded anyway.I decided to purchase an Arris/Motorola Surfboard SB6121 cable modem for my upgrade. This is a DOCSIS 3.0 device that, so far, has proven to be an excellent performer and a significant improvement over my old cable modem. Ever since I brought it online about a week ago, my wife and I have both seen a distinct improvement in online performance and stability across all our devices. Web pages on our laptops seem to load considerably faster; our smart phones exhibit a snappier response to our inputs; and, most noticeably, streaming video is much clearer, smoother, and faster on all of our devices.The new Surfboard SB6121 was very easy to install; I simply disconnected my old modem from my Linksys WRT54G router, and plugged the new one in. I did have to call Comcast and provide the MAC Address for my new modem. I was (surprisingly) able to get through very quickly to a technical support representative, so the entire installation and setup process took only about 15 minutes.The Arris/Motorola Surfboard SB6121 cable modem meets mimimum requirements recommended by most leading cable internet service providers.

"""3 Games to Glory IV"" is a 3-Blu-ray disc (BD) set that serves as a perfect summary of the New England Patriots' highly successful playoff run at the end of the 2014 NFL season. As is well known, that playoff run ended with the Patriots winning Super Bowl XLIX on February 1, 2015.""3 Games to Glory IV"" is a unique and absolutely outstanding production in every way.  Instead of summarizing the entire 2014 season, it focuses solely on the three games played - and won - by the New England Patriots in the 2014 postseason.  Each of the three BDs contained in this set spotlights one of the three Patriots playoff games: the Divisional Playoff game, AFC Championship game, and Super Bowl XLIX.NFL Films once again employs its brilliantly conceived combination of regular speed and slow-motion photography, excellent music, and sounds from ""miked-up"" players and coaches. Clips of every play of each game are woven seamlessly together to form a smooth-flowing narrative of each game, with play-by-play and color commentary provided by Patriots radio announcers Bob Socci and Scott Zolak. The mellifluous voice of narrator Scott Graham also provides spare but essential narration where needed.  All non-essential ""dead time"" - the time between plays, replays, time-outs, etc., has been removed, so each full game takes less than one hour to watch.""3 Games to Glory IV"" contains a wealth of special features that I found especially entertaining. On each BD, viewers will find postgame press conferences and interviews with Tom Brady, Bill Belichick, and other standout players, as well as Belichick's game breakdown for the game featured on the disc. Several other very entertaining short features are included as well. It's important to note that none of the controversy surrounding ""Deflate-gate"" and Tom Brady's possible role in it are addressed anywhere in ""3 Games to Glory IV,"" although ""Deflate-gate"" is mentioned once in passing. The focus of the entire set is football as it was played during the 2014 postseason.The main programs and all special features of the Blu-ray version of ""3 Games to Glory IV""  are presented in high definition video that is crisp, clean, shows no artifacts, and has perfectly balanced color. The video has a wonderfully filmic quality to it. Each disc also employs DTS-HD Master Audio 2-channel stereo which brought a surprisingly immersive sound into my viewing area.""3 Games to Glory IV"" is an outstanding addition to the long and illustrious series of NFL films that commemorate team championships.

"""Farewell: The Greatest Spy Story of the Twentieth Century"" is an altogether fascinating look at what is perhaps the most important and devastating espionage case of the Cold War era. Written by Russian journalist and espionage expert Sergei Kostin and French screenwriter Eric Raynaud, ""Farewell"" tells the story of Vladimir Ippolitovich Vetrov, a mid-level KGB officer who was also a spy for the French intelligence service known as the DST.During the years 1981-82, Vetrov, code-named ""Farewell"" by his French handlers, gave the DST thousands of pages of highly classified documents containing many of the Soviet Union's most closely guarded secrets. The government of France shared this information with its allies, most notably U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Vetrov's information proved invaluable to the West; it included the names of double agents working on behalf of the Soviets, and provided details on the myriad of technological and military secrets that those agents were able to steal from Western sources. Many analysts believe that the information provided by Vetrov enabled Western leaders to make key policy-making decisions that ultimately led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.I really enjoyed the book ""Farewell."" Authors Kostin and Raynaud certainly packed a tremendous amount of information into the book's 390-plus pages. They tell Vetrov's story in a pretty straightforward manner - how he went from being a young man of great promise, and how he became, in his later years, a disillusioned alcoholic, a philanderer, a murderer, and a traitor to his country. Kostin and Raynaud do an excellent job of both conveying what Vetrov did, and providing a thoughtful, reasoned analysis of why he did it.""Farewell"" was originally written in French, and was expertly translated into English by Catherine Cauvin-Higgins. Kostin and Raynaud's clear, concise, and always elegant prose loses none of its power and authoritativeness in the translation. It remains easy to read and understand, and very enjoyable.

Tempi are again perfect, and each sonata is again played with tremendous warmth and vitality.

"I've just finished watching ""American Sniper"" on Amazon Instant Video. My first impression: all I can do is add one more voice to the litany of rave reviews written about this remarkable film starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller, and directed by Clint Eastwood. I share the view of many that ""American Sniper"" is a brilliantly acted, written, and directed film. Without question, I think it's the best post-9/11 war film I have ever seen, and perhaps one of the best war films ever.Bradley Cooper is magnificent as Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who is credited as the most deadly sniper in American history.  I was especially glad to see Kyle portrayed as both a staunch patriot and a man of conscience. He obviously felt a deep sense of regret any time he had to take a life, but he did not let any remorse he felt deter him from doing his duty for his country and for his fellow combatants. Sienna Miller was equally brilliant in her role as Kyle's devoted wife Taya. I thought the on-screen chemistry between Cooper and Miller definitely added to the beauty of the film.Although I now own a digital copy of ""American Sniper"" on Amazon Instant Video, I think it is one of those very rare and special films that also deserves an honored place in my Blu-ray collection.

"""Spy: The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed America"" is a highly informative and very well-written book about the most damaging espionage case in United States history. For 22 years, beginning in 1979 and ending with his arrerst in 2001, Robert Philip Hanssen, a counterintelligence agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, sold secrets to various intelligence agencies of the Soviet Union and Russia. It's estimated that Hanssen handed over 6,000 pages of classified documents to the Soviets; warned the Soviets of the existence of several agents working for American clandestine services, warnings that resulted in those agents' execution or imprisonment; and gave the Soviets the United States' continuity of government plan. For these and many other traitorous actions, Hanssen was paid an estimated $600,000, with an additional $800,000 held in escrow by the Soviet government.""Spy"" was written by David Wise, who is an American journalist recognized as an authority on espionage and intelligence subjects. His expertise certainly is evident in this short but information-packed book. In the space of 320 pages, Wise narrates in his clear, concise, and easy to understand prose how Hanssen began his career as an FBI agent and, at the same time, a Soviet mole within the FBI. Wise explains how Hanssen was able to carry on his espionage activities undetected for over two decades. Wise also explores the connection between Hanssen's ultra-conservative Catholicism and his spying; and provides an overview of Hanssen's sexual peccadilloes, including his secret video-taping of himself having sex with his wife, and then his selling of those tapes to third parties, and his affair with a stripper.""Spy"" may be about as comprehensive an account of the Robert Hanssen case as readers are likely to get.  David Wise not only covers what Hanssen did, but also provides a thorough analysis of why he did it. This is a brilliantly written, disturbing,  but essential account of  America's worst-ever spy.

"""Person of Interest""  is a tense, taut crime/technological thriller that immediately engages and compels viewers with its highly innovative stories and superb acting from a first-rate cast that includes Michael Emerson, Jim Caviezel, Taraji P.

The show's main characters are Harold Finch (Emerson) and John Reese (Caviezel), two men who live in the shadows. Finch is a multi-billionaire computer designer and software developer who created a super-computer for the government; Reese is a former CIA agent and Special Forces soldier, now working for Finch as a ""fixer"" and enforcer.Finch's super-computer, which he calls ""The Machine,"" can sift through trillions of megabytes of data and then predict terrorist crimes against the United States.  But Finch's ""machine"" not only can predict all future terrorist threats; it can also foretell every other future crime as well - felonies the government considers ""too insignificant"" to do anything about.Finch, suffering from a severe permanent physical injury, feels honor-bound to do something to help stop those ""insignificant"" crimes before they happen. He enlists the assistance of a down-and-out, homeless, alcoholic Reese, who reluctantly agrees to be Finch's agent in the field.Complicating matters for both Finch and Reese is the fact that Reese is being hunted by both the CIA and the FBI, who consider him a major threat to national security; and by the NYPD, who suspects him of committing a series of unsolved murders.""Person of Interest"" is a terrific show on many levels. The acting is superb. Emerson and Caviezel maintain a quiet, reserved demeanor, a characteristic that adds tremendous credibility to each character's persona. Supporting actors, especially Taraji P. Henson who plays NYPD Detective Carter, and Kevin Chapman, who plays Detective Fusco, are equally good in their roles.But what sets ""Person of Interest"" apart from other new shows (most of which try to bring something ""fresh"" and ""different"" to their story lines) is that this show actually does that. Each episode creates a chilling, almost paranoid atmosphere from beginning to end.All of this adds up to a show that quietly and poses a question we all must grapple with: is vigilante justice ever an acceptable means of preventing or solving crimes? It's a question the show's creators and producers have wisely left unanswered, for even though viewers can see the positive results of Reese's and Finch's efforts, they should carefully consider the means used to achieve their desired ends.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U2CH6CRBV3VH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053O8AKU#wasThisHelpful","R3U2CH6CRBV3VH","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Beethoven: Complete Violin Sonatas Volume 1"" is the first of two volumes containing all ten of the violin sonatas composed by Ludwig van Beethoven. Simply put, these performances are brilliant in every way. In these recordings from 1979 and 1980, Austrian pianist Ingrid Haebler and Polish violinist Henryk Szeryng combine to play each of Beethoven's Violin Sonatas Nos. 1-5 with incomparable artistry. Their musicianship exudes tremendous warmth and vitality, and the obviously special chemistry between them is in no way diminished by the slightly thin tonal quality of Szeryng's violin. Both of Beethoven's violin romances, performed by Szeryng and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under the baton of conductor Bernard Haitink, also appear in this volume, and are no less beautifully performed. This is one of the finest recordings of Beethoven's violin sonatas available. Most highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UZ01ZW6KYSAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041CR#wasThisHelpful","R1UZ01ZW6KYSAC","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""NCIS"" is a police procedural crime drama that, as of this writing, is in its 12th season on CBS, where it has aired on Tuesday nights at 8:00 since it premiered in 2003. The show revolves around the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), an actual civilian-run law enforcement agency of the U.S. Navy. It follows the investigations of the Major Case Response Team (MCRT) located at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, DC.  Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs (Harmon), leads this team, which is made up of Special Agents Tony DiNozzo (Michael Weatherly); Ziva David (Cote de Pablo, since departed the series and replaced by Emily Wickersham), Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), Chief Medical Examiner Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard (David McCallum),  and forensics expert Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette.)""NCIS"" Season 9, which ran from September 2010 through May 2011 and certainly ranks as one of the show's strongest seasons ever, picks up right where Season 8 ended in May 2010. In the final episode of Season 8, Gibbs' team had just solved an extremely trying case that had resulted in great sadness for all the team members, especially Gibbs.  Special Agent Tony DiNozzo had been given a special assignment: find and ""take care of"" a suspected rogue NCIS agent...In the Season 9 opener, repercussions from that recently solved case at the end of Season 8 continue to shake up Gibbs' team. DiNozzo is in the hospital suffering from injuries sustained in a shootout with unknown assailants. Forensic evidence suggests he may have shot at least one other NCIS agent. Now Gibbs must find answers: did  DiNozzo in fact shoot someone? If so, whom? Are they dead or alive?Subsequent episodes from this superb ninth season of ""NCIS"" introduce viewers to Special Agent Tim McGee's grandmother, Abby Sciuto's brother, and a new love interest for ""Ducky"" Mallard. New cases involve a civilian government contractor gone rogue while developing a secret weapon of mass destruction; a Marine gone missing in Afghanistan; threats to a Navy Congressional liaison officer; and the murders of a beloved Marine Corps enlisted man and a Coast Guard officer. And, in the series' landmark 200th episode, ""Life Before His Eyes,"" Gibbs is forced to relive some painful memories and try to find answers to a series of ""what if...?"" questions concerning some of his past actions.In each of Season 9's 24 episodes, viewers are treated to ""NCIS's"" patented, perfect blend of suspense, drama, forensic science, and comedy, all provided by the best ensemble cast and writers in all of broadcast TV. The inevitable result: a consistently taut, suspenseful, action-packed show that's laced with humor, and is a sure bet to captivate and entertain viewers everywhere. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PWMAU4AVFB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005PYKNJY#wasThisHelpful","R20PWMAU4AVFB2","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Yahoo! Mail"" has been my preferred email service provider for over ten years now. I've been using the Android-based ""Yahoo! Mail"" app on all my mobile devices ever since I got my first smart phone in 2012. Unfortunately, I've had decidedly mixed results with it over the last three years.The app has always done a reasonably good job of executing its most basic tasks of receiving and notifying me of my incoming email messages; from that standpoint it performs well. However, I have periodically experienced many frustrating problems with it. At times the app would open very slowly or not open at all. For one three-month period, it would open intermittently with an annoying message about ""conversations"" splashed across the middle of the screen. At other times I experienced occasions when the app's responsiveness to my touch screen inputs was very sluggish at best. It's important to note that these problems were not limited to just one device, but spanned all four of my devices on which it is installed.Yahoo continues to update its Android-based email app, and for the last six months I have seen significant improvements in its overall stability, usability, and performance. ""Yahoo Mail"" now opens much faster, doesn't display any useless and bothersome messages upon startup, and seems consistently much more responsive to my inputs. The app's attractive interface also seems more intuitive, customizable, and user-friendly.Perhaps there is hope for the future of ""Yahoo! Mail"" after all. Recommended with caution.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HLZNIEN8JZFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00632HWOG#wasThisHelpful","R3HLZNIEN8JZFO","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Yahoo! Fantasy Sports"" is a very good app that allows me to manage all of my Yahoo! fantasy sports teams from one central point on all my Android-based mobile devices. Before 2012, Yahoo! had provided an individual app for each of its fantasy sports. I've been playing fantasy baseball, football, and basketball for several years, so that meant that, up until 2012, I was required to maintain three different Yahoo! apps on my devices at all times.  All that changed in 2012, when Yahoo! released its ""Fantasy Sports"" app that covers all of its fantasy sports offerings. Now  I can  open one app, select whatever fantasy sport I want to play, and go from there.My ""Yahoo! Fantasy Sports"" app works very well. With it, I can do almost everything on my  mobile devices that I can do on my laptop computer. (There are a few actions that do require the use of a computer.) The ""Yahoo! Fantasy Sports"" app's interface is clean, attractive, consistent across all covered sports (with minor interface customizations for each sport), and very easy to learn and operate. Graphics are excellent, and the app responds very quickly to my touch screen inputs. The app has never given me any problems.Overall I am very satisfied with the ""Yahoo! Fantasy Sports"" app. Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32HGUFJ0V95AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KC29YA#wasThisHelpful","R32HGUFJ0V95AH","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Eagles: The Very Best Of"" is a superb compilation of 33 songs written and recorded by the Eagles from 1972 to 2001.  Originally released by Warner Brothers in 2003, this 2-CD set contains the very best of everything the Eagles had recorded up to 2001.""Eagles: The Very Best Of""  isn't really a ""greatest hits"" album per se;  Not all of the songs contained in this compilation were released as singles, and therefore don't qualify as ""greatest hits."" That means listeners get to hear not only all of the Eagles' brilliantly performed mega-hits; they also get to hear some of their lesser known but equally superb ""non-hits"" as well.Disc 1 contains most of the Eagles' mega-hits recorded between 1971 and 1975, all placed in chronological order. Included are: ""Take it Easy,"" ""Peaceful Easy Feeling,"" ""Lyin' Eyes,"" ""One of These Nights,"" and  ""Hotel California,"" as well as a few interesting choices from that period that weren't huge hits: ""Doolin-Dalton,"" ""James Dean,"" ""Ol' 55,"" and ""After the Thrill is Gone."" I think these are absolutely superb choices for any anthology of Eagles songs.At the outset of Disc 2 are more tracks from  ""Hotel California:"" ""Life in the Fast Lane,"" ""The Last Resort"" and ""New Kid in Town,"" followed by hits from ""The Long Run"" (the Eagles' last  studio album for over 20 years). Most notable are: ""Those Shoes,"" ""In the City,"" and ""The Sad Café.""  The disc finishes on a somber note with a bonus song: ""Hole in the World,"" written in commemoration of the events of September 11, 2001.Listeners will be able to quickly discern The Eagles' evolution from a country-rock band in the early 1970s, with their flowing vocal harmonies, to the edgier hard-rock band they became in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Listeners can also recognize the band's personnel changes over the years: Randy Meisner's soaring lead vocal on 1975's ""Take It to the Limit;"" Joe Walsh's whiskey-soaked voice belting out 1979's ""In the City"" and Timothy B. Schmit's exquisitely refined tenor voice singing two of the Eagles' most beautiful love ballads, ""I Can't Tell You Why"" (1980) and ""Love Will Keep Us Alive"" (1994).The sound quality of ""Eagles: The Very Best Of""  is superb.  Audio is crisp and sharp throughout, with  an  excellent balance between vocals, harmonies, and the superb instrumental work of Joe Walsh, Glenn Frey, Timothy B. Schmit, and Don Henley.""Eagles: The Very Best Of"" is unquestionably the best compilation of Eagles songs I've ever heard.  It's ""classic rock"" entertainment at its very best, and a ""must-own"" for all Eagles fans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SOB4WEYQD0BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000CD5FR#wasThisHelpful","R3SOB4WEYQD0BQ","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My ancient and venerable Kindle Keyboard continues to see constant use five years after I first bought it, most often when I'm away from home. It's still in nearly perfect condition. That's because, soon after I bought it,  I enclosed it in a Kindle Leather Cover that serves as its faithful bodyguard,  shielding it from dirt, dust, and a myriad of fumbles, drops, thumps, bumps, and bruises.Soon after I bought my leather case and locked my Kindle Keyboard into it, I discovered that it was perhaps important Kindle accessory I own. While bringing my encased Kindle downstairs one morning, I slipped and my Kindle literally went flying out of my hands... all the way to the bottom of the stairs. It landed with a loud ""thwack!"" on the stone floor below. I thought for sure it was a dead duck; but much to my very pleasant surprise, it was completely undamaged (including the screen!)  and in perfect working order. I give all credit to the Kindle Leather Cover for this. Its hinge system kept my device securely locked inside, and the external strap kept the cover closed, thereby providing perfect protection against any kind of damage from outside sources.There are several additional benefits to the Kindle Leather Cover. It permits me to hold my Kindle more like a book than an electronic device when I use it. My encased Kindle fits comfortably in my hands, and is completely unobtrusive. It's also quite durable and easy to maintain; the bonded leather exterior and microfiber interior are easy to clean and resistant to wear and tear.The Kindle Leather Cover is an excellent product, and an essential accessory for the Kindle Keyboard. I only wish they made a similar product for the Kindle Fire HD.

"The Doobie Brothers is one of  my favorite rock bands, and ""The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers"" is just that... the very best compilation of the very best songs recorded by this mega-band that achieved its greatest success in the 1970s and 80s, and is still going strong, with some of its original members, four decades after it was formed.Initially released in 2007, ""The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers"" is a 2-CD set that contains 33 of the Doobies' best songs written between 1972 and 2000. Sixteen songs are located on Disc 1 and seventeen on Disc 2. Songs are arranged pretty much  in chronological order, beginning on Disc 1 with ""Listen to the Music"" and ""Jesus Is Just Alright"" (single version, 1972), and concluding on Disc 2 with ""Rollin' On"" (1991) and ""Ordinary Man"" (2000). In between are some of the most memorable Doobies songs from the ""classic rock"" era: ""Long Train Runnin',"" ""China Grove,"" ""South City Midnight Lady,"" ""Take Me In Your Arms (Rock Me,)""  ""Black Water,"" ""Little Darling (I Need You,"" ""What a Fool Believes,"" and many, many more.Both of the discs in ""The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers"" are engineered pretty well. To my ears, all 33 of the songs appear to be un-remastered copies of the original analog recordings with perhaps a few digital enhancements. Throughout the two-hour running time of the entire album, , the sound is crisp, clean, and shows no traces of hiss or other background noise. Stereo imaging is good, all vocals and each musical instrument come across clear and distinct.""The Very Best of the Doobie Brothers"" is certainly the best compilation of Doobies songs I've ever heard.

"""J.S. Bach Violin Concerti"" is a superb CD containing some of Johann Sebastian Bach's most famous and enduring works for violin. In these recordings from 1989, Japanese violinist Takako Nishizaki combines with Slovakian orchestra Capella Istropolitana, under the direction of Oliver Dohnanyi, and plays two of Bach's violin concertos, his double violin concerto, and the ""Air on a G String"" to near perfection. Although Nishizaki's playing style doesn't exhibit quite the level of raw power as other virtuoso concert violinists like  Itzhak Perlman or Viktoria Mullova, her style is ideal for these works. She colors each selection with just the right amount of passion, and her tempi are uniformly superb. I especially enjoy her performance of ""Air on a G String.""

"When the classic police drama ""Hill Street Blues"" began its historic run on NBC in 1981, it very quickly became my favorite TV show. At that time, I was in the sixth year of my U.S. Air Force career. Unfortunately, I was only able to see the entire first season and part of the second before I shipped out for the first of a pair of long overseas military assignments that kept me out of the U.S. until 1989. As a consequence, when I departed the U.S. in 1982, I never was able to see another episode......Until late last year, that is, when I purchased ""Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series"" from Amazon.com. This magnificent package from Shout! Factory contains all 146 episodes of the iconic show that changed the tone and format of police dramas forever, with its gritty realism, use of ""handy cams,"" outstanding acting and writing, and multi-episode story arcs. Now I could watch all of the exploits of Furillo, Davenport, Hill, Renko, Hunter, Goldblume, and every other character in this wonderful show.There's not much I can add to the praise that's already been lavished on the show itself, so I won't even make the attempt.  I will comment on the quality of the ""Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series"" package. I was extremely impressed with Shout! Factory's efforts to provide a first-class product to its customers. Each episode is shown in its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio. The video and audio quality are both top-notch. Colors are appropriately vivid throughout, and images are sharp and well-defined. Video resolution is sharper than I expected for DVDs. There's a certain filmic feel to the episodes, brought on by a light layer of film grain that's always present. Stereo 2-channel audio is clear and crisp, with a nice balance of low, mid, and high range frequencies.The packaging in which ""Hill Street Blues: The Complete Series"" arrived deserves praise for its quality as well. The package contains 34 discs, with each season's discs (4 or 5 single-sided discs per season) mounted in its own standard-sized, multi-disc  DVD case. The DVDs are all securely mounted inside each case, so they're easy to handle and there's almost no chance of them getting damaged.I'm still in the process of watching the entire season for the first time. So far, I've made it halfway through Season 4. I am constantly mesmerized by ""Hill Street Blues,"" which doesn't seem dated, even 30-plus years after it first was broadcast.

"""Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom""  is the second volume of James MacGregor Burns' magisterial two-volume biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the first major scholarly biography of FDR after his death in 1945.  (The first volume is ""Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox,"" which chronicles FDR's early life and political career.)In ""Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom,"" Burns brilliantly encapsulates the wartime presidency of FDR: how he at first met the dual challenge of keeping the United States out of World War II, while at the same time legally making aid to the beleaguered Allies available; and then, once the U.S. entered the war, how he managed to keep the Allied war effort moving toward the ultimate goal of victory over the Axis powers. Burns portrays FDR as a man divided between his principles and ideals on one hand, and his need to take a pragmatic approach to the war on the other. FDR is seen squarely placed at the center of worldwide historical events of the 1940s.Throughout this outstanding book, which was published in 1970 and won both the 1971 Pulitzer Prize for history and the 1971 National Book Award for History and Biography, Burns' scholarly research is impeccable and interpretations of history are flawless. His prose is elegant, fast-paced, and highly readable.

"As a fan of the late, great actor Steve McQueen, I rejoiced recently when I discovered the ""Steve McQueen Collection,"" a compilation of four of Steve McQueen's best movies: ""The Great Escape,"" ""The Magnificent Seven,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and ""The Sand Pebbles.""""THE GREAT ESCAPE:"" This film is based on a true story - the mass escape of Allied prisoners of war from a German camp (Stalag Luft III) in Poland. McQueen plays American aviator Virgil Hiltz, who has already become the bane of his German captors because of his many escape attempts. He continues his efforts in this new ""escape-proof"" Stalag, where his activities and his contemptuous attitude toward his captors earn him much time in the ""cooler.""  McQueen is superb in his relatively small part in this classic 1963 World War II thriller.""THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN (1960):"" Here is a western from 1960, in which McQueen plays Vin Tanner, one of seven gunslingers who volunteer to go to a border town in Mexico to protect that town's citizens from a gang of marauders led by the ruthless ""Calvera"" (played by Eli Wallach.) ""The Magnificent Seven"" also features Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn.  Here is a wonderfully written and acted classic western that has clearly defined heroes, villains, and victims.""THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (1968):"" This is probably the coolest part ever played by the ""King of Cool."" McQueen is Thomas Crown, a wealthy Boston business executive who plans and executes the heist of nearly 3 million dollars in cash from a bank, ""for the fun of it."" The heist goes off without a hitch. When the police fail to turn up any clues as to who committed the crime, the bank's insurance company pays off, and then brings in a beautiful private investigator named Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway) to solve the case. Sparks fly as she quickly focuses on Crown as her chief suspect, and uses every means possible to prove his guilt. Overall, this movie is okay, although it tends to be rather slow-moving at times. The on-screen chemistry between McQueen and Dunaway is superb.""THE SAND PEBBLES (1966):"" This is by far the best of the films in this collection, and unquestionably the finest role of Steve McQueen's career. He plays Jake Holman, a disaffected ""China Sailor"" newly assigned to a gunboat patrolling the waterways of China in the 1920s. McQueen earned a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for his performance as the embittered loner who battles everyone around him, as well as himself.""The Steve McQueen Collection"" brings some of the very best of Steve McQueen into one Blu-ray case. Each of the four films are excellent in their own right, made all the better by the actor known as the ""King of Cool.""

"I wanted to find a way to effectively connect the audio signals from both my HDTV and my satellite radio to my home theater system, which has only one aux input. I began looking for some kind of switching unit, since that seemed like the most logical way to do this. I decided that the Monoprice Component Video Switch with IR Learning offered the best combination of low price, size, and capability.It turned out to be a very good choice. The Monoprice Component Video Switch handles the relatively uncomplicated task of switching between audio-only sources with ease, even though it's designed to switch between sources having both component video and stereo audio inputs.  I simply select whichever input source I want with the unit's IR remote. The unit responds immediately, and passes the audio to my home theater system. There is no degradation of audio quality from either source. The unit passes monaural, stereophonic, and 5.1 surround-encoded audio signals with complete fidelity.I am very pleased with my Monoprice Component Video Switch. It is reasonably priced, well constructed, small enough to fit unobtrusively into my makeshift entertainment center, and it looks pretty good. Best of all, it works very well.

This is only a little faster than my standard Amazon charger was in charging my Kindle Fire HD, and a somewhat bigger improvement in charging times for my Kindle Keyboard.After a year of using it, I'm reasonably satisfied my Amazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter, although I don't think the results I get with it make it worth the 20 bucks I paid for it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM6BTINW5PJ4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GWO5WK#wasThisHelpful","RM6BTINW5PJ4X","A3IB1W0SVED0Z3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3IB1W0SVED0Z3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Sperry voltage tester is great! I do plenty of work around the house, with includes some very light electrical work like ceiling fans, thermostat, outlet replacements. The newer outlets have a child safety features that your can't insert anything in the plug so voltage testing with the prong tester was always a pain. This tester is perfect for that task, just plug and it will tell you if there's a problem. I already found an issue with one of the outlets I replaced with the combo outlet and USB port that shows an open neutral (will need to check this later as it functions just fine now). The GFCI tester is great, it was a surprise at first, I thought I broke something when I accidentally pressed the button, but this is perfect for testing the functionality throughout your GFCI circuit.Great product, if you like to dabble or a pro, this is an excellent tool to have!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQI2OOJMRE93V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0152U89DC#wasThisHelpful","RQI2OOJMRE93V","A38NHXL5257E3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NHXL5257E3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With the included velcro padding, the camera would not fit, I have to remove all the padding to get the camera to fit.

"Oh after the painful setup (see below) this Bestway Bouncer is super fun for the toddler! He jumps in and out through all sides and jumps until his energy is drained (Good sleep). This bouncy house is pretty big for a miniature size, it's fairly stable, however if there is more than one child in there and they are rough, the walls are not that strong to keep them in. So make sure you monitor them when at play.Now for the painful setup, no pump or adaptor is included with this (bad), also if you don't have a powered pump, don't even try to inflate unless you have the time and energy. On top of that you have to pump each section separately, which is good for leak protection but bad for us because they decided to use different sized fittings for the 3 sections. The base center area needs a small sized adaptor and the base edge needs a super large size adaptor the inflatable bed size. I didn't have that so I used my leaf blower and cupped it with my hand to force the air in, it worked...Once everything was up, the kid was happy and that is all that matter...","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8Z3V70ZSAGK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ERK8WWC#wasThisHelpful","R8Z3V70ZSAGK","A38NHXL5257E3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NHXL5257E3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Sony HTDT9 is an amazing soundbar, the sound quality is excellent, very crisp and clear. Installation is easy, just plug in the HDMI and optical (non needed if you have the latest ARC HDMI which I don't) and you are good to go. The sub is wireless so you can set it anywhere in the room.In comparison to my Bose Cinemate 120, the sound is comparable, however I am not an audiophile I find both bars sound great, full and powerful. The Sony does have more features than the Bose, I like the night feature, I find with little babies at home, the night option is pretty much the norm, less bass to wake the babies. Having Bluetooth is excellent feature my Bose didn't have, however I don't think I'll be dumping my Sonos system for this any time soon. There is a football mode on this system, it's suppose to increase the stadium sound and decease the commentators, I like that. The Sony system is nice because everything is inside the sub and bar, no need for a separate box as the main unit like the Bose.If you have a slim TV you know the sound quality is always what's lost with the beautiful aesthetics, adding this sound bar will give you the minimalist look and still feel like you have speakers all around! At this price point, you will get an excellent sound but if you like to stream your music, I would also consider the Sonos bar and sub combo for its superb streaming service.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXNUQGJFKTMNA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U78GFWW#wasThisHelpful","RXNUQGJFKTMNA","A38NHXL5257E3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NHXL5257E3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, this thing works, but ouch! The wife tried it on her leg and it was intense! She normally waxes and thinks this will work better for her for a follow up after waxing. So I had to give it a try on my chin of all places, wow, its like a torture machine! It did pluck fast and each hair pulled was painful! It also did irritate my skin a bit from the pulling. For my wife, the area on her leg she shaved wasn't irritated but was slightly red from the pulling. She will definitely use it again, but only after she waxes so there will be lesser hair for this machine to pluck.This is not for everyone, if you have a high pain tolerance, this will work, but if you are a weakling like me, you might want to stay away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTJD4RF078D85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XN1PLHA#wasThisHelpful","RTJD4RF078D85","A38NHXL5257E3B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38NHXL5257E3B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A very nice album -- I have to disagree with the reviewer who thought it sounded more ""early Eagles"" than country, for the whole approach to rhythm, not to mention the composition of the accompanying groups, creates what seems to me a different sound altogether.  Henley's voice is still at times that of the singer of ""Desperado,"" but he can adjust the timbre to suit a different mode.  At times, there's a touch of Dylan in the voice (in ""Prayin' for Rain"" and ""Where I am now""),  and the narrative of ""Waiting on tables"" sounds like it could be a Springsteen song, until the refrain kicks in -- but they all work well.  All but four or five of the songs are by Henley and are new; the oldest one goes back to the '50's (the Louvin Brothers' ""When I Stop Dreaming""), there are a couple from the '60s, including ""The Brand New Tennessee Waltz,"" and the disc opens with Tift Merritt's ""Bramble Rose.""  I don't know that these are classics, but they're good songs, and Henley's own efforts fit right in.  I particularly liked ""The Cost Of Living,"" ""Words can Break your Heart,"" and ""Train in the Distance.""  The themes are standard -- aging, loss, acceptance of failure, memories of youth -- but none the worse for that.The engineering seems really good to me, with the voice perfectly set against the ensemble and the different expressive mixes in the arrangements coming through clearly.  Guest artists contribute -- Mick Jagger works hard at his county style and accent in ""Bramble Rose,"" and Merle Haggard sounds very good in ""The Cost of Living.""  Alison Krauss, Trisha Yearwood, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, and Lucinda Williams all contribute effectively.  This was Don Henley's first solo album in 15 years, and I thought it turned out just fine.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34BLRV7LYXUQ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SXEM56#wasThisHelpful","R34BLRV7LYXUQ9","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's always a pleasure to watch Catherine Keener and Liev Schreiber, and here they are, at the beginnings of their respective careers, playing characters who combine likeableness with irritating-ness in about equal proportions -- that's to say, they're representing ordinary folks as Nicole Holofcener sees them.  For Holofcener herself, this was her first feature, and it's like the other two of hers I've seen in its attention to details of middle class life and an eschewal of the kind of melodrama that passes for realism in our current cinematic conventions.  It's quiet, though that's not to say that it's characters aren't a mass of anxieties of the kind that one often reads about in advice columns.  The structure is simple and symmetrical: as Amelia (Keener) has just broken up with Andrew (Schreiber), her best friend Laura (Anne Heche) becomes engaged to her boyfriend  Frank (Todd Field).  No sooner have these changes taken place, but the two young women begin to have second thoughts about them.  Amelia wants connection; Laura and Frank start getting tense with one another.  The two women also become aware of how circumstances seem to be forcing them to see  and consult with one another less as time goes on, so the nature of THEIR relationship also becomes a source of stress.  These are commonplace occurrences, and I think that the popularity of Holofcener's movies has to do with the way in which an audience of a certain age see themselves and all their insecurities in them.  Both women have jobs, and we see them at work, but their work seems to mean less to them than what's going on in their heads about their relationships.Maybe it's unfortunate that I've seen Holofcener's movies in reverse chronological order.  ""Enough Said"" was an excellent movie, and ""Friends with Money"" was very good.  This one, from 1996, is less interesting.  The problem, I think, is the writing -- Holofcener writes and directs.  I don't think that the characters are intrinsically less interesting than those in ""Friends with Money,"" but the writing seems less effective.  It's not easy to make credible everyday language dramatically pointed without inflating it into rhetoric, and Holofcener, to her credit, never inflates -- but here it isn't all that pointed and fresh either.  In this respect, it's less successful than her later films and a film like Stillman's ""Metropolitan,"" whose characters are equally mundane folks living largely inside their heads.  The actors are credible, and they do what they can, and they're as engaging as the material allows.  It's nice to know that they and Holofcener went on to better things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HP4XAMJVBY5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000065V39#wasThisHelpful","R2HP4XAMJVBY5U","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One has to respect the experiences of the author Matthew Quick and the director David O. Russell, who have had experiences within their own lives and families with illnesses like depression and bi-polar disorder, and both have testified to the fact that the book and the movie were undertaken as ways of dealing with, to some extent, the difficulties brought about by such illnesses.  And the movie has been very successful -- Americans seem to love the idea that emotional and mental illness (and of course, cognitive impairment and cancer) can be the bases of uplifting stories.  And sometimes, in ""real life,"" they can be.  More often, of course, they are disturbing, frightening, and financially and emotionally draining, both for the sufferers and those who seek to take care of them.  I sometimes wonder if the desire to see uplift in such stories -- the ""silver lining"" -- isn't a way of assuring ourselves that we are seeing these sufferers as people like ourselves and that we would never think of marginalizing them.  One would hope that we wouldn't marginalize them, but let's face it: they're not exactly like (and sometimes not at all like) those of us who are lucky enough not to be thus afflicted, and it bothers me to see them turned into occasions for comedy, for these enable in us a covert kind of self-congratulation: we see them as people and covertly congratulate ourselves for empathizing.  But one can't get away from the fact that the conventions of comedy  -- in this case romantic comedy -- blunt or fuzz up the representation of the difficulties of emotional illness.  We can't believe in the suffering of Pat (Bradley Cooper) and Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) when they don't seem credibly endangered or a source of danger.  It doesn't help that Pat's doctor is a broadly comic figure or that Tiffany's ""normal"" sister and brother-in-law seem more out of touch with reality than Tiffany does.  Pat's obsessive-compulsive father (Robert De Niro, wasted) has a fixation with the Philadelphia Eagles that is more a source of comedy than anything else.  To sum up, most of these people (including Danny [Chris Tucker], Pat's friend from the hospital in Baltimore where Pat has spent 8 months) are, in some degree, charming, and charming just doesn't cut it in a movie that purports to take emotional suffering seriously.As most readers will know, Tiffany talks Pat into partnering her in a dance competition, and they practice a lot.  We're to take it that the practice becomes a kind of emotional discipline and, in itself, a source of stability for both.  Fair enough -- and, to the film's credit, in the competition they are (credibly) not very good at all, but they're good enough to bring about a happy conclusion to a rather contrived betting situation that Pat's dad has set up, and -- in best romantic comedy vein -- good enough to discover each other, as each realizes what the other has done for him or her.  I didn't think much of the movie, but the actors are pros, and they give it a whirl -- my quarrel isn't with them.  It's with the whole concept.  I just hope DeSean Jackson was reimbursed for the use (or abuse!) of his name.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2267XAJPU865Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A81MV3U#wasThisHelpful","R2267XAJPU865Z","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As far as Perlman is concerned, for me it's the earlier the better -- not because he started to play badly but rather because in his later DGG recordings, his violin is far too close-up in the aural picture.  This Dvorak disc is from 1974, and I like it.  The orchestra has fine presence, Perlman is in a credible relation to it, and he plays with his usual richness and security.  I have read criticisms of Dvorak's handling of the first movement, but expressively it works well for me, whatever its shortcomings in terms of ""correct"" sonata form.  The slow movement is beautifully transitioned-into and has a mournful Slavic eloquence to it, which might be less memorable than anything in the Cello Concerto but which is very engaging nonetheless.  There's plenty of life and variety too in the folksy, dance-like finale.  The Romance for Violin and Orchestra is eloquently played too.  I think I marginally prefer the Accardo/Davis recording, from about 1979, with more refined orchestral sound, and with Accardo's more focused tone, but there's nothing at all wrong with this one.  And at the price, in its latest remastering, it's well worth acquiring.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q457FQIDIH1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010FULK9O#wasThisHelpful","R1Q457FQIDIH1B","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2 stars -- This was Peter Robinson's second Inspector Banks book, and it's interesting how much less polished it is than his later efforts in this very good series.  I found it less interesting than ""Gallows View,"" the first book in the series.  In this one the ""dedicated man"" is the murder victim, Harry Steadman, an academic historian with interests in Roman technology.  He has been the beneficiary of his father's estate, and that has enabled him to retire from academic work and pursue his studies in his own way from a base in Helmthorpe, a village 15 miles from Eastvale.  He and his wife are childless, but Harry has developed friendships there because he has been coming to Helmthorpe on vacation for over a decade prior to his retirement.  A shepherd discovers his body up on the moors, and Banks is called in to investigate.  In some ways, it's a very traditional mystery -- a small village, a small group of acquaintances, relations that go back for a decade or so -- and the victim a man about whom no one has anything bad to say, a man dedicated to his field of study . . .Banks flails around a good deal.  He has a feeling that the solution to the murder lies in the past and that it was not just a random killing.  At one point, one character comments, as they talk around the possibilities, that it's all a bit like the blind men and the elephant: they all probably have a part of it, but no one knows exactly which part or how it all might hang together.  Robinson plays with this idea in an interesting way -- he has two of the surrounding characters, who are not in communication with one another, come to believe that they have the answer to the puzzle, and they set out to take action to resolve the matter without informing Banks or anyone else about their conclusions.  In taking action, they put themselves at risk without really knowing what they're doing so . . . cue the suspense.  I think that that's a really smart idea to bring in to a story like this.  Unfortunately, Robinson can't find a narrative strategy for pulling it off interestingly, so he falls back on what was, by 1988 when the book was published. the hoariest of resolutions: after the dust has cleared, Banks sits everybody down and explains it all, pretty much like Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple.  Robinson's idea is good -- too bad the ending had to be handled so unimaginatively..There are some other problems.  For example, he has a group of teenage girls who converse on a number of occasions.  The dialogue just isn't right.  He also has neighbors and villagers commenting on the situation is a kind of standard issue local yokel cliched kind of language.  Banks's family do not come to life here as they do in later books -- his wife, Sandra,is a cipher whose main function is to provide a piece of vital information unknowingly.  In other words, Robinson tend to fall back on stereotypes, and in this respect this book is less effective than many of his later ones, in which dialogue, characterization, and resolution are much more deftly handled.  Still, there are things to enjoy, and shocks and surprises -- but Robinson became a much more assured writer as he went on, in the handling of both the writing and the narrative organization. .","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F382T7DKZX8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380716453#wasThisHelpful","R3F382T7DKZX8Z","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was young, I loved the ""1812"" and the ""William Tell"" overtures -- this was back in the late 1950s -- when they would come on the radio.  As time has gone on, I find that, for me, the ""William Tell"" has worn better, and I've come to like Tchaikovsky's ballet scores better than the overture.  But never mind!  If you want a performance with plenty of pizzazz, in good early-digital sound (from around 1981), this will do very well.  Muti's rhythmic grip, and his attention to the orchestral textures, serve, along with the nice sound picture, to give this music with a directness that is most appealing.  The piece has its own inflation, so to speak, and Muti doesn't gild the lily -- if it IS a lily to start with!  Liszt's tone poem ""Les Preludes"" is given its own distinctive, more somber, ""tinta"" here, and it makes a good ""middle movement"" to three pieces the first and third of which are pretty spectacular.  Like ""Bolero,"" it works with limited thematic material, cunningly transformed.  There are other tone poems by Liszt that I like better, but this performance seems fine.  The Ravel ""Bolero"" opens the program and is given a very fine performance.  It always surprises me how it holds the attention for 17 minutes, with all the repetitiveness, but it does, and Muti builds the crescendo unerringly.  The orchestral color throughout is outstandingly caught by the recording.  All in all, it's my favorite piece on this disc.  I would just add that on a CD, there was room for more.  ""William Tell"" maybe?","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35IO18BZSWIYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002RMQ#wasThisHelpful","R35IO18BZSWIYT","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The reviewers who complain that this movie doesn't really help us understand the extent and the intractability of the immigration crisis in the age of ""national security"" are right -- but I'm not sure that any movie could do that and I'm pretty sure that this movie wasn't attempting anything so ambitious.  Rather, the movie wants to remind us of a simple fact: among all the numbers that are thrown at us, and in spite of the polarized and under-informed ideological posturing, and in the face of the impersonal bureaucratic machinery established to deal with these problems, individuals' and families' lives are being impacted in quite horrifying ways.  You might think that that kind of focus is an invitation to a sentimental response to circumstances that require really hard thinking and really detailed knowledge -- and, again, you would be right.  Sentiment is the name of the game.  I would just say that there is a place for it, even as we need much, much more.  But on its own terms, this works pretty well.  It combines a number of stories of immigrants and ""illegal"" residents from the Iran, Korea, Mexico, Australia, sub-Saharan Africa and takes us through some of their encounters with ""the system.""  This being a movie, it's no surprise that some representatives of the system use it to exercise their own power or seek satisfaction for their own desires -- the characters played by Ray Liotta and Jacqueline Obradors -- while others try to bend the rules as far as they can to humanize the system and preserve families whose breakup is threatened by the deportation of one member -- Harrison Ford and Ashley Judd play the sympathetic characters who do so -- but sentimental though the movie might be, not all the benevolent interventions are successful, and there are harrowing moments.  When a teenage Iranian-American girl is deported on suspicion of supporting terror (on the basis of a report she gave in class). her mother goes with her, leaving her father and sister behind.  The scene at the airport is painful to watch, and very well acted.  The immigrants aren't the only sufferers:  Ashley Judd plays an advocate for immigrant children, while Liotta, her husband, is an immigration officer willing to trade green cards for sexual favors.  Harrison Ford plays a weary honest officer, who tries to keep a young Mexican mother and her son together, and he effectively conveys the fatigue that inevitably accompanies the constant battle to help people live with dignity.  Ford's character'spartner belongs to an immigrant Pakistani family whose older members are about to be naturalized and yet who are trying to impose traditional codes of conduct on the younger generation, not all of whom are interested.  That situation leads to the most melodramatic confrontation in the movie, a scene in a convenience store that involves a Korean kid.  The final scenes -- one at the naturalization ceremony and one out on the Mexican-American border wasteland are tense and effective.  So yes -- it's sentimental and it's not analytical -- but it's alive to human costs, and that's something that a movie can get across perfectly well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PMKI76PL9326/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UDS4BS#wasThisHelpful","R1PMKI76PL9326","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After seeing John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" (1947), I decided to see the three following ""OK Corral"" movies in chronological order.  The next two were ""Gunfight at the OK Corral"" (1957, with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas) and ""Tombstone"" (1993, with Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer), with ""Wyatt Earp"" coming a year later, in 1994.  I'm sorry to say that at 3+hours ""Wyatt Earp"" is the least satisfying of the four.  It's ponderous, a bit disjointed, and, finally, repetitive, for all the decent cast and the nice photography.  The whole second half of the movie, it seems, is just a matter of the Earp brothers moving from place to place, ending up as lawmen wherever thy go, while their wives constantly object to the upheavals.  There are gunfights in different locales, but we never get much sense of the people that the Earps are fighting (the Clantons et. al.) as characters, and in fact, with the exception of Wyatt, we don't get very strong senses of the Earp brothers either.  They seem pretty much interchangeable after a while.  The fault in these cases of underdeveloped characterization has to lie with the writers.  They don't do much with Wyatt's love Josie Marcus either -- in ""Tombstone,"" Dana Delaney was a much more vivid presence than Joanna Goings.  In fact, the memorable characters here are those we see least of -- Isabella Rossellini as Big Nose Kate, Bill Pullman as Ed Masterson, Mark Harmon as Sheriff Behan -- and that's partly because we get to know Wyatt relatively early -- after his recovery from his wife's death, he doesn't change much at all and he isn't all that interestingly characterized to begin with.There is Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday to give the movie a lift.  Doc is fatally consumptive and has no illusions about his future.  It's not altogether clear why he befriends Wyatt, but he sticks by him to the end.  Quaid's Doc is a kind of blend of Val Kilmer's dandyism and Kirk Douglas's volatility and fatalism, and he makes it work.  He's less outlandishly effete than Kilmer, but he is given a curious formality of speech that marks him.  In all four movies, the Holliday figure is strongly cast, and in the last two perhaps steals the show -- as, I think, Victor Mature did in ""My Darling Clementine.""  I have to say that I didn't like the focus on Wyatt's early years -- that part of the movie seems to exist only to let Gene Hackman, as the Earp brothers' father, make rather stilted speeches that are, in effect, thematic markers -- he talks about ""blood"" (i. e. family) and ""the law"" as being all-important, and he declares that the Earps are temperamentally itinerant.  And, of course, that's what the movie delivers on, rather predictably.  I'm not sure we needed Gene Hackman to spell all that out for us: just tell the story and SHOW us the Earps in action!  We, the audience, will get the point.What about Wyatt's character?  I wondered, on reflection, if Kasdan, the director, and Costner didn't model him to some extent on John Wayne's obsessives in ""The Searchers"" and ""Red River"".  He's single minded and stubborn -- but we don't need the better part of three hours to see that, especially when the dialogue isn't all that strong.  While on the trail of influences, I came to wonder if the ending might recall the ending of ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,"" for the question arrives, for Earp, later in life, if he really did all the things attributed to him.  Viewers can decide that one for themselves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173VJWKOY1GCS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E5N6LG#wasThisHelpful","R173VJWKOY1GCS","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel follows from the end of ""The Burning Room,"" and I think that it's another good, solid Connelly procedural.  It's set up in an interestingly different way from ""The Burning Room,"" and I don't mean only that we have a cooperation between ex-detective Harry Bosch and his half-brother, the pragmatic and flamboyant Mickey Haller, the ""Lincoln Lawyer.""  Fans of Bosch and Connelly will remember that in ""The Burning Room"" Bosch is the only character to whose consciousness we have access.  All we hear and know about his new sidekick Lucy Soto comes from dialogue, description, and Bosch's thoughts, not Lucy's.  And this is so even when the novel develops two stories, one of which is Lucy's and becomes Bosch's too -- it's all channelled for us readers through Bosch -- and it worked very well.  In that novel, we readers are always where Bosch is. Here in ""The Crossing,"" however, we have only a single story -- of the effort to clear the name of Haller's client D'Quan Foster, who has been accused of a particularly violent murder -- but we have access to three centers of narrative focus -- Bosch's, Mickey's, and that of two cops who (it's clear from the start) are up to no good, although what their stake is in the failure of Haller's and Bosch's efforts to free D'Quan doesn't become fully evident until later.Bosch is retired now, but he's suing the LAPD for mishandling his retirement (see end of ""The Burning Room""), and he needs money to help his daughter afford college next year.  Haller suggests that Bosch work on the case for him, his usual assistant having been taken out of commission in the first chapter.  Bosch is concerned throughout the novel about his working for ""the other side"" -- the idea that he's a cop outlives his actual professional life as one -- or the ""dark side"" as some of his old colleagues disparagingly put it.  He makes Haller agree that if the evidence and his investigation conclusively demonstrate D'Quan's guilt, then Bosch will be free to make that known to the prosecutor.  The evidence at the scene is very damning, so Bosch has to explore the likelihood that it was in some way planted or manufactured.  What follows is an excellent account of the procedures by which Bosch goes about finding the truth of the matter, and suspense is generated by the fact that we readers see (while Bosch for a long time does not) that his efforts are being observed and undercut by some bad cops.  We also see that there are still cops in LAPD with whom Bosch has credit -- his old partner Lucy is one of them -- so it's not totally a matter of Bosch v. a corrupt machine.The contrast between Bosch's and Haller's temperaments is established early, and their disagreements as a result become a bit predictable.  However, that's not enough to spoil our pleasure in Bosch's intelligent and diligent approach to the investigation or to Haller's courtroom theatrics at the end.  I think I preferred the tightness of ""The Burning Room,"" but this one is very enjoyable too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RISITM2D8O7LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316225886#wasThisHelpful","RISITM2D8O7LM","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A rock-solid procedural that I found very enjoyable: Harry Bosch is on the road to retirement, working cold cases, with his pension plan worked out, and his main concern seems to be whether or not the LAPD might dump him early and thus save something on his premiums. Then a man dies, ten years after being shot and paralyzed by a never-found assailant, the bullet that paralyzed him having remained in him all these years. Now it is extracted post-mortem, the death is ruled a homicide -- so Harry's on the trail of a murderer, well aware that after all these years it will be tough to track him with only the bullet to go on. Harry, of course, goes back over the paperwork, finds things to ask questions about, and in very short order, the game is afoot. The victim has connections to a rising local politician who is Hispanic, as is the young partner assigned to Harry -- ""Lucky"" Lucy Soto, a pin-up girl for the LAPD because of some heroics in a gunfight. She has been promoted early, a cause of some backbiting among jealous older officers whose track has been slower, and the question is -- will she prove her mettle with Harry?It turns out that Lucy has a reason for wanting to be assigned to cold cases, and soon enough we have in effect two separate investigations. I'll give no more plot details. In both, careful procedural work is done, a lot of it unglamorous but rendered interesting by Connelly's eye for detail and ear for dialogue. Harry's vulnerability as a near-to-retiring officer who tends to irritate his superiors by not bothering much about the PR concerns of the LAPD forms a kind of under-plot as the main stories develop. The tense moments and the revelatory discoveries are all made to fit plausibly with the procedural aspects of the story as well as with the characterizations of Bosch and Lucy. It's a tight piece of work -- one of Connelly's best, I think.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I61IULGHIXZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455524182#wasThisHelpful","R3I61IULGHIXZY","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't surprised that I liked this account of the Brahms First much better than Bernstein's later digital account from Vienna for DGG. The latter I found mannered, with Bernstein always intervening with the tempo and dynamics and seeming not to want the music to speak for itself. I know . . . other reviewers I respect take a kinder view, but for me this earlier recording has a directness and a freshness that are winning, and the re-mastering of an originally 1960 recording has been very well done (as seems typical of Sony's re-mastering for this ""Bernstein Century"" series). I WAS surprised to find that I liked this recording better than I did Szell's, also from CBS/Sony, at around the same time. Szell has a tense energy and propulsion, but the sound is more homogenized and less airy than what we have here. The ""filler"" here is the Serenade No.2 -- like its predecessor written before Brahms began to write symphonies. It's not music I know well, but it receives an attractive performance here, in sound that is a little less appealing than that for the symphony -- they were recorded six years apart in different venues. The symphony is the earlier -- so venue matters! All in all, a very fine disc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH0CTDT2BW50V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00138D2WQ#wasThisHelpful","RH0CTDT2BW50V","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very fine account of the Schubert Ninth in what is as good digital sound as I've heard from DGG.  The quality of timbre from the different instrumental groups, as well as the solo instruments, and their relation to each other in the aural space, just couldn't be better judged.  The concert hall at the Ravinia Festival (where I assume this was recorded back in 1983) must have great acoustics.  Levine's Brahms with this orchestra, recorded by Sony in Chicago, isn't in the same league, considered purely as sound.  The performance itself is fine -- it has a nice, unaffected forward thrust that avoids the rush (exciting though it may be) of Munch's Boston recording but still conveys an attractive energy.  Levine also understands that ""allegro ma non troppo"" and ""andante con moto"" aren't all that far apart, and so the first two movements, considered together, have an almost cumulative sweep.  My only reservation is that they are a bit straight-faced, and the final two movements, by contrast, have a life and variety as well as energy, that make them, for me, the source of real distinction in this performance.  The finale is simply outstandingly shaped and communicated, and the ending is thrilling, as it should be.  It's odd that this recording (and its later re-issue with ""Rosamunde"" as pairing) isn't easy to find nowadays.  Time for DGG to give Levine a ""big box"" of his fine recordings for the label.  This one wouldn't need re-mastering!This is such great music that I'm open to many different interpretive stances, if the music is well-played.  Krips, Furtwangler, and especially Giulini all get high marks from me too, with Giulini being perhaps the most different from Levine in approach -- but still great.  You need more than one recording of this music anyway -- but Levine should be on your list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EJ6WD5IDZ6UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E2V6#wasThisHelpful","R1EJ6WD5IDZ6UV","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is so different from the other, later, Fellini movies that I've seen -- ""Amarcord"" and ""La Dolce Vita"" -- that I was quite surprised.  The later two are satirical exposes of the shortcomings of post-war Italian masculinity; this earlier one, although set in post-war Italy too, strikes me as much more humanely involving and, at the same time, almost mythic in its clear schematic structuring.  The bare bones of the story are of a rather brutish itinerant entertainer called Zampano (Anthony Quinn), who travels around the countryside giving displays of strength to small crowds in provincial towns who are willing to see him break iron chains by flexing his pectoral muscles.  He's a bit like Canio in ""Pagliacci"" in his volatility and potential for violence.  At times, he hooks up with small circuses and does his act as part of the circus's entertainment.  His female partner has died (we learn as the story opens), and Zampano in effect buys her sister Gelsomina (Guilietta Masini) from their mother as a replacement.  This is the first hint of the economic stringencies of post-war Italy, looked at from the point of view of a class well below what we see in the later films mentioned above, and it is to that class that Zampano and the small circuses that he joins with appeal.  Gelsomina is simple-minded, to use an old-fashioned phrase that seems right for the time of the film, but she's sweet, and she discovers, as she travels around, a talent for attracting and appealing to audiences with what seems like almost a Chaplinesque, ""little tramp"" kind of shtick.  Zampano needs that talent -- for she is, in effect, his way of attracting a paying audience -- and yet seems to resent the easy rapport that Gelsomina establishes, and he treats her brusquely and sometimes cruelly.  Things come to a head when Gelsomina attracts the attention of ""Il Matto,"" -- a clown or ""fool"" played by Richard Baseheart -- who combines jesting with tightrope-walking and violin-playing.  He is associated in the film with a poignant little musical phrase that he teaches Gelsomina to play and which becomes associated with her.  Matto, unfortunately for him, constantly pokes fun at Zampano, and Zampano doesn't take it well.  For all that, it becomes clear that, much as Gelsomina likes Matto and shares his whimsy, she has come to care for Zampano, and given chances to leave him, she does not.  I'll say no more in the interests of not spoiling plot developments for readers who might not have seen the film.What's striking about all this is the economy of the script and the fact that most of what I've described above is communicated through movement and gesture.  These are NOT articulate characters -- they emphatically don't ""talk through"" their problems, and one doubts that they even could, and Gelsomina is simple anyway.  But beyond the dynamics of character interaction, there's a sense of Gelsomina's responsiveness to the natural and even spiritual dimensions of life.  She is associated with the sea -- and the movie opens and closes with sea images -- and she's also responsive to not just Matto's violin but to the simple ceremony of a religious parade that she encounters in one of the villages.  Her responsiveness to these things is communicated largely wordlessly, but Fellini's attention to Masini's look and gestures makes it clear.  It would be going too far to simply allegorize Zampano and Gelsomina as body and spirit respectively, but in the film's schematization, the contrast trends in that direction, and Gelsomina's unselfconscious playfulness is connected to this hint of the ""holy fool"" that is part of the way she's represented.  Anthony Quinn's Zampano isn't a graceful mover, as Gelsomina is, but the ways of movement, their ways of using their physical resources, push the film in the direction of dance as an expressive medium, especially given the deliberate paucity of the language.  The performances seem to me outstanding -- Quinn, Masini, and Baseheart seem to give themselves completely to Fellini's conception, and the conclusion is very affecting.  The filming in black-and-white seems apt too for the scheme, and it looks very good, even when what it's looking at is painful to contemplate.  Great film!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJJ8A5LILPNNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LMU1C8#wasThisHelpful","RJJ8A5LILPNNM","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm glad to have heard this, but to be honest, this recording has some serious limitations.  I'll deal with these first, then touch on what I liked about it.  First, the sound isn't great, and it deteriorates as it goes on.  The throat-clearing and coughing, from the love duet on (i. e. on CD2), is irritating, and it doesn't let up.  The singers sound a bit more ""present"" on CD1, but I don't know if that reflects a change in position of the recorder or not. (Was it Lord Harewood himself, one wonders?) It's hard to judge the conducting under these circumstances.  Often, the pacing seems fine, but the concerted passages throughout seem a bit frenetic, and the chorus, when singing loudly, gets blurry and indistinct.  When we get to the solo performances, there are some things to like.  Amy Shuard, the Amelia, seems quite at home in the stellar company here.  The microphones don't always do her justice, but it's hard to see that she puts a foot wrong -- she has power, tenderness, and alert expression throughout.  The same could be said of Jon Vickers in a role that one doesn't really associate with him.  But his voice, for all its size, has a airiness, almost a lightness to its timbre, which he uses to good effect here.  What he lacks is elegance, and that counts for something in this opera -- Carlo Bergonzi's accounts set the standard, in my eyes, for the role of Gustavo -- and Vickers is far from that.  His death scene goes for veristic effects -- Bergonzi, in contrast, never loses the aristocratic dignity of the character.  That said, Vickers and Shuard give a fine account of the love duet, marred only by the recorded sound.  In ""La rivedra,"" though, Vickers is far too free with the line and the expressive effects.  Resnik is a solid Ulrica, Joan Carlyle a blessedly un-chirpy Oscar with nice tone, and then there's Bastianini.  He was a great di Luna in a ""Trovatore"" recorded around the time of this recording.  Here, he starts strong but sounds more ordinary by the time he gets to his big confrontation -- the ""Eri tu"" part.  He doesn't sound nearly implacable enough in the recitative (""Alzati!"" etc.) -- compare Merrill here -- nor does he quite bring off richly the lovely cantilena after ""O dolcezze memorie.""  He's not bad -- no vibrato or strain -- but rather ordinary.  Still, these are all singers that I'm glad I heard in these roles.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R3NED4CHHOKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013ND3AM#wasThisHelpful","R2R3NED4CHHOKY","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It just so happened that the movie I watched on DVD prior to this one was ""Enemy at the Gates,"" which also featured Rachel Weisz.  She is an actress I find appealing to watch, for she credibly communicates intelligence as well as intensity, and here, as a biologist with expertise in genetics she sounds as credible as she needs to when discussing the (fictional) phenomenon of ""viraling out.""  You'll have to watch the movie to find out what that means!  If you do so, you'll get caught up, as with the earlier ""Bourne"" movies, in CIA skulduggery -- generally, an intelligence operation that is carried on as far as possible beyond the ken of the people or their elected officials.  The Bourne series (of which this is the fourth), has been all about keeping the lid on wider knowledge of what is clearly a rogue operation.  In this movie Edward Norton is the chief rogue, and Jeremy Renner plays Aaron Cross, a Bourne surrogate (Matt Damon having bowed out) and an operative who, like Bourne in the first movie, is out to discover just what his employers have done to him.  It involves genetic tampering, hence the presence of Rachel Weisz, who also, she claims (and we believe her because she's Rachel Weisz), doesn't fully know the extent of the nefarious uses to which her research has been put.When Norton realizes that Renner's character is looking for answers, he decides to eliminate him.  Easier said than done, of course -- and the chase is on -- at which point this movie becomes like all the others, a chase-movie.  Cars, planes, boats and motorcycles all feature, and the locale for the climax this time is Manila, and the final chase seems a partial homage to ""Terminator 2.""  That's all that needs to be said.  Renner is as effective as Damon was as a hunted man and, bearded, looks remarkably like the young Kenneth Branagh. Weisz is fine as the biologist who helps him, and Ed Norton is suitably chilly -- but this is a movie that doesn't really call for the full deployment of acting skills that Renner, Norton, or Weisz are capable of.  The same was true of Damon, of course.  The bottom line is -- if you like fast chases and exotic locales, go for it.  It's smoothly done.  My own tolerance for this stuff is limited, so I tend to think it's maybe time to put this franchise out to pasture (excuse the incoherent metaphor!).","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HUPDRP6PQZNU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIPS#wasThisHelpful","R1HUPDRP6PQZNU","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In one of the ""special features"" accompanying this DVD, the director Jean-Jacques Annaud talks of the fascination of the ""rhythm"" of a slow, intimate story (the sniper v. sniper slow dance) set against the world-historical, densely-populated, ""action-oriented"" story of the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43, the battle in which the Red Army, taking horrific losses, managed to stop the eastward movement of Hitler's Nazi war machine.  The movie actually starts with an old-fashioned visual device -- the map of Europe with the black stain of Nazism spreading out from Germany in all directions, until it comes, in the east, to the Volga . . . I liked that.  It reminded me of old war movies I had enjoyed.  And the ""rhythm"" idea is kind of neat too, although it's pretty much an aesthetic indulgence on Annaud's part -- for it isn't totally credible, for all of rhetoric of the Russian propagandist commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins), that victory at Stalingrad depends on the outcome of the sniper war between the Russian Vassily Zaitsev and the German master-sniper Konig (Ed Harris).  One has to give some credit to the set-designers -- the ruined Stalingrad is well presented and at times spectacularly filmed, whether in its details or in  the wider picture.  But that's it -- for the film is hollow at the core:  these cast members have done very good work in other movies, and they go at it like true professionals here, but they're given nothing to work on in terms of character.  Such back-stories as we get are very sketchy, and it's as if they have no lives beyond the exigencies of the plot.  The spicing up of a degree of rivalry between Danilov and Zaitsev, erstwhile friends, because of the presence of Rachel Weisz as a fetching woman soldier looks like a desperate attempt to inject ""human interest,"" but it doesn't go anywhere except a rather stereotyped reconciliation near the end.  Rachel Weisz is capable of really engaging characterization (like Harris and Hoskins), but she too is given little to work with.  Hoskins's Khrushchev is a very broad caricature -- basically, ""I've come to Stalingrad to kick ass, take names, and in so doing turn back the Nazis"" -- and the timeworn contrast between the heroic common soldiers and the brutal officers is played out once again.  I think we see more Russians killed by Russians than by Nazis.  Even allowing for some truth to that, it seems over-the-top here, and one can understand why the Russians found the movie offensive.  Just about all the close-up brutality in the movie is committed by them.  In the German scenes, it's pretty much Ed Harris with his boss or alone.  I see the movie as really wasting the talents of some good character-actors.  Moment by moment, it isn't boring -- but when one reflects back on it, there's not much there.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8D6V4QJWUNPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFXVCU#wasThisHelpful","R8D6V4QJWUNPS","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lovely recording from the late 1970's, in very good analogue sound.  It's possible to imagine a more refined sound picture, but who needs it?  This is graceful and spirited playing of two pieces that go well together on a CD.  The Octet is very early Mendelssohn, and it isn't quite as magical as the Midsummer Night's Dream Overture, but it seems to have an energy and sparkle that remind one of Rossini and a formal elegance that is Mozartian.  That's a potent mix.  The later Quintet is equally approachable.  The fast movements are fizzing, and the slow movements are elegant rather than profound, in a Beethovenian way, but they're none the worse for that.  As another reviewer reminds us -- the disc is a fine testimony to the artistry of the violinist Iona Brown, who succeeded Neville Marriner as leader of the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and who died far too young.

"There's a lot going on in this engaging, entertaining, and, at times, affecting version of the Earp family's involvement in the ""gunfight at the OK Corral.""  It tells a rather different and more complicated story than ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) and ""The Gunfight at the OK Corral"" (1957), making the story less a family feud story (Clantons v. Earps) and more a story of the Earps' battles as lawmen against a gang of feral outlaw types called ""The Cowboys,"" who terrorize Tombstone, own the local sheriff, and require the establishment of the Earps as federal lawmen as they try to bring peace and security to a wild gambling town.  Complicating things are the families of the Earps, not least Wyatt's opium-addicted wife -- but we're made aware here, more than in the earlier movies of the cost to families whose men are lawmen in a pretty lawless time.  Unhappy in a deteriorating marriage, Wyatt is drawn to a visiting actress, played by Dana Delaney, who seems to stand for a free and easy life (with ""room service"") while Wyatt seems almost paralyzed by a sense of various duties -- but she's in there at the end.  The other interesting element is Wyatt's friendship with the gunman and gambler Doc Holliday, whom his brothers don't trust -- but Wyatt sees Doc's essential honesty with him and stands by him -- just as well, as we find out near the end.The portrayal of Doc by Val Kilmer is an amazing performance, even more baroque than Victor Mature's in ""My Darling Clementine"" and a world away from Kirk Douglas's self-torturing and agonized Doc.  Holliday seems to be the character that writers, directors, and actors seem to feel free to exercise their ingenuities upon, to the point of fantasy.  Kilmer's Doc is apparently, but only apparently, effete and mannered.  Kilmer plays him as more seriously consumptive than the earlier movies do, and with his waxen skin and long black coat and natty clothes, he looks like an avenging vampire at times.  There is in fact an odd mythic-supernatural vibe that plays over parts of the movie.  There's a lot of talk of death, the afterlife, heaven, and hell, and justice is made to seem important in relation to these concepts, and they seem to be rendered at crucial points in the settings -- in the luxurious interiors or in thunderstorm, at times of intense feeling.  The sense of Wyatt as avenging angel is strong, although, as played by Kurt Russell, he's always credibly human, and, at times, vulnerable, too.  Finally, I don't think it's spoiling anything to say that the OK Corral gunfight isn't the end of things . . . All in all, though, this is a carefully thought out and oddly involving movie, and Val Kilmer, I think, just has to be seen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CML7JRDCKQJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=6304711905#wasThisHelpful","R3CML7JRDCKQJO","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It must have been difficult for the directors of ""Tombstone"" (1993) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) to come up with new takes on the story of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and the gunfight at the OK Corral in Tombstone in Arizona.  Behind them were this John Sturges movie of 1957 and John Ford's ""My Darling Clementine"" from 1946.  The two later versions bring the Earps and Holliday into conflict with what is in effect a lawless gang, the Cowboys, who are terrorizing Tombstone.  The two earlier versions, by Ford and Sturges, pose the Clanton family against the Earps in a much less complicated scenario.  ""My Darling Clementine"" was very unusual, with Henry Fonda (Earp) and Victor Mature (Holliday) strongly distinguished -- Fonda consistently quiet, efficient, almost unimpassioned, and Mature, in a great histrionic performance, is flamboyant.  In ""Gunfight at the OK Corral,"" Burt Lancaster is Earp, and he's a much more obviously pro-active character than Fonda's Earp, even though he ostensibly wants to get away from being a lawman and settle down.  The plot calls for his brother Morgan to be gunned down in the dark, mistaken for him, and his guilt over this injustice fuels his revenge.  Lancaster plays the intensity convincingly, as he also plays the humor earlier in the movie in his interactions with Holliday (Kirk Douglas).  Douglas's Holliday is a completely different kind of character from Mature's -- an educated, self-hating man, a compulsive drinker and gambler (and consumptive, of course) who is conscious of having disgraced his family and who takes his self-hatred out on his girlfriend Kate -- we would now say that he abuses her.  This drives her to seek temporary refuge withe the Clantons and their sidekick Johnny Ringo (John Ireland) and that helps set up the gunfight, which, after Morgan's death and Kate's alienation, has less to do with law enforcement than with personal vendetta.  Lancaster and Douglas are very good as a team -- you might have enjoyed them in ""The Devil's Disciple"" too -- and Rhonda Fleming enters as Laura Denbow, a lady gambler who attracts Wyatt's attention.  She looks fabulous.  Other familiar faces in the cast include DeForest Kelly (later to be on ""Star Trek"") as Virgil Earp and the young Dennis Hopper as the youngest Clanton brother, who senses that his family is going off the rails but who can't deny family loyalty when the crunch comes.  It's a thoroughly entertaining movie, and it blends a variety of tones -- comic, romantic, something close to tragic -- very well, and the credit for that goes to a decent script (Leon Uris) and to the performances of the two male leads.  The whole thing, I should add, is cast as a kind of Ballad.  Frankie Laine sings a somewhat cheesy song over the opening credits, and we hear him again at transitional points in the action, moving things along.  Good stuff!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L03DRS1XP1HJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEFY6LA#wasThisHelpful","R1L03DRS1XP1HJ","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this along with the Solti ""Rigoletto,"" and somewhat to my surprise found that this is much better.  Cillario doesn't set the world on fire, but he's steady, keeps a good pulse, trusts his singers to be expressive in the conversational passages, and coaxes a nice sound from the 1973 LPO that is well caught in the remastering.  But the question with ""Norma"" is -- how does it measure up to Callas?  Well, it's better cast than the two early EMI Callas recordings (studio with Filippeschi, and live with Picchi), and in much better sound too.  The 1960 Callas, with Corelli and Ludwig is stiffer competition.  Even so, this one holds its own.  Limitations first: in 1960, Callas and Corelli were old hands at ""Norma,"" and they had besides expressive resources and vocal qualities that neither Domingo nor Caballe possessed, and one result is that what I call the conversational passages are projected with much more nuance and dramatic awareness than we find in this recording.  It's the case too, I believe, that Cossotto, well as she sings, has a voice that's a bit too unyielding for Adalgisa, where Ludwig and Marilyn Horne are both more vulnerable-sounding; so good though the singing is -- and it always is -- some scenes aren't as engaging as one would ideally like.  Ralph Moore talks of an ""assembly-line"" quality, but I think that's a tad harsh -- rather, I think, these singers just hadn't thought or felt their ways into their roles -- had they even sung them on stage much, if at all? -- and that accounts for the lower dramatic temperature.However, a real virtue of this recording is that the final scene is given with great emotional power.  Caballe conceives it on a more intimate scale than Callas, and she sings absolutely beautifully.  Even without the spine-chilling baritonal tinges of Callas's ""In mia man,"" that final confrontation with Pollione is powerful and moving, and Domingo is at his best there too.  The singing, simply as singing, is of very high quality -- but there is much more than singing going on in that final scene.  Corelli and Callas are great there too, but Caballe and Domingo are a match, in their different approach. As for another ""big moment,"" I have to say that I thought ""Mira, O Norma"" was really well done, and if ""Si, fin all'ora"" sounded too much like two healthy hockey-playing girls, well . . . that's Bellini's fault.  I've always found that cabaletta to be a misjudgment on Bellini's part.  Of the other singers, Elizabeth Bainbridge is a very positive Clotilde, Kenneth Collins a very fine Flavio, and Ruggero Raimondi (whose name is mis-spelled on the front of the box) has a perfect voice for Oroveso and sings very beautifully.  Has there been a better ""Norma"" on CD since 1973? Scotto? Sutherland 2.0?  I don't think so.  I thought this was just fine and, where it mattered, much better than that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OCY0UUZYYQYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOMQNXI#wasThisHelpful","R3OCY0UUZYYQYL","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Charlton Heston wasn't convincing in ""Major Dundee,"" the only other western I had seen him in, but he seems totally at home in ""Will Penny,"" which he has said was one of his favorite roles.  He plays an aging, illiterate cowboy, who seems itinerant, and goes around seeking work as a cattle-herder from whomever will hire him.  He's good at his job, but touchy about his age and his illiteracy, and he'll fight if he's ribbed hard enough by younger cowpokes.  The basic story here is how Penny helps and is helped by a woman and her son who have been forced to winter in a cow-minder's shack up in the Montana hills.  The conventional aspects of the story deal with the threat to Penny and, eventually the woman and her son, from a feral family of rawhiders headed by Donald Pleasance, in full-out, eyes-bugging-crazy mode (the young Bruce Dern plays one of his sons).  As some reviewers have noted, these characters seem to belong to a horror movie rather than a western, so over-the-top is their conception -- but, of course, they give old Will a chance to show his mettle, and I'll avoid spoilers by revealing no further details about that.  The real power of the movie, for me, was in the leisurely build-up to the violent action, where the movie takes time to give us something of the texture of the cattleman's life (filmed beautifully in northern California, with the Sierras as backdrop) and the difficulties of domestic life in hard winters in a small cabin in close quarters -- getting firewood, water, milk, stopping up chinks in the log walls, etc. etc.The human interest lies in the developing affection between Penny and the woman (played very well by Joan Hackett) and her boy.  She's a married woman, traveling to join her husband in Oregon, and she has been deserted by the guide that her husband supposedly paid in St. Louis to get them to Oregon.  Up in the Montana hills, they live a kind of domestic life, and the itinerant Penny is drawn to it.  Heston is totally persuasive as an older man, habituated to a hard life, who finds himself uncertain and afraid of the love that he feels.  Hackett's character offers herself to him -- for a life together and not just sex -- and the scene in which that offer is discussed is very well done.  The sexual element in the relationship is forcibly communicated too, and the ending is very engaging dramatically.  This isn't the Charlton Heston that you might expect from ""Ben-Hur,"" and it shows him to have been an actor capable of range and growth.  So don't let the cheesy elements put you off -- this is a good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CKEIH551OPYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEBB8W4#wasThisHelpful","R2CKEIH551OPYE","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cast is strong from top to bottom, Solti is in charge, and the RCA engineers are on the job.  What could possibly go wrong?  Seriously, this recording should have been much better than it is.  I found almost constantly distracting features to it, despite secure singing and basically good remastered sound.  Much of the blame has to be Solti's.  At times, he's fast and metronomic and brutally loud, while at other times, he seems just to let the singers do what they please.  At the beginning of Act 2, for example, the orchestral lead-in to ""Ella mi fu rapita"" is unnecessarily driven and tense, but by the time he gets to ""Parmi veder,"" he seems to be letting Alfredo Kraus play all sorts of dynamic tricks, and then he goes to tense and driven again.  Kraus's singing of ""Parmi veder"" is impressive as vocalism, but seems to me expressively mannered.  In ""La Donna e mobile,"" on the other hand, he's fine.  Also notice how in the final act, the quartet begins nicely, but becomes rushed and over-metrical in the middle.  As a ""reading"" of the opera, Solti's seems bitty and incoherent -- something I would never say about his Wagner or ""Elektra"" or even his fine ""Don Carlo,"" just a few years later.  And Robert Merrill -- the beautiful voice is on display, but the drama requires phrasing and attention to words, and all we get is an outpouring of golden tone.  Another American baritone, Cornell McNeill, in his recording with Sutherland is much more musically and dramatically involved.  A few years later, Merrill recorded a Renato for RCA (with Bergonzi and Price) which is as good as any, but here it's all too monochrome.  Moffo makes up for the dramatic shortcomings of Merrill to some extent -- in the lower and middle voice her phrasing is expressively appropriate and her feel for words welcome.  Higher up, at the very top, the voice can sound a bit forced and unsupported, but like the others, she doesn't make an ugly sound.  I enjoyed hearing Kraus -- a great singer who was under-used by the recording companies during his peak years -- even if at times he gilded the lily.  Among the smaller roles, Piero di Palma (Borsa), Robert Kern (Marullo), David Ward (Monterone), and Ezio Flagello (Sparafucile) did fine work.  I once heard Ward in the theater as Wotan, no less -- the man could sing.An added irritation was what I would call instability in the aural picture.  A voice would be well forward, then suddenly it would be moved back.  Listen to Merrill, for example, right before the ""Si Vendetta"" section in Act Two -- then when ""Si Vendetta"" begins, he's in a different aural space altogether.  Was all this fiddling with voice placement an effort to reproduce the impression of movement on a stage?  If it was, it didn't work -- I found it ubiquitous and distracting.  Along with Solti's erratic direction, it pulled my mind from engagement with the drama to the problems with the presentation and the medium.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUUVDAGQVHPED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YTY119W#wasThisHelpful","RUUVDAGQVHPED","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlike his great older contemporary Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Muti seems to have felt no necessity to have three tries at the Beethoven symphonies.  This ""Eroica"" is from his only set, recorded in the late 1980s, in Philadelphia., and the recorded sound is very good.  What's striking about the performance to me is the extent to which it builds to the last movement, which is just splendidly performed here, with a mixture of delicacy, power, energy, and humor that is altogether winning.  The final movement begins by reminding me of Rossini, but by the end, it seems pure Beethoven without having dispensed with the Rossinian warmth and humor.  There's a lot going on in the orchestra in that movement, and the EMI sound catches it all, so that Muti's control of the whole developing narrative is just laid out for you to enjoy.  The third movement is a success too, with the scherzo and trio beautifully integrated and the playing just superb.I suspect that for most listeners, and maybe for me too, the emotional heart of the piece is the great slow movement.  Muti establishes here and in the first movement, like Klemperer, a pulse that never falters and gives great integrity to these two movements.  Klemperer -- my standard for the slow movement -- digs in to the accents a bit more sharply, with the effect of a craggy, tragic solemnity.  Muti doesn't go for that; rather he goes, it seems to me, for a more restrained and dignified but nonetheless human expression, and it works perfectly on its own terms -- and one effect of his way of handling it is to make the final movement a real climax and not a disappointment after the ""depths"" of the second.  So -- I think this is a really fine account, in beautiful sound, and I can understand why Muti might have felt no need to improve on it.  This well-filled disc ends with nice accounts of a couple of overtures -- ""Fidelio"" and ""The Consecration of the House.""  No reason to hesitate if you like Muti or Beethoven.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C9YPSBJU1XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000024A94#wasThisHelpful","R16C9YPSBJU1XS","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that Santa Fe Listener's account of the strengths and weaknesses of this recording are just about dead right -- the 1974 Israel Philharmonic sounds ""scrappy,"" the tenor Rene Kollo is sorely taxed at times, and the overall sound is unrefined -- though in the latter case the orchestra might be as much to blame as the engineers.  I assume that the recording was made in Tel Aviv, but there's no information on my copy.  Still, I give it four stars, and maybe partly for sentimental reasons -- Kollo and Ludwig were the soloists in the only performance of this music that I heard live in the concert hall -- in 1969, at the Edinburgh Festival, with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.  But it's not just sentiment.  I think Bernstein's pacing and expression here are faultless, for all the shortcomings of the orchestra.  And Kollo catches, as no other singer quite does on record, the underlying desperation and bitterness of the ""Trunkene.""  I would call his singing, as singing, uneven, rather than downright bad.  There are some very strenuous patches that he sings very well, only to let one down with pitch problems in places where one doesn't expect it.  And, I would say, he sings less well as the piece goes on, so that his last song is the least surely sung.  BUT he knows what the words and music are about, and he is fearless in expression, singing with good power, a good line, and good diction, for all the flaws.  To a degree not realized in her fine recording with Klemperer, Christa Ludwig catches a sadness beyond gravity in her singing throughout.  It's simply a great performance.  No one does gravity and acceptance quite as well as Janet Baker, for Haitink -- but Bernstein and Ludwig get at an extra degree of sadness, and they do so without exaggeration -- for I agree with Santa Fe Listener that Bernstein's ""classic"" interpretation for Decca in 1966 (with King and Fischer-Dieskau and the VPO) is made to sound inflated and ponderous by both Culshaw's sound production values as well as Bernstein's and F-D's more highly-inflected and interventionist phrasing.  So -- there's a downside to this recording, but for me it remains a very moving account.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAO1AR4UAN63H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000027MV#wasThisHelpful","RAO1AR4UAN63H","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For all the opulence of the sound -- the almost preternatural unanimity of the strings in particular --  these are surprisingly lively performances, and the solo instruments that require to be highlighted are not made to stand out in too artificial a way.  I was surprised, because I had read some reviews of Karajan's Haydn that weren't complimentary, and perhaps I gave them too much credence because I was enjoying at that time some period instrument recordings (Kuijken's Paris symphonies, with the OAE, also from the EMI stable) and so Karajan didn't sound too appetizing by comparison.  But I was unfair -- the rhythms are good, the inner movements aren't over-romanticized, and the finales are aptly high-spirited.  I should have remembered that Karajan's recording of ""The Creation"" speaks to his feeling for Haydn!  Here, we have one of the Paris Symphonies and two of the very late London set.  If you can resist the humor of the Hen in No. 83, you're soberer than I am.  Overall, I like better the orchestral presence in Colin Davis's set for Philips of the London Symphonies, but you can't go wrong with this well-filled disc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JCHANU77DVBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009NDKVE#wasThisHelpful","R1JCHANU77DVBB","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beautiful sound and great playing from a 50th anniversary release of the music from the original Beaux Arts Trio's first recording.  Amazingly, the original pianist, Menahem Pressler. is still there, and still playing with energy and limpid beauty as required.  The music is great too, of course -- Mendelssohn's First Trio marries a classical form with what we think of as ""romantic"" robustness memorably here.  The first two movements are eloquent and dramatic; the last two start with the skittishly humorous scherzo, the spirit of which returns several times to haunt -- in a charming way -- the lively finale.  Pressler's playing in the opening of the slow movement is very beautiful, and Daniel Hope, the violinist, is superb throughout.  The cellist Antonio Meneses gets more chance to show his quality in the ""Dumky"" Trio of Dvorak.  It isn't a big overpowering cello sound, but it's lovely, focused, and characterful.  The Dumky is a winning piece, with its alternations of melancholy Bohemianism and lively dance-music.  With six movements, all of which play with contrasts of tempo, dynamics, and timbre, Dvorak nonetheless holds it all together.  It's not formal in a ""theme-and-variations"" way, but there is a development and repetition of motifs that unifies the piece musically and expressively.  I should add that in this piece, Daniel Hope makes his violin sound like a very different instrument from its Mendelssohnian self -- in fact, he coaxes at least three different kinds of timbres out of it, depending on the music.  Clearly, these performances have been very carefully thought out -- but the execution sounds as spontaneous and alive as you could wish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGCB1RNM8PTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002VENP0#wasThisHelpful","R3VGCB1RNM8PTN","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It takes a special magic to conduct the first movement of this symphony at the pace that Alsop adopts here -- Giulini with the LAPO (who is even slower!) has that magic, but Alsop can't quite captivate us to the same degree.  Bernstein with the VPO couldn't either, but Bernstein's much quicker 1960 NYPO recording is enchanting.  Somewhere between 1960 Bernstein and Alsop are Bohm and Abbado, and they both do very well.  The later movements bother me less -- but first impressions are important if one is to stay the course, and I can't get away from a sense of ponderous tidiness here.  The recording (which some reviewers don't like) seems not bad at all to my ears (better than Abbado's, in fact), and the playing throughout is never less than highly competent -- but when Haitink, Klemperer, Giulini, and the young Bernstein are all in the field (not to mention Walter, Bohm, Karajan, and Abbado), then there are plenty of more compelling choices.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JEYA17TKQE8B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007ACVIC#wasThisHelpful","R2JEYA17TKQE8B","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fans of Jon Vickers -- and I'm one -- will know that when his singing in Wagner and ""Fidelio,"" for example, is compared to that of his contemporary, the American tenor James King, there's an easy power, and magic, and charisma to his singing that are not King's to command.  But listen to King, with Haitink and Janet Baker, in ""Das Lied von der Erde"" and you have to admit that King is better in almost every way -- he sings firmly, he caresses the vocal line, he knows what the words mean and how to weigh them with no compromising of the musical line.  It's tempting to say that he believes in what he's singing -- and on this disc Jon Vickers sings as if he has no idea what is expressively required.  He's not a singer one associates with Mahler, nor is Davis a noted Mahler conductor, and this well-played, quite brisk traversal of the music doesn't suggest that Davis had any useful advice to give Vickers about expression.  Isn't the thrill of the great, distinctive voice enough? Not in this case -- the singing is powerful but perfunctory to a degree where the German vowels sound very odd indeed.  That leaves Jessye Norman.  She has a better sense of the words, and she phrases expressively, and while she has the low notes for the part, she doesn't have them with the ease and roundness and warmth of a Baker or a Christa Ludwig, true mezzos both.  So . . . two great voices and great singers here, but it's just the wrong place for them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XHTR4HRIPTSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00469KJZM#wasThisHelpful","R1XHTR4HRIPTSA","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is disappointing.  The Decca sound (from 1986) is very good, but Solti's conducting leaves much to be desired.  It's weighty and rich, but it's rhythmically spineless and a bit slow, which might not matter if the accenting was crisper.  This means that in an opera that should be tense in all sorts of ways, it's sluggish and inexpressive.  There are problems with the principals too. Aragall was an attractive Alfredo twenty years earlier; here the singing is firm and he works to maintain a good line, but it's tonally monochrome and in important places (like the Act 1 duet) the words go for nothing.  There's no charm or sexual charisma or humor in the duet -- and all of these things matter.  He does a little better at moments in Act 3, but even so, ""Amaro sol per te"" is really almost bawled, and while O dolce mani"" is better, Solti drags it out to a point where it becomes shapeless.  Te Kanawa has the notes for Tosca but she lacks the amplitude of Price or Caballe.  To her credit, she tries to give the words their due, but in ""Vissi d'arte"" she's undone by Solti's sluggishness.  That leaves Nucci and Piero di Palma to rescue the dramatic singing in this performance -- and they know what they're doing.  Nucci never had the prettiest voice, but he can phrase and sing expressively, and he can accommodate better than the others to Solti's pacing.  Di Palma was an old hand by 1986 at Spoleta, and he sounds lovely and characterizes well.  It's easy to think that ""Tosca"" should be a ""can't miss"" kind of opera, but good singers have foundered on it.  Freni, with Sinopoli, comes to mind.  I think the Caballe/Carreras/Colin Davis recording is really good, and so is the Karajan/Price/Di Stefano.  Then there's the first Callas recording, which is outstanding, though the sound is getting old.  But even the second Callas (with Bergonzi and Gobbi) has something that this one of Solti's doesn't.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IPNE4LKQNZEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041QS#wasThisHelpful","R1IPNE4LKQNZEK","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Predictable kinds of pleasures here -- the malefactors in the novel keep thinking of ways to eradicate Jack Reacher as he zeroes in on their criminal operation, and they always underestimate his resourcefulness of body and mind, and there comes a point where Jack begins to predict the kinds of things that they will get up to and take action even before any threats materialize -- so that, when they do, he's more than ready.  Lee Child's Reacher novels all work like this, so the fun is all in the different specific ways and sets of circumstances that he dreams up to challenge Reacher.  I can imagine a certain kind of reader thinking that there's a sameness about Child's novels and beginning to seek writers who are less formulaic.  I'm not quite ready to join them, maybe partly because the writing is vivid and usually economical and partly because I recognize that at least the formula is Child's own and not a tired reworking of someone else's.  In this novel, it works very well for the first 80% of the novel, and its climax for me comes in the part that is set in Phoenix, Arizona.  (it's not giving away too much to identify it thus).  The last 100 pages or so, however, are a bit anti-climactic, mainly because (in my judgment) the plan that Reacher works out to deal with the main malefactors is very elaborate, and the action is slowed down to an unacceptable extent as that plan works itself out in the plot.  We need to keep reading, however, because it's only in the last 100 pages that the full extent of the evildoers' evil is revealed -- and it's horrible enough, so more's the pity that the tension sags so much in the course of that section.In this novel, Reacher finds himself getting off a train in the middle of the Oklahoma prairie at Mother's Rest, a small town that seems on its face to be a collecting point for grain storage and shipment.  As he does so, he meets Michelle Chang, a PI who is expecting her partner, Keever, to also be arriving on that train.  Even before Reacher arrives, we know that Keever won't be on the train -- a very effective opening section makes that clear -- and Reacher and Chang join forces to try to find out what has happened to Keever -- as a number of townspeople realize what they are trying to find out and take steps to form a plan to thwart them.  Good procedural detective work is done, and a number of American cities are visited as Chang and Reacher pursue their investigation: Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, San Francisco.  We're led from the rural heartland to the dark depths of the internet -- so there's a virtual as well as a geographical sweep to the novel that is attractive -- and it so happens that the geographical location of Mother's Rest itself poses challenges that require the complicated plan that slows down the narration in the last section of the book.  It's in these pages that we realize that that geographical situation has been carefully set up from the very beginning to provide the difficulties that Reacher and Chang (and their ally, an LA investigative journalist) face at the end.  To complicate matters further, Reacher seems in these last pages to be suffering from concussion, although that seems to me to be tacked on a bit gratuitously to heighten suspense.Chang is one of Child's very attractive, very competent, and sexy women -- ex-FBI, and therefore with a developed set of skills -- and she and Reacher are attracted to one another with predictable results, although, as always, Child's romantic scenes are quite chastely and understatedly handled, and none the worse for that.  Reacher amazes her with his capacity for coffee as much as for his forensic skills and physical prowess, and these again are familiar pleasures.  I enjoyed the novel, and, like our heroes, I had to find out what the bad guys were up to -- but that over-elaboration at the end wore on me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R389GKLYZHHSUY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178771#wasThisHelpful","R389GKLYZHHSUY","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Both of these recordings were made in 1969, and clearly EMI wanted to make the most of Oistrakh, Rostropovich, and Richter -- the Soviet ""big three"" at the time.  They had Oistrakh record the Brahms concerto with Szell in Cleveland at the same time as the Double.  It's interesting to hear all three in the Beethoven's Triple Concerto, recorded in Berlin, but I wish that the sound were a little less homogeneously massive and that Karajan had a bit more spring in his step.  It's impressive, but a bit marmoreal.  I prefer Masur's airier sound with the Beaux Arts Trio in their digital recording with the NYPO from the 1990s.  In both of the pieces here, the soloists are well forward, so there's no pretense to a ""natural"" sound picture.  I think that we just have to accept that as a solution to the problem of posing a chamber group in relation to a big orchestra, and if we can -- and I have no problem with it -- then there's a lot of pleasure to be had.  I think though, that the Brahms Double is the gem here.  There's a little bit more open-ness to the sound from Cleveland, and Szell conducts with fire.  His timings aren't all that different from Haitink's 1979 recording (with Rostropovich and Perlman) but my sense is that in the long first movement, where it counts, he drives the faster music hard and relaxes  a bit more than Haitink in the tender moments.  This brings an element of drama to the movement that is absolutely gripping.  Add to that that Rostropovich's sound is caught with more focus here, and that Oistrakh plays his heart out, making a stronger impression than Perlman (or Stern with Ma and Abbado).  The second movement is eloquently phrased in its lovely first subject, and there's liveliness and charm in the third.  And although the soloists ARE out front, the sound overall is better (and the conducting more dramatic) than with Haitink's 1979 recording.

They were brought together by EMI in 1988, in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Concertgebouw, whose orchestra, conducted with fire by Bernard Haitink, accompanies the soloists in both works.  I didn't even know this pairing existed until I picked it up second-hand, and I'm very glad I did, because it's quite wonderful.  The Brahms Double Concerto must be the very devil to balance on a recording, and EMI here has both soloists, Perlman and Rostropovich, well to the fore -- too much so, in fact, as Santa Fe Listener says.  So there is a touch of artificiality about the sound balance, but the orchestra nonetheless is given more than adequate presence, with the lower instruments getting their due.  The orchestral sound -- it's late analogue -- isn't as refined as some Concertgebouw sound I've heard on Philips, but it's fine, and Haitink brings weight and drive to the music.  It's very enjoyable -- not the most emotionally engaging of Brahms's big works, but one in which the two soloists cooperate genially, and the slow movement's first motif has the lovely quality of a folk song.  In the last movement, a good time is being had by all.  If you can live with the forward sound, you should like this.No reservations about the Mendelssohn -- the balance of Perlman and the orchestra is well-judged, and I like it better than the more forward balance of many of Perlman's later DGG discs.  The sound -- early digital this time -- is more refined than in the Brahms, though it isn't in the Telarc class.  It's a robust performance that nonetheless doesn't lack elegance.  Haitink brings an almost Brahmsian weight to the music without sounding sluggish, and Perlman's playing seems to me beyond reproach.  The lovely slow movement is done with restrained elegance, and the hell-for-leather stuff in the finale is invigorating.  All in all, a disc I'm very happy to have.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11PBE1I5LIDHI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000S59VNY#wasThisHelpful","R11PBE1I5LIDHI","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 1990, for good commercial reasons, Sony put together on one disc recordings of two Tchaikovsky concertos by two of the great Russian soloists of the mid-20th Century.  Emil Gilels, in a live 1980 performance of the Piano Concerto No. 1 with Mehta and the NYPO (in good early digital sound) and, from back in the catalogue, a 1959 studio recording of the Violin Concerto, with David Oistrakh and Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra.  There's 70+minutes of music here, and you wouldn't be disappointed with this disc.  Oistrakh is a bit too forward in the aural picture in his recording, but his playing is so beautiful and secure that one almost doesn't mind it.  Only the slow movement suffers a bit -- not from the playing per se but from the balance, which robs the music of some of its raptness.  In the outer movements, the violin part is so invigoratingly entertaining that one doesn't mind the closeness.  Oistrakh conveys the sheer fun and wit of much of the music, and the close-up sound at least enables one to marvel all the more at the deftness and security of the playing.  It's really amazing.  I always feel that this is a concerto that ends with its scherzo, and the qualities associated with a scherzo -- the humor and high spirits -- are fully in evidence here.  And in the coda, the Philadelphia strings show that they are no slouches either, and play with tremendous panache.The Piano Concerto, I think, is a more engaging performance -- but maybe that's just to say that I like the music better.  The recording is very good, the balance fine (though slightly favoring the piano), and Mehta moves this along very well.  Gilels gives an open-hearted, grandly rhetorical account of the piano part -- even in the slow movement, he doesn't go for delicacy, though the playing and phrasing are by no means insensitive, and in the outer movement there's a kind of Olympian gravity to it that is very compelling.  The interpretation seems to me all of a piece, and Mehta and Gilels seem to be in accord on it.  It's a very distinguished account, as good as anything in the catalogue.  Some reviewers were bothered by some audience noise -- coughs and creaks here and there.  With playing like this, I found it easy not to be bothered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HOEU5I07GZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014KFTX8#wasThisHelpful","R38HOEU5I07GZX","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Santa Fe Listener, whose reviews I always find interesting and informative, is really down on this one -- and I just have to say that my reaction was totally different.  I thought that these were lively, spirited, and genial performances.  I don't know many other recordings of this music, but I remember thinking that Arrau/Starker/Szerying (with Inbal) was a bit staid and thinking that Oistrakh/Rostropovich/Richter (with Karajan) was compromised by sound that was a bit muddy and a balance that might have been better -- though, to be fair, it has been a long time since I heard these versions and I haven't heard the latest remasterings.  Here, the sound is very open and airy, and only occasionally did I feel that the piano in particular was a bit too much to the fore.  The playing seemed very good to me, with the Beaux Arts cellist Peter Wiley eloquent in the brief slow movement, but the others doing very well too.  This is mid-period Beethoven (c. 1808), and the atmosphere is relaxed and sociable, and the music not all that demanding for the listener.  It's not one of his greatest works, but it never failed to give pleasure in this recording.  The near-contemporary Choral Fantasia is an odd piece, starting with a piano solo, going into a section of the finale where the orchestra joins the piano in a fantasia-like movement, and ending with a choral section, with soloists, praising the power of music, that it's tempting to see as a dry run for parts of the finale of the Ninth Symphony, which, of course, was very far from Beethoven's mind at the time.  I have heard one other recording -- Brendel's -- and I prefer Brendel's playing to Pressler's, but I didn't find anything very wrong with Pressler's.  Again, the sound and balance are good, the music is enjoyable, and, as with the Concerto, Masur drives his Leipzig orchestra along in an appropriately lively manner.  A good time seems to be being had by all, and I enjoyed it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DGJ1DLZHBYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000415M#wasThisHelpful","R24DGJ1DLZHBYH","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dvorak's Eighth Symphony is perhaps his most immediately likeable -- it was the first Dvorak work I ever bought, on vinyl, back around 1968, and I immediately was taken with it.  That was Karajan's Vienna recording (also on Decca), and good as it was, the sound can't really compare with this great Dohnanyi account from Cleveland.  There is an airiness and bloom to the sound, and the individual instruments and groupings come through with wonderful texture, and at the same time the sense of rhythmic solidity and forward progress in the music isn't compromised.  There's a lovely rustic folkishness to much of the thematic material -- a sense of folk-song and dance -- that is immediately appealing and that couldn't be more different from the Brahmsian good manners of the Seventh Symphony (also beautifully recorded by Dohnanyi, by the way).  Dohnanyi savors the melodies and textures, never seeming to hurry but never losing the thread.  It's a great recording of a very enjoyable work.  The ""filler"" is the Scherzo Capriccioso, a work whose expressive quality is very much in keeping with the symphony -- good natured, and coming across like a cross between a slavonic dance and a Johann Strauss concoction.I picked up this disc cheap and used.  Buyers considering this music would be best served by the ""Decca Double"" release that includes Symphonies 7 and 9 along with 8, all with Dohnanyi and the Clevelanders and at a good price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29A15TKZBTNBP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NBJA4Q#wasThisHelpful","R29A15TKZBTNBP","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes, I like it -- but the trouble is that other Decca recordings of this music are more compelling and in some cases better-recorded too.  That said, this late analogue recording (c.1980) is lively and well-played, even if the sound isn't as refined as it could be for Decca (the ""Argo"" imprint was a Decca label), and on the whole, I think the Italian comes off a bit better than the Scottish.  Perhaps I'm used to a larger orchestra with a richer sound in the Scottish -- something like Dohnanyi's Vienna Philharmonic on a slightly earlier Decca recording, which combines energy and weight of lovely sound in a most engaging way.  Then, a few years after this recording, Solti produced a lovely account -- beautifully sprung, not over-driven -- with the Chicago Symphony -- on Decca too!.  The best Scottish of all is Maag's, from 1957, also on Decca, and marvelously remastered.  Maag's has weight, energy, and a kind of rustic quality that is altogether winning.  If one goes outside Decca, there's Karajan from the early 1970's and Klemperer from a decade earlier.  You'll notice that I've ended up talking about OTHER recordings rather than Marriner's -- and that's the problem: the better and the best are the enemy of the good.  The music is always a pleasure to hear, though -- and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields is never less than reliable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PPMLKPMIPTHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E2R6#wasThisHelpful","R2PPMLKPMIPTHO","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"About a dozen or so years before making his Schumann symphony recordings in Zurich for Arte Nova, David Zinman, in 1989, made a set in Baltimore for Telarc, and if you want Zinman's Schumann, these Telarc recordings are the ones to get.  The Telarc digital sound in the 1980s and early '90s was one of the wonders of the world, and I'm not sure that it has been surpassed to date.  There's nothing wrong with Zinman's Zurich performances, and the sound isn't bad at all -- it's just not in the Telarc class.  And what of the performances of the symphonies on this disc?  Generally, I agree with John Kwok's more detailed earlier review -- they are just superb.  There are other really fine Schumann recordings, of course -- if you think of Schumann as an heir of Beethoven, then Szell's 1960 recordings are the ones to go for.  They're purposeful, energetic, and very excitingly played.  If you see Schumann as the precursor of his great mentor, Brahms, then go for Sawallisch, with the Dresden Staatskapelle, from around 1973 -- they have a weight and thrust reminiscent of Karl Bohm's fine recordings, plenty of energy, and excellent analogue sound.  But if you remember that Schumann was a friend and contemporary of Mendelssohn, then these Zinman recordings should please you.  The sound is airy and spacious, the textures of the instrumental groups are beautifully caught, there's and an attractive impression of ""depth of field"" in the excellently balanced sound.  The Second Symphony sounds intriguing and quirky rather than unsettling (as Sawallisch's account is) in Zinman's interpretation, but it works well.  The Third, of course, is almost always invigorating in any decent performance, and here the drive is both elegant and forward-moving, and the brass instruments are well-differentiated and thrilling to hear.  The moral of this review is that you really should have ALL the recordings mentioned -- great music in great performances.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPRHB1WC5YE8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003CV8#wasThisHelpful","RPRHB1WC5YE8R","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrea Rost has worked with some of the most prestigious conductors of the last twenty years, so clearly she's an estimable artist, but this recording (made in 1997, when Rost was 35) does her no favors.  For a start, when I played it at the volume that I usually employ for vocal recitals, the voice sounded far back in the aural picture, and the orchestra even further back -- and the overall acoustic seemed, for want of a better word, ""boomy.""  Turning up the volume didn't really help -- it still sounded boomy, and the voice seemed to spread,  To make matters worse, there were times when the orchestra seemed to come out of nowhere and almost overwhelm the voice -- so that, for example, the climax of ""Mi chiamano Mimi"" went for nothing.  None of this was the fault of the singer.  Guessing a bit, I would say that she had a voice of good size, with a nice combination of warmth and coloratura flexibility.  Her natural vibrato seemed not excessive, though turning up the volume on it made it perhaps more troubling than it is in the theater.  Her program encompasses Verdi (Gilda, Violetta), Puccini (Mimi, Musetta, Lauretta), and Donizetti (Adina, Lucia, Norina) -- and perhaps inevitably, given the circumstances of recitals and the anonymizing acoustic, they all sounded pretty alike.  Whatever vocal ""acting"" was going on didn't really come through -- which I wouldn't have minded if the acoustic had been better.  Mackerras, a fine conductor, sounded languid here -- though the acoustic did the orchestra no favors either.  Sony sonics are usually pretty reliable, but they let down the show here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4DS0S46RJG9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000029UF#wasThisHelpful","R2L4DS0S46RJG9","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, the sound on this disc is first-rate.  I bought it because I had been impressed by both the sound AND the performance on Andrew Davis's disc of the Vaughan Williams Sixth, and the sound certainly lived up to my expectations.  Listen to the Introduction and Allegro for Strings, Op. 47 -- to me, the highlight of this disc.  The way the recording catches the textures of the whole range of strings, from high to low, from loud to soft, just couldn't be better.  The balance of the string quartet in relation to the concertante orchestral sections is just right, and the playing by all concerned, to my ears, is beautiful.  The earlier Serenade for String Orchestra is also beautifully done, though it's a simpler and less engaging piece.  I have to confess a bias, however -- even well-played, Elgar never gets my pulses racing, much as I appreciate the skill of the orchestration and harmony.  I came to this recording having been listening to a lot of Schumann and Dvorak, and these two can get you out of your chair, so to speak.  And it's not just a matter of a degree of reticence in the climaxes -- compared with Tchaikovsky, for example, or even Vaughan Williams.  Elgar seems to be unwilling or unable to commit himself wholeheartedly to melody.  No sooner does a promising motif present itself than it's worked on or worked over before it has a chance to make an emotional impact.  Is this a fear of vulgarity on Elgar's part -- his textures can be very refined -- or does he just have a different conception of symphonic development from Dvorak or Vaughan Williams?  I'm a very unsophisticated listener -- I like music that hews close to bodily sensation -- the march, the dance, the song -- and yet I suspect that, though I like Vaughan Williams better, Elgar is perhaps the greater composer.  It's a bit like preferring Dickens to Henry James, even as you know that James is masterly in a way that Dickens can't be (and isn't interested in being).Anyway . . . enough about me.  I enjoyed this disc, with the reservations noted above.  It opens with a spirited Cockaigne Overture, and ends with the ""Enigma"" Variations.  My overall impression of the Enigma performance is, again of refinement, and the sound is, again, beautiful.  I've heard tauter accounts, though.  Still, much to appreciate here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGI14SABR3BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000SES#wasThisHelpful","R3KGI14SABR3BC","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read quite a few of the Inspector Banks series, and out of order too -- not that that bothered me -- so I thought I would take a stepback and see what I thought of Robinson's first novel in the series.  Banks, we are to understand, has left high-pressure policing in London to come up to the Yorkshire town of Eastvale, where he expects to find the pace a bit less hectic.  Of course, it isn't really . . . and in this novel Banks finds himself dealing with three separate cases -- one of which comes uncomfortably close to home -- while dealing with his feelings for an attractive psychologist/profiler type who has been foisted on him by his boss to help solve one of the cases.  The three cases involve a peeping Tom, a series of break-ins and thefts, and the murder of an old lady who lives up in the area of Eastvale that gives the book its title.  Banks has to sort out whether or not there are any connections among these crimes -- no spoilers from me! -- before he gets down to solving them.  Followers of this series won't be surprised to know that the plotting is very well worked out, although in later novels Robinson seems at pains to stress how cooperative an enterprise police work is, whereas here, the focus is kept more on Banks than on other detectives in his team.  That's not a big deal, but the greater attention to teamwork in the later novels -- and it isn't altogether absent here, by any means -- adds considerably to their plausibility and attractiveness for me.  Also in the later novels, Robinson's handling of dialogue gets better.  Here, the interactions of Banks and the pretty profiler aren't convincing, and the effect is to make the profiler less of a character and more of a standard-issue temptation for Banks than she (a professional, intelligent person) deserves to be.The novel features an interesting narrative set-up that shows, I think, how alive Robinson is to the technical challenges and opportunities of his craft.  With one crime -- the Peeping Tom -- we actually get the criminal's point of view at places in the novel without his being identified to us.  In the break-in story, we know who the perpetrators are -- but Banks doesn't, until he solves the case.  And in the murder story, we get the victim's view briefly, but no more (again, until the end), putting Banks and the reader in the same boat.  Robinson has to be careful to keep these narrative threads distinct and consistent -- and he succeeds very well.  That's one of the delights of the novel: it plays with generic expectations very deftly.  A good start, then, to the series -- and I think he got better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXPUZRZNA31V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062009389#wasThisHelpful","RTXPUZRZNA31V","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good Trouts are plentiful -- I have the Ax/Ma/Frank et. al.  and the Schiff/Hagen Quartet digital ones -- and they're fine, but when this showed up, used and very cheap, at my local store, I couldn't resist -- it had Rudolf Serkin, Jaime Laredo, and others, from the late 1960s at Marlboro, and since all my other Serkin recordings were concertos or piano solo, I wanted to hear him with a chamber group.  And it's delightful.  The sound doesn't really need any apologies, and the balance is excellent, and it's very mellow and charming music.  The opening is less tense than Ma/Ax, and it's in the opening variations of the fourth movement that one gets a touch of sentimental melancholy in the expression, as if the circumstances of the Schubert song ""Die Forelle"" are being alluded to.  Otherwise, there's wit and sparkle and charm -- a nice performance, even if, strictly speaking, I didn't need it!The filler is a soulful performance of Mozart's ""Stadler"" Quintet for Clarinet and Strings.  Harold Wright is the excellent clarinetist, and Alexander Schneider (Budapest Quartet), Isidore Cohen (Beaux Arts Trio), Samuel Rhodes (Juilliard Quartet), and Leslie Parnas are the string players.  Schneider plays beautifully and eloquently too, in those passages where the first violin is given its head.  Again, the sound is well-balanced, and together with the Trout, it all adds up to 70 minutes of very pleasant listening.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S01BBY6YDH4Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000275O#wasThisHelpful","R2S01BBY6YDH4Z","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In all my recent listening to Schumann symphonies -- Harnoncourt, Szell, Zinman, Klemperer, Haitink, Kubelik -- I forgot that I owned this disc and that when it was released in 1988, it was very highly thought of.  And rightly so, it turns out!  It was recorded in the Lucaskirche, Dresden in 1973 for EMI by a group of engineers and producers whose names meant nothing to me, and with a conductor whose work I didn't know.  There was a great orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle, to look forward to, but it turned out that these recordings were outstanding in every way. Sawallisch conducts with great fire and great refinement, the orchestra is outstanding, and the production team has come up with a sound that has an airy three-dimensional quality of a kind that I associate with the best digital recordings -- and this was a decade prior to the digital revolution.  Go figure, as they say!  When I talk of a 3-D quality, I mean that you can hear the parts of the varied orchestral groupings in sound that is clear, true, and well-balanced to create a sound picture that, if you like, gives much more information than, say, Kubelik's recordings or even Szell's -- and when the Rhenish here has an energy that is close to Szell's, it's clear that you have a really outstanding recording AND performance.  The strings get their due -- as they don't quite with Szell or Kubelik -- and the brass is thrilling, but the subtlety of the wind textures can also be appreciated to a degree that they can't in these other analogue recordings.The Third Symphony, the Rhenish, gets a tremendous performance here, but that's one I was fairly familiar with.  However, thanks to the recording quality, I was able to appreciate the eeriness of much of the writing in the Second Symphony -- a work that sounds like no other and that makes one realize what an original symphonist Schumann could be.  The textures are refined and varied, and thus arresting, but the thematic material often seems unpromising, with odd stops and starts in its forward movement, and then, amazingly, Schumann develops out of it powerful and exciting climaxes.  The overall feel of the piece is unsettled and unsettling, but out of that eventually is built something affirmative and even joyful.  But even at the end, with all the affirmation, it's hard to forget the  almost weird lyricism of the slow movement, some of which re-appears transformed in the fourth, in the build-up to the finale.  A great recording then -- up there with Szell, which is high praise in this music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F019NA45KY71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000DOIW#wasThisHelpful","R1F019NA45KY71","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful-sounding account from the mid-1980s of some great music.  The sound has great warmth, and yet clarity that enables one to hear the individual instruments isn't sacrificed.  The Gabrieli Quartet had been together for 20 years prior to this recording, which must have been one of the last that featured its founding first violinist, Kenneth Sillito, and he plays here with fine feeling and lovely tone.  (He would move on to lead the ASMF Chamber Ensemble.)  The other players are excellent too.  I have a couple of reservations -- the Takacs Quartet, recording just a year later for Decca (and with ITS original first violin) plays the first movement repeats, and in music of this quality, I prefer to hear them.  The Takacs Decca sound is also excellent, and the playing has a bit more pace to it and a nice airy texture, without any compromise in weight.  In addition, the Takacs accounts of these Op. 51 Quartets comes in a Double Decca twofer release with the Third Quartet (Op. 67) and an excellent performance of the Op. 34 Piano Quintet, with then-young Andras Schiff.  All in all, it's a much better bargain.  However, this Gabrieli disc gives much pleasure, and if you can, as I did, pick it up for two or three dollars, you won't be disappointed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2BZERKDRWOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AGB#wasThisHelpful","R2L2BZERKDRWOI","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would very much second the judgment of Mr Giles in his excellent earlier review.  The recordings, 1960 for the Concerto and 1965 for the Fantasia, have come up well in remastered sound (my pressing is from 1988), and is perhaps a bit better than the CBS/Sony recording of the same vintage with Stern and Ormandy -- a lovely disc too, as is the rather better-sounding Accardo recording on Philips, with Colin Davis and the Concertgebouw Orchestra.  All of these recordings seem to me worth having, and I don't feel the need for more recent digital versions!  The Supraphon sound for Suk has the violin advantageously placed, as was typical of the time, but not overbearingly so, and Suk's tone has a tight focus and a wiry sweetness to it that is most attractive.  The orchestra, a little back in the picture, isn't just a homogeneous blur -- it has some body, and the woodwind and timpani can be heard when they count.  The Suk Fantasia was new to me, and while it has a loose, improvisatory quality to it, the lyrical passages are beautiful and affecting, and the more energetic moments are charming.  Dvorak's Concerto is a tighter construction, and finally a more interesting piece, but it has the same qualities of dance contrasted to a somber lyricism that makes this pairing apt and effective.  That Josef Suk, the violinist, is the composer Suk's grandson and Dvorak's great grandson gives a historical interest to this disc too -- one feels that the music must be in the blood, in some sense!  It's such a nice performance that it's easy to think so.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B2IU9XWE1TOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I49N#wasThisHelpful","R2B2IU9XWE1TOD","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with Mr Giles and Santa Fe Listener here -- although I award four stars for sentimental reasons.  I'm softer-hearted than SFL, and Kubelik's Schumann Third was one of the first classical discs I owned, back in the vinyl days.  And Kubelik's Schumann isn't bad at all -- but it's true that Karajan, Bernstein, and (especially) Szell bring a bit more pizzazz to the task.  On its own terms, though, this set is perfectly listenable.  I agree with Giles too that there isn't a whole lot of difference between Kubelik here in 1964 and his Bavarian set from fifteen years later.  In terms of sound, the 1979 BRSO set does more justice to the strings, which sound a bit whistly in the 1964 Berlin recording -- but the overall orchestral picture is a bit more immediate or present in this 1964 recording, at least as I hear it via my Bose headphones.  I would characterize the sound of both as ""warm,"" and there isn't a lot of orchestral detail that comes through -- though the brass does get its due, and in the Third, for example, is quite thrilling.  Szell is still the best choice here, I think  -- his 1960 sound isn't perfect, but the performances pretty much are.  For all that, I have taken Kubelik off the shelves and listened with pleasure to both his Berlin and Bavarian sets.  And by the way, if you must have digital, I find Harnoncourt on Teldec preferable to Zinman on Arte Nova.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8T8ILSNU7OAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UIWSLE#wasThisHelpful","R8T8ILSNU7OAU","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Harnoncourt can be irritating and overly interventionist -- though pretty rarely -- in some of his interpretations, but I have to say I really liked these.  In fact, they are the best digital recordings of Schumann I've heard.  I tested them head to head, as far as just sound is concerned, with Zinman (2003) and Giulini (1981), and this Teldec sound is clearly superior, via my pretty good Bose headphones.  Haitink's early digital recording is good, but still it's less airy than this.  Harnoncourt's orchestra is the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, and they don't sound too heavy or muddy.  It's about as transparent as I've heard Schumann recorded.  It also has a spring in it's step -- even more than Zinman and Giulini, the rhythms are strongly marked, though I don't hear the ponderousness that one reviewer complains of.  There's a kind of Landler-ish feel to these performances, which I like.  Perhaps my favorite in these symphonies remains Szell's Cleveland accounts from around 1960 -- in the Masterworks Heritage pressings, the sound has come up well, and the propulsiveness of the performances is infectious.  Still, this is, I think, a smaller band, and that's all to the good.  The recording of the Fourth is the original version -- I don't really know enough to judge it vis-a-vis Schumann's revision, but on its own terms,  it sounds very engaging.  These recordings were from live performances in Graz -- Teldec did a great job in making them so sonically appealing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RITFDMKP03SDS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009KT6#wasThisHelpful","RITFDMKP03SDS","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cohen's seventh studio album, and again one marvels at his verbal resourcefulness and his careful deployment of musical means that nonetheless keep the challenging lyrics to the fore.  There is indeed a tinge of C&W to the arrangements, but the songs seem to deal with existential themes to an extent that goes well beyond typical C&W subject matter, even when it is gospel-inflected.  A concern with masculine authority, violence, and spirituality seems to underpin this album -- that's a very broad characterization, I know, but to get any more specific, one would have to get into the weeds of textual interpretation to an extent that wouldn't be appropriate in a review.  Suffice it to say that the affirmative songs, like the famous ""Hallelujah,"" and ""Dance Me to the End of Love"" are never uncomplicatedly affirmative -- confusion and a consciousness of finitude (of life, of love) give them weight and contrarian texture, and the blending of the spiritual and the political -- in songs like ""The Captain,"" Hunter's Lullaby,"" and ""Night Comes On"" -- is striking and effective.  I don't have a clear ""favorite song"" from this album, and there's nothing quite as engaging as ""Alexandra Leaving"" (from ""Ten New Songs""), perhaps Cohen's most beautiful song, but they are all thought-provoking and satisfying musically in the moment.Note: I've found the Wikipedia pages on Cohen's albums very informative, usually giving more information than the program notes on the reissued CDs and usefully contextualizing the album in relation to what was going on creatively in Cohen's life at the time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSKKGQAJCJDP6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012GMW7A#wasThisHelpful","RSKKGQAJCJDP6","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A terrific bargain here -- I was lucky enough to get it on a half-price sale (!), but even at list price, you can't go wrong.  Yo Yo Ma is never disappointing, although in some cases he isn't my first choice for some of the music here.  He has no technical limitations at all, but as an interpreter, I tend to find him too uniformly mellow -- but that's a problem only where some more deeply expressive music is concerned.  Thus, his Dvorak Concerto (here with Masur) doesn't impress me as much as Wallfisch's does, but there is other music in which his performances are as good as any.  Thus the discs here with Maazel -- The Saint-Saens/Lalo disc is superb, as is the Prokofiev/Tchaikovsky.  Indeed, his ""Rococo""-Variations are as good as any I've heard.  The chamber discs are very appealing too -- the Brahms sonatas (with Emanuel Ax) are rock-solid, and the Schubert disc, including the Trout Quintet has a very attractive energy in the Quintet and some eloquent playing, with Ax, in the Arpeggione sonata.  Likewise, the ""Belle Epoque"" arrangements, with the excellent Kathryn Stott on piano, are winning -- a really lovely disc.Ma is famous for expanding his horizons beyond the category of ""classical"" music, but in this box he pushes the limits of the familiar classical, with accounts of the Schoenberg concerto (with Ozawa), concertos by New York composers (with Zinman), which includes an arrangement for cello of the Bartok Viola Concerto, and, also with Zinman, a recording of the not-too-often heard Barber and Britten Concertos.  I don't know any of that stuff well at all -- most of it just by name -- but I'm glad to have it all so cheap and in performances that are persuasive and good-sounding.  There are also two discs of Ma's solo Bach suites (not necessarily a first choice, but very well played) and, surprisingly, only one disc of Beethoven -- the Fourth Sonata and some shorter pieces, with Ax.  I don't know why Sony didn't expand the box a little to include all the Beethoven.  Again, these wouldn't necessarily be the most compelling accounts, but they are estimable and in good sound.  I recommend the box -- if you don't have much of this music or just want to add an excellent cellist to your collection, you won't go wrong.  I should just add that the remastered sound is very good to excellent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36J2LNQ23D27H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117VO358#wasThisHelpful","R36J2LNQ23D27H","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own three digital recordings of the Dvorak Cello Concerto, and this is the most satisfactory one.  The solo playing on the others is fine -- Weilerstein with Belohlavek, and Ma with Masur -- but the combination of Wallfisch, Mackerras, and Chandos's engineering carry the day.  Ma plays beautifully, but as often with him, in my judgment, the effect is mellow, and this is a piece of music of deep pathos, if not tragedy.  Masur and the NYPO sound good, but the movement is not particularly propulsive.  In Weilerstein's case, the engineering is the problem.  Her rich, warm sound is foregrounded in the aural picture (and very well caught by the recording), and her interactions with the winds and brass are also spotlit and, again, sound great, but the listener's attention is directed away from the forward movement of the music as a whole and leaves us savoring the details.  Wallfisch has a leaner, grainier tone than either Ma or Weilerstein, but that sounds right for the way he phrases here, and he is very well balanced with the orchestra, the LSO, which Mackerras pushes to very forward-moving and eloquently inflected phrasing.  His feel for dynamic adjustment -- the outburst in the soulful second movement is harrowing -- and tempo modification is impeccable, and he and Wallfisch seem to be in total accord about what this music is getting at.  It's a very moving account.There's an excellent and substantial filler too -- the Dohnanyi Konzertstuck, which I wasn't familiar with and am very glad to have in such a well-played and good-sounding performance.  There are other Dvorak Cello Concerto recordings that I like from the pre-digital era -- Rostropovich with Karajan is justly famous, and Lynn Harrell has a lovely account with Levine.  I'm particularly fond of Heinrich Schiff's account, with Colin Davis, but the sound on Wallfisch/Mackerras is even better, and the performance certainly isn't inferior.  Great music, great performances!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SOJ7RT9FOOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AI7#wasThisHelpful","R23SOJ7RT9FOOU","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the great bargain CDs -- a compilation from two or three Decca/London sessions of the early 1980s that brings together Carlos Bonnell and Charles Dutoit and his Montreal Symphony in Rodrigo's ""Concierto d'Aranjuez,"" in as fine a performance as any on record (and there are many very good ones, I hasten to add: Bream, Williams, Romero . . .). But that's not all -- Dutoit's ""El Amor Brujo"" is very fine, with plenty of energy in the loud fast stuff and real feeling, with an undertone of melancholy, even desperation, in the slower music. Huguette Tourangeau sings the songs with the right edge of rawness, and shows off the bottom of her voice to fine effect. The sound quality and balance are excellent. And to top it all off, there's ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain,"" with de Larrocha and Fruhbeck de Burgos, this time with the London Symphony. Again, the sound, from 1983, is lovely and warm, though the energy and power are there as needed, and Fruhbeck's control of dynamics and transitional movement is exemplary. De Larrocha's pianism is very distinguished here -- the piano sound has warmth and the playing is tender or spirited, as the occasion requires. She can make the piano sound like castanets or a guitar at times -- it's really quite remarkable. This isn't world-shaking music, but for what it is, this is an indispensable disc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUG1SY1X1ZFTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041YL#wasThisHelpful","RUG1SY1X1ZFTH","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: I would describe the sound as unrefined, although it has plenty of presence, but there's none of the airiness that one gets from, say, Telarc discs of the same vintage, i. e. 1980-90.  I was less bothered by this in the ""Amor Brujo,"" where the slower sections are played with great feeling and where Sarah Walker, the distinguished British mezzo, shows her lower range and her temperament to fine effect.  The louder music is a bit too raw and in-your-face, however, and this is particularly damaging in ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain.""  The pianist, Margaret Fingerhut, is miked a bit too closely, so overall the charm and sense of mystery doesn't come across as effectively as it should.  A better bet are the performances on Decca/London from the early 1980s, with Dutoit capturing the magic and the energy of ""El Amor Brujo,"" and Fruhbeck de Burgos conducting a wonderful ""Nights in the Gardens,"" where Alicia de Larrocha gives a remarkable performance of the piano part, seeming to be imitate at times castanets and a guitar as well as being pianistic when it counts.  Her sound is warmer than Fingerhut's, and the balance is better.  Fruhbeck's grasp of the dynamics and phrasal adjustments brings it all to life.  As more than a bonus, there's also a great performance of Rodrigo's Concierto d'Aranjuez, with Carlos Bonnell, conducted by Dutoit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15KOG2F4LNH9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006SGEZG#wasThisHelpful","R15KOG2F4LNH9T","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Teldec gave Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra beautiful sound here (in 1990) -- it's particularly striking how well it catches the dynamic variety in the creepy, quiet music that makes up the final movement.  That's music that sounds like the wind passing over the waste land of post-World War 2 Europe, both desolate and beautiful.  Santa Fe Listener commented on how difficult it was to get a volume setting that did justice to the loud stuff and the very quiet stuff.  On my Bose headphones, I was able to hear it all, with nice presence.  The earlier movements are brutal, at times recalling Mahler or reminding one of Shostakovich, and Andrew Davis drives it all home effectively.  Nothing could be further from the Vaughan Williams of English folksong-inspired pastoral lyricism, and I would guess that there isn't likely with music like this to be much room for differences that matter in interpretive nuance.  Previn's and Haitink's accounts are both very good too (I haven't heard Boult's or Slatkin's).  There is a lovely Holstian moment or two of repose late in the first movement, but it seems to be there only to NOT be taken up or sustained in what follows in this bleak and compelling work.The Tallis Fantasia makes for one nice filler -- it's a piece that I like but feel that if I could hear it live in an appropriate acoustic I would like it better.  And ""The Lark Ascending"" rounds out the disc.  It's hard to believe that Tasmin Little has been before the public for 25 years now.  She has just recorded ""The Lark"" again for Chandos (with the Moeran concerto), and very nice it is.  This early performance seems equally fine to me, though it's not a piece I spend a lot of time thinking about.  The sound in the ""Lark"" and the Fantasia"" is excellent too.  Fine disc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1II3SYUFAVNA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000SEB#wasThisHelpful","R1II3SYUFAVNA4","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I found this a better movie to think about after the fact than it was to see.  Clearly, it's very thoughtfully put together, and visually it is consistently striking, though the experience of seeing it made me think that the three genres that are being blended here perhaps don't hang together very well.  The genres are action thriller, futuristic cautionary tale, and fairy tale.  The first has been better done in the Bourne movies; in the second, ""Blade Runner"" stands out; and in third, maybe Cocteau's 1946 ""La Belle et la Bete"" is a good example.  But of course, these movies aren't exactly trying to put things together in the way ""Hanna"" is.  I don't much care for action thrillers, so that aspect of the story bored me -- but that's just me.  Many people like this genre, and the director of ""Hanna,"" Joe Wright, has every right to make the movie he wants to make -- and I've found it worth reflecting on.In the back story, Erik Heller (Eric Bana) is an ex-CIA operative who had been engaged in a program to genetically alter infants so that they would grow up to be killing machines -- ""perfect soldiers"" is his phrase.  The program seems to have been shut down by an upper-level CIA administrator, Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett) and the infants involved have been eliminated -- all except Hanna, whose mother is killed by Wiegler, who can't however, prevent Erik from escaping with Hanna (Saoirse Ronan).  He raises Hanna according to his program, and his goal is to have her kill Wiegler.  In fairy story terms, Wiegler comes across as a kind of wicked witch here, but Heller isn't benevolent -- he seems not to be Hanna's biological father.  I would call him a ""mad scientist"" figure.  He brings Hanna up in the woods of Finland, and while they are in a sense attached to one another, it's obviously a perverse relationship.  Hanna's skill in unarmed combat with Heller is what wins his approval.  So ironically, it's possible to see the wicked witch as being in the right here -- except that Wiegler's determination to stop Hanna and Heller seems to be driven less by principle (""genetic experiments on human subjects are ethically dubious"") than by jealousy.  Hanna's dying mother's last words, addressed to Wiegler, are ""You'll never have her.""  It sounds like a jibe at Wiegler's childlessness and perhaps sterility, and I wondered if at some point in the past Heller and Wiegler hadn't been lovers as well as colleagues.  The idea of sterility seems to me to be the dominating trope of the movie -- all the settings, Finland in winter, the Moroccan desert in summer, the panopticon at the CIA black site, the glass and steel of Berlin, and the infantilizing Grimm-themed funhouse all say that Hanna has been denatured.  The geo-political aspects of these places hardly register; it's the visual presentation that carries the message.  All that means too that Hanna has no future.  The story comes to a satisfactory action thriller close -- but what then?  The closest Hanna has come to relatively normal human contact is when she travels for a while, after her escape from the panopticon, with a neo-hippie family and their two children.  These scenes afford some humor and some recognizable emotional connections -- but that's it.  It doesn't last.  The cautionary aspect of the story has to do, I think, with the exploitation of technology to manipulate human beings by other human beings driven by ambition, jealousy, hatred, power, or whatever.  The old ""essential"" human tendencies -- and fairy tales seem to me to be almost by definition essentialist -- in a technologically sophisticated age, given free play, threaten to dehumanize our interactions.  We (the audience) are made to feel the pathos of Hanna's situation in a way that Hanna can't and perhaps never will.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TFQXYR8TNZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CMSDKA#wasThisHelpful","R1TFQXYR8TNZ0","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since this particular issue of Klemperer's recordings, EMI/Warner has issued a remastered 4-disc box, which I noted in a March 2013 review.  I own separate discs of the symphonies in a 1989 remastering, and the box reviewed here includes remasterings from 1999.  At around $3.00 a disc (used) from my local indie store, I couldn't resist, so I'm going to replace my 1989 versions with this box -- which helps with my space/storage issues too!  These recordings, from the late 1950's, were superbly engineered and produced to begin with by Walter Legge.  They are still as compelling as any other accounts of the symphonies on the market.  The word sometimes applied to Klemperer's Brahms is ""craggy"" -- and I think that is partly because the sound, though present, clear, and well-balanced, isn't glamorous. Also, it's because Klemperer's rhythmic alertness doesn't let you want to linger as you listen -- he moves along with great cogency, and yet each symphony emerges with its own character, because Klemperer trusts the music and trusts his orchestra and his instincts. In some more recent digital versions, you'll hear more of the inner voices of the piece, and that's very nice, but the heartbeat has to be there, and Klemperer gets you to it.  The First Symphony is gloriously rendered, and the Second and Third are great too. For me, the Fourth is the touchstone: this is the Fourth by which I measure the others I hear, and it's simply amazing that it was recorded in 1956 and 1957. The sound shows its age a bit -- the strings a little whistle-y -- but the whole thing is perfectly balanced, and the sound is airy and present. I'm reminded of Maag's great Mendelssohn Third (on Decca) from the same year. So credit Walter Legge and Douglas Larter, his sound man, for getting the sound right. But even more credit to Klemperer, whose pacing of the symphony makes it more engaging and even exciting than any other I've heard so far. Although often criticized for taking things too slowly, Klemperer here is faster than other conductors, and in the first movement that gives it a sense of both momentum and coherence: the transitions seem just right, because Klemperer convinces you that he knows where he's going. If I'm not mistaken, he picks up the pace just a bit at the end of the movement, and he drives it home excitingly. The two inner movements have an almost Mendelssohnian flavor to them -- the little dance-figure with a kick in the scherzo, and the phrasing of the first theme in the slow movement. The slow movement has two gorgeous melodies that are related to each other, and Klemperer realizes that he doesn't have to convince his hearer that they're beautiful -- so he trusts them and doesn't linger, and the effect is enlivening. The final movement is, like the first, taken at a good pace, and the variations seem to grow out of one another very naturally. There are times when we're reminded of the third movement in some of the brass figures, and the ""slow"" variations are grippingly done, before Klemperer moves confidently to the end. This is a Fourth to cherish in a set to cherish.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DG4W26AYMJTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002Z2YMX2#wasThisHelpful","R1DG4W26AYMJTH","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A tightly-constructed, atmospherically-shot, and very well paced independent film, ""Frozen River"" reveals the full extent of the talent of an actress I had previously seen in small parts: Melissa Leo. She plays Ray Eddy, a woman living in a small mobile-home in upstate New York, near the Canadian border and near an Indian Reservation that spans the border and that therefore has become a place from which people can be smuggled into the United States.  Ray gets into smuggling because she's desperate -- the money she had been saving to make a downpayment on a double-wide has been taken by her husband, a gambling addict, and one of the first shots in the movie shows us a close-up of Ray, weeping in her car outside her home, with the empty glove-compartment testifying to her husband's theft of the money.  It's just before Christmas, and  she has to go in and tell her five-year-old son that they won't be moving to a new home after all.  She finds her husband's car, which has been appropriated by a Native American woman, Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), who has troubles of her own -- she has been widowed as a result of her husband's having taken her place on a smuggling run late in her pregnancy, and her child has been taken by her mother-in-law.  She wants the child back, and she's trying to use smuggling to raise the money to be able to take and keep him.  It's Lila who tells Ray that she saw her husband abandon the car -- leaving the keys -- and get on a bus.  Ray assumes he headed for Atlantic City.The story tells how the women start to work together as smugglers to make what they need.  There's nothing glamorous about the operation: it involves driving over the frozen St. Lawrence River, and the Highway Patrol is on the watch when their car gets off the reservation (where the HP has no jurisdiction).  Meanwhile, Ray is dealing with her elder son, T. J., who is 15 and is willing to drop out of school and get a job to help out.  His mother resists this plan, and the dynamic between the deserted woman and the abandoned boy is beautifully and plausibly played by Leo and Charlie McDermott.  There comes a point -- avoiding details to avoid spoilers -- where one last run (so both women hope) has to be made to garner the money they need, and it doesn't go well.  Again, the circumstances are plausibly handled, and the suspense that is built up is achieved without resort to melodrama or special effects.  Near the end, Ray has to make a choice -- or, rather, she makes a choice that she doesn't have to make, and the way that she makes it is beautifully consonant with the way that we have seen the relationship between the women developing.  The ending is touching, without being implausibly optimistic.Misty Upham, who died tragically about six years after the film was made, is memorable as Lila.  The focus of sympathy and emotional interest has to be evenly balanced if the film is going to work.  These are two strong women -- not a plucky white woman taking care of a hapless Native American.  There is in fact something like a power-struggle early in their dealings with one another, but then the relationship settles.  Each comes to understand the family dynamic of the other, so this is a movie about ""family values,"" if you can detach from that term all the sentimental accretions it has undergone in the last 30 years.  Doing the wrong thing to do the right thing is an old story in movies, but it's very effectively employed here.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKV6E0VB4LT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KEHAG2#wasThisHelpful","R3VKV6E0VB4LT6","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard to dislike such an obviously well-meaning movie, with its attractive cast, nice camera work, and sensible message, but there's something maybe too low-key about it for it to be totally compelling dramatically.  That might be because it seems not sure whether the drama or the message should come to the fore.  The message is two-part: first, it's that international multi-billion dollar corporations are ruthless in protecting their bottom lines; second is the point that in some cases, the people that they seek to make deals with are in impossible situations and often the promised deal is the best they can hope to get. That latter message is what Steve Butler (Matt Damon), representing Global Energy, is telling the small farmers of McKinley, PA who can't make good livings from their land and are being offered large sums and other incentives to lease their land for hydraulic fracturing, ""fracking,"" for natural gas. He believes it -- his pitch is that when his family's Iowa town went under when Caterpillar left, he saw the impossibility of making small farming work.  He can't guarantee that fracking won't have some adverse environmental consequences, but these aren't inevitable, he argues, and besides -- where else would you get money to enable you to live a decent life and give the kids a decent education?Steve and his sales partner Sue (Frances McDormand) are making progress, but two complications arise: a crusty local schoolteacher, Frank Yates (Hal Holbrook), reveals a good deal of expertise about the physics and hydraulics of fracking -- and he has enough standing in the town to be able to persuade the local board to allow a town-wide vote on whether or not to allow fracking in McKinley. Yates acknowledges Steve's point about the economics of the local situation, but he worries about possible unforeseen impacts as well as the tendency among anxious townspeople to reduce all problems to economics.  The other complication is the arrival of an environmental activist, Dustin Noble (John Krasinski), who makes a strong pitch against Steve, with posters of dead cows and the message ""Stop Global"" -- and who also seems to attract some interest from Alice (Rosemarie DeWitt), a schoolteacher whom Steve is attracted to.  The drama, such as it is, resides in the conflict between Steve and Dustin for the soul of the town and the love, perhaps, of Alice -- but that dimension of the story is all very low-key, and the thematic issues tend to dominate.  The relation between Steve and Sue, including their different attitudes to their job, is interesting too, and I can't quite decide whether the dynamic between them suffers from being under-written or whether enough is given to let us see the relationship as more complicated than we had at first thought.There's a twist at the end -- nothing I've said so far constitutes a spoiler -- that changes our perceptions about a number of things, so the movie is worth sticking with.  The predicaments of the farmers are real enough, and the movie isn't too long, and it has a nice screenplay by Damon and Krasinski.  Gus Van Sant directs without calling attention to himself.  You won't find here the goofy and at times anarchic humor of ""Local Hero,"" a great movie on a similar situation, but on the other hand, you won't find the broad drama and button-holing moralizing of ""Erin Brokovich,"" enjoyable too in its way.  ""Promised Land"" might be low-key, but there's something attractively unassuming about it too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K5ZU0CVJZHQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BWUDUR2#wasThisHelpful","R1K5ZU0CVJZHQD","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me get an unkind thought out of the way: would Natalie Wood's teeth really be as white and regular as they are in this movie if she had been living out in the wild for years with the Comanches?  Ah well . . . luckily, the movie prompts us to more substantive reflection too, and Wood's character, Debbie, is not so much a character (for no acting is required of her here) as an icon, the object of the search, and it's what motivates the searchers Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) and Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) that comes to matter as much as the rigors of the search itself.  The setting, ostensibly West Texas, but actually filmed largely around Monument Valley in Utah, as so many of John Ford's movies were, is 1868, and Ethan Edwards has been gone from home for eight years.  What has he been doing since the end of the Civil War (in which he fought on the Confederate side)?  He seems to have been a mercenary in Mexico, and it's hinted that he might even have some criminal activity in his past, but his old friend Samuel Johnson Clayton (Ward Bond) doesn't push it.  What becomes clear early is that his long absence might have to do with his affections for his brother's wife, which is made clear in an understated way, and that he has returned a racist, as we would now say.  Perhaps he always has been, but now the idea of miscegenation between Indian (Comanches in this part of the world) and white folks deeply disturbs him, and when his niece, Debby, is taken after an Indian attack that leaves his brother and family dead, the search for her becomes a search to purify her by killing her --- for Ethan assumes, correctly as it turns out, that Debbie has grown up to become a wife of the raiding Comanche chief, Scar.  John Wayne gives a performance here that matches at least his great performance as another kind of obsessive in ""Red River.""  We tended to think, late in Wayne's life, that he simply played versions of himself, but that does him an injustice.  Parts were written for him of a certain kind, and he played them as a professional actor should, but he was capable of doing more than he was often given to do, and a movie like this shows it.Fortunately for Debbie, Ethan is accompanied by Martin, whom Ethan tends to look down on both for his youth and for the fact that Martin -- in effect an adoptive brother to Debbie -- is himself eighth-Indian.  And when the final confrontations come, Martin rises to the occasion . . . and, eventually, Ethan does too, but when he gets Debbie back to the settlement where she grew up, he seems himself to feel that it is no place for him.  The final shot is iconic, and by that time we realize that what Ford and Wayne have given us not just a stereotypical portrait of a ""loner"" but a nuanced account of a man who might realize that his attitudes can't survive in the nascent ""civilization"" that West Texas represents here -- it's a place that has a place for a person of mixed blood, like Martin, and it's a place where crazy folks like Mose Harper (Hank Worden) and ""foreigners"" like the Scandinavian settlers the Jorgensons, have a place too.  It's to the credit of Ford and his screenwriter Frank Nugent that they allow most of our grasp of the dynamics of the settlement to be conveyed more by image and gesture than by explicit dialogue and explanation -- which would be a problem for plausibility, given that we don't seem to be among very articulate people here.The movie was made in 1955, and it seems reasonable to assume that Ford is touching on the fears of many Southern whites especially at a time when the Civil Rights movement was taking off.  Brown v. Board of Education had been decided the previous year, and Dr. King was in Montgomery around the time of the filming.  Things were stirring, and Ford seems willing to keep them stirred.  The odd sub-plot of Martin's comic courtship of the Jorgensons' daughter Laurie (Vera Miles, not totally convincing) interwoven with the uncomfortable comedy, if comedy it is, of Martin's acquiring an Indian wife, whom he calls ""Look,"" in the course of the search is important.  Ethan finds it humorous -- so when the Indian maiden is the ostensible sexual object, he clearly has no qualms.  Laurie, on hearing about it in the labored single letter she gets from Martin, is obviously disturbed and becomes open to being courted by Charlie McCorry (Ken Curtis), a musician and a largely comic and non-sexual figure.  Martin and Ethan get back on Laurie's wedding day -- and the ending of that strand of the plot devolves into ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers""-type comedy, but given what has gone before, we can't just sit back and enjoy it -- especially with Ethan and Debby in the picture.  The bottom line for me is that the movie still has the power to disturb, though whether in 2015 we're disturbed in the way that the audiences were sixty years ago seems questionable.  But where issues of race, justice, and empathy are concerned, any disturbance that prompts reflection is salutary.  So see this if you haven't already.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EWFCSWKER96Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QJUX24#wasThisHelpful","R1EWFCSWKER96Y","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a movie of small pleasures.  Released in 1985, and set in the late 1970s, it resists the temptation to be politically rhetorical and keeps the focus on characters who seem too dim (in one case) and immature (in the other) to be doing what they're doing.  The opening credits set the scene: a montage of newsreel footage, all of which, with its focus on wars, scandals, and assassinations, reminds us of the reasons to be disaffected about politics by the late 1970s.  In the very comfortable middle-class setting of the story, Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) seems to like spending time with is falcon more than he does thinking about his future, and he clearly is uneasy with his father's pulling strings to get him a start with a contractor that processes intelligence for the government.  But he lacks the force of personality to stand up to his father, who works for the FBI, and goes along, while clearly resenting his father's power over him.  The contractor's office is sloppily run, and Chris discovers just how much the US government is committed to interfering in the politics of other countries, like Australia.  This gives Chris the reason he needs to stick it to the government, and by association his father, and think about selling information to the Russians.His means of doing so is Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), his aimless, air-headed, drug-dealing best friend, who once was an altar boy with Chris and who, on hearing of Chris's disaffection with the government, offers to be the man who delivers the intelligence on Chris's behalf.  He frequently travels to Mexico, and it's his idea just to walk into the Soviet Embassy and do what has to be done.  There's a mixture of comedy and pathos in this, for Daulton has no idea how seriously the Soviets or the Americans take spying, and his contact Alex (David Suchet, in an understated, essentially comic performance) is by turns amused, irritated, frustrated, and empathetic with this strange creature who claims to have important information about US spying, satellites, etc.  Daulton talks a good game at the embassy, but he really has no idea what he's talking about or what exactly he is or isn't getting from Chris to deliver.  Sean Penn's breakout performance a couple of years earlier was as the stoner Spicoli, in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" and there's just enough Spicoli in his characterization of Daulton to make him both richly amusing and (because we're in different circumstances from Ridgemont High) finally pathetic.  Like Chris, he's at odds with his family -- but they have no idea what to do about his sloppiness and drug-dealing, which is all they know about.  Richard Dysart effectively portrays Daulton's ineffective Dad.Penn and Hutton must have been only 24 when they made this movie with the director John Schlesinger, best known to me as the director of ""Midnight Cowboy.""  Their performances as not-fully-grown-up young men are very good.  If Schlesinger is hinting at a connection between anti-government activism and immaturity -- a sense that the idea of it attracts a certain kind of immature temperament from young men of a class that perhaps encourages them to overconfidently overvalue their abilities -- he doesn't rub our noses in it.  He just lets the story make its points, and the writing in Steven Zaillian's screenplay is good enough to enable the actors to round out their characters.  I won't give away plot details but just say that it isn't a comedy, for all its comic moments, but ""tragi-comedy"" doesn't seem quite right either.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OIW6HQEL3R5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K0DR#wasThisHelpful","R2OIW6HQEL3R5Z","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five stars is supposed to say, ""I love it!"" but that doesn't seem an appropriate response to a movie about such harrowing events and circumstances.  It's hard to shake the notion nowadays -- especially in the age of Pixar and bromances -- of movies as anything but entertainment, but you have to do that as best you can with a film like this.  Poldek Socha (Robert Wi'ckiewicz) is no Oskar Schindler, with his wealth and social connections to the Nazis.  Socha is a sewer inspector in Lvov, who discovers a group of Jews -- and extended family, in effect -- during an inspection.  They have created an entrance to the sewers from their house, and escape into them just as a round-up is beginning in the ghetto.  Basically, he allows himself to be bribed by them, but when they run out of money, he doesn't cease to help them.  There are risks for him, of course, for the Polish authorities are cooperating with the Nazis and suspect that the sewers are being used.  Luckily, they don't suspect Socha -- at least not until it's too late.  Visually, the movie does a superb job of creating a sense of the dank filth and claustrophobia of the sewers.  There are Hollywood-ish moments -- the big rainstorm that pulls Socha away from his daughter's first communion because he realizes the threat it poses to the Jews is perhaps the most obvious one, and very suspenseful it is.  The cost to Socha is suggested powerfully, especially in the wake of his killing of a German soldier, but most engagingly in the representation of the relationship between Socha and his wife, Wanda (Kinga Preis), who instinctively feels for the Jewish victims of the Nazi occupation but is frightened and worried by her husband's growing commitment to them.  After the rainstorm, Wanda, angry at Socha's leaving the communion service, walks out -- the house is empty when Socha returns, tired and stressed.  The scene between them when she walks in is wonderfully and credibly played, testimony to the way the characters have been represented throughout.Underground, the early bickering and tensions related to status among the Jews soon gives way to a serious focus on survival.  There's a love interest that develops, there are children who get lost, and a baby is born. And if rats in the slimy dark freak you out, prepare to be freaked.  As plot elements, some of these might strike the viewer as standard narrative shaping that is perhaps more a matter of convention rather than truth, but visually none of it is glamorized, and such scenes create focuses of empathy that perhaps a more documentary treatment could not manage.  The alternations of stoic endurance, near-hysteria, depression, sexual frustration -- it's all there.  And in Socha and Wanda, we have characters who just do the right things without theorizing about it -- they just keep on doing, for when they stop to reflect, they tend to tell themselves they're crazy, so they stop reflecting.  On the Jews' side, there is a developing of trust with Socha that takes time, and there are interpersonal tensions among themselves that aren't sentimentally resolved in every case.  All in all, I found it moving, absorbing, and very well put together by Agnieska Holland.  The filming in the sewers, which seeks to do justice to the literal darkness while still letting us see enough, is very well managed.  Jolanta Dylewska was the cinematographer and deserves great credit for her work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR87AQHHZL4QA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UI0CIA#wasThisHelpful","RR87AQHHZL4QA","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The earliest Western I remember seeing, when I was about 12 -- and the scene with James Stewart getting his hand shot has stayed with me for the past 58 years.  I saw this again right after seeing the original ""3:10 to Yuma,"" and it's a very different kind of movie.  There's a whole different kind of suspense (that is shared with ""whodunits""), and there is too in effect a double-plot: the main one is the effort by Will Lockhart (James Stewart), the ""man"" of the title, to find out who was responsible for his brother's death in the massacre of a troop of cavalry in New Mexico; the other plot is the story of Alec Waggoman and his family as they seek to extend their cattle ranch to take in more land and put smaller farmers out of business.  Alec (Donald Crisp) depends on his foreman Vic Hansbro (Arthur Kennedy) to keep his out-of-control and violent son Dave (Alex Nicol) out of too much trouble and to try to educate him in the qualities needed to run the ranch.  Vic has the qualities Alec would like to see in his son, and he has made vague promises that when he dies, Vic will inherit at least part of the ranch.  At other times, he seems to wobble on this promise (if promise it was), so the situation is fraught for both Dave and Vic.  It's into this family dynamic that Lockhart comes, and he's almost immediately attracted to Barbara Waggoman, Alec's niece (Cathy O'Donnell), who runs a store in the town of Coronado.  Barbara is sort of engaged to Vic, which is a complication, and Lockhart is also befriended by Kate Canaday (Aline MacMahon). a small rancher who was jilted by Alec decades earlier.  Lockhart is very soon made aware that he's not welcome in Coronado, with some of the pressure coming from Dave, but it isn't clear immediately whether Dave is acting only on his own behalf.  Be that as it may, even the sheriff seems to do pretty much what Alec wants -- money is power in Coronado.  Lockhart soon comes to see that somebody is selling guns to the local Apaches -- another mystery he has to solve . . .I'll avoid plot details in the interest of avoiding spoilers, so let me just say that the problem with the movie lies in some casting choices.  James Stewart is very good as a man whose obsession for revenge is kept under wraps most of the time, though when it breaks out, it's scary.  Arthur Kennedy is fine as Vic, though it's an oddly conceived part, I think.  But Crisp and Nicol -- and especially the former -- seem in a different movie altogether.  Dave is a bit of a stereotype, and Nicol brings some intense moments to him, but he's not all that interesting.  Donald Crisp should seem formidable on some level as Alec, but it's a flat performance.  MacMahon brings some pizzazz to the older woman, Kate, but Cathy O'Donnell just isn't a credible object of desire as Barbara, even though she plays the role of an apparently independent, resourceful woman -- she doesn't convince, though.For all these limitations, there's plenty to enjoy.  Good pacing, nice attention to the arroyos and plains of New Mexico, and a double-plot that is well-integrated, despite the casting limitations.  I enjoyed seeing it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9HCRSRZBFQEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000031EGW#wasThisHelpful","R9HCRSRZBFQEL","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was 13 when this movie came out.  I saw ""Shane,"" ""High Noon,"" and ""The Man from Laramie"" (and a bunch of less-distinguished but enjoyable Westerns), but I missed this one, and I'm glad to have seen it now, in the excellent print by Criterion, with interesting ""special feature"" interviews with Elmore Leonard (on whose early story the movie is based) and Glenn Ford's son, who was about 12 when Glenn was working on the film.  Leonard, interviewed in 2013, not long before he died, looks frail but is full of pep and information.  It's a charming and useful addition.  Ford's son is more gossipy, but there's an enjoyment of his dad in his remarks that doesn't preclude his seeing Ford's weaknesses as a husband and father very clearly.  The essay included in the booklet, by Kent Jones, maybe states the case for Delmer Daves's immortality a bit too much . . . but it also has good, contextualizing information.The movie, beautifully shot (by Charles Lawton, Jr) and very effectively paced by Delmer Daves, is now considered a ""classic"" of the genre, and I'm going to say nothing of the plot, just in case there are a few younger fans of the genre who might not have seen it yet.  It has a more psychological focus than Zinnemann's ""High Noon"" (where the focus is ethical), and it also is less claustrophobically zeroed in on place than Zinnemann's movie (and that isn't a criticism of Zinnemann).  Rather, it connects the psychological pressure on Dan Evans (Van Heflin) to the economics of his situation as a small rancher in drought-stricken Arizona and to his pained consciousness of perhaps failing as a husband and a father in part because of the economic pressures on him.  Heflin, who was wonderful in ""Shane,"" where his masculinity was also in question, is superb here with a character more richly connected to his inner life.  If the pressures on Dan are quite transparent -- and they are transparent too to Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), the outlaw whom Dan has undertaken (for $200.00) to get safely on to the 3:10 train to Yuma and to prison -- Wade himself is less transparent.  He seems a mysterious mixture of impulses, and Glenn Ford gives a winning performance of this complicated man.  Apparently, Ford was initially offered the Evans character but turned it down, seeing something in Wade that he wanted to have a go at -- a good choice on his part!  Felicia Farr, Henry Jones , and Robert Emhardt are very good in supporting roles, while the members of Wade's gang are less sharply individualized -- which makes Wade's charisma all the more compelling.  The movie runs at 90 minutes, with plenty of time given to crisply written scenes in a variety of locations (the range, the hotel in town, Evans's farm, the train station), and the combination of adequately dramatized lead-up and the growing suspense of the two hours before 3:10 are really very efficiently and concisely handled.  It's a must-see.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11WLE9QAA9DO6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJB2G74#wasThisHelpful","R11WLE9QAA9DO6","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why is it that I'm happy to own multiple recordings of Beethoven's, Brahms', and Mozart's major works but that I don't feel the need to have as much Haydn? As I cull my CD collection to make room for new purchases, I'm finding that I can readily give up the recordings of Haydn's twelve ""London"" symphonies by Jochum and Szell and be content to keep Colin Davis's two Philips Duo sets. There's nothing wrong with the performances by Jochum (DGG) and Szell (CBS/Sony), but I don't find their differences from Davis's -- which seem to me minor -- makes up for the superiority in sound on the Philips discs.

These recordings are from the late 1970s-early 1980's, with the later ones being digital. The analogue recordings are fine, though. Jochum's accounts are 8-10 years earlier, and their sound can be a bit bright or glaring in the loud, high writing, while Szell's 1960's recordings are drier in sound and a bit more homogenous.

"4 1/2 stars -- I haven't heard all the recordings of the Brahms Second Piano Concerto (Pollini's most recent, or Hamelin's, for example), but of the many I've heard, this is certainly the best sounding.  In the 1990's, Haitink was making some excellent recordings in Boston, mostly for Philips, and this is another beauty.  The orchestral sound is tonally lovely, well-balanced, and transparent, and, as always, Haitink's grasp of an evolving musical narrative is compelling.  The piano is beautifully balanced with the orchestra too, and I have never heard Ax sound better.  His playing too is distinguished for its coherence and variety in phrasing and dynamics.  The final two movements are as good as any on record, with the playfulness of the final movement especially noteworthy.  The lovely slow movement is taken at a nice moderate pace -- faster than Katsaris and Kovacevich -- but never sounding rushed and always poised and eloquent.  The gentle lead-in to the return of the cello late in the movement has just the right hushed expectancy to it.  If I have one reservation, it's that the expressive contrasts and sense of drama could be a bit more heightened in the first two movements.  Fleisher and Serkin (both with Szell) are gripping in these movements, and so is Arrau, with both Guilini (1960) and Haitink (1969), with the later account being very well recorded for its time, though the piano is more to the fore than I would ideally like.  For all that, Ax has an idea about these movements that he executes beautifully, and I can see some listeners preferring his account to the more stormy or troubled ones.  This one's a keeper for me.The filler is a transcription for cello and piano of a violin sonata.  It's beautifully played by Ax and Yo-Yo Ma, though I'll confess to preferring the original combination of instruments (in the excellent Suk/Katchen version, for example).  But it makes this a well filled as well as a well-played CD.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4BXV0IVOLO6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000K2UW#wasThisHelpful","R4BXV0IVOLO6W","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2 stars --  It isn't easy to keep a mystery/cop series going when you're trying to deepen your readers' understanding of the characters (as opposed to just constructing different plots  a la Lee Child and not worrying too much about the characters' lives going forward in time).  If Ace Atkins succeeds (so far), it's at least in part because of the voices -- Quinn Colson, the sheriff, himself, and his second-in-command Lillie Virgil, as outspoken and profane as they come.  There's a double-plot going here -- one of them is a cold case, from 36 years earlier, involving a rape and murder, and the other a story of Quinn's efforts to deal with the crooked County Commissioner Stagg, who wants Quinn either in his pocket or out of a job.  A recent tornado in the town of Jericho, Mississippi, has enabled Stagg to present himself as the savior of the town, as he manipulates contracts for rebuilding and infrastructure from his office in the Booby Tap strip club.  But Stagg has reason to fear: a man who was jailed twenty years earlier is close to release, and Stagg knows that this man, the biker leader Chains LeDoux, will be coming for him.  Going for double insurance, Stagg hires a bodyguard/enforcer type, the ex-military man Ringold, to watch his back, and he prods Colson to solve the long-ago cold case, which involved LeDoux and his biker gang and perhaps thus put LeDoux out of harm's way again.  In return, Stagg makes it clear that he has the power to get the DA to drop a trumped-up charge against Quinn and Lillie -- a charge that Stagg trumped up in order to give him leverage over Quinn.  And that's just the background . . . .Along with all this, we have Quinn worrying about his ex-addict sister Caddy and her son, his girlfriend Ophelia Bundren (the local embalmer), his mother Jean and his absent father (who were in Jericho as young lovers at the time of the rape-murder that Quinn is trying to solve), and Diane Tull, raped and left for dead 36 years earlier, but now back in town and running a farm supply store.  Nobody wants the past dug up, except Diane, Quinn and Lillie (for a good reason) and Stagg (for a self-serving one).The complicated past-present structure is well-handled, the center of consciousness for the past scenes being Diane and Quinn's dad.  Their points of view have short italicized chapters.  The ""present"" chapters (by far the greater part of the book) has us moving among Quinn's, Stagg's, Diane's, LeDoux's and Lillie's viewpoints.  The issues are Quinn's integrity and the question of whether anyone will be forthcoming with information that will help with the cold case.  It's all worked out quite well, though Stagg's getting involved in the cold case seems a bit implausible, and then at the end, in a climactic scene, we begin to see that things aren't quite what they seemed.  Individual readers will have to judge for themselves whether or not they think Atkins plays fair with them.  I was reminded a bit of reservations I had about the last of Peter May's ""Lewis"" trilogy -- the longer it went on, the more complicated the treatment of the past in relation to the present became.  This novel doesn't strain credibility quite to the same extent, but there are times when the plotting seems more clever than convincing.  Lots to like though -- Quinn and Lillie are a lively pair, and Jean and Ophelia aren't far behind.

"The movies here deserve separate review, which I will give them in due course, but I do want to give a general recommendation to this boxed collection from the late 1950's and very early 1960's in Britain.  These are four tales of suspense, with one of them -- ""The League of Gentlemen"" -- being comic, though far from saccharine, and the others touching on attitudes to race and homosexuality at a time when the latter was still criminalized and when the beginnings of recovery from World War 2 marked a return to prosperity that made Britain an attractive place for immigrants who were at that time mainly people of color from the Caribbean and South Asia.  Although not devoid of stereotyping, the movies make an effort to treat the attitudes and characters with an appropriate degree of complexity and understanding.  The narratives in all four movies are all very efficiently told, the prints are very good, and the only complaint that one might have is that the amount of documentation and special feature supplementary material (including subtitles) is lacking, compared to the usual Criterion issues.  However, you'll note that the price is extremely reasonable, and all in all, this is a fine bargain.  The gem of the collection, for me, is Dirk Bogarde's performance in ""The Victim"" -- a movie that took some courage to make and act in in 1960 and that, while it might seem a bit tame today, was thought dangerous enough in its time not to be approved for American release.  Close behind, and in a different tone altogether, is Jack Hawkins in ""The League of Gentlemen,"" the opening shot of which is almost worth the price of the box and which anticipated some similar moments in the early James Bond movies.  The movies deserve to be seen, then, both for their own sakes and for what they show of the culture of their times.  An excellent bargain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVCGMBHS7HPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047P5FTK#wasThisHelpful","R3TVCGMBHS7HPI","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somewhere inside this amiable bloated monster is a straightforward story that would fit neatly into a 50-minute TV episode.  It would look a bit like a brief ""Wrath of Khan,"" but it would be fine.  Unlike the original ""Khan,"" where Kirk and Kahn are the antagonists, here it's primarily Spock (Zachary Quinto) versus Nero (Eric Bana, tattooed), the crazed Romulan commander of a space ship that resembles a giant bug -- very far from the classic lines of a Federation starship.  Bana doesn't quite have the panache that Ricardo Montalban brought to Khan, but Quinto is a credible younger Spock.  Chris Pine, for his sins, is forced to play Kirk as a kind of frat-boy smart-ass, and it's difficult to believe that he would grow into the wry and witty Kirk of William Shatner -- but that how he's written, and so I don't blame Pine, who was good in ""Unstoppable.""  The cause of the bloat here is the attention paid to the young lives of Spock and Kirk, and their meeting and initial mutual dislike at Starfleet Academy.  I'm afraid that I couldn't get too interested in that -- it seemed to smack of a fairly predictable plot-formula in which two temperamentally different soldiers learn to respect and trust one another, and not all the paraphernalia about Starfleet rules and the Kobayashi Maru simulation could do much to spice it up.  I also found the young Kirk's apparent interest in young female cadets a bit tiresome -- the jock-frat boy stereotype again.I have to say too that the plot device used to get Leonard Nimoy into the picture seemed very forced to me -- was it dumb luck that he happened to be on that icy planet when Kirk crashed there?  And how convenient that Scottie (Simon Pegg) was there too, to help effect transportation back to the Enterprise.  And how come that almost immediately Scottie is put in charge of the dilithium energy system for the ship?  Is it just so that he can say lines that are familiar from earlier shows -- ""Im not sure she can take any more, Captain!"" -- which chimes nicely with ""Live long and prosper,"" which is also trotted out a couple of times.  No -- it's all a bit too forced for me.  I liked ""The Wrath of Khan,"" and I liked ""The Voyage Home,"" the one with the whales, best of all.  This 2009 revival is all pace and no wit.  There was the revelation that Uhura had the hots for Spock, though.  I did not know that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NO3FB7V4CSHU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WV5A9G#wasThisHelpful","R3NO3FB7V4CSHU","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It bothers me that I gave ""The Counselor"" only two stars and give three to ""A Walk among the Tombstones"" when it seems clear that the former is a much more thoughtful and multifaceted piece of work.  But I didn't like it, and this much more modest, predictable movie seems better of its rather ordinary kind than the hyper-intellectualised kind that ""The Counselor"" belongs to.  All that said, ""A Walk"" is not a great movie by any standards -- we have the familiar ex-cop-and-recovering-alcoholic-turned-PI, and the fact that Liam Neeson takes the part and lavishes his solid professionalism on it keeps us watching.  It seems that the wives and daughters of drug dealers are being singled out for kidnapping, mutilation, and murder, and Kenny Kristo, the husband of one of the victims (Dan Stevens, playing sullenly against type) hires Matt Scudder (Neeson) to find out the perpetrators, with an eye to taking his revenge on them.  The police are out of the question because Kenny is a drug trafficker (NOT a mere dealer, he wants Scudder to know).  Meanwhile Matt is attending AA meetings and coming to terms with the circumstances that caused him to leave the NYPD and also forming a relationship with TJ (the appealing Brian Bradley), a black homeless teenager who seems to hang out in libraries and has read a whole lot of crime fiction.  Suffice it to say here that he's instrumental in resolving the case and that his moment of triumph comes when Scudder introduces him to Kenny and others as ""my associate.""  The others include Kenny's brother Peter (Boyd Holbrook) who is fighting a gallant losing battle with his addiction, and Yuri Landau (Sebastian Roche), a drug-dealing acquaintance of Kenny's, whose young teenaged daughter is kidnapped late in the movie.  The stakes for the audience are now higher, because a child is in danger -- director and screenwriter Scott Frank is clearly pushing our buttons here.  The suspense throughout involves our awareness of the strategies and targets of the kidnappers, and their van always appears cued by ominous music.The tombstones of the title refer to a cemetery in which the body parts of one victim were scattered and which figure again late in the movie.  I'll avoid spoilers and just say that much, though not all of the procedural work that Scudder does is plausibly presented, though the part involving Jonas (Olafur Olafsson) I found not convincing -- and that's a weakness since it does point Scudder in the direction of the perps.  The tombstones might also be Scudder's now-dead past that he can't quite get away from.  The ending will strike viewers as meeting the requirements of rough justice, but the last narrative section seems clumsily handled to me.  On the plus side, we see Neeson here as credibly human and sympathetic and not the implausible superman of the exploitive ""Taken"" series.  Be thankful for that, and enjoy the moments of creepiness.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPGK9LTE5JIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NQE5V60#wasThisHelpful","RHPGK9LTE5JIC","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Credit where credit is due -- if you are going to act in a farce (I'm referring to the genre), then you must never, even at the silliest moments, seem to be tipping off your audience that you're aware that you're in a certain kind of play.  The humor depends on the actors seeming to be dead serious, even when, to the audience, the events on stage are at their silliest or most outrageous.  So the actors in ""The Counselor"" deserve a lot of credit.  They play it dead straight.  So, you might ask -- are you saying that this movie is, generically, a farce?  I am saying that, for if it isn't, it's a total mess.  But there's reason to think that Cormac McCarthy, who wrote the screenplay, and the director Ridley Scott knew exactly what they were doing.  Any screenplay for what looks like a ""thriller"" that alludes to the death of Socrates and Christopher Marlowe's ""The Jew of Malta"" (and probably some other things I've missed) obviously has something going on, and the nearest analogue I can find to the kind of drama this is is the hyper-sensationalized early 17th-Century morality plays that used to be referred to as ""Jacobean Tragedy"" and that were associated with names like Cyril Tourneur and John Webster.  Marlowe's ""Jew of Malta"" might be thought of as a kind of prototype of such drama, and elements of it can be found in Shakespeare's tragedies -- obviously in ""Titus Andronicus,"" and maybe less obviously in ""King Lear"" and ""Macbeth.""  The 17 Century critic Thomas Rhymer referred to ""Othello"" as ""a bloody farce,"" and that's not a bad description of ""The Counselor"" too, as long as we remember that heavy-handed moralism goes along with it.The mixture of power, greed, and sex, along with characters who think they can control events after having made some very sketchy decisions -- it's all there, just as it was in the Jacobean predecessors.  You might be tempted to think of it as a kind of ""film noir,"" because there is in this film also a sense of its characters becoming more and more entrapped, the atmosphere becoming more claustrophobic.  But in a ""noir,"" entrapment and claustrophobia are expressed through visual style.  Here the visual style is much more realist, and it's in the dialogue that the sense of entrapment and ever-more-limited choices comes across.  It does so because the characters talk all the time about choices and consequences.  Westray (Brad Pitt) advises the counselor (Michael Fassbender) not to get ""in"" to the drug deal that Reiner (Javier Bardem) is involved with.  Even Reiner is cautioning the counselor -- don't get in.  But the counselor (who, for reasons that aren't explicit, needs money) thinks he CAN get in, just this once, pick up his share of $20 million, and get out again.  It's not accidental that people lose their heads in this movie -- for when greed, power, and sex get to work, clear thinking goes out the window, so losing one's head seems an apt trope, all things considered.Once you're in, getting out is difficult, especially when, to bring off the deal, you have to run afoul of ""the cartel.""  Let's just say that the Borgias, as popularly imagined, have nothing on the cartel.  Of the characters who are willing to take their chances, only the coolest can have a chance at success.  In this case, that's Marika (Cameron Diaz), and it helps that she lacks a soul and is willing to do whatever it takes with her body.  At the end of the movie, she's still on the playing field, so to speak, though whether she will ultimately prevail is an open question.  Suffice it to say here that thieves have fallen out, and some of the mayhem in the movie derives from that fact and not just the cartel.  But what might strike you most about the movie -- and all the characters are unlikeable -- is the talk.  Everybody's a kind of pseudo-philosopher, and on and on they go about choices, consequences, freedom, guilt, weaknesses.  In case you don't get the point, think about the scene in which Cameron Diaz tries to get a priest to listen to her confession.  It's rare to find such hyper-articulateness yoked to a modern ""thriller"" plot, and it's one of the features that clues the audience to the kind of farce that this is.  I think that the movie is exactly what Scott and McCarthy had in mind, and clearly a bunch of very talented actors are all on board.  One could even say that it's very good of its kind -- but I don't much like the kind.  I haven't been tempted to re-read ""The White Devil"" or ""The Revenger's Tragedy,"" and I doubt that I'll be revisiting this -- although there is that scene of Cameron Diaz having sex with an expensive car . . .","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UV9C9Q36FTPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HF98SPS#wasThisHelpful","R1UV9C9Q36FTPZ","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"1980's Telarc sound was one of the wonders of the world, and here it is again, from 1984, in a performance that almost matches Janssons' great Chandos account.  Janssons is just a tad quicker, and there's a touch of rawness to the sound that is expressively apt, but Previn matches him in sound that is warmer and truer throughout a wide dynamic range and that has what I can only call a kind of three-dimensional quality to the aural picture.  Add to that the tonal distinctiveness of the sections of the orchestra that the recording manages to capture -- and the playing is beautiful throughout -- without diminishing the impression of a coherent orchestral sound.  It's quite miraculous, really.  And Previn is clearly totally engaged.  He builds the climaxes within the movements unerringly, with dynamic and phrasal variation beautifully judged, and he has enough in reserve to make sure that the climax of the final movement is the climax of the whole.  I would just add that the slow movement is as beautifully played and recorded here as I have ever heard it -- and all in all, it's just a very distinguished account of a great Romantic symphony.  The March from Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Tsar Saltan"" is a lively and delicate palate-cleanser to end the disc.

"This excellent recording of a live performance from 1983 has been re-issued in a pairing with the Double Concerto, and that issue is obviously better value for money. I picked this up used for $4.00, so I'm not complaining! It's gratifying to hear Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic in what seems to me much better form (AND more warmly recorded) than was the case with their disappointing (to me) Brahms First Symphony from around the same time. My only previous exposure to the Latvian violinist Gidon Kremer was in his set of the Beethoven sonatas with Argerich, that I thought were splendid. He's splendid again here. The first movement has an ideal blend of muscularity, playfulness, and grace, and unusually (and one good reason to own this recording) he uses a Reger Prelude, all four minutes worth, as the cadenza. He really digs into it, and it fits the spirit of his first-movement playing perfectly. (Oddly, the liner notes make no mention of this choice). The second movement, surely one of the loveliest there is, is done with great tenderness and chamber-like delicacy in places. It's ravishing, and the uncredited oboist who opens the movement plays very eloquently too. Kremer leaps into the last movement as if determined to establish the contrast with the previous one in the starkest terms. There's no messing around with refinement -- it's just invigorating gypsy fiddling, and Kremer and Bernstein have great fun in the coda. The orchestra sounds great -- the strings especially get their due, with warmth and presence, and there's no dawdling from Bernstein -- he's much faster than, say, Tennstedt in his fine recording with Kennedy. But you can't have too many Brahms Violin Concertos . . .","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2CEV6G77NKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E2LI#wasThisHelpful","RI2CEV6G77NKS","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great sound from the Philadelphia Orchestra here, with Sarah Chang, aged around 13 at the time, just a bit more forward in the aural picture -- and that's my main reservation.  It's just a bit too close-up.  That's no criticism of Ms Chang, who plays with great spirit and lovely tone, but I already had Accardo in the Paganini and Kyung-Wha Chung in the Saint-Saens items, and this isn't music that I feel the need to have multiple recordings of.  I can't get all that interested in the Paganini fireworks -- sorry! -- but I do like the Spanish-inflected Saint-Saens pieces, and if you don't have them, you would be very happy to have such a rich-sounding recording.  It's tempting to say, ""Nice going for a 13-year-old,"" but no condescension or apologies are needed.

"The Criterion issue on 2 discs -- DVD in my case -- is excellent, with a fine print of the movie on Disc One and some very interesting ""special features"" on the second disc.  If you can, you might try to see it in relation to John Ford's ""The Informer,"" also set in Ireland at a time (though a different one) of political trouble.  Reed's 1947 movie owes a good bit stylistically and thematically to Ford's 1935 one.  There are also debts to French and German movies of the 1930's that are addressed in the special features commentary.  The basic similarity is that in both movies, the protagonist, not long out of jail, takes action that causes a death, and one could argue that, different as the circumstances are, in both cases the protagonist causes the death to meet some basic needs of his own and not for any ideological or political reason.  The actions result in both men going on the run, so to speak, and trying to avoid capture, while at the same time being psychologically and maybe ethically disturbed by what they have done.  Stylistic similarities are the representation of the city, especially in nocturnal images, with lots of shadows, deep back-and-white contrast, and a sense of the city as a kind of warren or maze, almost a trap, from which the protagonist tries to escape.  Reed's film, to an even greater extent than Ford's, I think, makes the audience aware of its style -- every shot seems very deliberately framed, and engrossingly, I might add.  However, to the credit of Reed and his actors, the awareness of style doesn't get in the way of the reader's engagements with the characters and their plights.  Sometimes, it's desperation that draws us in; at others, it's an odd, almost absurd kind of humor.  The ostensible issue that the plot engages us in, again like ""The Informer,"" is a simple one -- can the protagonist get out of the city and away from his pursuers?  But the plot, like that of any good film noir, is just the excuse on which to hang issues of psychological breakup and existential threat.It's odd, however, that the political dimension of the story is played down.  Johnny McQueen (James Mason) is the head of what in the movie is referred to merely as ""The Organization,"" and nothing in the movie makes it certain that the organization isn't a criminal enterprise as opposed to a political one.  It has usually been taken to refer to the IRA, but there's nothing in the movie about Irish politics and history to warrant that identification.  I wondered if the ""depoliticizing"" of the story was a sop to the British censors -- but there's no way that the organization, whatever it is, is glorified or its violence endorsed.  In fact, Johnny, we learn right from the start, has begun while in prison to have doubts about violence -- it's ironic that he's strapping on his gun around the time that he reveals this to his girl, Kathleen (Kathleen Ryan).  But he doesn't come across as a tough guy -- he's reflective and even sentimental, and that's partly his undoing, and Kathleen's attraction to him has none of the dangerous allure of the bad boy for the tough girl.  Be all that as it may, the absence of politics throws all the interest on the existential aspects of the story and serves to suggest that Johnny's situation has a kind of universal human interest.  His conscience is focused on his having killed, with no attention given to the context of or possible reasons for the killing or the robbery that was the occasion of the killing.  The effect is to make Johnny's consciousness seem almost inhumanly ""pure"" -- or, if you're historically minded, implausibly limited.  For myself, that's where I have to suspend my disbelief where this movie is concerned.  Once you start thinking about the complex history that lies behind an event like the robbery in the context ( a divided Ireland, c. 1940), the film can lose its purchase on you and seem oversimple.  If you head down that road, all you're left with is style.  But partly as a response to style, I DON'T head down that road, and then my interest in what the style is there to express reawakens.The oddest feature of the movie is the part where Johnny finds himself in the studio of the artist Lukie (Robert Newton), who wants to paint him.  Lukie is such an extravagant character, and Newton (remember his Long John Silver?) is himself an extravagant actor, that he almost seems to belong to a different kind of movie.  Still, the idea of the artist as the medium required for penetrating the soul of man in extremis has thematic plausibility here, and it's in that scene that Mason delivers HIS most histrionic moment -- a surprise in a movie in which the protagonist, up to that point, hasn't had much to say at all.  And that's another odd feature of the film -- Johnny, once he is wounded, is remarkably passive.  It's not clear that he cares about being saved, though he doesn't want to be found by the police.  Rather, he just seems not to want to be a burden to anybody.  Is he paralyzed by guilt?  Is he weak through loss of blood?  Both, perhaps?  Kathleen wants to save him and is scouring Belfast looking for him, but it's not clear that he wants any more than Kathleen's presence -- and at the end of the day (literally -- the movie is about the events of a single day and ends at midnight), it's not clear that Kathleen wants any more than just to be in Johnny's presence.  The ineffectiveness of Father Tom (W. G. Fay) gives the ending a very different character from the ending of ""The Informer,"" where Gyppo (Victor McGlaglen) ends up in a church asking for forgiveness.  And yet Frankie's mother's absolution of Gyppo (""Sure, you didn't know what you were doin' "") perhaps applies to Johnny too.Anyway -- if you've read this far! -- good performances all round, not only from Mason but from a stable of good Irish actors including the young Cyril Cusack, Dan O' Herlihy, and W. G. Fay himself.  This was Fay's last movie, for he died in 1947, having been involved forty years earlier with Yeats, Synge, and Lady Gregory in the establishment of the Irish National Theater (later, the Abbey).  Take a look too at the proprietor of the bar.  I thought I recognized him from long ago.  I wondered, was it Peter Cushing?  But no.  He's William Hartnett, who went on to become the original Doctor Who.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXS00X66LLL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SC8KUJ8#wasThisHelpful","R2IXS00X66LLL3","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very partial to Mackerras's digital recording of Brahms's First Symphony, on Telarc, with excellent sound, but it is something of a special case -- it has been recorded with an orchestra with a much smaller complement of strings than the typical modern symphony orchestra, and Mackerras would have us believe that Brahms's preference, as a conductor, was for such reduced forces.  Is there a digital recording with a full orchestra that is sonically appealing and yet employs all the resources of the modern symphony orchestra?  I would say that this one -- recorded in the late 1980's by Haitink and the Boston Symphony -- gets the job done.  As sound, it is superior to Abbado's Berlin recordings from the early 1990's.  As a performance, it is superior to Bernstein's rather inflated performance of 1983 with the Vienna Philharmonic.  The sound has presence, clarity, and warmth, and Haitink's control of the outer movements especially seems exceptional to me.  The danger in the first is failing to avoid (for 16 minutes or so) a sense of sameness, as limited motivic material is worked over.  Haitink's sense of phrasal and dynamic variation, with no loss of forward motion, is exemplary.  In the fourth movement, the problem is to make coherent a great variety of motivic and harmonic material -- and again Haitink succeeds -- as do, I should add, Bohm, Karajan, and Klemperer on their respective analogue versions.  Middle movements are lovely too, with the trio of the third movement given an appealing lilt.  The filler is the choral work ""Nanie"" --nicely done too, but the symphony's the thing.Note: for a slower version that, to my ears, avoids Bernstein's dragginess AND has superior sound, there's Guilini and the LA Philharmonic.  I haven't heard the more recent Rattle (Berlin) and Zinman (Zurich) accounts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJOBHRNKWPFZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000041K0#wasThisHelpful","RJOBHRNKWPFZ0","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hearing this digital recording of a live performance from the early 1980's makes me want to hear Bernstein's 1960's account of this symphony with the NY Philharmonic.  His CBS (now Sony) recordings were generally fresh and full of life, but this one is a bit of a drag (even reviewers who like it admit that it's slow).  I think the outer movements suffer most.  There doesn't seem to be a consistent pulse or feeling of propulsion that carries through the whole, long movements, and they come across to my ears as sectionalized or ""bitty.""  There are moments when the music seems to come to a complete stop, and that undermines any sense of effective transition. Individual passages might be strikingly phrased or lovingly cherished, but overall the trees get in the way of the forest.  Brahms reportedly liked to walk -- I like to hear a spring in the step in his symphonies.  The sound has presence but is a bit bottom-heavy and not very refined.  In Abbado's recording, the studio sound isn't great, but the pacing and coherence are better.  Better still is Haitink's digital First from Boston -- here, the individual sections of the orchestra and the solo instruments come through with clarity and warmth, and Haitink's shaping of the long outer movements is much superior to Bernstein's, to my ears.  And if you like even more spring in the step, Haitink's Concertgebouw recording (analogue, early 1970's) really moves along, especially in the first movement.I like Bernstein a lot, but I find that in general I prefer his earlier recordings on CBS/Sony to the relatively few digital DGG ones I've heard.  I should just add that in this recording, the Vienna Philharmonic is with him all the way, so I'm not saying the playing is sub-par.  It's just the concept I don't like.  Also, The Vienna Philharmonic gets a better deal from the engineers with Bohm, in his rich and rhythmically alert performance of this symphony, now available in a bargain box and well worth the outlay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MNZ0YK3KHS70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001GDW#wasThisHelpful","R1MNZ0YK3KHS70","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1980's, Richard Goode made some fine Mozart concerto recordings with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, and it was on the strength of these that I picked up his recording of these three Beethoven sonatas (Nos. 16, 17, and 18), from the same period of Goode's recording career.  I already owned, and liked, Kovacevich's recording, and I had Brendel too, in a box set of the complete sonatas, also very fine.  These recordings are in that league.  The Nonesuch/Elektra sound is lovely, and the piano is perfectly placed in relation to the microphones.  In fact, I prefer the Nonesuch sound to the EMI sound for Kovacevich, and it's a bit more rounded than Brendel's fine analogue sound.  But it's the performances that matter, and they're full of life.  ""The Tempest,"" No. 17, is perhaps the best-known of these sonatas, and it gets a fine reading here, but I'm especially partial to No. 18, which is as charming a sonata as you could wish to hear, with a presto con fuoco finale that's a delight.  It also oddly has a scherzo AND a minuet, the latter serving as the slow movement, and very lovely it is.  The first movement, with its odd peremptory chords followed by sprightly figures, keeps the listener on his toes, so to speak.  Goode doesn't over-pedal, and the fortes are never banged out -- the music seems to unfold very naturally.  If you have other recordings that you like, I don't know that this is indispensable, but you wouldn't regret getting it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZX0WRJQ6K3S9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00122PV5E#wasThisHelpful","R2ZX0WRJQ6K3S9","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3 1/2 stars -- there's a lot to like about this debut novel that introduces an intriguing protagonist, Gregor Reinhardt, the man of the title.  He's a decorated WW1 veteran of the trenches, with a hard won Iron Cross to show for it, who went to work in the Berlin Police Force after the war.  With the rise of the Nazis, however, he witnessed with disgust the politicization of the Force and the kinds of compromises he had to make in order to continue work as a policeman.  Finally, after it all gets too much for him, to the point of his feeling suicidally self-hating, he joins the Abwehr, the intelligence arm of the German military, thinking that there, at least, he can be more in touch with the honorable soldier he once was.  However, Hitler has taken Germany into WW2, and Reinhardt finds that his military life now, basically doing interrogations, with colleagues who are often brutal and compromised themselves, is not satisfying, and the book opens with Reinhardt in Sarajevo, suicidally depressed again, wanting to serve his country but to do so honorably, in an environment where honor seems to mean nothing.Then he is tasked with a job that calls on his skills as a detective -- a double murder of a woman, a popular Croatian journalist, and a German officer under circumstances that, given the sexual history and reputation of the journalist, are suspicious and yet maddeningly unclear.  The woman has been stabbed to death, the officer shot.  The Abwehr has an obvious interest in finding the killer of the German officer, but the local police in Sarajevo are only interested in the woman's death and clearly want a quick arrest, trial, and execution, even if they get the wrong person.  Reinhardt is paired with a Croat policeman, Padelin, who is as much a hindrance as a help in the enquiries and whose brutal methods disgust Reinhardt.  Complicating matters is the fact that it becomes clear that there are elements of the German army -- military police and SS among them -- whose interest in the case is not the same as Reinhardt's and who make their contempt for Reinhardt quite clear.  Complicating things further is the fact that Yugoslavia has a civil war going on.  Croats, Serbs, Muslims, and communist ""Partisans"" are all at one another's throats, with the German army basically trying to work with what seems to be the dominant local faction, the Croat-dominated Ustasa, to keep sufficient order to enable them and their Italian allies to keep Yugoslavia under German control following the failure at Stalingrad, which had stopped German advances in the East.  Also lurking in the background are the problems of Jews and Gypsies in fraught circumstances where both the Germans and the Yugoslavians see them as dirt.Luke McCallin does a good job of enabling the reader to understand the pressures that this complicated situation puts on Reinhardt, as he finds out more about the victims of the murder and their connection to high-ranking elements in the German Army, and the procedural elements in the novel are deftly and clearly handled.  In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll spare you details.  Reinhardt's depressed, near-alcoholic character is also compelling -- a culturally and historically grounded variant on the ""burned-out"" cops like Rebus and Banks, but the more plausible because of the grounding; he's a man who wants to serve his country but doesn't know that he can honorably serve what his county has become.  McCallin also knows Sarajevo and the surrounding countryside, though he perhaps overdoes the street names (or at least might have supplied a frontispiece map).  But the atmosphere of a tense city at the mercy of rival groups AND an occupying force of supposed allies is well caught, and, of course, navigating the murky local politics is challenging for a foreign detective who often feels that he has no business being there.Why only 3 1/2 stars?  Mainly because the ending is awkwardly handled -- too talky and stretched far too long.  Reinhardt's own meditations on his situation are old stuff by this point, and the late introduction of an important character who then has to do a LOT of explaining on his own behalf gets in the way of the pace and excitement of the best of the the earlier parts of the novel.  For all that, it's a book worth reading -- a first novel, so therefore the clumsiness at the end, which includes some implausible moments, might be understandable.  I'll be willing to give the sequel a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JVCHYAYQHOHS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425263053#wasThisHelpful","R1JVCHYAYQHOHS","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you saw ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (TBME), the previous movie that Tommy Lee Jones directed and starred in, then the odd and arresting quality of this movie -- an even better one, I think -- won't altogether surprise you.  It's absorbing to watch, for all its leisurely pace, and it stays in the mind and prompts reflection afterward.  As with TBME, it's about madness and absurdity, but in ""The Homesman,"" that absurdity is tied to a specific time and place and enterprise that, one feels, has not been done justice to in American film before.  In the mid-19th Century, in Nebraska Territory, the whole enterprise of establishing civilization, initially in the form of viable economic activity, is seen as involving costs to the sanity of the women who were made part of it.  There's a stereotype, of course, of the plucky and resourceful frontier woman, but this film is having none of it.  The resourceful woman here -- and a number of less resourceful ones -- pay a terrible price for trying to make it on the plains of Nebraska.  The place is so inhospitable that anything ""normal"" that survives seems to do so as much by luck as anything else.  Families are necessary to secure work, succession, and division of labor even before one thinks of the refinements of civilized life -- and yet the establishment of stable families is seen as a hit-or-miss affair.  Women have children, and they die; their husbands are more concerned with heritage than affection, so sex is more perfunctory than romantic; marriages are economic arrangements first and foremost, and sometimes marriages just can't be arranged . . . .The story, as all readers will know by now, is how Mary Bea Cuddy (Hilary Swank) undertakes to take three women who have been driven insane by their circumstances back to Iowa, from where they can be perhaps reunited with their kinfolk.  A lot of the early part of the movie shows us these women and their circumstances, and it's not a pretty sight.  Mary Bea's sympathy for them and tenderness with them are palpable, and poignant too, for she's a single woman trying to work her own claim and hoping to ally herself in marriage with a man who will help her.  Her ""courtship"" scene is both funny and painful, but it goes nowhere, and her disappointment, it would seem, is partly what drives her to undertake the quixotic task of relocating the mad women.  Her feeling for them -- and she is, as they say, a God-fearing woman -- makes one wonder about her own psychological condition, and that's something that we continue to wonder about throughout the movie.  I'll say nothing about the events that prompt reflection about this in the interest of avoiding spoilers.  However, Mary Bea's journey isn't the only quixotic enterprise in the movie.  The speculative hotel building of Aloysius Duffy (James Spader) that is encountered on the journey back east is a visible symbol of the absurdity of attempts to ""normalize"" the frontier, and that encounter produces some of the most memorable action and images in the movie.Mary Bea saves the life of a man who has been left to hang for claim-jumping in an oddly comic scene -- he's George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones) -- who seems to have no clear idea or direction about his life, but agrees to help Mary Bea on the journey because she has saved his life and, perhaps more important to George, offers him $300.00.  There's an obvious ""odd-couple"" appeal to the idea of the Christian woman and the pragmatic and unprincipled rascal, and their journey is a mixture of the painful, the tender, and the humorous.  The mad women don't regain their sanity en route, but they become quiet and reasonably co-operative.  One does wander off and fall in with a wandering and dubious cowboy (Tim Blake Nelson, in a very brief cameo), and there is an encounter with Pawnees, in which George proves his worth -- but there are disturbing things too.  Food runs short, a desecrated grave that the party comes upon causes a major upheaval.  The sense of the environment as unfriendly and hostile and empty is made manifest, thanks to the leisurely pacing of the story.  The psychological effects of the journey on both Mary Bea and George become increasingly interesting to us, and again, we wonder about costs . . .I don't think it's giving too much away to say that the movie has two climaxes -- one for each of the main characters.  There's horror and humor and pathos all mixed in here.  We know, of course, that ""the west was won,""  but this movie shows us aspects of that process (if that's the word) that we haven't seen on the screen before.  It's this breadth of interest -- what does it take? what does it mean? to ""win"" a life from this land -- that distinguishes the movie from something like ""True Grit"" or even TBME, which are also demythologizing but have a narrower focus.  I should add that Tommy Lee Jones here gives as fine and nuanced a performance as I've ever seen from him, and Hilary Swank is deeply affecting as a woman of real resource who might have over-estimated her capacities.  This is a very fine movie.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHXV2OH2J5OY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PPGZMFM#wasThisHelpful","R1LHXV2OH2J5OY","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked up this recording -- an original first run issue from the mid-1980's -- on sale, used, and I have to report that my reaction is very much like Santa Fe Listener's original reaction: it seems to me (with one reservation) very good.  To my ears, the sound is very good, maybe not quite in the mid-'80's Telarc class, but close.  There's an airiness and transparency to it that is especially welcome in the ""Wunderhorn""-like passages in the first three movements.  The Philharmonia, Sinopoli's orchestra at the time, plays beautifully, and the texture of the lighter passages and the timbre of individual instruments is ravishingly caught.  Nothing could be further from the rather harsh and dubiously balanced sound that I hear, for example, in Abbado's Brahms, also, strangely, a DG production.  Sinopoli's tenderness in the folk-like Wunderhorn material is winning, and that makes the brutal massed brass eruptions all the more threatening and powerful.  The scherzo material isn't at all light-hearted, and that's in keeping with the dramatic narrative that the symphony enacts over its 80+ minutes -- a narrative of innocence and beauty threatened and seemingly defeated, until the ""resurrection"" music asserts itself in the last 20 minutes or so.  And that's where my reservation is: the opening choral section is beautifully sung (after Fassbaender's powerful ""Urlicht"" section), but for the later, louder choral music, the engineers seem to have taken a step back, as it were, and there's some loss of immediacy.  Apart from that -- and it's not the fault of the musicians -- this is a beautiful and affecting reading.Fassbaender and Bernd Weikl provide some extras -- the Wayfarer songs and some early songs.  Nobody will buy a 2-disc set for these alone, but be assured that they are very well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27G7ZKGT3C898/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E33J#wasThisHelpful","R27G7ZKGT3C898","A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3BJOYY5ZWF5VM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this first installment of PUNISHING MISS PRIMROSE.  I thoroughly enjoyed it; although I would to say that I would have been much, much happier had it been a complete story.  That's not a complain, merely an observation.  In any event, I found the book to be very well written, with a storyline that is fairly unique...at least in my experience.  The story that unfolds is tantalizingly erotic.  Spencer finds himself unwillingly drawn to Beatrice, despite the fact that he believes her to be a villainous female who used and abused his younger brother.  It will be interesting to see how the story unfolds and how these two mule-headed people finally achieve their HEA.

"I wish I could give this piece of crap zero stars. I bought it a few months ago from BJ's Wholesale; it's one of the worst purchases I've ever made! This thing overloads whenever I use it...EVERY. SINGLE. TIME!!!! When I say it overloads, I'm not talking about when I try to shred several pages simultaneously. I mean even when shredding ONE SHEET of letter size paper the blasted thing will become stuck...the overload indicator lights up...and I have to continuously depress the forward button to get the sheet to go through. The first time I used the machine I had a bunch of paper to shred because it had been a while since my previous shredder died. Consequently, I attributed overheating and overloading problems to the volume of documents I was shredding. However, when I next used the machine I experienced the exact same problem, and it's not like I have any heavy duty shredding to do. I shred any mail with my family's name/address on it, any documents with personal information, and the like, stuff that you find in a regular household. I am not a business. Unfortunately by the time I used the machine the second time, and figured out that it really was a piece of s***, it was too late to return it. As much as I hate to do it, and as opposed as I am to wasting money, I fully intend to toss this crap out with the trash. It is just way too aggravating to use!!!! So make a note, if you're looking for a shredder DO NOT BUY THIS ONE!!!! I really wish that I had checked reviews before I forked out my $50.

"This story encompasses a really, really sweet romance.  If you're in the mood for a quick, sweet story with a hero that is totally dedicated to the heroine, then this book just might fit the bill--it did for me!  While it's true that everything in this story seemed to move at a really quick pace--it's only about 70 pages after all--yet still, the author was able to sell me on the couple's instant connection with one another and when the H told the h that he loved her, I totally believed it!  Nate and Tessa meet when she waits on him at the restaurant where she works part-time.  They have an instant connection, but Tessa is a bit hesitant because of her recent breakup with a long-term boyfriend that left her broken hearted.  Nate, on the other hand, is all about Tessa almost from the very beginning.  Despite her reservations Tessa decides to enjoy the moment and not overthink the situation.The story depicts the couple's first two dates then it jumps ahead to a few weeks later; by this time their feelings have grown, but Tessa is still not quite believing that Nate can really be serious about her; although she doesn't spend time thinking about it.  The couple do suffer a setback and end up separated for a short period of time, but I really liked that fact because, IMO, it solidified the couple's relationship.  Tessa resolves her feelings for her ex, so it took away any feeling like she might have been rebounding with Nate.  Consequently, when the couple finally do get their HEA I was totally on board--I found it completely believable.  Yes, it went back very quickly; I wish we could have had more time with them once they reconciled, but that's often the case with books that are this short.  You can only get so much story into 70 pages.  In any event, I really enjoyed Ms. Goldman's writing style and I will definitely be reading more of her books in the future.  As a matter of fact, I have her Vacation With a Star (Contemporary Romance) ready to go next!  FYI, this isn't a clean romance; there is sex, but IMO it's not graphic and it's easily skipped.

Two months later, Matt is back in his hometown for his sister's wedding, while awaiting a hearing to determine his future with HOT.  Matt is from a wealthy, privileged family; his family owns an oil company, and his father is a state senator...hence the team name ""Richie Rich.""

Evie and Matt were childhood friends, ever since they met when Evie was six and Matt seven.  Over the years the two hung out, until they hit their teen years when things started to change between them.  Eventually the two drifted apart, but right before he left for West Point, Evie asked Matt to be her first, and he took her virginity.  When Matt bragged about sleeping with Evie then departed for college, he left Evie's reputation in tatters, which made her senior year in High School pretty horrendous.  I have to say that the more I heard about Matt as a teenager, the less I liked him...as a teenager that is.  As a man I love him!  Anyway, I wish Evie had called him to account for his bad behavior when they were teenagers.  When she first lays eyes on Matt, for the first time in ten years, she thinks to herself that he had been ""a self-centered, arrogant jerk with a giant sense of entitlement...""  Yet when she does come face to face with him and he tries to apologize, she downplays his selfish behavior, even taking part of the blame onto herself!  She tells him it was partially her fault because she shouldn't have asked him to be her first!  I didn't like that.  I wanted her to tell him he'd been a a$$hole.  That's what she really thought, so that's what she should have told him.  In any event, that was all in the past, and wasn't significant to the story.The first time Evie and Matt come face to face, things are a bit awkward between them.  Evie tries to keep Matt at a distance, but he's drawn to her and can't stay away.  That first night, the two find themselves at the same party by the lake, which is where the action gets started.  The book is chock full of excitement, what with shootings, a house bombing, high speed chases, a kidnapping, and organized crime.  Wow!  All the events take place over an intense 48 hour period, so as you might expect, the story moves at a really fast pace.  Developing side by side with the organized crime aspect of the story is the relationship between Evie and Matt.  Matt is determined to walk away from Evie after he helps her get her sister back and makes sure Evie is safe; he doesn't believe that his job is conducive to having a long-term relationship.  There is also the fact that Matt's future is uncertain, as he has no idea what will happen when he attends the hearing regarding his career...there is the possibility that a court martial will be recommended, which could mean time spent in Leavenworth.  And even if he is reinstated, Matt doesn't think it would be fair to ask Evie to live with all the uncertainty associated with his job every time he went out on a mission; not knowing where he was going, how long he'd be gone, and when or IF he'd be coming back.My favorite part of the story is the end, where Matt finally claims Evie as his.  I thought it was so romantic.  I loved the fact that Matt came to the realization that no matter what, Evie was number one in his life.  He realized it; he accepted it; he made it abundantly clear to Evie.  Sigh!  I read a few reviews where readers were annoyed by Evie's constant refusal to follow Matt's directions.  Usually I too am annoyed by the idiotic female who is going to ""save"" the hero, even though she has no special training, not even in self-defense.  However, in this book, for some reason, Evie's actions didn't bother me.  Oh there was a time or two when I told her she really needed to stay put, but I could see her point.  It was HER sister that was in trouble, and Matt was putting his life on the line to help her.  I could understand why sometimes she'd go off half-cocked to make sure he was okay.  When you're sitting around waiting, without any clue as to what is happening, five minutes can oftentimes seem like 50 or more.  So even though there were times when I thought she was crazy, and maybe even a little annoying, I found her behavior realistic.As much as I loved the story, though, there were a few times when I thought it tended to be a overly dramatic...one such example is the scene by the lake where the shooting takes place.  Matt and Evie both thought it was just some crazy redneck that was probably drunk and shooting off his gun, yet Matt went into full blown covert operative mode.  I had to laugh when he was smearing dirt over his face and arms--because he had no grease--and he was thinking that he should have rubbed dirt on Evie too.  That was a mite crazy.  I also couldn't understand why the house was blown up.  That never made any sense to me...I figured it was just to add more drama to the story.  It also got a little tiresome listening to Matt's inner dialogue about all the crazy things that were second nature to him because of his training as a Special Forces soldier.  After a while I was like, ""enough already!  I get it!  He's a well-trained military machine!""  SheeshNonetheless, aside from a few moments that seemed over the top--at least to me they did--and getting a little tired of hearing about how well trained Matt was, I really liked this book.  I loved it, actually.  The series is so darn HOT that it's got me hooked!  Speaking of hot, the love scenes are hot and graphic; furthermore there is some crude language in the story, for instance the f bomb is used quite a bit.  Anyhow, that's my take on the story, it wasn't perfect, but I loved it, and I definitely recommend it as a worthwhile read.  FYI, there are eight members on the HOT team, each of whom gets their own story.  There are seven books in the series right now, and the eight book is due out some time this year.  Hoo-ah!HOT MESSThis is the second book in the Hostile Operations Team series.  In book one, team leader, Captain Girard, got his lady love.  In that book, we are introduced to HOT in the prologue, while they were out on an op, during which two members were killed.  By the end of that book those two positions remained to be filled.  The hero in this book, Sam ""Knight Rider"" McKnight is one of the replacements.  In this book, Sam has been newly recruited to the HOT team, and the events in his story take place several weeks after the events in book one.Sam and Georgie are childhood friends; her big brother is Sam's best friend.  Georgie is from a wealthy, privileged background and Sam is from the wrong side of the tracks.  Georgie has pretty much been ""in crush"" with Sam ever since she was thirteen years old, but as far as Sam is concerned, she is strictly off limits.  When Rick, Georgie's brother, asks Sam to check on his sister, Sam and Georgie meet again for the first time in six years.  The last time they saw each other was at Georgie's wedding.  Georgie lives in Maryland, where she teaches college courses to Army personnel.  One of her top students has missed several classes, and the Army won't give her any information.  When Sam goes to see Georgie, she asks him if he could find out what happened to her student.  Subsequently, Georgie's life is threatened, and Sam discovers that Georgie's student has been murdered and that he was involved in illegal activities.  These illegal activities are linked to the threat against Georgie, and the HOT team is mobilized to neutralize that threat.  In order to safeguard Georgie, Sam takes Georgie to a safehouse.While the two are sequestered together, sparks begin to fly between them, and old feelings are brought forth.  Sam is determined to keep Georgie at arm's length, but he's fighting a losing battle, and Georgie certainly isn't making it easy for him.  LOL  I LOVED Georgie.  She may be from the elite, country club set, but that woman is REAL!  Sam sees her as some kind of princess; he thinks she deserves the best; diamonds, silk sheets, and fancy clothes, all things that he cannot give her.  In reality Georgie is no such thing.  She's as down to earth as they come, and she has her own issues.  Georgie went through a divorce almost a year ago, after her husband cheated on her for several months, before finally leaving her for the other woman.  Her self-esteem took quite a beating, and since then Georgie hasn't felt really attractive.  She wants Sam, has always wanted him, and she doesn't hold back in letting him know that.  I admit that when I read the reviews that said that Georgie went after Sam, I was concerned, as I don't like heroines who are willing to throw away their pride all in the name of love.  I usually don't respect them.  However, that is absolutely not the case with Georgie.  Georgie is strong.  She tells Sam she wants him, and she thinks he's an idiot for thinking he's not good enough for her.  But she doesn't beg, and she absolutely doesn't demean herself in order to get him.  What I love is the way she talks--what a mouth!  She's certainly doesn't talk like a princess.  LOLSome reviewers complained that Sam's hot and cold attitude towards Georgie was annoying, but I found it completely realistic.  Sam was fighting a battle on two levels; on the one hand, his job is not conducive to a committed relationship.  He can be deployed at a moments notice, heading to parts unknown, for an indeterminate period of time, with no guarantee that he will return.  He didn't think it was fair to ask Georgie to have to live with that constant uncertainty.  Furthermore, his assignment to HOT was brand new, having a new relationship so quickly after being assigned to such a high level, stressful job, I think, would make anyone think twice.  Then there was the more personal reason; Sam didn't think he was good enough for Georgie.  He had demons stemming not only from the fact that he didn't come from Georgie's world, but also from the mental abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents.  Under those circumstances, it was no wonder Sam blew hot and cold.  His heart was at constant war with his mind, and when you add in the intense sexual attraction that existed between the two, let's just say he doesn't stand a chance.In some ways, this story is similar to that of the first book; the hero and heroine have been friends since childhood, with the heroine having a crush on the H since she was a teenager; Georgie asked Sam to be her first lover just like Evie in book one had asked Matt, although in this case that situation turned out completely different.  Then there is the fact that Sam, like Matt, doesn't think he can have a committed relationship with his job, and tries to push Georgie away.  However, for the most part, this is a very different story.  Book one was action-packed with high speed chases, a kidnapping, shootings, a house bombing, and more.  This story doesn't have any of the excitement that book one did.  Once Georgie and Sam are secluded in the safehouse, the story focuses on the couple and their relationship.  The threat to Georgie gets neutralized without any fanfare whatsoever; on that level the story was a bit of a letdown.  Nevertheless, for me, overall it was a very satisfying read.  Besides when it comes to the sex scenes, the ones in this book are way hotter than those in book one!  They are scorching hot, and graphic!  No clean romance here, ladies.  LOL  FYI, this is also the crude language in the story.  Now I'm off to finish book three.  Hoo-ah!HOT PACKAGEThis is the third book in the Hostile Operations Team series.  The series is so fantastic that as soon as I finished one, I started another.  As a matter of fact, I read all three books over two days, and was up until 1:30 a.m. this morning finishing this one!  All the HOT books are interconnected, but each can be read a standalone.  In this book, computer whiz, Billy ""The Kid"" Blake gets his HEA.  The events of this story take place just a few months after those in book one.In this story, LRH mixes things up a little; unlike the heroes in books one and two, both of whom were convinced that there wasn't any room in their lives for a woman AND their job, Billy is open to the notion of a committed relationship.  As a matter of fact, Billy and his lady love, Livvie, dated for a period of six months, before she upped and walked out of his life, after giving him an ultimatum...either his job at HOT, or her.  Now several months later, Livvie is in a bind, and shows up on Billy's doorstep asking for his help.  Livvie is a public relations expert for a weapons company that is in the middle of a bid for a big government contract.  When she uncovers a dangerous conspiracy; she goes to Billy for help, who in turn enlists the aid of his fellow HOT teammates.When Livvie and Billy first lay eyes on one another, for the first time in months, the sexual tension between the two is palpable.  After Livvie left him, Billy struggled to move on with his life without the woman who had come to mean so much to him.  As for Livvie, she is convinced that she made the right decision for her peace of mind, and her heart, when she preemptively left Billy, even though it was the hardest thing she had ever done.  The book is super short--at around 90 pages, it is the shortest one in the series to date--so the story books at a super quick pace.  Nevertheless, Ms. Harris packs a lot of story in a few pages, and the end result is a very satisfying read.  I loved the fact that H and h had a history together--a fact which has been true for all the HOT stories that I've read so far.  Both Billy and Livvie have issues stemming from their childhood--Billy with abandonment; Livvie with trust.  This story is a nice balance of romance and suspense.  Billy and Livvie have to team up to find the necessary evidence to expose her company's nefarious plot; while working together old feelings are rekindled, and eventually the two achieve their HEA.  When the couple finally confessed their love to one another, I found it totally believable, even though it happened very quickly.  It was pretty obvious that despite their time apart, Billy and Livvie had never stopped loving one another.Overall this was a very satisfying read. The sex scenes are hot and graphic, and, as with the previous two books, crude language is used in the story.  These books are certainly not what one would all clean!  LOL  Anyhow, I can't wait to read book four, but if I don't force myself to take a break from this series, I seriously will not be spending any time with my family over the next few days--not to mention, I won't get anything else done...excepting reading.  So, I'm done with book three, and I don't plan on hitting book four, for at least 24 hours!  But I WILL be reading it and SOON!!

"This is a great puzzle.  Over the years I've purchased a few of them as birthday gifts for various children.  As it typical of most Melissa & Doug products that I've encountered, the puzzle is of superior quality...I love the fact that it's constructed of wood.  The puzzle pieces and board are extremely well made and are very durable.  We've owned ours for over four years now and it is still in excellent condition!  Each puzzle piece is about 3/16 of an inch thick.  The names of the States are printed on the puzzle pieces, while the names of the capitals of each State is printed on the puzzle board.  That way children not only learn the names of the states, and their location within the US, but also the capital of each State.  The puzzle consists of 45 pieces--the smaller New England states, share a puzzle piece.  For example, MA, RI, and CT all share one puzzle piece.  The same is true of a few other north eastern states that are not within NE region.  In any event, this is a wonderful puzzle.  It's educational and fun, providing children with endless hours of entertainment, while increasing their knowledge about their country.  My daughter, who is eight, has one of these puzzles and she loves it.  I bought it back in 2011 when she was only 4.  My husband and I have completed the puzzle with her many times over the years, and now that she's older she's taken it upon herself to do it with her five year old brother.  It's really cute to watch them seriously concentrating while completing the puzzle. :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26FSYCUW7ZEPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000RMZSYE#wasThisHelpful","R26FSYCUW7ZEPI","A310KT1UQC5UNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A310KT1UQC5UNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started using Proactiv several years ago. I loved the way it cleared up my acne and made my skin feel, but didn't love the high price tag that came with it. Upon the recommendation of a friend, I decided to try this Acnefree Clearing System. Alas, after only a couple of weeks usage, my skin started breaking out again. I decided to give it a little more time, but after using it for a full month, I was getting acne breakouts consistently. That's when I decided to return to Proactiv. It's unfortunate because this system is so much cheaper than Proactiv, but it just does not work for me. Maybe it has something to do with one's skin, because I see where a number of people have had success with this product, while others, like myself, did not.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U65OXDWO962X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00070QF20#wasThisHelpful","R3U65OXDWO962X","A310KT1UQC5UNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A310KT1UQC5UNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I truly enjoyed this book.  At the heart of the story is a super sweet romance between two people who really love each other.  It's the fourth book in the Charity House series, but after a little investigation I came to the realization that book five of the series, Charity House Courtship, should really be book one.  That's because the events of that story take place prior to the events in this one, and also precedes the events in books one, two, and three.  We do meet the couple from book five in this story, and they are already married and have been for some ten years.  In any event, LAWMAN CLAIMS HIS BRIDE is a good book.  The hero, Logan, is totally and completely devoted to his beloved Megan, and has been for over five years.  Logan fell in love with Megan at first sight, but was convinced by others that Megan was too young for marriage and that he needed to wait.  In the meantime, Logan went off to pursue a career in law enforcement so that he would have the means to provide a good life for Megan when they finally did get married. Now five years later, Logan returns only to discover that Megan has been arrested for the murder of a man who attacked her.  Very quickly Logan dispenses with the ridiculous idea that Megan could be a killer, but there is the concern that Megan could possibly identify the real killer and thus the scepter of danger hangs over her head until that individual is apprehended.  In order to protect her, Logan takes Megan to his family's' ranch.  Most of the story is devoted to the couple's adjustment to one another after a five year separation.  Megan is no longer a girl, but a woman fully grown, and one who is not only independent, but also determined to stand on her own two feet.  Logan has his work cut out learning to deal with this ""new"" Megan.  LOLThere is a hint of intrigue as Logan tries to uncover the identity of the real killer, and by the time his identity is revealed I had already figured it out...there are a lot of clues provided throughout the story.  FYI, as you might expect with an inspirational romance, this is a clean story; no sex.  Despite the fact that there are no explicit scenes in the book, there is some focus on the intense physical attraction between the couple--especially Logan's attraction to Megan.  I do like the fact that the author brought up the issue physical attraction between the couple, because so often Christian romance novels try to pretend as though there isn't physical love between a husband and wife.  Furthermore, even though the issue is raised in this story, it is by no means crude!  All in all this was a very nice story and one that I happily recommend.  Happy reading!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17N5AODSPV1SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GKBIPK0#wasThisHelpful","R17N5AODSPV1SS","A310KT1UQC5UNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A310KT1UQC5UNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My five year old son is a HUGE train fanatic.  He has an extensive wooden railway collection with trains, track, bridges, and overpasses, of all different brands, including Thomas the Train, Chuggington, Circo (the Target brand) and Brio.  This Maxim Enterprise Over and Under Tunnel works perfectly with all of those brands.  Furthermore, the circumference of the tunnel is wide enough to accommodate even the Chuggington wooden trains--which are quite a bit bigger than the other brands of wooden trains.  The only train that we've had a problem getting to pass through the tunnel is Thomas Wooden Railway -  Rocky because of his long crane.  Nevertheless, with some maneuvering my son was able to push Rocky through and, to be fair, Rocky has trouble passing under the Thomas the Train bridges!You should be aware that this over/under tunnel does have a pretty big footprint.  When assembled, the overpass is approximately 20 inches wide; it consists of 2 ascending/descending pieces, which are each about 9 inches long, and a small male/female connecting piece that is about 2 inches long.  The tunnel itself is 8 1/2 inches long.  If your little one is going to add this tunnel to his/her masterpiece, make sure they have room enough to build a fairly large track!  LOL  The small male/female connecting piece sits in a groove on top of the tunnel and has two tiny appendages that extend down from underneath and holds the piece in place, thus preventing it from sliding backwards and forwards [see picture #2].  This keeps the overpass securely in place.  It's not perfect, because it does rattle around a tad, but it's never moved out of place while my son is playing with it.The tunnel is very durable.  We've had ours for over four months now and it is still in excellent condition.  My son, unfortunately, is not gentle with his toys, and his tracks usually get tossed around quite a bit.  So far, the over/under tunnel doesn't even have a scratch on it--although my son has used a maker to ""decorate"" it.  Sigh!This over/under tunnel has been a great addition to my son's wooden railway collection.  He loves with it and plays with it all the time.  When I asked him if he would recommend this to another child he said ""yes!  It's super fun!.""  LOL  So, there you have it, out of the mouths of babes.

"While the plot for this book is really very good, the story itself lacked substance.  At least, that is my opinion.  Significant aspects of the story were brushed over or skipped completely and when the book ended I was left feeling like I’d missed out on something great.  Jessie and Sarah are both likeable characters, but I didn't get a chance to know them at all.  Character development is pretty much nonexistent.When the book begins Jessie and Sarah have been corresponding with each other and have already fallen in love.  The story starts with Jessie’s last letter to Sarah asking her to marry him.  The letter is sweet and clearly indicates the deep feelings Jessie has for Sarah and his excitement at the prospect of marrying her.  Sarah is in a bad situation at home.  Her mother died when she was very young; her father is a lazy, ne’er do well, leaving Sarah with the responsibility of caring for her two younger brothers.  Sarah’s father would rather con, scheme, and steal his way through life than earn an honest living.  As soon as Sarah receives Jessie’s marriage proposal, she plots her escape from her father's clutches.  She has to sneak off in order to realize her dream of becoming Mrs. Jessie Kincaid.  Up to the point where the Jessie and Sarah first meet face to face and get married the story is very good.  However, once they do marry and Jessie takes Sarah home to his family’s ranch, it begins to fall apart.The problem is that once Jessie and Sarah arrive at his home the day after their wedding, the story skips over a significant aspect of the plot and takes the reader to one month in the future.  I was astonished when I realized that I was not going to be allowed to read about any of the Jessie and Sarah’s first days together as a married couple.  I didn’t get to see how the love that had developed between them through their written correspondence blossomed during their marriage.  Furthermore, when the story does skip ahead to a month down the road, Sarah’s father attempts a despicable act, gets his just desserts, and then the story ends.  Once again you don’t get to see Jessie and Sarah together as a couple.  I also felt a bit let down because there was so much buildup to what to expect when Jessie’s mother found out about his marriage, but I never got to read about her reaction to the news.  The end result is a story that is somewhat entertaining, but also disappointing.  FYI this is a clean romance.

"This is a great bag!  It's beautiful and functional!  I own the Cricut Create CRV 20001.  It's fits very easily inside this bag, with room to spare.  The bag is exceptionally well made and is extremely durable.  I purchased mine back in 2011, and it's still in like new condition.  The exterior design on the front is stitched in a light olive green color that matches the base of the bag, and is very beautiful.  It's a picture of a bee in a garden.  The handles are sturdy, padded, and comfortable to use.  The shoulder strap is a nice length that is adjustable.  There is a padded piece that rests on the shoulder when using the shoulder strap, which makes it very comfortable to carry the bag using the straps.  Inside, the bag has six pockets.  On one side there are three small zippered pockets towards the top of the bag, with one large open pocket at the bottom.  On the other side there are two zippered pockets towards the top of the bag.  Please see pictures #3 and #4 that I have attached.  On the exterior backside of the bag there is a zippered section; the zipper can be unzipped 180 degrees.  Pictures #1, #2, and #3 depict this section of the bag so you can see exactly what it looks like.

"I really enjoyed this book.  It's very obvious that Ms. Cabot is a very talented author; I truly enjoyed her writing style and she has a marvelous flair for storytelling.  As wonderful as the story was; however, IMO it was a little too slow.  Abigail and Ethan meet on the last lap of Abigail's journey from Vermont to Wyoming to visit her older sister Charlotte.  Charlotte is married to an Army officer, and it turns out that Ethan is a friend and fellow officer of Abigail's brother in law.  Because of the close friendship between the two men, Ethan spends a lot of time at the home where Abigail is visiting, and the two get to spend a significant amount of time together.  A friendship quickly develops between the couple and, over the course of several months, gradually blossom into love; this is certainly no rush to love romance, which was nice.Nonetheless, at times it seemed to drag.  Ms. Cabot keeps the romance very true to the times; an era when the mere touching of a woman's hand could signify that a man had very deep feelings for her; kisses between non-engaged/married couples were frowned upon; and it was considered gauche for a young lady to share her feelings with a gentleman before he declared himself.  Ethan and Abigail's romance is therefore hampered by the strictures of their society, as well as by the fact that Abigail is all but promised to a fellow teacher back in Vermont.  This remains the case for most of the story.  So, even when Ethan finally realizes that he has fallen in love with Abigail, he refrains from declaring himself because he believes she is destined for another, and of course SHE cannot declare herself first because that would be most improper!  The end result is that while there is a lot of internal dialogue from the couple's constant thoughts about one another and his/her feelings for the other, there aren't really any overt displays of affection.Despite the slow romance, I thought the story was quite enjoyable.  There are a couple of sub-plots involving a series of unsolved stagecoach robberies, the theft of military arms, and the continuing problem of desertion by the soldiers, all of which add a little bit of intrigue to the plot.  Needless to say, this is a squeaky clean romance.  Other than a kiss or two on the cheek there is no physical intimacy between the couple, until a shared kiss at the end.  Furthermore, there is a Christian aspect that is pervasive throughout the story without being preachy.  Overall this was a very entertaining book and one that I highly recommend.

"I purchased this puzzle for my son a few years ago when he was only a few months old; the recommended age is 6 months - 1 year.  We love the Melissa & Doug products.  IMO they product extremely well made, durable, reliable products.  This puzzle was no exception.  The extra-large knobs are perfect to little hands, making it easy to remove each brightly colored piece.  Under each puzzle piece are matching full-color pictures. This super-sized; solid-wood puzzle with extra-chunky  thick pieces is the perfect first puzzle.  The puzzle includes five pieces; a square, triangle, circle, rectangle, and oval.  Each puzzle piece is a different color, simultaneously teaching little ones about colors and shapes.  My son is five now, so it's been a very long while since he's played with this puzzle.  I recently found it put away in the back of a storage closet.  It's still in perfect condition so I passed it on to a friend who has a 7 month old baby.  She tells me he loves it and plays with it all the time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JK2R5SUG8Y0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EK59H0#wasThisHelpful","R3JK2R5SUG8Y0F","A310KT1UQC5UNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A310KT1UQC5UNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OMG I absolutely LOVE this case!!  I got is as a Mother's Day present, along with my new Kindle Paperwhite device!  I was actually torn between this one and another, more expensive case by Marware.  I've owned a few Marware--I see they are MarBlue now--cases before and they have all, without fail, proven to be a superior product.  So, when I had the choice between this one, or the more expensive MarBlue case, I hesitated.  But, after reading several reviews I decided to give this case a chance; after all Amazon has an excellent return policy.  Oh. My. Goodness.  When I opened the package and first lay my eyes on this little case I was totally in love.  I chose the purple color; the shade is a deep eggplant color that is absolutely beautiful.  The case is made of a nice textured, faux leather that looks and feels great.  Furthermore, it is so lightweight it feels like it weighs nothing at all; the extra weight it adds to the Paperwhite is positively negligible.  In addition, it has a magnetic closure that keeps the cover in place when the case is closed, and it also has the auto wake/sleep function with the opening and closing of the cover.  Add to that the fact that it fits the Paperwhite like a dream and what you have is the PERFECT case for the Paperwhite!  Wow!  I was really blown away.  I'm so glad I took a chance on this case and saved myself the extra $15 it would have cost me to buy the MarBlue!

"I bought this soccer ball for my daughter a few years ago when she was three years old.  She's a huge Tinker Bell fan--still is--so of course she loved it.  We enrolled her in soccer and once she saw this ball she was off and running, kicking the ball all over the place.  LOL  The actual soccer class didn't fare so well--she did one session and decided that was it--but she still had fun playing with this ball.The ball is smaller that than a regular adult soccer ball--it's a perfect size for little children.  I see the product description indicates that it is recommended for children 36 months - 15 years, but I would recommend buying this ball for a teenager; it's not that they couldn't play with it, but really, it's just too small!  My daughter is now almost eight and IMO it is already too small for her; although she still gets a blast kicking it around the yard with her five year old brother.  And yes, our ball is still going strong after almost five years of on and off use by two children.  This is really a great product; extremely well built and durable.  My husband has had to pump air into it a few times to keep it firm, but other than that it has been perfect!  FYI the ball is a size 3; I've noticed other size 3 soccer balls are recommended for children age 3 - 5, so I'm not sure why this one says 15.

"My seven year old daughter--almost eight--is a voracious reader.  She has systematically worked her way through several series of books, and I find myself constantly looking for new ones to entice her.  To date she's read all of the RAINBOW FAIRIES series, NANCY DREW AND THE CLUE CREW, NANCY CLANCY, EVER AFTER HIGH, and a few others.  So far, every series of books that she's read, she absolutely loves.  To her they have all been five star reads--I know because we have discussed it at length.  LOL  Anyhow, I was very happy when I discovered the GODDESS GIRLS while searching through my local library's digital catalog.  So far my daughter has read three of them; this one, which is book three in the series, and books one and two; Athena the Brain (Goddess Girls Book 1), Persephone the Phony (Goddess Girls Book 2), and Artemis the Brave (Goddess Girls Book 4).  She enjoyed those books as much as she did this one.The Goddess Girls series are stories about the lives of the Greek goddess--you know, Athena, Peresphone, Aphrodite, etc.--during their childhood.  All the stories are set around the Mount Olympus Academy, the school the girl goddesses attend.  Each book focuses on a different goddess.  In this story, Zeus assigns Athena the task of keeping an eye on new kid, Hercules, who expects will be causing trouble at MOA.  Hercules is a bit of a loose screw and keeping the hothead out of trouble isn't an easy task.  Things only get more complicated when Athena decides to help Hercules complete the twelve tasks he has to do in order to be able to become a god and remain at MOA permanently.  My daughter says she had ""fun"" reading this book.My daughter loves this book.  It's recommended for children ages 8-12, Grades 3-7.

"My daughter, who is almost eight, loves these Disney Fairies Chapter books.  I started purchasing them for her when she was only three years old.  She loves Tinker Bell and all the fairies, loved being read to, and could sit still for long periods of time, so I decided to try her with one of these illustrated chapter books.  The first one I bought for her was Fawn and the Mysterious Trickster (Disney Fairies) (A Stepping Stone Book(TM)).  She loved it so much, that very quickly bought her another.  I then bought her another, Rosetta's Daring Day (Disney Fairies) (A Stepping Stone Book(TM)), and after that one came this one.  My husband and I would read her a chapter or two before bed each night, and sometimes she would beg for more.  She is now in Second Grade and recently reread this book.  She loved it just as much as she did the first time around.  According to her it's a 5 star read!  LOLIn this story the ever unruffled Silvermist's calm demeanor is rattled when a so-called unlucky white ladybug lands on her head.  Silvermist's friends tells her that she is now cursed, but Silvermist is not convinced--at least not until a series of bad things start happening to her.  Now she wonders, are her friends correct?  Is she really cursed, or is it merely a coincidence? The book is very well written and includes some beautiful illustrations.  It is recommended for children ages 6-9, Grade level 1-4, but if you have a younger child who loves being read to, and has a love of all things fairies, they too might very well enjoy this story!

"I purchased this set of Hand Grip Forearm Strength Grippers for my husband.  He's no body builder; just a regular guy with medium sized hands, who works out on a regular basis.  Before these grippers, he had tried a couple of other ones, but didn't really care for any of them.  He absolutely loves this set.  He says they fit perfectly in his hands and are so comfortable to use; one of his main complaints about the other ones that he tried is that they hurt his hands whenever he used them.  The set includes all three weights; 30, 40, and 50lb resistance.  We've had them for a couple of years, and my husband still uses them a few times a week.  He says that he still gets a really good workout using the 50lb resistance ones and the 40lb ones are great for a quick, easy workout.  He no longer uses the 30lb ones because it is too easy for him, but I do on occasion.  It's an intense enough workout for me!

"This is a fantastic baby carrier; I should know, I went through several before I finally found and tried this one.  It is absolutely fantastic!  I used mine with both my children; I purchased it when my daughter was already a year and a half.  I used it with her and then with my son, from birth until he was about 2--he did not liked to be carried around, while my daughter preferred not to walk.  LOL  When my son was born I purchased the insert that is available to use with younger babies, ERGObaby Original Infant Insert, Grey.  However, if you don't want to go to the expense of buying the insert, a small rolled up towel would do just as well, I think.In any event, this carrier is wonderfully comfortable, both for parent and baby.  It attaches across Mom's shoulders and around her hips.  Youngest babies are carried lying cradled against Mom/Dad's chest, while older babies/toddlers sit cradled against the chest facing Mom/Dad.  My husband, who is a physical therapist, really liked this carrier.  He had a lot of reservations about the Baby BJORN because he said that the position in which that carrier held the baby was not good for their hips.  In his opinion, this carrier is much, much better because it holds baby in a sitting position...baby's weight is on his/her bum.  I used my carrier for over five years.  When I was done with it, it was still in excellent condition; there was only some fading of the fabric--I had the burgundy color.  I was actually able to resell mine, even after over five years of use.  Furthermore, it really does have the capability of carrying larger toddlers.  My husband used it to carry my daughter even when she was almost 40lbs!  I told you she preferred not to walk.  LOL  Anyway, this is a GREAT baby carrier!

"I love this gps portable friction mount.  I purchased two of them back in 2012; one for me and one for my hubby.  Since then we've each had two or three different Garmin Nuvi GPS, and every one of them have been compatible with this friction mount.  Currently my husband uses the Nuvi 52 LM; I have a Nuvi 50LM.  Prior to those we each had the Nuvi 2360LMT.  I found this friction mount when I went searching for a method of securing my vehicle gps without using the window mount that was provided with the unit.  I was living in California at the time, and it is against the law there to have anything mounted on your windshield.In any event, when I discovered this friction mount, I admit that I was skeptical.  I didn't think that there was any way it would remain securely in place when the car was in motion, much less if the car made a sudden stop.  As soon I received it I put it to test.  I drove up and down my a nearby empty parking lot going fast and braking suddenly, swerving from side to side and basically being crazy!  LOL  Not once did this friction mount fall off the dashboard.  Shoot, it never even once moved!!!  In the years since I've had it, I can honestly say that it's slid off my dashboard maybe once or twice, and those times were when one or other of my children had moved it too close to the edge of the dash.

"This is a great picnic table for little ones.  It very comfortably seats four children; the product description says it seats six, but while I agree that it can seat six, I don't agree with the claim that it seats them ""comfortably"" and I'm talking about toddlers, ages 3 and 4.  The table came in the manufacturer's box and was super easy to assemble.  It's very sturdy; it is not wobbly and does not tip.  I have sat on ours many times and while it's not the most comfortable seat for me, it easily takes my weight and does not tip over.  LOL  My children are now almost 8 and 5, and they still use this table.  It's very well made and is extremely sturdy.  It gets no special treatment from us; we keep it outside in the open and periodically I hose it down to keep it clean.My only complaint is that I wish it didn't have the center cupholders.  IMO, the table would have been better without them.  With the way it is, the cupholder pretty much divides the table in half; it's not that big, but because it's right in the middle of the table it ends up restricting each child to his/her side of the table.  If your child is painting/drawing/writing on a large piece of paper that extends from one side of the table to the other, when they try to work on the section of the paper that sits on the area where the cupholders are located, the paper dips.  Years ago, before my son was even born, I ended up cutting a piece of cardboard from a large, sturdy box, which I would put on the tabletop whenever my daughter wanted to do her artwork.  It worked pretty well, but every so often I'd have to find a new piece of cardboard.  I finally got a friend, who works in construction, to get me a thin sheet of cardboard, that he smoothed down, to use instead.  It works great!  I did promise myself, however, that if I ever buy another kids' picnic table, I'd get one sans the cupholders.

"The idea for this product is great; but the product itself is a little disappointing.  This is due to the fact that the tubing that leads from the shower is too short.  My daughter was only two years old when I purchased this and it didn't work well with her height.  For her small size, the shower head needed to be lower.  Of course she loved it so much that she insisted on using it.  Another problem I had is that I could never get it attached to the shower securely enough to prevent leaking.  Consequently, whenever my daughter took a shower, the water would leak out from the top.  In any event, we used this for a few months; it works, but it's not great.  I used it just long enough for my daughter to get over her fascination with it.  I then went ahead and purchased a regular ""adult"" handheld shower head that worked much, much better.  I should have done that from the very beginning and saved myself a few bucks.  Oh well, you live and you learn!","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZC95T39CADTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ZOM356#wasThisHelpful","RZC95T39CADTT","A310KT1UQC5UNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A310KT1UQC5UNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this DVD back in 2009 when my daughter was two years old and ready for potty training--well I was ready for her to be potty trained!  LOL  In any event, she didn't really care for this DVD.  I got her to watch it once or twice, and each time was a chore to get her to watch the entire video.  That was pretty surprising as she loves music, singing, and the like, so I was sure she'd like this DVD.  I ended up getting her another DVD, that she loved, Go Potty Go.Although my daughter didn't seem to be particularly impressed with this DVD, it was a favorite of my son's when he was potty training--he's now five years old.  He watched this DVD so many times that he knew all the words and could sing along whenever he watched it.  LOL  The best part is that while watching the DVD he very happily sat on his potty and oftentimes we would get some positive results!I recently passed along this DVD and some others to my cousin who has a toddler aged child.  He is now being potty trained.  My cousin tells me that he LOVES this DVD and has no problems sitting on his potty while he watches.  I guess this DVD is great for some kids, while not so great for others.

I read it to her, at her request, over and over, and she was determined to become potty trained, just like the Hannah in the story.  The story is told is a lovely rhyming rhythm which makes is fun to read and listen to.  It's also beautifully illustrated.  It tells the story of a little girl, Hannah, whose parents bought her a present...a brand new potty.  I loved this book; my daughter loved it even more.  She was already two when I bought this for her; she was fully potty trained by the time she was 2 1/2.

"This is a fantastic playhut!  I purchased this for my daughter back in 2009 when she was only 2.  Now at almost 8 years of age, she still loves to play with it with her 5 year old brother.  The two have a blast using this thing!  This thing is pretty huge though; it takes up my entire living room!...it's about 7 feet long with both pieces attached.  You also have the option of playing with only the Thomas the Tank portion or the caboose, if you don't have enough room for the entire playhut.  FYI the playhut does not have a floor; the bottom is completely open.  There are two pieces that are connected using Velcro tabs; the front portion is Thomas, the back portion consists of the cabooses, Annie and Clarabel.  The playhut is made of a thing polyester material that is surprisingly sturdy; we've had ours for almost six years now and so far we've had no mishaps with tears, snags, or anything else of that nature!  As far as storage goes, that is an absolute breeze!  It has that EZ twist technology that makes folding it a breeze; it folds down flat and I keep ours stored behind our couch!  As for set up, it's even easier than folding; all I do is shake it and pops right up...it's similar to those pop up laundry baskets.If space is an issue for you, you should know that Amazon also sells the Thomas the Tank Playhut without the caboose, that is considerably small, yet is still fairly roomy....it is about half the length of this one, Playhut Thomas the Tank Play Vehicle.  Personally, I'd say buy this bigger one, even if you don't have enough space for it indoors, for those times when the kids use it outside.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVKTL8VY413TO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XQCQ9Y#wasThisHelpful","RVKTL8VY413TO","A310KT1UQC5UNU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A310KT1UQC5UNU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is one fantastic toy box.  I purchased mine back in 2008, when my daughter was almost a year old, and it's still going strong!!!  It's made of hard plastic on either end, but the front and back consist of a sturdy, heavy duty canvas-like material.  As depicted in the product picture, along the front end there are three pockets.  The toy box was extremely easy to assemble and once put together there isn't anything else that you have to do with it.  You have the option of keeping the lid on or off; when my children were younger I would remove the lid completely as I was afraid that it would fall down on them while playing.  Now that they are older--almost 8 and age 5--they have continued to do the same thing.  The front pouches are great for keeping smaller items, such as lego pieces, play jewelry, or the like.

Initially I used them to organize baby items...you know, diapers, wipes, baby toiletries, etc.  After both my children past the baby/diaper stage, I started using them to organize books and toys.  They work great!  If that's not enough, they are extremely attractive; the artwork on the outside is par excellence and each bin is painted a beautiful color on the inside.  Add to that the fact that the bins are exceptionally well made and are unbelievably sturdy; all three of my bins are in in excellent condition.

"The Kindle version of the dictionary sucks, sucks, sucks!  It is impossible to find a word.  I literally have to scroll through page after page after page when looking for a specific word.  There isn't even a way to get directly to a particular letter of the alphabet!!!  It's difficult enough trying to scroll to the specific letter of the alphabet; it's impossible to get directly to a specific word.  The Table of Contents allows you to get directly to a certain section by tapping on the live link.  The problem is that, rather than have the dictionary portion divided up by the individual alphabet, that section of the lumped together; it's listed as ""Dictionary A-Z.  When you click on that live link you are taken directly to the beginning of the dictionary section; which means that you are taken the first page in the ""A"" section.  If you want to look up a word that begins with another letter, then you have to ""guess"" as to where that letter might be and blindly scroll forward...of course you have to stop constantly to ascertain whether or not you reached the particular letter you if you passed it by.I was looking up the word ""neat"" for my daughter and I kid you not when I say that it took me almost ten bloody minutes just to find the word.  First I scrolled until I got to the N section; of course you have to do that by total guess work because there is no way to tell when you get to any particular area.  Once I finally found the Ns after trial and error then I tried scrolling to ""Ne"".  Well let me tell you that that was an exercise in futility!  Sometimes I'd go too far back and end up at No or some other combination; when I tried to scroll back I'd end up at the Ms.  And on and on it went.  A complete disaster!!  I needed to look up another word, but decided that there is no way that I'm using this piece of crap--yes I am seriously ticked off!!  I wish I could give this blasted book ZERO stars because that is exactly what it deserves!!!  The ONLY saving grace is that I purchased it when it was a Kindle Daily Deal special, so I only paid $1.99 for it; and quite frankly it isn't even worth that.

"These are really terrific quality/value paper towels.  I wouldn't have thought of switching to this type of towel from rolled paper towels until reading that someone else was doing so.We have a very open floor plan and my kitchen can be seen from living, dining, breakfast and family rooms.  Anything and everything that helps me keep my kitchen tidy and attractive is a plus for me.  I'm keeping these towels by the sink in a basket that holds them perfectly and it is much more aesthetically pleasing than a vertical roll of towels--no matter how nice that holder may be.As to the quality of the towels; they are great.  One towel unfolded all the way is large enough to use as a napkin for a messy toddler or when having BBQ.  They really shine as towels for cleaning and drying.  They are sturdy, can take some serious scrubbing, and one towel can clean a lot of mess.Pricewise, this math nerd compared my normal Bounty Pick-A-Size towels to the C-Folds.  I always compare paper product pricing by cost per square foot because manufacturers have become so deceptive--cardboard rolls get wider and shorter, paper quantity gets smaller every year.  The square footage of paper is the only way to know what you are really buying.The Bounty comes to 2.9 cents/sq ft when I buy the huge roll 12-packs at $28.40.  The Georgia Pacific C-Fold comes to 2.8 cents/sq ft at current amazon price of $31.98.  We will be sticking with the C-Folds because of their durability, versatility and compactness of storage space.  The C-Fold box 00 towels takes up substantially less space than even a 6 pack of rolled towels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CUQTB1GJ6UCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VPEMA1W#wasThisHelpful","R3CUQTB1GJ6UCD","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Caring deeply about the health and longevity of my dog; I am always searching for the best food(s) I can afford for her. It has become a source of frustration for me that even the best of dog food manufacturers seem to always be involved in recalls; leaving me unable to trust a) that any have my dogs well-being at heart and b) that they are sourcing from reputable countries/sources and c) that anyone but a molecular biologist who is VERY current on their research can even determine if the ingredients are GOOD for my dog.This food starts off with one BIG star taken off because of the poor reputation of this manufacturer; many recalls in the past; but none recent that I have found so I am believing that they figured out it isn't profitable to kill peoples pets.  Note that I DON'T think they care about our pets which would be the motivation I would like to see.  Given that this company was started by a woman who adores her pets I am really surprised she sourced to this company.I am a bad consumer (don't like spending money :>) and a big big skeptic:  I believe nothing and fact check as much as time allows.  I am not moved by packaging, bogus/meaningless marketing terms, etc.  I tried this product because it was free in exchange for an honest review and it appears to have quality ingredients.  Almost all of the marketing descriptions on this and most packaging are meaningless so you have to dig into the ingredient list and know something about the nutrition you want to provide for your pet.This product is made in the US, but ingredients are sourced from around the world.  It is a relief that they do NOT source from China.  For this price, and it is exorbitant for what you get, I feel like the ingredients should be sourced from the US and/or reputable sources overseas with proven interest in animal health.  As is the trend these days, there seems to be a lot of superfluous ingredients designed to make humans buy the food (various microscopic amounts of fruits, veggies, herbs, vitamins, micronutrients, etc.)Our Libby LuLu is not a picky eater and inhaled this food as it was introduced, and when fed this food solo.  It didn't cause her any transitional/gastric distress.  Because of the manufacturers poor reputation in the past and the crazy high price, this will never be our primary food.  I don't mind it in the rotation of foods we give our girl.We continue our search for the perfect food made by an HONEST, ETHICAL company who is extremely thoughtful about exactly what goes into the food they make and markets this food at a price the average person can afford.  Thus far, we haven't found that company and or food.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC507KIJKQFS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIGFWM#wasThisHelpful","RC507KIJKQFS2","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great DHA supplement.  I've used other Viva Labs supplement with good success and felt safe ordering this product as well.The capsules are small and smooth enough to swallow easily, do not cause me gastric distress, and I do NOT have nasty fish burps afterwards.The product is supposedly and hopefully wild caught and is molecularly distilled and fully tested for contaminants and heavy metals.The company provides a certification from the IFOS, but it is for only one batch number.  It would be quite simple to make a single batch and clean it up, get your test and then advertise as if ALL of your product tests the same.  Unfortunately, that is not terribly reassuring to me.

"The elastic bands that hold my prior paperwhite easel cover have stretched out.  The cover is no longer made so I had to go searching for a new one.The material of this cover feels very cheap, but then all things considered this was a lower price point.It marks easily which is a negative if you are carrying it in a bag with other items or using it on any less than pristine surface, such as any restaurant table, picnic table, etc.Mostly I am displeased with the bulk and weight of the cover.  when you lie in bed reading, the cover doesn't fold up flat and neat behind the kindle.  It has a triangular wedge shape which is bulky and awkward to hold.

"I genuinely hate leaving one-star reviews and have to be extremely disappointed to do so.  I don't like crushing an author, and I don't like all the ""unhelpful"" votes one gets when giving an honest negative review.I don't know if this is a YA Fantasy book gone wrong or what happened; but this book missed almost every mark one needs to hit to have a good piece of fantasy lit.The writing feels embarrassingly juvenile.  It's as if the author reached into a ""how to write a fantasy book"" grab bag every now and again and grabbed an idea:  include mythical winged creatures, primitive/barbarian cultures, create strange new kingdoms, don't forget the nasty queen and your tragic ""Cinderella"" character.  How about some magicians or wizards and some spells to go with them.I have no problem with an author reaching into that grab bag as long as the author is able to weave a cohesive story around them.  World building is about much more than coming up with weird new names and basic geography.Speaking of names; as a 40+ year fan of fantasy literature I have read my share of strange names for both characters and kingdoms.  I don't know what the problem was with the naming in this book but I was unable to remember the vast majority of the names.  It's as if some unwritten rule of name creation was violated in the writing of this book.In the end, which comes before the story ends--MAJOR ONE STAR pet peeve of many of us--there really wasn't a story.  Just a collection of sentences, paragraphs and chapters that come to an end with no REAL STORY.  This is yet another author releasing PART of a book and calling it a book.When a book gets one star and you paid nothing for it and feel cheated because it wasn't a whole story that is just bad news all around.A lot of times I can give books like this 3 stars because I can FEEL the good story buried within a new author's writing or find it within editing issues.  That was impossible in this non-story.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHV0ZUV8B549/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8O7FLQ#wasThisHelpful","RJHV0ZUV8B549","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another great Solid Gold Dry dog food.This is one of the best fish formulations we've tried in any brand.  Some of them stink so bad in the bag and in your dog that it makes you kind of queasy.THIS bag of food actually smelled really good when we opened it.  After reading the ingredient list I'm really impressed with the ingredients and the fact that Alaskan Pollock is the FIRST ingredient (not pollock meal--that is second ingredient).  This food is going in our regular rotation for our dog.

"What fun!!!I had modest expectations of this toy...made in china junk is what I really expected.Instead we received a toy that has been a blast to play with for adults AND kids. What a nice surprise.Assembly was quick and easy other than finessing the inevitable stickesr that you have to place for dragon eyes, teeth, etc.I'm mostly surprised that we got three nice quality Hot Wheels Monster Jam trucks (Gravedigger, Reptoid and Firestorm) that are made well enough to withstand the abuse they get with this toy since they are repeatedly catapulted at pretty good clip into various objects.Number one grandson laughs gleefully when the dragon ""catches"" the car--thinks that is just too wonderful.  He is far more into that action than ""winning"" by hitting the dragons tail and capturing the golden chalice.  He also loves it when he can send the dragons head flying (it really is fun to watch--it goes quite the distance)His parents and grandparents, on the other hand, are competitive and want that chalice.  It isn't nearly as easy as you would expect to get the chalice (I'm guessing once every 30 or 40 launches at best) so there is high replay value for competitive kids.  I love that even ""losing"" is entertaining with this toy.Note: you can attach the launcher at two different locations on the set to expand the options for fun.After playing for a while I noticed a much higher chance of success with Gravedigger and that Firestorm got ""caught"" more often.  I weighed the cars and low and behold, Gravedigger weighs the most and Firestorm the least.  Great educational opportunity for kids if you want to teach about mass and velocity :>).I HIGHLY recommend this toy and think it is well worth its $20 price tag.Oh, and I LOVE the frustration free packaging amazon offers--not pretty to look at for gift recipient, but oh so much better for those having to unpack and assemble the toy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMC0EL197NGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD3N3NO#wasThisHelpful","R1BMC0EL197NGX","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This could have been a five star product with just a minor tweak.First, it's a great idea and is unlike any books we have for our grandson.  My husband is an engineer and former builder and my son is an automotive tech.  My 18 month old grandson is already showing the family ""bent"" for taking things apart, making things and understanding how things work.The big challenge with this book is that while it is interactive, the interactive parts are much to flimsy to be used by younger toddlers who haven't yet mastered the art of ""GENTLE"" handling of more delicate items.  A book made for this age group should have had much sturdier construction (Melissa and Doug line could have executed this really well).For the price I felt like the book should have delivered appropriate construction quality for intended age group.The kind of kids who are going to like this book (the busy bees and future engineers, contractors, mechanical kids etc) are by default going to damage the pieces because they are going to USE them!That said, if you have an older toddler who maybe isn't super ""hands on"" this would be a good book for their collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26XRJW3FJ9CW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1027600743#wasThisHelpful","R26XRJW3FJ9CW7","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are always open to finding new and better dog foods for our little LuLu.We work hard to balance finding high quality preferably organic and grain free foods with the cost of said foods.She is not a picky eater so she scarfed this food as it was introduced with her current food and then as she was fed the food solo.The ingredient list appears to contain good quality ingredients; but as is the trend lately, it sure seems there are a lot of superfluous ingredients.The healthiest dog I ever had was fed raw from beginning to end.  That is more work/time than I have at this point and our current little girl came to us with heart problems so I worry about feeding her ""off the grid.""She had no digestive issues with this food and didn't act like she was starving (which she has with some foods we've tried which make me think they are missing enough protein or fat for satiety).In the end, this is a very high priced food and we like it, but not as much as we like other comparably priced premium, grain free foods.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D313LV1GMKTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIG7BG#wasThisHelpful","R2D313LV1GMKTU","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really pleased to receive this excellent magnesium supplement in exchange for an honest review.  I had only 3 tablets left in my existing bottle so the timing was perfect.I take Magnesium at the advice of my cardiologist to help with pvc's and t-wave abnormalities (my electrical system is evidentally wired wrong!)My gastroenterologist recommended it as I have severe LPRD (like GERD) accompanied by esophageal spasms.My primary care doctor recommended to help me sleep.Needless to say, magnesium is high on my list of ""gotta have, gotta take"" supplements.I've had good results using ""premium"" forms of magnesium (i.e. not oxide), but have never tried the bisglycinate chelate form.I'm happy to say that I'm getting very good results with this type of magnesium and hope over a period of a month or so (the norm for me to really see changes/improvements with most supplements) to see even more impressive results.I will post in a month with any changes.In the meantime, this is what I can share:I have a pretty intense gag reflex and these tablets, while chalky, solid and of average to large size go down easy and cause no gagging or sticking to throat as they go down.  This is important because I am taking one in a.m., one in afternoon and two in evening.  I couldn't do four a day of any supplement that was miserable to consume .They cause me ZERO gastric distress.They seem to be particularly effective in the sleep realm, to the point that I can't take two in the a.m.  It's more of a relaxing effect that tired effect so be careful if you are taking these for the first time not to do so before driving or running with scissors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10XXUSBX7FV8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JUGTDI#wasThisHelpful","R10XXUSBX7FV8C","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed Mitch Albom's ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" and I love music, so there was no way I was passing up this book.This is an enchanting story with the narrator being ""Music."" Music is a grand and generous persona/spirit.  A sampling of how Albom handles Music's storytelling:""I am Music.  And I am here for the soul of Frankie Presto.  Not all of it, just the rather large part he took from me when he came into this world.  However well used, I am a loan, not a possession.  You give me back on departure.I will gather up Frankie's talent to spread on newborn souls.  And I will do the same with yours one day.  There is a reason you glance up when you hear a melody, or tap your foot to the sound of a drum.All humans are musical.Why else would the Lord give you a beating heart.""I was IN the story from that paragraph on page 4 all the way to the end.  I'll warn readers who like a nice calm, linear story that this is NOT that kind of story.  It skitters along and hops back and forth through time.I loved that the story included all kinds of people in the music industry and loved that they came from many backgrounds (Wynton Marsalis made it in--hooray!).Frankie was at Woodstock, Frankie was EVERYWHERE with EVERYONE.This does in fact give the story a ""Forrest Gump""-y type vibe (and that was a movie with a great meta story and the music to go along with it) and it weaves quite a spell on the reader.The story ends 400+ pages later with this:""I am Music.  And Music is in the connection of human souls, speaking a language that needs no words.  Everyone joins a band in this life.  And what you play always affects someone.  Sometimes it affects the world.  Frankie's symphony ends.  And so, at last, we rest.""If you love music, good storytelling, and can tap into the spirit of what Albom has created; you are going to have a special read with this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQZK7HSG0QLF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062294415#wasThisHelpful","RQZK7HSG0QLF5","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:  Garden of Life responded to my request to find out how much of each strain of probiotic was in this formula saying it was proprietary information that they wouldn't provide.  They did say that just like food products, they've listed the strains in order of highest content to lowest.  I figured that out on my own when I saw the cheaper and more common acidolphilus listed first.So, for all I know they really have shipped a very expensive bottle of acidolphilus with token amounts of the other strains just so they can put it on the label.  I've just knocked off another two stars for the company being either non-transparent or disingenuous...I don't care which it is.  I'm not buying this without knowing what I'm paying for.Props to them for responding fairly quickly even if they didn't provide the needed information.--------------------------------We ordered both the mens and womens formulas of the Garden of Life Probiotics.We have taken probiotics both prophylactically for overall health and wellbeing and more intentionally when travelling to places with questionable food/water/hygiene and during times of medical challenges.This is definitely the most comprehensive probiotic either of has taken with the most active strains.I've taken off one star because of price and the fact that the amount of each individual strain isn't provided for in ingredients. It isn't clear if the quantity of each strain is listed in order of highest proportion either.You could be getting 239 mg of the first strain and 1 mg of each of the other 9 strains for all we know. If the quantity of each strain isn't available in the amount needed to provide benefits, then all those listed strains are just marketing hype.The mens and womens formulas have the same strains listed in different order on the labels. The mens says it is 217 mg and the womens says 248mg.If I find that there are only ""token"" quantities of most of the strains, this review goes to zero stars. I've written to the company to find out this information and will post if company responds.In the meantime, we continue to take this probiotic on faith that Dr. Perlmutter values his integrity and our health and has created a good quality product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35XHEUXUTD6HB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8MP4G6#wasThisHelpful","R35XHEUXUTD6HB","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE:  Props to both amazon and Fisher Price for prompt and efficient customer service.  Fisher Price went through trouble shooting process with me and offered to send replacement.  Amazon, beat them by an hour (both responded within 24 hours) and sent a replacement.  The replacement works great and we all love this little wagon!NOTE:  If this toy worked as advertised it would be FIVE STARS; however the wagon we received doesn't play music as advertised.  I have written to amazon and FP asking for replacement and will update review when I hear back from them and get a working replacement. I am giving my enthusiastic five star rating in belief they will send me a working toy.In the meantime, here is what's great about this toy:It is very well made.  The wheels roll smoothly, are attached firmly.  The plastic is sturdy and has no sharp edges.  The handle is the perfect size, weight and length for a toddler.Our grandson has recently discovered that arms and hands can be worked in such a way to THROW things.  He has great muscle strength and coordination as we have found.  His new activity has also tested the limits of his toys.He was ear-to-ear grins when we unpacked this toy; and he's not one of those kids that gets all worked up about a new toy.  He does have a real love for balls, blocks and anything with wheels; so this toy met all of his happy requirements.The blocks have balls that roll around inside the blocks with various artwork on the balls.  The balls also have hollow indents on some sides to allow for stacking of the blocks.  I love the fact that this little twist provided grandson with a real challenge that he persisted in mastering.Another great challenge for this 18 month old was placing the block in the front corner and using the block itself to rotate the little holder and make a great clacking noise.There is a ""catapult"" on the other front side of the wagon and that was MY favorite thing about the toy.  I used the catapult to launch blocks at duplo creations and other stacked towers we built.  The catapult will launch those blocks a good distance (far past the rear of the toy) so don't teach your kiddo this move in front of a glass cabinet/tv etc (as the blocks are substantial in weight and are a rigid plastic).  Once grandson saw me doing this he really focused on learning to do this himself and laughed with great gusto every time he succeeded.  We used pillows to ""shield"" ourselves from his barbarian attacks and that really had him rolling.The rolling side of the blocks means that little hands can roll the blocks in the same way they would a push car...meaning just that much more fun.On to the wagon itself.  The rocking motion seemed like a weird idea in the written description but turns out to be a fabulous idea in reality.  Grandson is fascinated by the motion and the movement and noise of the blocks as he pulls his wagon around house.

"UPDATE:  Garden of Life responded to my request to find out how much of each strain of probiotic was in this formula saying it was proprietary information that they wouldn't provide.  They did say that just like food products, they've listed the strains in order of highest content to lowest.  I figured that out on my own when I saw the cheaper and more common acidolphilus listed first.So, for all I know they really have shipped a very expensive bottle of acidolphilus with token amounts of the other strains just so they can put it on the label.  I've just knocked off another two stars for the company being either non-transparent or disingenuous...I don't care which it is.  I'm not buying this without knowing what I'm paying for.Props to them for responding fairly quickly even if they didn't provide the needed information.-------------------------------------We ordered both the mens and womens formulas of the Garden of Life Probiotics.We have taken probiotics both prophylactically for overall health and well-being and more intentionally when travelling to places with questionable food/water/hygiene and during times of medical challenges.This might be (see comments above and below about label not specifying how much of each strain you are getting) is definitely the most comprehensive probiotic either of has taken with the most active strains.The probiotic causes no gastric distress.We've taken off three stars because of price and the fact that the amount of each individual strain isn't provided for in ingredients.  It isn't clear if the quantity of each strain is listed in order of highest proportion either.You could be getting 208 mg of the first strain and 1 mg of each of the other 9 strains for all we know.  If the quantity of each strain isn't available in the amount needed to provide benefits, then all those listed strains are just marketing hype.The mens and womens formulas have the same strains listed in different order on the labels.  The mens says it is 217 mg and the womens says 248mg.If I find that there are only ""token"" quantities of most of the strains, this review goes to zero stars.  I've written to the company to find out this information and will post if company responds.In the meantime, we continue to take this probiotic on faith that Dr. Perlmutter values his integrity and our health and has created a good quality product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0Y7AU8RO2P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8MP5VA#wasThisHelpful","R1L0Y7AU8RO2P4","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love that this company is offering up not only an organic infant cereal, but one made with healthy quinoa.Before giving it to ""number one grandson"" I made a small batch for myself to try.Upon opening the bag, I got an immediate dose of earthy quinoa scent.  The color was a pale sandy tan (package says can be gray to tan in coloring).  The texture was very fine as you would desire in an infant cereal.I prepared with a one part cereal, two part water formulation as most reviewers mention cereal being too thick.  It turned out to be a perfect texture, just the right thickness and smoothness.  Interestingly, you could smell a bit of the apple once the warm water hit the cereal.  The cereal hydrated fully very quickly.Drumroll, the taste test...earthy, sweet, apple essence-y is my first impression.  Checked label for sugar it tasted so sweet....no sugar, good.A few minutes after consuming the cereal I felt a headache coming one.  Once again I check the label looking for stevia perhaps (migraine trigger for me).  Instead, underneath the amazon vine label which I had to peel off to read bottom half of ingredient list, I found holy basil as an ingredient.  Holy basil is another migraine trigger for me.  Even with what was probably a miniscule quantity of Holy Basil I am sitting here with a pounding headache.I have decided not to give this cereal to number one grandson.  I wish the manufacturer had kept this simple; cereal and apples, and they would have had a winner.  I can't think of any reason why I would give my grandson or anyone else any herbs, vitamins, supplements, additives that he didn't NEED for his good health.  Our goal is to maintain the good health he is in, largely a result of his mom breastfeeding him thus far.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUQF97W1NSZX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8DYVXC#wasThisHelpful","RUQF97W1NSZX9","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used a TENS unit for over a decade for pain management and have had good success so I was intrigued by using the Slendertone Muscle Toner to tone my aging stomach muscles.I went into this with an open mind and didn't do any research (because I knew I would read rabid reviews both for and against both the technology and the product).  I've been losing weight steadily for the past few months and am happy with my reduced size, but boy oh boy am I ever aware of how much I need to stregthen and tone my body as well.I'm taking an exercise class focused on core strength as well as using a pilates reformer for same reason.  Progress is slow.  I figure if this Slendertone helps AT ALL, I'm a happy camper.The instructions are simple, and with the pads being same as a TENS unit, figuring this out is simple.  It is worth your while to take care of your pads so they last as long as possible.I only used the Slendertone two weeks before an emergency room visit in which I found out I have electrical problems with my heart.  That said my doctor felt like using the Slendertone was probably not worth any potential gain I might have (it turns out the Slendertone booklet has the first ""warning"" related to pacemakers and heart issues).During the two weeks of use I could feel the effects of the Slendertone and felt good after using it.

"My husband has a high stress job and is also showing some signs of early cognitive decline.  We have been addressing these issues largely through dietary changes and supplements and we read constantly in hopes of helping him through this challenging chapter of life.We have had very good look with Jarrow supplements and tend to start with their brand when trying something new.I was happy to get this PS-PA for my husband to try.As with any supplement/drug, results may be subtle and take time.  He is three weeks into this supplement and we can only judge results by his overall behavior and observations.I would love to say the results have been miraculous, but they haven't.  However, he is feeling less anxious and more focused and that is worth something.I have started taking it as well and am pleased with noticeable results.  I've got some big bookkeeping projects going and feel much more on-the-ball taking the PS-PA three times a day.  Overall I feel it has helped with my stress levels as well (in the questionnaire from the book ""the Mood Cure"" I tested as being pretty spent in the realm of adrenals, so perhaps this is helping.  I sure hope so!We tend to give any new supplement a three month trial at minimum and will do so with this.At that time my review will be amended with any new observations.Best of luck to all who need this supplement.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31W3MEMHZWCF4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZFOR9AK#wasThisHelpful","R31W3MEMHZWCF4","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

You can tell that very good quality, fresh, crunchy apples were used as the full flavor and crispy texture of these apples is amazing.  And unlike a lot of cinnamon seasoned foods, these apples have a subtly sweet cinnamon essence that doesn't overpower the apples.  These will be a new pantry staple.If I were going to have unused apples after a week, I've found with other freeze dried food that the best way to keep it crisp is to put the remainder in mason jars and vacuum seal with my FoodSaver jar attachment.

For that matter, almost all the vine reviews seem to be cut and paste copying/editing of prior reviews.This is a very well made pot holder--nice heavy weight fabric, quality stitching and finish seams, nice silicone ribbing and outstanding heat resistance.On one side of the pot holder the silicone ribs extend all the way across.  On the other side there is a pocket sewn into the full length of the pot holder that slips over the handle of your pots.  What a great, practical idea!The potholder protected my hand when pulling a cast iron skillet out of a 400 degree oven--one of my biggest challenges to a pot holder.I also used it to remove baking sheets full of roasted veggies and found that this particular pot holder isn't well suited for grabbing shallow baking sheets.  It is too thick, long, bulky and/or just shaped wrong for that purpose and the fabric gets all over the food.  It excels on pot handles and on pulling casserole dishes out of the oven.  I will be getting a second one as I would feel more secure pulling larger/heavier dishes out of the oven with two.Note to manufacturer if they read reviews:  Use a fully sewn on tag/care instructions.

"I had never seen or heard of dehydrated pet food before seeing the Honest Kitchen Halcyon food.  We are downsizing to a smaller home in our retirement and have been talking about how we need to pare down the amount/quantity and size of items we store.I tend to keep a large pantry because I loathe shopping.So, along comes Honest Kitchen with this fabulous food.I was surprised by how small the box is! Very compact.  There is a nice weight, good quality ziplock bag inside with the food.On opening the food I was happy to see it looked and smelled good and fresh.Instructions were easy to read and follow:  Serve up just how much you need, add warm water, stir well and let soak a few minutes.The food is very green when hydrated and smells kind of ""earthy"" so I was interested to see if our picky terrier would even try it.SHE LOVES IT!  It hasn't caused her any gastric distress.I'm pleased with the sourcing and attention to ingredients this company has chosen.LuLu is a rescue girl who came to us in poor condition and is wrapping up her heartworm treatment now.  She needs all of the goodness she can get.The Honest Kitchen Halcyon has earned a permanent place in our pared down pantry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EVSFNM3URIMD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLN0WYE#wasThisHelpful","R1EVSFNM3URIMD","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not a book. Has a beginning but no ending.

"My husband is a handyman extraordinaire and our house and landscaping project give him plenty of material to work with.  He is a fan of craftsman quality tools and already had some Irwin tools in his tool chest.He was VERY happy to receive these and quickly set about using them on various projects.As with all Irwin tools he owns, these are of very high quality, fit and finish and are a pleasure to use.  They came with a well-made and very handy lanyard.While he liked this tool and said it is great for specific tasks, it is not as versatile and overall as useful to him as his Irwin PowerSlot Diagonal Pliers.The cutter has a max. gap of ” which spreads the handles too wide to get leverage.

"I'm always open to better ways to keep my trunk organized and carry groceries from warehouse stores and farmers market into the house.I had high hopes that this would be the perfect storage solution.My first box arrived broken, leading me to believe the plastic used in this box is fragile.  Amazon, quickly replaced it with a new box which arrived in perfect condition.I love the colors and the fact that the box stores flat so it doesn't take up space in your trunk until you need it.  It was easy to go from flat to box and no need to read instructions--intuitive design.  I can't carry as many pounds as this box is said to hold by manufacturer.  However, I did take it to Costco and load it up to my personal max (probably 40#).When I went to lift the full box up and over the back of my car and into the trunk the sides wanted to fold in.  This is not as sturdy as a fixed sided crate that you could tilt, angle and manipulate to get exactly where you want.  I also don't think I would have trusted $200+ dollars worth of wines, oils, etc in this crate hauling over any distance...just didn't feel like it was secure enough.Lastly, I feel that this is priced higher than design/construction warrants.  I'd say $10-12 max price point.In summary, I will keep this in my car to corral my grocery bags on smaller runs to the store or for farmers market where the open crate design helps keep produce from getting funky from trapped heat/moisture.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCCCUBC3JCRCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LFOHX7S#wasThisHelpful","RCCCUBC3JCRCN","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently had to switch from carrying shoulder bags to carrying crossbody bags due to neck/shoulder issues.I've tried more purses than I care to remember in my search for a simple, stylish, leather, lightweight, well-made bag.Of all the bags I've tried, the Tignanellos have consistently been the best. I've purchased this style along with 4 others and love them all.This particular bag gets the most use as I can fit my kindle (in a leather case), reading glasses, coupon folder and assorted items like makeup, mints, pocketknife etc in the main compartment and it's pockets. My smart phone is too big for the pocket designed for phone so I slip it into the inside zippered pocket and leave it unzipped. I would take off a 1/2 star for that glaring design fault if possible as I place a high premium on easy access to phone.I rarely need to use the long zippered outer compartment, but it is very roomy if you need extra space--great spot for checkbook if you carry one.The primary reason I love these Tignanello crossbody purses is because of the EXCELLENT zippered ""wallet"" that is part of all 4 styles I've purchased. This particular version has the roomiest wallet compartment with drivers license window slot, a plethora of regular card slots, and a zippered compartment for your cash.I have this style in 3 colors and my favorite is the ""Peacock""--a rich, deep teal blue. The ""Brown"" is a rich, deep espresso brown that goes with everything.The construction on all 3 is excellent, from leather quality, dye, construction/seaming details, heavy weight interior fabric with very tidy finish. The strap is very comfortable and doesn't cut into my neck. It can be configured several ways if you don't care to go crossbody all the time.HIGHLY recommend this bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR73G1VJWO9L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ECOMXI#wasThisHelpful","RR73G1VJWO9L8","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband loves this razor (but not the price) so here is the review in his own words:I've been an electric razor user for almost 40 years and am a fan of the original ""triple header.""I've also used Braun and Panasonic shavers.The Norelco S9721 was well packaged and included a good manual.The initial charge lasted two weeks.The shaver head comes apart easily for cleaning.Shaving area feels much larger than it needs to be.  Low speed works well for my face, does not take any longer to shave than the higher speeds.  Manual recommends 3 weeks for your face to adjust to this shaver.  It did work better after a couple of weeks.The 9700 is much quieter than any shaver I've used and is a big plus.It is easy to switch between the shaver and trimmer head, but highlighting the alignment tab on both head and shaver would make it easier to see and align for assembly.Nice bonus:  The travel lock feature prevents the shaver from accidentally coming on while traveling or storage.The hard case provided also protects the shaver from damage during travel.Biggest downside (but certainly not a deal-breaker) is that there isn't any place on the stand to store the trimmer head. It either lays on counter, adding to unsightly clutter, or gets put in a drawer for possible damage or even loss.The Smart Clean System works well to clean and lubricate shaver.  Manual cleaning the shaver between shaves lets the system do a better job and extends the fluid and filter life.  The system alerts you when the filter is dirty.  Anticipated fluid cartridge life is 3 months, which I think is reasonable.I do not see an Amazon listing for replacement JC302 cleaning solution cartridges.  They are available in a 2-pack from the Philips website for $11.99 which includes free shipping.  That seems reasonable for the preventative care and maintenance of such a nice shaver.Overall I think this is a very good shaver, but it is definitely not worth the $350 price tag.  He feels like the difference in performance between his $250 shaver and this one is negligible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ODZ4Y0KTVSKV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M1E5FU8#wasThisHelpful","R2ODZ4Y0KTVSKV","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a lover of all things ""frog,"" I was happy to choose this toy for my grandson.Upon receiving the frog I was even happier.  He is even cuter in person than in the images on amazon--frog goodness to be sure.The toy is very well packaged (in other words, it is going to take you some time to get it apart, but all the pieces are in perfect shape).  This is one of those items that might be nice for amazon to offer ""Frustration Free Packaging"" option.This is definitely geared toward young babies (9+ month) and won't offer enough variety/stimulation for most older babies/toddlers.The toy comes with 3 balls.  When a ball is placed in the frog's mouth he ""ribbits"" and his cheeks light up and a tune plays.  This particular tune is only 'ok,' not annoying but not enjoyable either.  Bonus points for including starter batteries with the toy.There is a button on the bottom that releases balls from the chute and plays much better music selections (and lights up the cheeks again)--some with kind of a Caribbean/reggae/island vibe that makes me happy.  I LOVE that the music is happy, sweet music set at a very nice volume and encourages dancing around with your child/grandchild.  I don't allow many toys in my home that make noise/music because it grates my nerves.THIS toy can stay permanently at grammys house :>).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X3SAHDN7RHLL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHHLMDM#wasThisHelpful","R1X3SAHDN7RHLL","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pairing was easy and straight forward.Having used many headsets over the years, and comparing this to others; the Jabra Stealth is louder and clearer.Listeners can’t tell you are on headset. Volume is adjusted on phone, not headset like others, which is a plus to me.The headset comes with multiple ear inserts and ear hooks, to pick a comfortable combination for individual ear shapes.  This was very important to me as I evidently have small and odd ears (I base this on how hard it is to find any headset that works for me).  I was able to get a comfortable fit for this set.Ear inserts are a sporty red and black which kind of kills the ""stealth"" factor.  I prefer a headset that is unobtrusive, which red is not.The headset holds a charge well but does not give a warning of a low battery, just voice quality goes down.  It would be nice if there was some type of warning so you can make sure its charged before a day of heavy usage.The short USB charging cable is OK for a laptop but takes longer and the laptop has to be on.  The little cover door for the charging port is weak and doubt it will be there for long.The on-off switch is easy to use with thumb while headset is in ear.The call answer/end touch button works as expected.The voice button looks up inquiries on Google +, but I could not get it to dial a number.  It would find a restaurant, but you have to press send from the phone.One time the headset disconnected from the phone, but the Bluetooth still showed enabled on the phone and could not use the phone.  Tried to reconnect and it would not.  Had to reset the phone to use.I rate this headset 4-1/2 stars (because of the disconnect issue above and a few other collective things I'd like to see functioning better).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WOJS7FOBSKU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LSYHLR2#wasThisHelpful","R2WOJS7FOBSKU5","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having been a fan of model cars when I was a youngster I looked forward to building this fabulous looking Dark Knight model for my grandson.  He is too young to assemble this himself.The box says ages 8+, but I don't believe most 8 year old children could put this together without the help of an adult.  The pieces are very tiny and there are a lot of them to keep up with.  I'm thinking 10+ to build this solo.If I were going to allow a child to try this on their own, I'd put all the pieces in a nice big baking sheet with edges so they could keep track of everything (and make sure they don't throw anything from the package away until completely assembled).  The pieces themselves aren't numbered so don't detach them from the sprue until ready to use.  The pieces assemble kind of like pop beads and assembly took about an hour. Unlike a lot of models, the individual pieces on this kit were smooth edged with no points or barbs where they detached from sprue.The cape was chintzy and very disappointing.  Would have been very cool if they had included a moody, billowing fabric cape.Assembly was straight forward and logical using included directions (I had to use a magnifier to see some of the pieces to connect them so not only need to be able to handle tiny pieces but to see them :>).  The instructions are actually a huge colored diagram printed on nice glossy paper that provides strictly graphic instructions on how to assemble.  It breaks the project down into parts (head, torso, arms, legs, etc).  I much prefer written instructions but imagine most people would like the graphics (like legos) more.Once assembled, other than the cape and a lack of eyes and/or even eye slits in the mask, the overall effect of the model is definitely that of the Dark Knight himself.My favorite thing about this is that this crosses the line from model into action figure with nicely articulating joints which gives this toy much more playability.  Oh, and he has multiple left and right hand options so that he can use his weapons or fists as needed (for a child who is careful with toys this is great but for the average kid these are tiny pieces to keep up with).I think for the $20 price tag there should definitely be an awesome super cape so that when a child (or adult) is playing with Batman his cape is doing that awesome whooshy cape thing it does when he swoops in to save the day or kick some bad guy booty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JJGTLERQQB42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5KKSHO#wasThisHelpful","R1JJGTLERQQB42","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My grandson uses Latch bottles and likes them.  He sleeps with low level white noise in his room during naps.  He loves his pacifier.For these three reasons I thought this Latch pacifier with heartbeat clip would be a perfect match (a latch match perhaps?)Alas, it wasn't to be.Number One Grandson has used a different brand of pacifier from birth and we couldn't get him to adjust to the Latch even though he likes the Latch bottles--KIDS!!!The strap is very high quality and the clip holds very well.  It is durable and better made than most we've tried, but the strap needs to be a little bit longer.Rather than lulling him to sleep the ""heartbeat"" sound actually keeps him awake and leaves him with a confused face.  It sounds nothing like a heartbeat and should be replaced either with a more natural, soothing heartbeat sound or a GENTLE white noise.This has the potential to be another great Latch product with a few minor improvements.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QFSWEVWGOWID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTGNIYU#wasThisHelpful","R3QFSWEVWGOWID","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW! These placemats far exceed my expectations and are much more beautiful than the images on amazon.com.I'm a bit of a table linen addict and currently have 9 sets of placemats along with even more beautiful linen tablecloths.  My table never goes naked :>) and I consider myself well qualified to review table coverings.The color is a warm color that reads more of a golden toasty/straw tone than traditionally cooler/grayer toned taupe to me (I've never met a neutral I don't like so that isn't a problem for me!).  My walls are painted with Sherwin-Williams ""Latte"" and these mats look like they were custom made to complement the paint :>).What most impresses me is unlike many ""made in India"" woven products, the weave on these placemats is nice and tight and the finished edges are nice and even (not lumpy, uneven, unraveled like many).  The fibers themselves have a very soft, smooth, substantial feel and the woven mats lay nice and flat (again, not a given with many imported fiber products).Others have commented on the uneven knots on the fringes and/or the size of the knots.  I like the knots and fringe a lot.  The knotting is a proper size for such a large placemat and the variations in knot sizing give the mats a nice overall look.Speaking of size, these mats are HUGE, which is great!  I have a very large table, and oversized dishes.  It is very hard to find a placemat that will hold my dinner plates and glass, much less dinner plate, bread plate and glass.My set measured 23"" x 13-1/4"" and all six mats were within 1/8"" of those dimensions (another unusual quality ""plus"" for a made in India set).  The fringe was 1-1/2"" on each side leaving the body of the placemat at 20"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AMUQBVP2GE21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRI7QI#wasThisHelpful","R3AMUQBVP2GE21","A2WVF9ZQ068DN0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WVF9ZQ068DN0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"L-THEANINE is an amino acid analogue of the proteinogenic amino acids L-glutamate and L-glutamine and is found primarily in particular plant and fungal species. It was discovered as a constituent of green tea in 1949 and in 1950 was isolated from gyokuro leaves, which have high theanine content.[3] Appearance of the name ""theanine"" without a prefix is understood to imply the L-enantiomer, which is the form found in fresh teas and in some, but not all dietary supplements. The opposite D-enantiomer has far less studied pharmacologic properties, but is present in racemic chemical preparations, and substantially in some studied theanine supplements.As an analogue of glutamate and glutamine, the theanine in common preparations (teas, enantiomer supplements, etc.) is absorbed in the small intestine after oral ingestion; its hydrolysis is to L-glutamate and ethylamine and occurs both in the intestine and liver. It can also cross the blood–brain barrier intact, and register pharmacological effects directly.As for me, did I like the product? I did! All BRI products I have tested are of quality and have worked well for me. It helps relax me at night and get me to bed at a decent time.---------------------------DISCLOSURE---------------------------I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29107W3O8OV1C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X8AC51Q#wasThisHelpful","R29107W3O8OV1C","A2LB4FLRZG6CUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LB4FLRZG6CUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"-------------------------------REVIEW-------------------------------I've been been a big Netgear router fanboy for a long time, simply because they make quality stuff, but at a premium. I recently got the opportunity to review the TP-LINK AC3200 router, and I must admit I was thoroughly impressed on ever level, so much in fact that I gave away my Netgear Nighthawk R7000 router and kept the TP-LINK AC3200 router for my home.I've always loved the Netgear UI as its cleanly laid out, easy to navigate and just overall easy to use. I've used a lot of other brand routers from Cisco/Linksys, ASUS, DLINK, Ubiquiti, Netgear and now TP-LINK. The TP-LINK UI easily rivals Netgears for the #1 UI for a router that I have used, keep in mind that is a subjective opinion and nothing more. The TP-LINK UI is extremely clean, more so than Netgear in my opinion, it's very easy to navigate and use.The initial setup is very easy and it offers the more advanced setup for the more tech savvy individuals. With the 1GHz CPU the UI is very fast and powerful, no lag that I experienced. One of my favorite features of the AC3200 router is that it is TRI-BAND, you can have 3 simultaneous bands running, one 2.4GHz, and two 5GHz bands, they also have a ""Smart Connect"" feature which is awesome as it intelligently load balances each band and combines the SSIDs into one for a more seamless experience. It has 6 external antennas that actually work and provide very adequate range for medium to larger homes.I also like that this router offers a smaller footprint than I expected for an AC3200 router, much smaller than the Netgear Nighthawks series routers. The only real complaint that I have is that it doesn't have individual LEDs for each LAN port to let you know which individual LAN ports are connected, it only has one LAN LED so it lights up if one, two, three, or four ports are in use and doesn't light up if none of the ports are in use. I would much prefer individual LAN LED port lights myself.-------------------------------PRODUCT FEATURES-------------------------------- Tri-Band technology creates 3 separate Wi-Fi bands for connecting more devices to your network- Smart Connect helps devices run faster by assigning them to the best available channel- Combined 3200Mbps Wi-Fi for lag-free 4K video streaming and gaming across multiple devices- 6 high-performance antennas with Beamforming maximize coverage area and stability- 1GHz dual-core CPU and 3 co-processors handle simultaneous connections without interruption- Intuitive interface and Tether app for easy installation and network management- Industry-leading 2-year warranty and unlimited 24/7 technical support-------------------------------PROS-------------------------------- Awesome Range- Fast & Clean UI- Smart Connect- Good Warranty (2yrs)- 6 External Antennas- Smaller Footprint-------------------------------CONS-------------------------------- No Individual LED LAN Lights-------------------DISCLOSURE-------------------I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUMDAXYWJBM5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3XSSA#wasThisHelpful","RUMDAXYWJBM5C","A2LB4FLRZG6CUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LB4FLRZG6CUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you haven't tried Brainwavz headphones or earphones yet, I highly suggest you give them a shot for a few reasons.1. Price to Value ratio is off the charts2.

Their soundstage is wide, crisp, accurate and natural which is awesome for virtually every music genre. My only complaint would be that they have no mic/phone controls which a lot of earphones these days have and a lot of people want.

"---------------------------OVERVIEW---------------------------A large bottle, with 240 capsules is value, good for 120 days or 4 months if taken as directed per the instructions on the bottle.If you have bone and/or joint issues, I highly recommend taking Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM. I recently fractured my anterior tibial plateau, very painful and I cannot put any weight on my left leg for 6-8 weeks. My Orthopedist recommended me getting some Glucosamine/Chondroitin to use in conjunction with recovery and some Aleve. I've been taking the Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM for about 2 weeks now and my while my leg/joint is feeling better, while I cannot validate if the Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM is making and difference, I do believe it is.A recent study published in the Journal of Rheumatology, found glucosamine sulfate to have greater therapeutic effects on joint health than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Viva Labs' formula contains 750mg of glucosamine sulfate bound to potassium chloride, which helps to support the stability of glucosamine.The pills are very large and may be hard for some to swallow however.Highly recommended.---------------------------FEATURES---------------------------- CLINICALLY PROVEN JOINT RELIEF- SUPPORT HEALTHY CARTILAGE FORMATION- HEALTHY SKIN AND GLOWING COMPLEXION- PURIFY CELLS FROM THE INSIDE OUT- IMPROVE JOINT HEALTH NATURALLY---------------------------PROS---------------------------- Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM All in One- High Quality- Potent- No After-Taste- No Burping Up---------------------------CONS---------------------------- Semi-Large Capsules---------------------------DISCLOSURE---------------------------I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTB6QT6J3J3W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00STSUPCS#wasThisHelpful","R2UTB6QT6J3J3W","A2LB4FLRZG6CUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LB4FLRZG6CUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thought Madden 15 was bad, well Madden 16 is far worse for so many reasons it's sad. First, given it's a new game it's very buggy/glitches. The run game is virtually impossible due to the snail's pace that the Offense is in, it's like in some slow-mo, it's odd. The animations are far worse in 16 than 15 and they are executed extremely slow for some reason. Makes the game virtually unplayable.With the new catch modes, Possession Catch, YAC Catch, Aggressive catch, more and more pathetically, ridiculous improbable catches are made much more often (we can thank ODB JR for this).The game often crashes, loses sync, disconnects from servers.It's bad, keep playing Madden 15 for a few months until this fix all the pathetic issues this game is plagued with.**************************************UPDATED #1 - -9.14.2015**************************************I played Madden 16 this weekend and it had a patch (I assume) to download, it was over 700mb and it has fixed some issues, the running game has improved SOME, but the O-Line is still very slow, and the handoff is slower than it should be IMO. It's definitely better, The game is more playable at this moment, from last time I played, but still has some patching.**************************************UPDATED #2 - 10.23.2015**************************************The game has become better and more enjoyable with the new patches, roster updates, likeness updates, etc but ONLINE play is still plagued with issues, crashes, glitches, and cheaters which make it very frustrating to play online. I have attached pics of the most common online issues.STILL SEARCHING:When looking for an online game, it gives you a predicted time measurement it will take until it can place you into a game. RARELY is it accurate, I tend to wait much longer than expected, and YES MY NAT IS OPEN!STILL WAITING...:FAILED TO START GAMES:This happens a lot when trying to play, game just crashes.**************************************UPDATED #3 - 11.17.2015**************************************I still get a lot of FAILED TO START GAMES errors when I play online, which is what I mainly do, but after a few tries or rebooting the game, it usually works. Its rather annoying and I wish it was not an issue but it is, but nothing that completely ruins the game like the issues in the beginning.The game overall has improved since the patches and weekly (it seems) roster updates. Much more enjoyable and playable as well.

They work great outdoors or indoor, whether you're exercising due to their sweatproof (not waterproof) design or just wanting to listen to music.With Bluetooth 4.1 which is extremely nice and offers great sound reproduction for virtually all genres of music. They have good highs, mids, and lows without being overwhelming in any of those three areas. As an added bonus, they even include built-in mic to take phone calls hands-free. Very nice headphones/earphones.I am going to rate them 4-stars for now, just due to their build quality, while good, it's not great and I'm not sure how they will hold up over time while using them at the gym and such.

"---------------------------OVERVIEW---------------------------I've test and used various ""HD Tempered Glass"" screen protectors for the iPhone 6. The LaoHe Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector is a great protector. The quality of the tempered glass is very good while still maintaining a low profile which is very nice for those minimalist, such as myself. Overall, highly recommended product.When I installed the LaoHe Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector, I immediately grabbed a small marble, a quarter and a 50 Cent piece and was gutsy enough to drop them on to my iPhone (roughly 3 feet above my iPhone). My result? The The Tech Armor Apple iPhone 6 Premium Edge to Edge HD Clear Ballistic Glass didn't break or scratch. I was extremely impressed.While I wasn't gutsy enough to drop my iPhone on concrete or a hard floor, I was confident that even if I did (accidentally) the LaoHe Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector would hold up, if not give me peace of mind that my iPhone 6 screen wouldn't break/crack with it installed.

When I was given the chance to try out this bike pump I was excited because I needed a portable bike pump.The pump is crafted nicely and is of quality. It's made mostly of aluminum and plastic, it's extremely lightweight but also durable as I've dropped it several times already and it still functions nicely. Since the pump is so compact, it's very easy to mount and store on your bike itself or a backpack if you prefer.With these smaller pumps, it will take longer to inflate any tire, but the pump was easy to use, even my 8 year old daughter was able to inflate her 20"" tire in a few minutes with no issues.Overall a great portable pump so far, I definitely recommend it.--------------------------------SPECS--------------------------------- SIZE: 170mm (7 inch) fully closed, 275mm (10.5 inch) open- WEIGHT: 116g- VALVE: Reversible Presta & Schrader valve attachment - see instructions on how to switch between them- PRESSURE: 100psi maximum pressure- Accessories Included: Mounting bracket, Gas needle, Screw--------------------------------PROS--------------------------------- Priced Cheap- Small, Lightweight, Compact- Very Easy to Use- Easy to Store or Mount to Bike--------------------------------CONS--------------------------------- None so far--------------------------------DISCLOSURE--------------------------------I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZDX5058XTZ7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011L3LVNY#wasThisHelpful","R2ZDX5058XTZ7V","A2LB4FLRZG6CUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LB4FLRZG6CUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"--------------------------------OVERVIEW--------------------------------I think it's important, possibly critical to have a flashlight in every main room and bedroom in the house, possibly every single room in case of an emergency. I was excited to get a chance to have the XFIL flashlight for various reasons.First and foremost,  the XFIL flashlight has an adjustable focus zoom, while at 5 meters from object, the ""Zoom In"" position illuminates with a bright, precise focus. At 5 meters from object, the ""Zoom Out"" position illuminates 2000x larger diameter than ""Zoom In"" illuminating a much larger area which is great for virtually any situation at hand.The added colored ring that can change color can easily assist in identification in the dark if needed, especially in the event of an emergency. It also includes lanyard to easily attach to your belt, bag, or other equipment so you do not lose the flashlight.I like that is uses standard AAA batteries, as they are easy to find virtually at any store, they are easy to store in the home and can also be taken out of a lot of other devices if ever needed, such as remote controls, and such. AAA batteries allow this flashlight to be more versatile in my opinion.--------------------------------FEATURES--------------------------------- Energy-saving, ultra-bright, durable, lightweight, and compact all in one flashlight.- Suitable for camping and outdoor activity, navigating dark areas, working on vehicles, and quick illumination during power outages, emergencies, and survival situations.- Small size allows you to carry or store anywhere with ease.- Great to use while walking alone or with pets at night.- Includes lanyard to easily attach to your belt, bag, or other equipment.--------------------------------PROS--------------------------------- Price- Versatile- Changing Color Ring (for identification)- Quality: Durable & Strong- LED is bright w/ adjustable range- Can use AAA batteries (easy to find, buy, and store)- Dedicated ON/OFF Button- Small/Portable/Compact/Lightweight--------------------------------CONS--------------------------------- None so far--------------------------------DISCLOSURE--------------------------------I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJEPQ5HTW9PWQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DDM0N2#wasThisHelpful","RJEPQ5HTW9PWQ","A2LB4FLRZG6CUV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LB4FLRZG6CUV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am reviewing a paperback edition. Most/all of the other reviews seem to refer to the Kindle digital version. I got my hardcopy free at a Poetic Review event in Chinatown Los Angeles in June 2014. Thanks!The narrative is a dystopic view. Set in Shanghai, but not confined to it. A backdrop of news references trickles throughout the story, telling us of dire straits elsewhere in the world. The authors allude to a global recession brought on by a rampant capitalism. No doubt inspired by the recent and some would say ongoing Great Recession.Whether you agree or not with this, the story still makes compelling attention. The minimalist nature of the drawings and dialog leave much (if not most) to your imagination. Fill in by necessity. This style perhaps would not appeal to those used to the much richer illustrasting content of conventional cartoon magazines. But it seems to enhance the Shanghai noir.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGLQ58Y556Z3C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GQ121K4#wasThisHelpful","RGLQ58Y556Z3C","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book looks at a hitherto neglected field of architecture. Commercial buildings, and particularly for Los Angeles up to 1941. Nothing in the book is about the grand artistic buildings most often admired. But instead at how the utilitarian needs of retail merged with the rise of the car. In Los Angeles, the easy mild climate led to innovations in what was called a drive-in. Which is not the drive in of later years for showing movies.Instead, the drive-in was the mini-mall of its time. For a new mobile working and middle class to easily shop. The book has many photos of key buildings. The narrative explains how the drive-in was then succeeded by the supermarket. Fundamentally, by the 1940s, the new supermarkets were essentially the format we know them as today.If you live in LA, you may especially find neat the descriptions in words and images of intersections and neighbourhoods. The photos of buildings are all accompanied with a remark as to whether the buildings are still extent.There is a peccadillo. Many of the photos were taken by a person called ""Dick"" Wittington. But the photo credits keep repeating this, including his nickname. Tedious. Couldn't the author have shortened the credits, for clarity?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCOX9E7PUQ0YF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262621428#wasThisHelpful","RCOX9E7PUQ0YF","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A massive effort that can aid someone working in a Spanish and English chemistry context. I don't know Spanish. But I took chemistry as an undergrad. Neat how when I look at an English word listed here, its Spanish equivalent makes sense. And vice versa. In general, showing a common Latin root in the technical sphere.Note also that it is not just single words that you can look up. Common chemistry phrases are listed as keys also.What is strange is when I looked up English phrases related to semiconductor, I found entries for both 'semiconductor' and 'semi-conductor'. And for 'semiconductor laser' and 'semi-conductor laser'. Why list both with and without the hyphen? In English, the hyphen was largely discarded by the 1970s. It tends to appear only in articles prior.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LFYU6E91HGB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118237978#wasThisHelpful","R2LFYU6E91HGB7","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume has a stupendous amount of background on Heinlein and the science fiction culture he inhabited, and indeed helped craft. For this, you should be always grateful. We see that even for a successful writer, bills always loomed in an eternal treadmill.What is neat is some flesh on the backstories of the stories. Like how Tunnel in the Sky was originally called School in the Sky. But Heinlein acceeded to an editor's request to amend the title because few students would buy the original title. There is also a neat and by now well known anecdote that the main character is a Negro !! Not in so many words, but if you parse the narrative carefully, this becomes clear. Heinlein's way of tweaking the system.The paths of other major authors cross the pages. Apparently, one of the best known Star Trek episodes, The Trouble with Tribbles by David Gerrold, was a blatant imitation of an earlier Heinlein story. The biography says that Heinlein graciously declined to sue Gerrold, but makes clear that he had a strong case. What may grate is when Gerrold then goes on to exploit his Tribbles story with toy tribbles etc. In this, Heinlein comes off as perhaps a little too indulgent.Another anecdote is about The Mote in God's Eye by Niven and Pournelle. Perhaps their first major joint success. The book relates that they sent Heinlein a preprint. Which he then copiously critiqued, suggesting that they discard the first 30 pages or so and use a more gripping start to hold the reader's attention. Heinlein did commend that the Moties seemed like a genuinely alien race. He did not expect Niven and Pournelle to actually abide by his advice, based on his earlier extensive experience with other writers. But amazingly they did, to the extent of withdrawing their book from publication and doing a large rewrite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25H1TYZFY1VJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765319616#wasThisHelpful","R25H1TYZFY1VJ3","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The tone (spirit) of this book differs markedly from that of other technical books I commonly get. The author uses a very informal means of introducing the topic. Which is appropriate because Prezi is a very distinctive way of visually presenting material, where the latter can be text or graphics. In general, as you can see from the book, the material will have many instances of both.Prezi is shown as an infinite canvas. But you are advised to start by just focusing on 3 top level tasks - define the goal, message and audience. In itself, without recourse to using any computer package, thinking this way can be a great help when you start out and want to write down a talk that you will later give. Of course, this is not new to Prezi. Similar advice was available decades ago, when you might have had to do all this by hand, having no computer in sight.In a way, this is the power of Prezi. It takes you back to essentials. The computer is just a secondary tool. But using Prezi arrays the top level ideas and the lower level topics into a spatial arrangement on the canvas that is quick to grasp.A key aspect of Prezi is what they call frames. Where you can group the topics on the canvas into clusters. And then move these around, treating all the topics enclosed in a frame as one entity. This is a natural top down decomposition. Then when enough frames have been defined, you can make a path through these frames. The path is the presentation order.Scattered throughout the narrative are good pieces of advice for presentations. Like 'avoid large blocks of text'. Use images if possible, to engage the audience. And if you use drawings, keep them simple.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ASDGQ56LLYBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849699771#wasThisHelpful","R2ASDGQ56LLYBG","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Don't take the 'anime' in the title too literally. It is not restricted to the anime style of cartoons from Japan. Rather, Anime Studio is a simple framework within which to draw most any style of cartoons. The book can be used as a guide for the rank beginner in the basics. From writing down a first draft, which the text warns you is likely to be terrible, to making a storyboard. And these days, to providing audio sound track if your characters will speak.So it has to be noted that the cartoons here are typically not destined for celluloid, as in the 20th century. But more often meant for display in a web page. A major attraction is that the book shows how you as a beginner can affordably put together a professional looking composition.Anime Studio is stuffed with many easily learnt tools accessed via a rich GUI. Drawing of figures has been made as simple as perhaps possible.If you come from a background in graphics, especially with Photoshop, then many concepts will be familiar. Including the idea of layers. Anime Studio fully supports layers, with specialised tools like Transform Layer and Follow Path. Great time savers, and that is really what layering is all about.But the most important aspect of Anime Studio might be bone animation. So instead of a character being a raw set of pixels, it is a set of graphics with an underlying skeleton. By manipulating its bones, you can rapidly and intuitively animate the character. Looks easy to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R71HB93JXH7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1849699577#wasThisHelpful","R1R71HB93JXH7I","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very neat that the book immediately commences with a non-trivial real world application of two factor authentication. Stringer shows the reader that a useful technique for verifying a user can be easily done with your website ringing her phone. The most important context is for purchasing, when actual money is meant to change hands. The source code is only a few pages and you should probably read it carefully to see how Twilio's libraries enable the entire operation. The point is that the example will present the user with a form on the browser where she types in a username and phone number, presumably of a cellphone though it could also be a nearby landline. The browser is assumed to be showing on her laptop or desktop. The example makes a one time password which is then sent as a text message to the phone. She reads it and then types it into the browser.The second example of the first chapter is showing how to record a phone call. Where the recorded message can then be sent to an email address you designate. As with the first example, this leads to a foray into the Twilio Helper Library for PHP.Later chapters give other examples of course. But Stringer made good and I am sure very deliberate choices in the opening chapter to grab your attention. The early examples will be a propos to many sysadmins and developers of commercial websites. Overall, you can use this book to make a rudimentary but practical IVR [Interactive Voice Response] system. Essentially free in terms of software running on generic hardware. Whereas if you bought a commercial IVR hardware package, the cost can easily run into thousands of dollars. Granted, the vendors of those will affirm that their systems offer more options. True. But if you only need the basics, this book and Twilio might suffice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT5T0OLW0D64C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783550651#wasThisHelpful","RT5T0OLW0D64C","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I thought Ouya [I'm not going to capitalise it all] was a software engine; not being a hardcore gameboy. But it is hardware! Wow! So used to reviewing books on software that this makes a refreshing change. What the text suggests is that getting the Ouya gives you a leg up in developing games of professional quality. A hardware IDE. On top of this sits the Unity3D engine and the book takes you into coding with C#.The first chapter is really more important than in some other books, because it orients you in the Ouya environment. Where the store that you can browse for games does not list prices! Quickly the book explains that for a game to make it into the store, it needs at least one free element. Like free play credits.There is an immediate dynamic tension here. You after all are likely reading the book to want to code successful games. That people will pay money to play. So really seeing the game store with no prices is not exactly encouraging.Now for the game store, the book cautions that ""the games are often smaller and less expensive... because of the abundant indie presence"". What this translates to is that a typical game is simply not as impressive. The book does not come right out and say this, but reading between the lines, that is what you get. The indie developers [and you aspire to be one of them] just don't have the financial wherewithal to underwrite a sophisticated and complex game.The book is somewhat pitched towards a new programmer. Because in part it introduces object oriented programming as a new concept. And I am not really sure why they chose C# instead of java or C++. But that's not a big deal. If indeed you don't know any of those languages, learning C# will certainly help you if you have to migrate to the others.The game development environment explicated later in the book looks simple enough. Like using the IDE to pick a shader and then having the means via a GUI to vary the shininess and specular colour. Very easy and intuitive. Plus, learning Unity's classes greatly speeds up the coding of your game.The text takes you all the way through to submitting a game to the Ouya store. What it does not discuss is the top level decision about whether you want to deal with Ouya in the first place. Professionally, Ouya is likely not where the money is; not where the big time is. Just be aware of that, once you parse thru all the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU5XMUELO11HZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KH01KS4#wasThisHelpful","RU5XMUELO11HZ","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book might not serve well anyone seriously trying to get into the finance world by programming applications in Python. On a more optimistic note, the book might be better directed at an undergraduate who has read about topics like Black Scholes pricing of options. And who wants to quickly code some simple test programs. The back of the book says it is useful for practitioners. Nonsense. Practitioners in finance already have scads of far more complex programs for modelling.Each chapter of the book basically is a simple rendition of code for the chapter topic. Somewhat superficial. As another reviewer perhaps accurately observed, it is as though the author just went through Wikipedia and dragged out several finance topics and the starting equations. And then coded those into chapters.One good aspect is that the text describes how to use two standard Python modules, NumPy and SciPy. For numerical scientific and financial contexts. If you do end up using this book, you should absolutely learn how to use the routines in those modules. First, the modules have been extensively debugged and are being freely maintained. Second, you add more value for yourself by starting there rather than wasting your time recoding their routines. Though granted, an exception could be where you explicitly want to recode some of their routines as a learning experience for yourself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2SPNQA8G783/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783284374#wasThisHelpful","RN2SPNQA8G783","AG35NEEFCMQVR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AG35NEEFCMQVR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Is this a cautionary tale, a foray into the mind of a stalker? Or a reminder of the explosive nature of social media? The type of novel that becomes a guilty secret, You is compulsively readable until the great flood of voyeurism turns brackish and tainted, as irritating as a young woman’s careless neglect of her personal belongings or obliviousness to the smell of the garbage in the shoebox-sized apartment in which she lives, everything strewn with the detritus of a shamelessly narcissistic existence. This is the world of Guinevere Beck (who prefers to be called “Beck”), a college graduate living in school-sponsored housing while she pursues a writing program in New York City.It all begins when Beck walks into an East Village bookstore managed by Joe Goldberg, an attractive autodidact who has never gone to college, but easily holds his own in a literate, bantering conversation with Beck. Joe is an unapologetic sociopath who fixates on Beck, a flirt thriving on the attention of men that can’t help but flaunt her sexuality before a willing audience. Just another encounter with an attractive man becomes the catalyst of an obsession for Joe, whose interest, at first innocent, escalates into a pattern of behavior that grows from voyeurism to the infiltration of Beck’s social media, emails, tweets, Face Book posts, every aspect of her life available to the insatiably curious would-be lover. Joe knows they belong together, that it is just a matter of time, and carefully managed synchronicity, that will turn them into a couple.It is a sly and detailed seduction, a manipulation of people and circumstances to bring Beck and Joe together as lovers, Joe endlessly forgiving and understanding of Beck’s many flaws, the object of his passion yet to realize how perfectly suited they are for one another. Though Beck’s pursuit of an unworthy boyfriend tests the patience of her closest friends, Joe has contingency plans; when Beck’s wealthy, possessive girlfriend intrudes, Joe is prepared to wait for Beck to come to her senses. Joe can afford to be patient. He now has access to every minute detail of Beck’s life.In point of fact, the couple may be well matched, author Kepnes balancing Joe’s pathology with Beck’s overweening narcissism, social media the vehicle of their fated, albeit unhealthy love affair. As events accelerate and Beck moves closer to the circle of Joe’s arms, there are disturbing echoes of American Psycho, unburdened by the heavy-handed misogyny that marks that novel, Joe a predator strolling through a city of women enamored of technology, the land of “selfies” and self-obsession. This landscape is peopled with the young, no place for the elderly, save the retired owner of the bookstore Joe manages. Haunting, shocking or repellant, this is a tale for the times.

"The latest must-have for little shoppers-in-training, the Shopkins “Small Mart” has all the touches of a real supermarket experience for children 3 years and up. There’s a little shopping cart that rolls to the check stand, a check stand complete with basket storage, with moving parts and a chute to slide merchandise down before check out.One of a series, the Small Mart is made of bright colored plastic with the appropriate signage to make the experience as authentic as that in the grown-up supermarket. These toys are made for tiny fingers to play with, enjoy and maybe save in a plastic storage box to keep all the small parts together. Given the primary colors, this set is not just for girls, but can be used for boys as well, the perfect opportunity to teach little ones the etiquette of shopping and suggest ways to assist the adult shopper while becoming acquainted with the experience. While some might think such toys are too gender specific or limiting, they are wonderfully useful in training toddlers for new experiences, teaching desirable behavior when out in public and including them in the various aspects of shopping expeditions.

Well-designed and easy to clean, the bottom of the mechanism is dishwasher safe, easy to empty- and has the added advantage of use for storage of the chopped item when some is left over. The chopper makes cooking easier and faster. It is recommended to start with the slow speed before using the faster one, to get the feel of the chopper and how quickly it reduces an item to the desired amount, whether chopped onions or fresh fruit for a smoothie. I have been waiting for just such an item to add to my kitchen, compact, handy and able to do the little jobs I need in meal preparation.

"In Alaska, the remote village of Keelut is suffering famine that has turned the wilderness savage, children stolen from outside their cabins to slake the hunger of wolves. The winds howl with the mourning voices of those who cannot reclaim what has been taken in nature’s cruel order: “When kids are killed, the future dies.” Authorities avoid the village, knowing they will find no answers from those who resist intruders, take care of their own. All the more surprising then, when grieving mother Medora Sloane begs author Russell Core to help her find her six-year-old son, Bailey, or at least his bones for burial. Having written a book on wolves, Core has a deep affinity for their ways, their intelligence, unsure why this woman might think he could help, yet drawn by her need and his own flirtation with a place where death might come easily to a weary traveler.Knowing nothing of this place or these people, Core finds Medora a surprise, bright-haired and white-skinned, certainly an anomaly among the others. Sleeping on the couch in a tiny cabin where the boy’s empty boots are a reminder of his absence, Core cannot but be aware of the mother’s murmuring at night, her vigil by the window, her incantations to the moon. Medora’s husband, Vernon, is due to return any day from a tour of duty in the Middle East, his brutal reality in the shifting sands across the globe in stark contrast to the blinding snow that covers Keelut, portending a difficult, if impossible search, Russell dressed in Vernon’s hunting garb and boots.As anticipated, the journey proves fruitless, though Core barely escapes the snarling wolves he tracks in search of the boy. Near-frozen, exhausted, he returns to the village to find Medora missing, a shocking discovery at hand, one that brings the authorities streaming into Keelut, Vernon come home to a nightmare worse than the one he has lived on foreign soil. Not yet acclimated to the ways of civilization, Sloane’s reaction initiates a violent, brutal series of events, revealing a great chasm of fury, inconsolable grief and rage. Yet amid the chaos, the death, the author’s prose is stark, often arresting and compelling, capturing the unapologetic cruelty, the relentless demands of life and death in a place where the flesh of children fills the bellies of starving animals, where compassion is trampled under the boots of men.It is Giraldi’s ability to balance the extremes of place and emotion that imbues his novel with unexpected allegiances, from Russell’s courting of death in a land where it is easy to die to Medora’s motivation in asking for help, from Vernon’s friend Cheeon’s last stand against the breach of his fortress home to the love between Vernon and Medora and the death of their son. It is a tapestry woven tightly with ragged threads, the knotted string of impropriety and outrage, the blood red of carnage and the still-white of a snowstorm, a land that embraces the aberrant, the desperate and the brave, my own twisted hope joining the tangled mess, a hope that the guilty might escape, survive the devastation left behind.

"Though perhaps the least mysterious of French’s novels thus far, The Secret Place explores an unexpected complexity of character and theme, beginning with the anonymous postings by teenage girls on “The Secret Place”, a message board supplied by the exclusive St. Kilda’s Girls’ Academy. Though hopelessly archaic and rigid, the school is making an effort to circumvent the distraction and mischief of social media, replete with a strict headmistress, pious nuns and school uniforms. Certainly, the unsolved death of a young man from a neighboring academy, discovered on St. Kilda’s campus, has proven that crime can intrude even in the most controlled environment.During the summer break, angst over the tragic and brutal murder of Chris Harper has seemed to dissipate, only to erupt once more when fifteen-year-old Holly Mackey, marches into Dublin’s Cold Case squad room and hands a photograph she found posted on “The Secret Place” directly to Detective Stephen Moran, who treated her with dignity on a former case when Holly was a witness. The picture is made more cryptic by the cut-out words around the dead boy’s image: “I know who killed him.” The fact that Holly’s father is an established detective adds yet another level of complication as the novel unfolds over the course of one long, grueling day.French sets the stage for drama with two scenarios: a renewed police investigation by Dublin’s Murder Squad led by Detective Antoinette Conway; and the events at St. Kilda’s that lead to Chris’ death. In alternating chapters, past and present, the investigation- during which Detective Moran makes his play for a place on the Murder Squad- and the evolution of a murder, the author creates a contrast between the relentless push to force the girls to reveal the truth and the slower, often claustrophobic examination of the intricacies of friendship among four students, Holly, Selena, Julia and Rebecca and their nemesis, popular and powerful Joanna Heffernan and her clique (nicknamed “the Daleks”), a conflict of values and character in which Chris Harper becomes a central figure.Equally fascinating is the relationship of Moran to the only female on the Murder Squad, a prickly, tough detective who demands the best from him and challenges his private ambitions in unexpected ways. The juxtaposition of these diverse elements, the renewed and more rigorous investigation and the truth behind the murder is brilliantly facilitated, the reader intent on learning the secrets behind Harper’s death, then thrust into the agonizing territory of teen loyalties, friendships and betrayals, the inevitable, shattering cracks when life intrudes. French never misses a beat.

"As jewel-like as the exquisitely made rooms of a miniature house replicating the townhouse where Nella Brandt has come to live with her new husband in 1896 Amsterdam, Burton captures the claustrophobic atmosphere of a marriage rife with secrets in a city where “the austerity and oppressiveness of Calvinism converges with an obsession of wealth and acquisition”. While the marriage of successful merchant Johannes Brandt and Petronella Oortman has yet to be consummated, the new bride has left all behind in her rural village, prepared to make a new life with a husband she has yet to know. And in the same manner that hypocrisy is veiled behind the fine mannerisms of successful people, Nella learns the extent of the subterfuges hidden behind the closed door of the townhouse, the urgency of showing a placid face to society while riddled with uncertainty and fear.Having learned well the danger of having nothing to do, Johannes gifts his new bride with the cabinet-sized replica, hoping she will be content filling its rooms, albeit sleeping alone while Johannes works in his study or at the office, learning that “her husband speaks in all tongues but that of love.” Left to her own devices, Nella faces daily the other inhabitants of the house: Marin, her strict, disdainful sister-in-law, a spinster who abhors frivolity and waste; Cornelia, an overly-familiar maid; and most shocking, Otto, Johannes’ manservant and the first dark-skinned man Nella has ever met. The strange trio keeps the house running smoothly so that Johannes is free to add to their fortune with his trading skills, all of them adept at keeping secrets and sweeping scandal into corners. But eventually Nella stumbles upon a scenario that rips the blinders from her eyes. Meanwhile small, tidy packages arrive from a miniaturist Nella has contracted to make items for the doll’s house in a small rebellion against Marin’s rules and the abject loneliness of her daily existence.As Nella’s innocence is stripped away and Johannes travels abroad, pursuing buyers for a warehouse full of sugar threatening to rot, she cannot decide if the craftsman of these tiny replicas is a prophet of the future of a sorcerer intent on the destruction of the family, occurrences at home replicated with eerie prescience as though they are all being watched. Confined behind the walls of an unhappy, even disastrous marriage, an uncertain fate looms over this small group, the bustling world around them intolerant of weakness, sin or financial ruin. Nella learns that everything she thinks is based in misperception, challenged to face reality, to embrace this strange and broken “family” and move forward. In prose that perfectly captures late 17th century Amsterdam, both the tiny, life-like dolls and the human characters confront private weakness, venality, courage and hidden passions, The Miniaturist is a small gem, where insight and compassion animate the lives of characters caught in a dark tide of history, where salvation lurks in the love for one another that illuminates their hearts.

"Much as I love the trend, fashion scarves present a particular problem when deciding how best to store them. Smooth and unwrinkled when purchased, a few weeks in a drawer can make this easy accessory looking unkempt. There are some scarves that are meant to look scrunchy or wrinkled and for those a drawer is fine, but for the smooth ones with fringe, only hanging will keep them looking fresh. That’s where this product offers a solution to ready-to-wear accessories without taking up a lot of space. Each Interdesign Horizontal Scarf Holder holds at least four long scarves, but is not limited to that number. In addition, the wider hanger keeps the unit from drooping to one side or another, spilling scarves on the closet floor. For those with space issues looking for storage solutions, this product answers the need to keep closets orderly while clothing and accessories remain easy to reach. It may have other uses as well for similar items, but for anyone with too many scarves and no place to hang them, this is a perfect, simple solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39FFJVZZ7G8HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I2HXXUW#wasThisHelpful","R39FFJVZZ7G8HW","A2MF2QVSCUI27G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF2QVSCUI27G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is nothing less attractive in a kitchen than a well-used bottle of dish soap and sponge, so  I had great plans for this product. From what I could tell in the onscreen image, this combination soap and sponge holder is perfect for tidying up a messy problem and keeping kitchen clutter to a minimum. I was surprised that the soap dispenser, while as pictured, was larger than expected. And what I thought was a metal lid/dispenser was instead made of plastic. (In my experience, these tops don’t hold up well to daily use, the finish gradually chipping away.) So, contrary to expectations, this dispenser will not suit my needs. That’s not to say someone else won’t like it- it certainly does what it says and is sturdy and well-made (but for the faux-metal top). So overall, this product is quite acceptable and doesn’t put on airs. I guess my kitchen countertop needs are a bit precious, my kitchen harboring pretensions (even with its outdated tile countertops and lack of stainless steel appliances).

"At first appearance, this product seems to be a worthwhile purchase. But once the product is plugged in, its poor design is apparent.

If the fingers burn so readily, what damage might this wand do the hair? Second surprise: the curls are very loose. It would take an hour to do a full head of hair, even medium length.Frankly, I am surprised that a company with Remington’s reputation wouldn’t do more product research before putting this item on the shelf.

"The minds of teens are fertile, often given to catastrophic thinking (“If I can’t have a certain boyfriend/ coveted pair of shoes/ tickets to a concert, I’ll die.”) and the need to belong. Girlfriends Gabby, Deenie and Lise, all students at Dryden High, are no exception- until the day when Lise is taken by a strange fit in class. When the others learn that Lise has been taken to the local hospital in critical condition, they eagerly indulge in rampant speculation about the cause of her hospitalization, every opinion exacerbated and embellished on social media. Lise has become a male magnet since morphing into a young woman with the curves to turn admirers’ heads, occasioning much gossip and not a little envy from her peers. Gabby, one of the trio, is so stylish that a loyal following emulates her style of dress and affectations, Deenie’s friend since their first days in grade school. Of the three, Deenie Nash is the most level-headed, living with her brother Eli, a hockey star and her father, Tom, a teacher at the school, their mother having left the family for greener pastures, taking her children for random visits, essentially unreliable in a pinch.As Lise’s unknown medical condition becomes the fulcrum for a crisis built of rumor and fear, the school is slowly infected, one by one, other girls falling prey to strange fits, like the one that delivered Lise to an unknown fate. The template is set, the school-and social media- a breeding ground for rumor, the fits feeding on one unsuspecting teen after another, all of them girls. While the school attempts to quell the concerns of parents and students, both medical and police officials arrive to ascertain what exactly has happened at Dryden High, parent meetings a source of conflict and demands for action, Lise’s mother hiring a lawyer, everyone frantic to stop the epidemic that has devastated their town. And while her two best friends have fallen prey to the mysterious ailment, unfortunately Deenie has not, a source of gossip for those who wonder why. Shades of the Salem witch trial, when a group of hysterical young women garnered attention for their antics, claiming possession by the devil and naming witches among them.Clearly, Abbott is mining this hysterical event for her modern day cautionary tale about the susceptibility of teen girls and the dramatic excesses that come so naturally to them. Yet there is more at work than happenstance in this novel, which examines the tenuous relationships of girls at this critical time in their lives, many of those involved coming from fatherless homes and various dysfunctional situations, real malice at the heart of it, albeit with less drastic intentions. Narrated from various perspectives, Deenie’s, Eli’s, Tom Nash’s, etc., much time is spent in that bewildering landscape where girlhood clashes with impending womanhood, betrayals and gossip the tools of the trade. Though it all makes sense as the novel winds to a close, I found the plot tedious and too often overwrought, marketed for a broader audience but clearly most appropriate for young adults, who will find this topic relevant and eerily familiar. For this demographic, the young adult, it makes perfect sense, a chilling tale for the right reader. For others, not so much.Luan Gaines/2014,","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZG2QF1P14DZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316231053#wasThisHelpful","RZG2QF1P14DZT","A2MF2QVSCUI27G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF2QVSCUI27G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Burley’s first thriller starts out with a harrowing chase through the woods of Wintersville, Ohio, a boy pursued by a killer who ravages and mutilates the victim’s body. Beyond the outrage and repulsion of authorities who discover the victim, the town is horrified that such a thing could happen in their community. Given the brutality of the attack, officials are determined to find the monster that would inflict such damage on another human being before more victims suffer the same fate. Without knowing the identity of the victim, anguished parents await the return of their students from local schools, frantic to have their children safe at home. Among them are medical examiner Ben Stevenson and his wife Susan, who have moved their boys, Joel and Thomas, from Pittsburgh to avoid the stresses of big city life. Grateful to know their older son, Thomas wasn’t the body found in the bloody snow, the grateful couple cannot help but imagine the grief facing the parents of the dead boy. After a call from the Chief of Police, Sam Garston, Ben heads to the coroner’s office to receive the tattered remains of the killer’s prey.Burley sets the tenor of his mystery from the start, the savage brutality of the crime, the medical examiner’s empathy for both victims and those left to mourn them, a father relieved that his family is saved and a member of a community shocked to the core. With only a few peeks into the mind of the killer, the author focuses primarily on Stevenson’s reactions and how the case impacts his wife and family, the grueling examination causing haunting nightmares as he struggles to imagine the savagery of the perpetrator. His fear affects the family, as Ben tries to limit Thomas’s nighttime excursions, causing rebellion and resentment on the home front. But when Monica Dressler is attacked after a local party, a member of Thomas’s own social group, the horror strikes closer to home. Authorities are obsessed with finding the perpetrator, Ben in the middle of the investigation and noticing cracks in the domestic harmony he has counted on at home.Between the details of the investigation and Ben’s concerns at home, Burley creates a picture of a beleaguered town and its fearful inhabitants, a man surrounded by the realities of mortality and the problems of parenting two boys with a suddenly less communicative wife. From one clue to another, one suspect to another, the search is futile for the overworked detectives, the tension more palpable over time. Burley finishes off his tale with an unexpected turn of events that is both unpredictable and nearly as horrifying as the murder in the opening pages. He doesn’t pull any punches, either in detail or his protagonist’s depth of emotion and distress, from the first autopsy to the final pages. For a first novel, Burley has written a fearless foray into the stuff of nightmares, the kind that never end.

"Stone's drama revolves around the impetuous behavior of the brilliant and beautiful Maud Stack, a student and a New England college who is deep in the throes of a love affair with her mentor, Professor Steven Brookman. Unused to rebuffs, Maud has thrown herself at the man who is in thrall to her intelligence and hubris, her unique combination of brains and beauty irresistible to a man who has dabbled in infidelity with other professors, but never tasted of the forbidden fruit, a student. Oblivious to Brookman's warnings of the imminent return of his wife and daughter from a visit to family in Canada, Maud has fashioned a future for them, shutting out reality in her determination. Flitting through campus from one class to another, Maud and her roommate Shelby, navigate the throngs of homeless who wander the campus, detour around the haranguing pro-life picketers waving placards of dead babies. Infuriated, Maud writes an article for the college newspaper, excoriating the picketers, annihilating their beliefs with vicious irony, Maud leaves her article to Brookman's critique, which never happens, in spite of frequent calls from Maud.Maud's calls go unanswered while Brookman ruminates on how best to end the affair, preoccupied with his wife's return and rationalizing his behavior. Furious at his refusal to answer his calls, Maud demands an answer, only to learn the truth that Brookman wants the romance to end. Brokenhearted, Maud escapes to New York, where her widower father, ex-cop Eddie, faces a daily struggle with emphysema and a lifetime of regrets, Maud the only star in his heaven. Burying her sorrows in drunkenness, Maud is in an agony of rage, returning to campus in the midst of the furor that has arisen from her article, including death threats. But all is a blur as Maud stakes out Brookman's home, intent on calling him out. Pain and outrage begets tragedy as the confrontation escalates, a crowd gathers and a young woman's life is extinguished. Deceptively simple, the central drama is infused with the broader complications of a society compromised by intolerance, the supporting characters adding more layers to what becomes a microcosm of the larger world: the abundance of the homeless and mentally ill; the ideals of youth clashing with the inflamed passions of pro-life activists; a father's helpless outrage at the loss of his daughter; an unfaithful man's useless guilt after the fact.Stone's supporting characters allow the broader discussion of events, from an historical, practical and cultural perspective, the weight of religion in public controversy, the tendency to extremes instead of compromise, the certainty (sanctity) of beliefs in conflict with those who reject ideology, from contemporary Roman Catholic scandals to a mission in South America that slid into fanaticism, terror and blood sacrifice, atavistic urges still simmering years later. Pulling all of this into a cohesive narrative is one of Stone's particular skills, his work delving beyond the surface of events to cause and effect, the impact of religious belief in the course of history, the conflict between changing mores and morality. Maud's short life and ugly death, her ill-fated romance, are but a moment in the vast canvas of a society unable to make peace with its differences, a thoughtful and provocative novel reminding me why I have missed his writing.

"Detective Chief Inspector Andy Gilchrist of Scotland's St. Andrews Division of the Constabulatory's Crime Management Department, is consumed by a mystery that melds past and present in a cycle of imminent threat and long-buried secrets when the skeleton of a long-dead young woman is discovered in an excavated grave. Dated thirty-five years earlier, the time frame coincides with the death of Gilchrist's brother, the victim of a never-solved hit and run accident. Mourning the death of his remarried ex-wife and struggling with difficult relationships with both his children, Andy avoids the problems of his personal life through a case that taxes both memory and instincts. Given the macabre circumstances of the discovery, the unidentified remains create a high-profile nightmare for authorities, the pressure building on Andy as he interviews familiar faces from the past and tries to recreate the conditions of the murder. At the same time, an unexpected- and unwelcome- clue leads Gilchrist to look into his brother's death, fearful that the two are somehow related.Muir captures the essence of time and place, a society inevitably changed by the passage of time, old secrets long-buried and threatening to undo the reputations of those who once knew the young woman. The bones identified as belonging to Kelly Roberts, Gilchrist travels to America to interview the girl's mother. But he is working against time, in the sights of a nemesis that would use any misstep to bring Andy down. Then there is the bizarre appearance of author/psychic Gina Belli, who pushes her way into the care in the guise of writing a book about Andy's cases, hovering on the periphery with insights and dire warnings that serve to unnerve an already overburdened detective. The plot moves forward, potential suspects falling into place, though time has muddied critical evidence and Andy's pursuit of the hit-and-run driver puts him in further jeopardy. A believable and empathetic character, Muir's Andy Gilchrist has all the right instincts and just enough human flaws to make him an interesting and effective protagonist.

"In an ongoing experiment with alternative history, Anderson posits the scenario of a son born to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, William (Henry IX), who has recently attained the age of eighteen. Chafing against his advisors, particularly the heavy hand of his uncle George Boleyn, Duke of Rochford, who bears the title of Lord Protector, William seeks to prove himself equal to the demands of kingship. As in the first book of the trilogy (The Boleyn King), political intrigue is rife, from those who seek to replace William on the throne with Mary Tudor and provide proof of his less-than-royal birth to the usual strife between Protestant and Catholic factions in England. The characters are familiar, their dramas exacerbated by William's willfulness and refusal to listen to advice, even from his best friend, Dominic. The foursome of the first novel is still intact"" William, his sister Elizabeth, Dominic and Minuette, who was raised with the Tudor children and nurtures a secret love for Dominic. Robert Dudley hovers around the periphery of the group, enamored of Elizabeth, albeit burdened by the accusation of treason against his father.Complicit in a dangerous plot to unseat William in The Boleyn King, Minuette is privy to the plots afoot, unafraid to pursue her own investigations, even though her behavior puts her in danger. Unfortunately, a situation has developed among the four friends, William planning behind closed doors what he dare not admit in public, drawing both Dominic and Minuette into complicity despite their advise to pursue the expected course for the good of the kingdom. Once more, Minuette is caught up in the unfolding political drama, as Anderson expands the political landscape with new characters that reflect historical reality. Though well-plotted and fluidly written, it is difficult to acclimate to the alternative circumstances of the author's premise, or to invest fully in a novel that has no basis in fact. For lovers of historical fiction, it is an entertaining diversion, though built on a what-if that didn't.

"Trivia for one reader is a feast for another. Nissley's A Reader's Book of Days is filled with the arcane and the fascinating, a dreamer's treasure hunt to inspire a return to a favorite author in this literary companion. Nissey- eight-time Jeopardy! champion and former bookseller- captures the lives of authors in diaries and letters, quotations and details, an almanac that expands beyond the usual boundaries to encompass personalities, events and human reactions. An example: ""April 15th wasn't just the day that Robinson Crusoe was published, Henry James was born and Edward Gorey died. It's also the day that Walt Whitman mourned the death of Lincoln...and Thomas Higginson received four poems from a woman named Emily Dickenson..."" Such is the charm and fascination of this remarkable collection of days, ideas, accomplishments, thoughts, memories and anecdotes. The joy of discovery is experienced in the manner an individual reader approaches the book, whether at random, seeking a particular date, say a birthday, or choosing a favorite name from the index ""the historic and the humdrum"".Nissley harbors another ambition in this tome, stories from the fictional lives of characters along with their writers, a mix of fact and fiction, where actual events occur, as do fictional events in novels, an ambitious undertaking, but one that adds yet another layer to the collection.

"What do you get when you mix wealth, opportunity, the pressure to excel and the labyrinthine corridors of new technology? Sometimes, murder. When middle school dean and ex-cop Raymond Donne attends the funeral of Douglas Lee, found fatally stabbed under a bridge in Brooklyn, he is at a loss to explain the tragic trajectory of this student's short life, the case currently being treated as a drug-related killing, not a high priority in Williamsburg. Sympathetic to the boy's distraught mother, who begs him to do an article on his former student to keep the pressure on law enforcement, he agrees. With a high-profile uncle in an important position in the department, Donne's recent exploits in another case have inspired a warning not to interfere in police business since he's no longer on the force. Meeting with reporter Allison Rogers at the crime scene the next day, Donne is surprised to see Detective Dennis Murcer there as well, a cop with whom he has some personal history. Murcer is cordial, but guarded, reiterating that Raymond should leave the investigation to the authorities.Donne has two problems at this point: an inability to say no to the dead boy's grieving mother and the innate curiosity of a detective no longer on the force after a serious injury. Despite Murcer's warning, Allison and Raymond are sympathetic to Mrs. Lee, who continues to ask Donne for more favors, all of which draw him deeper into the mystery of Dougie's death, Allison a willing co-conspirator. Frustrated with the lack of progress, Donne does exactly what he was told not to, with predictable results, unanswered questions which he pursues when he's not putting out fires for his students as dean of the middle school. O'Mara has created a believable character, sympathetic toward his Williamsburg students, easily integrating with a community often at odds with law enforcement, habitué of a local cop bar and attracted to reporter Allison Rogers. At odds with Lee's attorney uncle and his own uncle on the force, Raymond persists on Mrs. Lee's behalf because he doesn't believe Dougie is guilty of any crime, especially when another classmate dies.O'Mara drives his novel toward an unexpected conclusion, with a denouement that goes far beyond Raymond's expectations, a contemporary take on events that adds another level of menace to an already thrilling ride, tightly-plotted, with unexpected twists and well-developed characters. Raymond Donne is likely to cross the divide between new career and the old again, regardless of consequences in the right circumstances, a protagonist with a lot of adventures ahead. I look forward to enjoying them all.

"Phillips has performed an extraordinary feat in Quiet Dell, the reimagining of a horrific murder spree in 1931 West Virginia that begins in the Chicago home of widow Asta Eicher and her three children, Annabel, Hart, and Grethe, literally inhabiting her characters through the Chicago-based reporter, Emily Thornhill, who follows the arrest of the killer, Harry Powers (AKA Cornelius Pierce) through his arrest, trial and eventual hanging. The story takes on the ambiance of a Depression-era tragedy, from the outraged reactions of the public to the actions of law enforcement, the prevailing style of journalism and the values that define acceptable social behavior. Certainly, Mrs. Eicher has few options after his husband’s premature death. Despite the generous intentions of her boarder and friend, Charles O’Boyle, Asta corresponds with a gentleman of means, Cornelius O. Pierce, who offers marriage and a home in West Virginia with her children. Within weeks, the little family is dead. The case comes to light after a similar disappearance, that of Dorothy Lemke, all the bodies gruesomely discovered, the murderer apprehended.Phillips skillfully describes the desperation of a widow with three children to raise and no resources; O’Boyle, the boarder who loves the family; Annabel, the fanciful youngest girl who writes plays and draws pictures; and the family dog, Duty, silent witness to the tragedy.  She imagines the appeal of a chivalrous man met through lonely-hearts correspondence, the children gathered from the home in haste to join their mother; the struggle on a rain-soaked country road, a cruel and violent ending. Emily Thornhill is assigned the shocking case for her newspaper, joined by journalist Eric Lindstrom, expenses paid by banker William Malone. These characters come together in another plotline, one inextricably tied to the Eichers and Harry Powers, from his arraignment to the trial that examines the fate of the family and that of Dorothy Lemke, Powers posturing and adamant, claiming his innocence.Of another time and place, these murders could have easily been exploited, details milked for avid consumption by a curious public, but the author creates such a sympathetic scenario, couched in the sensibilities and particularities of the 1930s, that Asta Eicher’s emotional state, her childish belief in the promises of a stranger is believable, as are the obedient children who follow the directions of a man their mother has told then to trust. Believable as well, is the relentless trajectory of Emily Thornhill as she follows her story to the end, speaking for the dead, battling with her own reactions to the nightmare that unfolds in the courtroom. Emily is a modern woman who will face daunting challenges, embrace the opportunities that come her way and confront the killer, clutching the little dog that belonged to the children in her arms. Phillips captures the essence of the era perfectly, from the emotional tenor of the principal characters to the historic details that bring the events to life, nuanced social commentary adding sophistication to the novel, Thornhill bridging the territory between a lonely widow’s foolish expectations and the demands of the journalistic community for accurate reporting, as well as interacting with law enforcement as sources for material. Phillips enters the dark landscape of the murders, yet fashions beauty from that ugliness, empathy for the lost and hope for those left to find a place in a world sometimes filled with monsters.

"""Back in the day"", girls with curly hair had to resort to an ironing board and an iron to achieve what we take for granted to day. That said, the Andis Titanium 450 Flat Iron is a modern-day answer to an age-old dilemma, a good starter item, described as safe to use without burning or damaging the hair. Though it is not a top-of-the-line item in terms of expense, it provides the expected features, and a few more: titanium to preserve the integrity of the hair and seal the hair cuticle: 20 heat settings, up to 450 degrees; a clamp style to hold hair tightly; a swivel cord to avoid tangling; dual voltage; and an automatic shut-off.The titanium plates are flat, not curved, so there is a possibility that hair can get caught along the sides of the plates. And while the heat dial can be raised or lowered, the numbers on the dial do not indicate the degrees of heat, nor is the dial lighted. Because of this, an automatic shut-off feature is even more critical. This product is serviceable, but like other such styling aids, an acquired skill, to avoid over-heating or burning the hair. (I would suggest a styling spray to protect the hair when using any heated styling aid.) A bit clumsy for smaller hands, it will take some practice to become adept at using this flat iron, to become familiar with its weight and ease of handling- or not. While this flat iron is acceptable overall, I am not impressed with its quality or design features. It has no great flaws, but neither is it an item I will use daily.

"Provocative playwright Neil LaBute brings brother and sister, Bobby and Betty, together on a stormy night at a remote cabin, where Betty is cleaning out a tenant's effects before the place can be rented again. Despite the acrimony that has plagued both their youth and adult years, it is Bobby that Betty turns to for help, rather than her husband, Bruce. The tension between the siblings is clear from the moment Bobby arrives at the cabin, unable to resist the barbed jabs that have defined their relationship. While Betty is now a professional, a successful college professor, her teen-aged reputation was both sordid and memorable. Bobby, a carpenter, has accomplished little, a shabby history of two divorces tainted by domestic violence, his chronic use of expletives in conversation reflecting his general disillusionment with life. Sporadically attending the task at hand, sorting books and other items, brother and sister engage in repartee that segues from sarcastic to contentious, the years falling away in shared remembrance of past issues, the crux of Betty's present endeavor revealed as Bobby feints and parries, pushing his sister to finally tell the unembellished truth.With a surgeon's precision, LeBute ushers this modern-day Hansel and Gretel into the dark center of the forest, a masterful dance between characters who share a history but not the same values, the scars of youth exposed as the younger brother demands a quality of honesty that Betty, a practiced liar, energetically resists. There are moments of sincerity, of empathy, others of rage and frustration, the weather outside accentuating the storm inside, a visceral tension that can only be resolved when all pretenses are stripped away. LeBute's Preface is fascinating and informative, for his remarks on character and the plot device that injects the story with its particular sense of intimacy, an intuitive quest for truth: ""Sometimes I can't tell if I'm running towards the safety of the forest's edge or deeper into its center."" This is, indeed, a forest dark and deep, the harboring of secrets and lies and the bright light of truth.

"Sanford brings Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension agent Virgil Flowers back for another adventure, this time with the added flavor of international intrigue: a precious artifact has been stolen from a dig in Israel, the thief returning home to Mankato, Minnesota, to conduct a bidding war, the stolen item, an inscripted stele, to go to the highest bidder. Elijah Jones, dying from terminal cancer, has carefully planned his crime, returning safely home only to be followed by the converging interested parties, none of whom plans to leave without the bounty. Busy on site in tracking down a counterfeit limber ring headed by the curvaceous and intriguing ""Ma"" Nobles and her sons. With more than a passing interest in Ma, Virgil, a bit of a ladies' man, is not thrilled when his boss, Lucas Davenport assigns him the case, beginning with meeting a representative of the Israel Antiquities Authority who has come to return the artifact to its rightful home.An eclectic cast of characters assembles in search of the artifact, Rev. Jones managing to stay off the radar of anyone hoping to confront him or take the stele, though his daughter, Ellen is strongly suspected of abetting her father's movements. Virgil, meanwhile, is busy running down various leads and the interested parties who have suddenly arrived in Mankato, from Tag Bauer, a TV journalist, to a Texan interested in documenting the find, not to mention a renegade Mossad agent, Faraj Awad, a young Lebanese Arab with dreams of becoming a pilot, the fearsome ""Turk"", agents of Hezbollah and assorted thugs hired to act as muscle. Not to be outdone, Ma Nobles manages to insert herself into the drama. The chase continues, Jones always one step ahead of the pack on his tail, Flowers attempting to arrest Jones before lives are lost. He is not entirely successful.While Flowers seems a more light-hearted reincarnation of the iconic Lucas Davenport, Sandford isn't as demanding of this protagonist, except in matters relating to the job. In that respect, Flowers is a dedicated agent, albeit a bit of a rule breaker, like his mentor. Considerable tongue-in-cheek humor abounds, as with the charming, if misguided Faraj Awad, including a plethora of references to Ma Nobles' physical attributes, blunting the potential for edge-of-your seat thrills in the crime drama. Good `ol boy Virgil Flowers, ladies' man and dedicated agent, lopes more easily through mayhem and periodic violence, but the novel loses the momentum of Davenport's hard-edged approach to cases.

"McFarland has penned a truly frightening novel set in Australia, where Ruth Field, seventy-five, is spending her waning years at the seaside cottage where her husband Harry retired and died five years ago. Ruth is content in her isolation, save for the occasional nightmare she has of a tiger prowling her home. She realizes the tiger is a figment of her imagination, but considers it her ""consequential visitor"", perhaps a portent of something to come. Whole afternoons drift by in the contemplation of the ocean; her actions habitually ritualized, a task begun after four waves crest, for example. To be sure, her mind is not as acute as it once was, but she is proudly independent, content in her solitude. Raised in Fiji as the daughter of missionaries, Ruth is a product of her upbringing, unassuming, reluctant to make demands of others. Change arrives in the larger-than-life person of Frieda Young, who greets Ruth in the Fijian manner, announcing she has been sent by the government as a carer on a temporary basis, to assess Ruth's needs.Frieda invades Ruth's solitude with brash energy and an air of inevitability, making subtle changes in routines, sometimes beneficent and wildly enterprising, others cajoling and bullying to gain Ruth's cooperation. By turns affronted by the stranger's presence and happy for the company, Ruth adapts to Frieda's moods, which change as rapidly as her hair color. Dropped off each morning by her brother, George, in his taxi, Frieda's hours expand to three, as she takes over Ruth's shopping, cleaning, preparing meals. Soon Ruth cannot imagine her home without Frieda in it, the carer consistently unpredictable, either solicitous or punishing. It is at this point that Ruth's nightmare seems significant, her private world invaded by a woman who is either helper or predator, their symbiotic relationship impossible to deconstruct, though there are moments of clarity in Ruth's confusion. McFarlane captures perfectly the terrain of aging, the weaknesses of the body and the vulnerabilities of an elderly woman living alone. Ruth is often confused, needing assistance, grateful for Frieda's strong arms and fearlessness. McFarland perfectly contrasts Ruth's interior life, the graceful unfolding from youth to old age, replete with memories and future hopes with the terror that commences with Frieda's arrival and the recurrence of the nightmare. It will leave you reeling.

"The world literally seems to turn on its axis for those caught in the maelstrom of the Mississippi Flood of 1927, when the great river overruns its banks, decimates man-made levees and inundates homeowners with floodwater. It is a massive disaster on a scale the federal government has yet to significantly alleviate for those suffering the loss of homes, lives and futures. But beyond the expected trauma of the disaster, there are saboteurs who, for financial or political reasons, create further chaos, dynamiting vulnerable areas of the levees. Hohnob, Mississippi, is on the path of destruction, a hotspot for bootleggers, who profit handily from the Volstead Act as government agents roam the countryside in search of illegal stills. The land already filled with homeless folks scavenging for supplies and teams of people sandbagging against the river's rise, special agents Ted Ingersoll and Ham Johnson are assigned by none less than Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover to pose as engineers while trying to locate two missing revenuers last seen near Hobnob.Against this chaotic setting, the team of Franklin and Fennelly posit a two-pronged drama of characters on a collision course. After finding an orphaned baby at a crime scene, the soft-hearted Ingersoll decides to find the child a home. To that end, when the partners separate near Hobnob, he trusts the advice of a local woman, delivering the infant to Dixie Clay Holliver, a young woman who has lost her firstborn. Relieved of his precious burden, Ingersoll has more trouble forgetting his encounter with Dixie Clay, a circumstance that causes him no end of complications, both in the investigation and establishing his priorities. Dixie's husband, Jesse, is the man behind the most successful moonshine in the region, a man with no scruples and a plan to move on to bigger and better things.It's always tricky when authors combine efforts: Franklin has a solid reputation as a novelist; Fennelly as a poet. The transitions between the two points of view are sometimes successful, sometimes not, but the authors use the impetus of the plot to keep the action moving forward, filling in the backgrounds of the primary characters as events unfold. Whatever the intentions at the start, from the search for the missing agents to Dixie Clay's embrace of the orphaned baby, from bootlegger Jesse Holliver's manipulation of people and circumstances to the massive flooding that sweeps away homesteads and hope, the surging water puts everyone in jeopardy, Dixie Clay facing the consequences of her hasty marriage to Holliver and Ingersoll on the cusp of a life-changing decision. Too many easy resolutions here, but the authors capture the essence of the drama during an infamous disaster too many have forgotten.

"Although her novel is historical fiction, Cullen's Mrs. Poe breathes fresh air into the mythology of Edgar Allen Poe. Popular lore paints Poe as an addict, a madman, a nascent criminal and a bitter critic of his contemporaries. What a revelation, then, to view Poe through the eyes of poet Frances Osgood in 1845 New York City. A struggling poet hoping to make a profit with her writing, Osgood scribbles children's tales and feminine verses, desperate to provide for her two young daughters, Vinnie and Ellen. Frances and the girls presently reside at the home of her good friend Eliza Bartlett. Samuel Osgood, a popular portraitist, has abandoned the family to pursue his art. An incorrigible philanderer, Samuel has an eye for the ladies and a pronounced lack of concern for his wife and daughters. Having published some of her work, Frances is a habitué of a local literary salon, where she hopes to attract the attention of a publisher.Emotions run high in this novel, a city sensing its importance on the world stage, life fragile in an era where children are frequently lost to disease, the distance between security and poverty too easily breached, as Frances Osgood well understands, a woman in a man's world. The salon Frances attends is filled with popular writers and those chasing fame and fortune, among them the newly celebrated Mr. Poe, with his shocking poem, ""The Raven"". The subject of much speculation and jealousy, Poe is adored by women, an object of fascination to all for his bizarre ideas, his rabid criticism of other writers agitating the literary community. Among Poe's most damning critics is Reverend Rufus Griswold, publisher of ""The Poets and Poetry of America"" (the very man entrusted with writing Poe's biography after his death). It is at the salon that Frances first encounters Poe, who arrives with the beautiful Virginia his arm, fragile cousin and wife. Neither is seeking a connection, but once drawn together, the attraction is unmistakable. Of course they are doomed, by circumstance, by society and by fate.It is here that Cullen shines, capturing Frances's desperate circumstances and the shame of her tenuous position in a judgmental society, the honesty with which she approaches every encounter with the talented, sometimes temperamental poet. Frances is an innocent in every respect, Edgar resisting what he recognizes is an impossible attachment, until the fragile Virginia begs to have Frances visit their home. Beyond the glittering ambiance of New York society, what Frances discovers in Poe's home is the heart of the novel, a complex relationship between a poet and his ill, child-like wife. The tension of the chase is exquisite, the agony of certain consequences heartbreaking. Yet there is a sense of menace as well that Frances cannot understand, torn between her desire to be kind to a dying woman and the growing love for Edgar she harbors in her heart. Cullen writes this romance with such acute awareness of the risk for both, tempered by the relief of finding solace with a beloved, albeit painfully temporary, that it is impossible to view Poe from the jaded perspective of the myth that has become his legacy. This no monster, no evil villain with a twisted psyche, but a man bedeviled by his past, his genius and the marriage that binds him to one woman when he loves another.

"Kent changes her focus from previous works of fiction- set in Puritan New England- for the wild west of Texas post-Civil War. There Nate Cannon, an ex-veteran and new Texas lawman, joins forces with two men who will have a profound impact on his life as they all pursue brutal killer Bill McGill, who has cut a swath of death through Texas. As Nate struggles to adapt his moral compass to the actions of the two lawmen, Captain George Deerling and ""Doctor"" Tom Goddard, he learns of the killer's past and his new partners' determination to run this man to ground. Faced with the tough realities of life on the road, including decisions that require pragmatism over strict legality, Nate holds to his values, often in conflict with Deerling, who demands loyalty and a willingness to take direction.In a parallel storyline, Lucinda Carter slips out of a Fort Worth brothel on a mission to meet her partner and lover, the only one who has made her feel secure in a world that has offered little in the way of protection. Harboring her own secrets, Lucinda is headed for Middle Bayou on the Gulf Coast, there to bide her time and await further directions, meanwhile fitting into a role that affords her some anonymity. Lucinda is a complex character, by turns sympathetic and others deeply flawed, the product of a harsh upbringing. Masquerading as a woman of good character is no problem for one who has made her living giving others what they want, Lucinda obsessed only with the promises of the man who will come to claim her and enact the plan they have constructed to secure the future.Both elements of the novel converge as the lawmen and the killer draw closer, Lucinda a pivotal part of a plot that proves Kent's skills as a storyteller and an observer of human nature, from Nate's awakening to the nature of the daunting task ahead to Lucinda's devotion to a man who will push her beyond her means to survive, lawmen Deerling and Goddard providing the colorful historical background that is the setting for the conflict, Nate absorbing harsh lessons while traveling through unfamiliar terrain, both physically and emotionally. Post- Civil War Texas is filled with renegades, crooked lawmen, recovering, war-weary towns and the slow return of sanity, with just enough room for a killer like McGill to escape undetected from one scene of death to another.As in her Puritan-era New England scenarios, Kent builds a believable landscape for her protagonists, people and places with a sense of historical accuracy and the temperament of the times. Each scene brings the action vividly to life, whether a deadly ambush at a campsite, the disposition of inconvenient prisoners meant for hanging, the taming of a wild horse or Lucinda's retreat to the elegant mathematics of geometry for distraction. There is no shortage of violence or retribution, good and evil at odds on the streets of Texas, the Gulf Coast and New Orleans. Some will die, others survive, all touched by the quest to end McGill's reign of terror, strange bedfellows on opposite sides of the moral divide.

"Daly strikes a chord of truth with her novel set in the English Lake District. Overworked, overtired and overextended, Lisa Kallisto finds herself at the center of a shattering event- the disappearance of her best friend's daughter, Lucinda Riverty. Friend of Lisa's own thirteen-year-old teen, Sally, Lisa realizes she is responsible for the girl's well-being after a sleepover, a sleepover that never happened. Having trusted one another with each other's children, Lisa realizes, too late, that her busy life has been the cause of unfathomable tragedy should Lucinda not be found. Cloaked in the weight of her guilt, Lisa approaches Kate and her husband only to be rebuffed, Kate in complete shock. Lisa returns home to her own children, Sally and two younger boys, depending on husband, Joe, to help her through the next few harrowing days.In this dramatic scenario, Daly taps into every woman's worst nightmare, the loss of a child, and the aftermath of such an event. While authorities begin their investigation, Kate is suspended in limbo, her sister, Alexa, attacking Lisa on Kate's behalf. Devastated by her part in the drama, Lisa attempts to balance home, work and her increasing need to find Lucinda herself, Daly describing the awkward scenes between Lisa and Kate, revealing the history of a friendship between women from different backgrounds and the contrasts in their lives: ""The Lakes has always been littered with two extremes of women: the ones who never work... and the ones who never stop."" Lisa is a relatable character caught in a terrible situation, her oversight born of too many details in the busy life of a working mother. Her mistake isn't huge, but the consequences are.Daly inhabits her protagonist with painful accuracy, examining Lisa's missteps and motivation, her eagerness to help her family and friends, her care for others extending even to her work, a charitable organization for placing homeless animals where they might thrive. And while attempts to make right her lapse in judgment, another figure lurks in the background, a predator watching girls like Lucinda, preying on their innocence. Fearing a series of similar abductions in the district, Detective Constable Joanne Aspinall scrambles to make sense of the main players and find Lucinda before another girl is lost. Daly builds the tension to a shocking conclusion, a grim reminder of the secrets that lie behind careful facades of normalcy harsh judgments born of fear and the impossibility of protecting children no matter how well intentioned. Daly's first effort is a winner. Can't wait for the next.

"Love the concept of a mess free coloring option for toddlers, especially when riding in a car or visiting a place where caryons might be a nuisance. This product is age-specific; its use may be limited as a toddler seraches for more advanced ways to create ""art"". I like the idea of capturing a small child's attention with the addition of light and sound, but the music could be an aggravation for parents hoping for a few quiet minutes of play. Given the remarks in other reviews about the loud music that accompanies this product could be a deal-breaker, but the instructions include an option for a light-only mode, so what might be a drawback can be controlled by a parent. The gel surface is attractive to small hands and easy to clean, though puncturing might be an issue. The toy is sturdy enough to resist handling and easy to hold.

"As disarming and eerie as a black and white film featuring an iconic ""woman gone bad"", these tales contain that same disconcerting jolt of a female breaking character in the most sacred of places, the home. Editor Sarah Weinman has selected the stories of fourteen writers in this brilliant anthology, tales with the same elements as those portrayed in 1940s films, a peaceful domestic environment, the jarring dissonance of a female abandoning the role of caretaker for a more harrowing action, murder perhaps. And like the nostalgia for simpler times (when women knew their places), the selections read as familiarly steeped in domestic harmony, well-behaved young women, refined, mannered ladies- each with a fatal flaw running through her psyche. There's something even more sinister about stories set in the home, where families seek comfort and nurturing. Leave it to women writers to expose that notion of security.One of the most fascinating elements of this collection is the manner in which it is presented. Not only does Weinman provide a comprehensive history of the domestic crime novel's evolution in the Introduction, but she prefaces each writer's tale with specific details. All of this serves to give context to a cogent argument for celebrating the work of these literary trailblazers, women contributing to what is essentially a male domain. There is much to be said for these writers and their struggle for a voice in a world that needs their labors during WWII, only to discard them when the men come back to a country is distracted by post-war opportunities. Today, avid readers of crime fiction reap the bounty of the efforts of the ""Trailblazers of Domestic Suspense"", a generation spanning three decades, from the 1940s to the 1970s. Today our choices are unlimited and without geographic boundaries, from Gillian Flynn to Sue Grafton, Tana French, Louise Penny and Denise Mina.Suspend time for a while. Revisit a pre-digital world, where the face of a monster is masked by loving motherhood or devoted domesticity, where a woman's role is restricted, but not her ability to wreak subtle revenge, where ladylike nannies are hired to care for precious children and elderly ladies too fragile to successfully manage a murder. Some of these writers may be familiar, others not (Patricia Highsmith, Vera Caspary, Charlotte Armstrong), but their stories will both shock and fascinate, early excavators of a rich vein of domestic crime plunging beyond the faade to the more troubled waters beneath.

"Shameless. Brave. Unflinching. Brutally honest and slyly observant of the roles we play on the stage of life. Post-9/11 New York still in the grip of color-coded terrorist alerts, widowed Celia Cassill has wrapped herself in the sturdy embrace of an apartment building, landlady to George, a gay man; the Braunsteins, a married couple; and Mr. Coughlan, a retired ferry captain. George has asked to sublet his apartment for a short time to write in Europe, though Celia has purposefully constructed her rental agreements to specify no sublets. The burden of sorrow she carries since her husband's losing battle with cancer obscured by the necessary accoutrements of apartment management, Celia feels security slipping away as she agrees (just this once) to allow Hope to move in, unable to resist the lush personage of the new tenant, who is in search of temporary respite after a divorce.Whatever a younger Celia might have imagined for herself, it never included the agonizing loss of a beloved spouse, loneliness in her late thirties or the weighty grief that seems to have settled in her bones. Soon the wonder that is Hope settles into George's tastefully appointed apartment, scattering her flowery scent, emotions and creature comforts everywhere, danger sliding through the cracks along with a bevy of sophisticated friends and well-wishers. And Celia is drawn into a drama both enriching and terrifying, her carefully-constructed interior breached, life demanding a return to the living.Loyd leaves no stone unturned, nor is anything sacred in the exploration of Celia's world without her man, her coping skills, ritualized reapportioning of daily activities, need for control. Her tenants become less abstract, taking shape in a manner she hasn't anticipated, her life laid bare, instincts intact enough to understand that ""we were necessary distractions. A jigsaw she was arranging like a hobbyist."" Visceral, sometimes violent, literary and utterly without artifice, Loyd explores the wild terrain of love and desire, littered with sorrow, renewal and the endurance of the human spirit: ""You could love what you could not foresee, that we are all shape-shifting whether we want to or not.""

"I was pretty excited to get this plush ABC Elmo, my favorite character of all time and a source of much hilarity for both granddaughters. However, when I read the other reviews, I was sorry to hear that the battery cannot be replaced. I love Elmo with or without a voice, but a two-year-old may be pretty disappointed that Elmo loses his voice when the battery fails. In general, I don't believe plush toys have to ""do"" anything to inspire creative play, so I am hoping Elmo will overcome his problem and hold his value even without a voice. Both girls have had plenty of enjoyment from the smaller Elmo I bought each of them. It doesn't do anything, is just easy to carry and tuck in at bedtime. Since this Elmo won't get his tryout until Christmas, I will try to resist squeezing his hand for my own entertainment. Elmo will always rate five stars for me.Luan Gaines/2013.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V8DCJNMEO1O4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B100AT4#wasThisHelpful","R2V8DCJNMEO1O4","A2MF2QVSCUI27G","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MF2QVSCUI27G?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The tragically tormented Quirke returns in another mystery, one that strikes to the heart not only of Quirke's childhood traumas as an orphan, but the power wielded by the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland in the mid-50s. The Church effectively censors Ireland's politics, morals and financial institutions, stifling any scandals or questions of impropriety, even when murder is at stake. Murder is certainly the issue in Holy Orders, that of Jimmy Minor, a reporter who is found floating in a Dublin canal, his battered face almost unrecognizable. As a pathologist, it is Quirke's onerous job to perform the autopsy, later to inform his daughter, Phoebe, over tea, of the paucity of clues available to Detective Inspector Hackett, who makes it a habit to investigate crimes with Quirke by his side. The only name that surfaces early in the investigation is that of a popular priest, Father Honan, about to go to Africa as a missionary. Other than Honan, there is only an obscure reference to a band of tinkers visited by the priest to suggest any further avenue of inquiry into Minor's death.Given Quirke's history of aversion toward the church, commitment issues and alcoholism, the usual struggle to interact with others in a meaningful way bedevils the protagonist, as usual, but in this novel, the female characters, particularly Phoebe and on-and-off lover, Isabel, illustrate the grist of the conflict raging in side Quirke, his realization that these women are important to his humanity, yet unbearably threatening in their proximity. He cannot tolerate the emotional stresses of true intimacy. At the same time, both women understand Quirke (Phoebe less generously), though they remain powerless to reach him. Isabel, in particular, suffers for her love of this unlovable man, able at last to question her role in remaining with him. Certainly, Isabel serves as an alter ego, the voice of humanity calling Quirke back from the abyss where he straddles the worlds of the dead and the living. And while Jimmy is the link between Quirke and Phoebe in this novel, the late-to-be-acknowledged daughter has yet to claim her own identity, conscious of the personality traits shared with her father, unsure of the nature of her relationship with his assistant, David Sinclair and even more confused after an encounter with Jimmy's sister, Sally Minor.From Quirke's uncomfortable visit with Hackett to Honan's superior at the rectory- where he is assaulted by near-crippling memories of the orphanage- to a dangerous nocturnal visit to the tinker's camp, Quirke seems more lost than usual in pursuing the murderer, unraveling the threads of his past and the secrets surrounding Jimmy's death, avoiding Isabel, worried for Phoebe and helpless to find justice in the face of the truth. Even the resolution leaves some confusion as to Quirke's future, Black cloaking his protagonist in the shadows of the past, the irresolution of the present and a yet to be faced future.

"Heartbreaking. Absolutely heartbreaking. The depth of the novel is apparent from the beginning, when two adolescents become friends in Brewster, New York in the ""summer of love"" (1968), forced into manhood by circumstances beyond their control or their ability to manage. The lanky Jon Mosher is a loner, his German-Jewish immigrant parents unable to recover from the loss of the first-born son, Jon painfully invisible in his own home. Ray Cappicciano is Jon's polar opposite, the consummate bad boy who marches to a different drummer, has a reputation as a fighter and lives in scarcity with his ex-cop father and brother. There are others: schoolmate Frank, who finds security in the rigidity of his fundamentalist religious beliefs; the teacher-coach who prods Jon into joining the track team and learn the limits of physical endurance; and the luminous Karen Dorsey, an outspoken new student who befriends Jon but falls in love with Ray at first sight, her exuberance for life an unexpected bounty, equal parts unconditional love and wisdom. And there is Gene, Ray's baby brother, who makes his struggles bearable, but at the same time tethers him to the dark violence of a drunken father.Between Jon's revelations while running, a relationship with Ray that ameliorates his invisibility at home and Ray's battered-but-charming campus mystique, Slouka probes beyond the faade of 1960s adolescence, young men about to face real world consequences, a future defined by war and the draft, the fate of a star-crossed romance and a young man's life-and-death conundrum, innocence colliding with reality in a heart-stopping denouement. Whether describing Jon's excruciatingly difficult relationship with his mother, his discovery of running as emotional catharsis, or Ray's battered bonhomie and reservoirs of courage, Slouka keeps his finger on the pulse of two unlikely friends bound by deep affection. It isn't often that beauty and violence are so exquisitely rendered: ""You didn't punch me in the chest. I trapped your fist with my heart."" Slouka caught me with the first page and leaves me in tears.

"The voice of fifteen-year-old Anais Hendricks carries the reader through the harrowing bureaucracy of Scotland's foster care system, a child who has been in the revolving door of that care since infancy, currently waiting on the disposition of a case that could remand her to a locked facility until the age of eighteen. Accused of bludgeoning a now comatose policewoman, Anais awaits a decision on her fate at the Panopticon, a home for chronic young offenders in Midlothian, Scotland. Though she has denied the attack on the victim, the stern faces of those who interrogate her at the police station suggest guilt or innocence is irrelevant. Anais is seen as a lost cause, a habitual troublemaker and petty criminal. No fool, she has long ago learned to read the judgments of others, a litany of failures: ""Fifty-one placements (twenty-three before she reached seven), drug problems, violence, dead adopted mum, no biological links, constant offending.""In scathing prose, Fagan riddles her protagonist's language with the vocabulary of the helpless in the face of authority. Anais escapes the theater of the unbearable through drugs- of which there are a surplus- and what she calls ""the birthday game', imagining her parentage, extended family members and location, haunted by not having ever known her mother, worried she was created in a test tube as an experiment. For comfort, she turns to drugs (acid, uppers, downers), the affection of predators and the generosity of the street savvy people who have peppered her short existence. As a newcomer in the Panopticon, Anais proves herself through confrontation, bonding with Shortie, Isla Tash, John and Dylan, each with their own painful story. In spite of her rage, frustration, fear and crushing loneliness, Anais is bright, curious, inventive and street wise often enough to have survived her life thus far.This is not a novel for the faint of heart, it is brutal, unapologetically honest and memorable. Fagan indicts the foster care system and its inhumane bureaucracy with her characters, its institutional mentality, revolving door of college graduates, social workers and do-gooders. The Panopticon is a place for the nowhere kids, those who have fallen through the cracks, who shuffle from one place to another: ""I... understand that I am just a human being that nobody is interested in."" At the Panopticon, the young people in care create their own society, subversive by its very nature, one that operates below the radar of the social workers and caretakers, with its own system of checks and balances. The intimate society of the unwanted takes on a life of its own in a drama that reflects the needs, emotions and frustrations of those who create a family, who aid and protect one another and who howl in protest when any of their number are lost. The beautiful, damaged Anais speaks for all.

"Evil is indeed pervasive in Burke's latest novel, set in Montana, where longtime pals, the infamous ""Bobbsey twins from Homicide"", Dave Robicheaux and Clete Purcel, are spending the summer at the ranch of English professor and environmental activist Albert Hollister, along with Dave's wife Molly, adopted daughter, Alafair and the soon-to-arrive Gretchen Hollister, Clete's daughter, about whose existence he only recently learned (Creole Belle, 2012). Though Montana doesn't provide the history-laden ambiance of New Iberia, where fans first fell in love with Robicheaux, it has its own raw beauty, besieged by the usual controversies between environmentalists and oil men, in this case personified by the wealthy Love Younger and his son, Caspian. There's nothing on the visitors' minds but fishing, until Alafair has a run-in with an arrow that barely misses her ear and an ensuing argument with a cantankerous ex-rodeo rider, Wyatt Dixon, who disavows any attack with bow and arrow.One thing leads to another, as they usually do in Robicheaux novels, culminating in an adversarial relationship between Dave, Clete and the local sheriff, Elvis Bisbee, Detective Bill Pepper's vendetta against Gretchen Horowitz (who is, after all, a reformed mob assassin), the disappearance of Angel Deer Heart, the adopted Indian daughter of Love Younger and Felicity Louviere and Purcel's impulsive infatuation with the wife of another man. None of this is as sinister or ratchets up the danger as much as Alafair's declaration that she has seen serial murderer Asa Surette following her in town. Believed killed in a fiery accident en route to prison, Surette is the face of evil, a man who carries the very stench of death wherever he goes, Alafair in his sights since an interview and the articles she published about him. Though out of their jurisdiction, Dave and Clete first get involved in the Indian girl's disappearance, questionable connections fueling their suspicions, a trail that leads straight to the mouth of hell and an encounter with a man who will not die.Burke's prose is colored by the expected and provocative philosophical musings of a man who has seen too much and lived to ponder the wisdom of his actions, but the atmosphere of unrelenting menace casts a pall on each day under the bright Montana sky, nature's beauty at odds with the casual brutality, heinous murders and greed of a wealthy opportunist. Against the backdrop of a sadistic activities of a sadistic serial killer on the prowl, the weary Bobbsey twins from Homicide have nearly met their match this time, Alafair and Gretchen refusing to be left behind, Clete exhausted by his usual self-destructive tendencies, Robicheaux haunted by otherworldly visions and an intuition of a reckoning between the dark forces and the light. Burke's worldview has always been painted with equal parts joy and grief, wisdom and horror, but there is a fainter glow in Light of the World, a fatal wound for a man who has perpetuated  a message of hope, regardless of man's inhumanity to man.

"The Tudor dynasty is born on the back of Richard III's defeat at Bosworth Field, a pyrrhic victory it seems, with the specter of the Princes in the Tower bedeviling the new king, Henry Tudor. Whether real or carefully staged by Yorkist supporters, the threat casts a pall over Henry VII's reign, diminishing his power and his peace of mind. The major players are larger-than-life: Henry VII; his domineering and fanatical mother, Margaret Beaufort; bride Elizabeth of York, former lover of Richard III; Elizabeth's mother, Elizabeth Woodville, keeper of secrets and spinner of spells; and the ""pretender"", whomever he might be, waiting to unseat Henry and return the throne to the Yorks.The lines are drawn from the first days, king and mother on one side, everyone else on the other, Beaufort managing the court as though she is queen, usurping the queen's quarters, penning strict rules for court behavior (meant to marginalize Elizabeth), building an elaborate network of spies. For his part, Henry is the fruit of his mother's  ambition, a ruler lacking the accoutrements of princes, exile robbing him of the intuitions of a natural ruler: ""What matters is that you have not made your boy the beloved of England."" At its best historical fiction breathes life into desiccated facts. This is Gregory's métier, an author who inhabits the personalities of her characters with trenchant wit, ever cognizant of the ironies of fate, particularly in her rendering of Elizabeth of York, trapped in a marriage with the man who killed her beloved, bearing the Tudor children, witness to Henry's weakness and the fanaticism of his mother, who would bend God's will her to own.Loathing turns to pity, even affection (""On the contrary, it makes me tender towards him"") as Elizabeth observes the true nature of the Tudor king, his inability to bond with his subjects, his fear of the pretender by whatever name (Henry's ""looking-glass king""), her own mother's secret cooperation on behalf of the York cause (even after the birth of an heir) and the tantalizing possibility that her younger brother is alive, albeit in hiding. The paranoia is pervasive, Henry besieged by rumors and rebellions, Beaufort often white-knuckled with fear, prostate to the God who has delivered her son to his destiny: ""Nobody in the world could be more sure than my mother that her son should be king."" This dynastic marriage of York and Tudor sets the stage for the future of England's game of princes and their heirs, murders and prophecies lingering for centuries, the mystery of the Princes in the Tower unresolved, yet perhaps made clearer by Gregory's keen and informed blend of history and fiction.

"Set in post-Katrina New Orleans, journalist Nola Cespedes of the Times-Picayune is back (Hell or High Water) in a new novel, the feisty reporter first to discover a body on her regular run through Audubon Park. Nola is horrified when she realizes she knows the victim, Judith Taffner, her former journalism professor at Tulane University. Not one to let an opportunity go to waste, Nola sprints over to Tulane before the authorities lock everything down, copying the contents of Taffner's computer on a thumb drive for later examination. On the move, Nola heads for Judith's home, able to snag an interview with the dead woman's husband by virtue of her former association, the stunned widower left with a small daughter and no comprehension of how radically his life has changed. By end of day, Nola has already put her stamp on the story, checking in with the NOPD detectives, but on her own mission, inspired by two explosive stories Taffner was working on when she was killed.Castro writes with energy, her protagonist propelled from one idea to another, instinctively looking for connections, whether sleuthing her former professor's activities and contacts or interacting with her best girlfriends, each with a distinctive personality, as colorful as the city they inhabit. Make no mistake, this is a murder mystery, but Nola Cespedes is an engaging character with boundless enthusiasm for life and a dedication to her craft that sometimes gets her into hot water. From her first interview with Taffner's husband to touring the lush estate where a senator's wife breeds thoroughbred horses, Nola is always keyed into the appropriate emotional pitch for her subject, whether pursuing the professor's stories or touring the New Orleans Jazz Fest with her Little Sister in tow. Castro has created a lively, interesting character, fearless, inquisitive and impulsive, New Orleans the perfect background for the mayhem, mischief and misdeeds of those who fall under her scrutiny.  If there's murder afoot, Cespedes will not only break the story, but run the killer to ground.

"In Dorion's Massacre Pond, Game warden Mike Bowditch is caught in the middle of the most heinous slaughter in Maine history, ten moose when the count is finished. From the start, it's all about politics, a developing drama between environmentalists and sportsmen and the internal politics of the Maine Warden Service, where Bowditch has been warned to keep a low profile if he wants to move up in the ranks. The conflict originates with the prime hunting land purchased by Mrs. Betty Morse, property she plans to turn into a national park, envisioning an unspoiled landscape where wildlife can roam free. Unfortunately, this grand scheme will have a profound effect on the local economy, alienating those who make a living from that very land. Her enemies have been enthusiastic in voicing their opinions, including threatening letters to ""Queen Elizabeth"", as her adversaries call Mrs. Morse. Outraged since discovering the dead animals with his friend, Billy Cronk, Bowditch wants to catch the culprit, but understands the law and his own limitations.Thanks to an ambitious Lieutenant heading the investigation, Mike is assigned to peripheral duties that make it unlikely he will steal any of Lt. Marc Rivard's thunder, though Bowditch is chronically unable to resist immersing himself in the case, reluctant to embrace obvious suspects without further information. There are conflicts for Bowditch at every turn, with Rivard and the other wardens, with Mrs. Morse, who chooses him as liaison over Rivard, with Morse's daughter, Briar, who finds him attractive, with his friend Billy, who is hiding a secret he refuses to share. Meanwhile, the media demands answers and his superiors demand arrests. Even Bowditch's personal life is tangled up in the unfolding events, his strong attraction to the daughter of retired chief warden Charley Stevens (though she is engaged to another), anxiety over the frequent calls from his mother, from whom Mike has kept his distance over the years and a realization of his part in the failures of his relationships.Dorian captures the essence of the Maine wilderness and passions of those who live there, his protagonist beset by the demands of a horrific case, a domineering, wealthy woman determined to do things her way, the internal politics of the Warden's Service and a personal life gone off track. Peopled with strong personalities, from Morse's constituency of fanatical visionaries and a rebellious daughter, to angry sportsmen who resist Morse's intrusion on their way of life and an abundance of eccentrics, petty criminals and regular folks caught up in a conflict between ideologies. In a microcosm of human conflict, the larger debate is acted out in real time, the animal carcasses a grim reminder of collateral damage in the wake of progress and the high price of legacy.

"This thing is great for when you are transporting dirty items or just have a full vehicle.  I primarily use it for transporting stuff like bags of dirt and gravel/cement items that I do not want in my car.  This allows dirty items not to dirty up my vehicle which is great, I also have found it useful when I need to transport some additional items that will not fit in my car (car too full).I have found it able to hold a lot of weight (not sure how much I put on it, but it was not close to the 500 pound limit it states), although the bottom steel grate is not super strong, so it cannot take a lot of weight in one place, maybe it could handle it, but it looked like it started to push in when a heavy thin heavy item was put in one location (weight could not be distributed).It is easy to move and lift so I just store it in the garage and put it on the car when I need it (I drive a 2014 Ford Escape with Tow package), having it upright will block the tailgate so I do not leave it in the upright position.  It fits great in my car's 2"" hitch and a regular hitch lock fit it perfectly (the unit does not include the bolt to hook it to the hitch).In the end this is really nice for keeping the car clean and giving some extra space when traveling, I can use standard bungee cords and it holds up with no problem.

"This conditioner is really nice, and helps add some shine to my hair and helps avoid dry scalp (mainly flakes).  It goes in smooth and is easy to wash out without leaving any residue.  I have been using this with hot water and have had no problem with flakes while using it since my scalp does not get that dry feeling.  I also do not get a greasy hair feeling that some other conditioners leave.

"This vacuum is great!  It is small enough to go in the corner of the closet without taking up much room and is so light I can clean without trying to fight with my canister vacuum.  The battery is great since I do not have to deal with cords and it holds a charge long enough for me to do the entire house.The vacuum is light and easy to carry.  I have hardwood floors and carpet in the bedrooms.  I can drive this right off the carpet onto the hardwood floors and just change it to floor mode which turns off the spinners.  It is great especially in the bathrooms picking up hair.  For such a small vacuum it does a great job picking everything up, I have actually found that I clean more with this since I do not dread getting the canister vacuum up the stairs (it is so large I could only find a place for it in a closet downstairs; this is a townhouse so downstairs is really nothing and everything is upstairs).The handheld part comes out and is great for cleaning the stairs and the edge piece is very useful  I have not had much use for the small spinner part (I do not have curtains in this house, and in the past I used these for curtains).  This makes cleaning the stairs much easier and I also use the handheld for cleaning the car which is a nice bonus.  The no cord is also a plus in cleaning the car and stairs!I really like the dumping out vs bags since I will save money on bags and this makes life easier since I can just clean and dump it in the trash (every once in a while I wash out the filter).In the end this is a great vacuum!  It is super lightweight and easy to use and does a great job cleaning!  I find it quite beneficial to keep this upstairs and only get out the canister vacuum for large messes (which is rare).  I have just been using this whenever I see a need for vacuuming and just keep the battery on the charger in the office.  This allows for quick use whenever I need to vacuum!  I highly recommend this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQAKRERT8JWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1N4#wasThisHelpful","RQQAKRERT8JWJ","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these solely to be legal when going through the mountains.  I have a 2014 Ford Escape (Titanium with 18"" wheels).  This vehicle is more than capable of getting through these areas without tire chains, however, in California it is law that in some areas you must have tire chains (or it is like a $500 fine...).  So I got these.  They were cheap and fit my car.  I was nervous at first since Ford explicitly says NO TIRE CHAINS on the 18 and 19"" wheels.  However, I do not think ""My car manufacture said I couldn't"" is a viable excuse for getting out of a ticket.These are cheap and fit my car.  I put them on at home to make sure they fit and they went on easily fit snuggly (it took a few tries to get the connector in the right place to get both sides even (for me it was 4 notches, so I wrote that down on the instructions)).  This way if I get to an area with a sign saying ""TIRE CHAINS REQUIRED"" I can put these on and be legal!If you are looking for super heavy duty tire chains these are not for you, but if you just want basic tire chains that do the job of giving a little extra traction and allowing you to drive in tire chain areas these are a great choice!!I am happy with these and highly recommend them for those wanting to take a weekend trip skiing and concerned about tire chain restrictions.  My only complaint is that I wish the carrying case was a little bigger (although I am glad it came with one), but it takes a little effort to get the chains back in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPH9KKKY2TFJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VAFN60#wasThisHelpful","RPH9KKKY2TFJT","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Miracle Gro is my go to choice for plant food.  It works wonders and this is no different.  I have been using this on some roses (got them as just the cut off branches) and this has gotten this to leafy and almost ready to bloom in about a month!The actual feeder is great and my plants seem to love it.  The hose adapter is a neat concept, but my hose connection is in the garage and I do not like leaving it on when not using it, so I take it off between uses which is not great.  The hose kit allows me to simply water my plants using my hose and having this plugged into the faucet.  I am not sure what the ratio is that is being used, but it does not seem to be too much since after a few uses the feeder is still pretty full, I assume the main purpose of this is to ensure a nice proper amount of feed per water.  This does make it easier and if you had a faucet outside that you could leave this on all the time it would be idea.  In the past I have used the crystals that you mix with water which works nicely, and this seems to have the same level of growth with less work.  Putting it on and off is a bit annoying, but this is just because of the space limit I have in the garage, if you have an outside faucet this will work great!In the end this works great and my roses love it!  They are almost ready to bloom and I only planted them a month ago (as root/stick).  The water hose attachment makes this simple since I do not have to measure and can just spray them down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UK8K6WKSM7RL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MKB6R0O#wasThisHelpful","R2UK8K6WKSM7RL","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not sure why they call this topper.  To me a topper is what I put on a cheap mattress to make it feel like a memory foam mattress.  To me this is more of a 'guest' or second bed.My main use for this is as an available bed for when guests are over (or if we go out and do not plan to stay at a hotel).  I use the third bedroom for a office, but if we have guests it is nice to let them use that bedroom.  This was perfect for this.  This mattress is foldable and takes up a small amount of room in the garage and when someone is over we can toss this on the floor in the third bedroom and put a pillow and a sheet/blanket on it and they are good!It is surprisingly light (when you first see the box it looks like it will be heavy), but it is light and the carrying case has a nice handle on it for easy carrying.  I put it down and laid on it and it is super comfortable.  It feels like a regular memory foam bed and it wide enough for one person to sleep comfortably.  It is also longer than me, allowing for a comfortable sleep without hanging off (I am 5'10"" and it has about another .5-1 foot length).  I weigh about 190 lbs and this holds up nicely, I do not sink through any part of it and it forms around nicely.The carrying case is nice, but this is the only thing I do not love, they made the zipper only go about a quarter down on each side, which makes it hard to get in and out.  I really wish it opened all the way, it took two people to get this in and out of the case (difficult due to the bulk and flexibility of the mattress).  While this is not a big enough deal to affect the item, it would have just been nice to have a full zipper to get it in and out easier.In the end this is great for keeping in the garage and using in the office for guests.  It is good for one person and super comfortable.  I do not know about it as a topper, as all we have is a queen and king bed, so this would hardly cover half of it.  However, for a guest bed this is great!!!  Keep out of sight and be ready when you have guests!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TAWORSF5EMM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYJXBC4#wasThisHelpful","R1TAWORSF5EMM2","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this to help get some sun on my arms.  I ride almost daily so no reason not to work on a tan.  This was very solid feeling and felt well made.  It is a thin material and was very cool.  The orange color is really good looking and stands out (bright color that cars will see).  It is only a half zip, which is normal in cheaper jerseys, but that is OK, for the cost I can live with a half zip.The size is odd.  I am 5'10"" and about 180 pounds and I got the small (I always want cycling clothe to be form fitting), but even the small was a tad loose.  So you may want to get a smaller size then normal.  Maybe they made this with the idea it would be loose, even in the photo the jersey looks loose.The jersey has back pockets which is useful and the back of the jersey itself is longer than the front so you get more backside coverage which is great!For a great affordable jersey this was a perfect choice!

"These are super high quality staples in numerous sizes that makes hanging stuff way easier.  My main use for staples is hanging wires or other items outside the house.  I find this much easier than trying to use screws and I can pull these out without big holes in the walls.  My recent use for these was running a cable down the side of the house and stapling the cable (to keep it organized) against the wood.  The staples went in easily and they felt high quality like they would not rust (only time will tell, but they felt high quality).  The different sizes were great as I started using the super long ones and all of the sudden they would not go in all the way (apparently some metal plate behind the plywood), so I put in the smaller ones and continued and it worked perfect, this ensures they were all snug to the wire.I really like these for around the house jobs as I can quickly staple them into the wall and be done, no more trying to run wire along screws or leaving wires hanging and when I do remove them it leaves such a small hole it is unnoticeable.  These are great for around the house chores!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y9FX1YLE1HM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000Y8GXRM#wasThisHelpful","R1Y9FX1YLE1HM","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to have a rice cooker, but I sold it when I moved since it only did rice and took forever...  When I saw this it looked pretty awesome, so I gave it a shot.  First off, it looks way more expensive than it actually is, essentially the design does not look cheap and looks pretty modern.  So I read over the instructions (which could have been better), and added the water to the base and put some broccoli in the bottom container to test.  I turned it on and pressed the time to the chart's recommendation in the book.  I hit start and waited.  After about 3 minutes you could already here the water bubbling and after about 8 minutes it was steaming.  After it beeped so I knew it was done I went back to the kitchen (the beep is not too loud, so if you are like me and go back to the living room to watch TV you do not have to worry too much, since it goes into warming mode).  I tried some of the broccoli and it was delicious!  This was frozen broccoli from those big bags you get at the store.  The broccoli stem was even soft and good and it tasted amazingly!So I love rice, and was excited to cook rice the right way (not a steamer bag); rice just tastes better when cooked this way.  I was not sure from the instructions but it seemed like I should not use the second tray when cooking rice...  Well being the rebel without a cause but wanting rice and veggies I did it anyway (maybe it was accepted to do this, but I could not get a clear answer from the instructions).  I put the rice in the black bowl and put it on the bottom tray and put broccoli and snow peas on the top tray.  I added a little bit of water to the rice bowl and little bit of chicken bouillon (this is not needed, but I like the chicken flavor it gives to rice).  I set the timer to the recommended time for the rice (which was greater than the veggies) and waited.  After about 3/4 of the time I stirred the rice.  Well it went off and I was ready to try it.  I took the rice out and plated it (it was super, it was plain long grain white rice and it had puffed out nicely and tasted amazingly), I then forked the veggies and they were also perfect.  I poured them together and served them on the rice.  The broccoli was cooked perfectly and was tender and soft making even the stems taste amazingly.  The snow peas were still a whole (in shell) and the peas were cooked amazingly (you could bite through the shell and the peas and all were just perfect.I also could not figure out from the insturctions what was dishwasher safe, it stated some items were but I did not know what those items were (they used names that they would recognize but I did not know it).  So i just put it all except the unit and the part that covers the water (since it was not dirty; I just rinsed it in the sink with some soap) in the dishwasher.  After the cycle (I always use heat dry) everything was fine and it was all perfect and clean!I am very happy with this unit and find veggies cooked in this taste amazing!  I love being able to cook rice and veggies at the same time and cleanup is a breeze.  This can cook so many different things that I look forward to trying other items.  I will note the only thing I do not love is the display on the unit is set into the unit (not flat against the edge), so when on the counter I have to lean way down to see it (I am only 5'10""), this is sort of annoying, but not the end of the world. In the end this unit is quick and cook my food fast and make it delicious.  It is easy to use and a breeze to clean!

"I will state that the locking mechanism was really nice and I had high hopes for this.  However, the inside compartment is very tiny and hardly holds anything.  I wanted to put a little key fob in and the measurements online looked like it would fit, but the locking mechanism takes up so much room with a slanting effect that very few items fit (I guess their measurements included the space behind the slanting of the lock).

"Sunglasses are ridiculously expensive, and when my last bike glasses fell out of my pocket I was not looking forward to finding new ones.  The last pair were just sport glasses that were like $20 for basic glasses.  So when I saw these for about $15 I was willing to give them a try.  They are surprisingly awesome for being a brand I never heard of.First they lack instructions.  Had no idea what all the stuff was for.  I figured out how to change the lenses and understood the piece that hooked to ear rest to keep them on your face, but I was not sure what the last strap was for.  I later (a few days) realized the black button on the side pops out the ear rests and allows for the item to be hooked into that hole.  I was also not sure what the plastic glass frame looking thing was for.  I assume you can put prescription lenses in it and pop into the holder in the sunglasses?  I wear contacts so this is not an issue for me, but if that is what it is for that is pretty neat.The lenses are nice and I mainly use the one in the picture (not too dark but keeps the sun out).  I will say it is odd how screens look through this glass, it adds a strange filter over digital screens (like looking at an iPhone is tougher).  However, I can see my Garmin head unit fine.  So it is not a big deal.I like the clear lenses for night riding since the wind dries my eyes out (which causes the contacts to become an irritant).  I have not had much use for the other lenses but it came with several, so you are bound to find one you like.The nose piece is adjustable and fits nicely on my nose.  The glasses are a little away from my face (quarter of an inch), but I can still see fine when looking to my side since they wrap around.The lenses are easy to change and while yes everything does feel like cheap plastic, they all pop together nicely and does the job for little price.  The package included a real nice hard carrying case and loads of accessories and lenses (like I mentioned). They all go in the case nicely.I am very happy with these and they were about the cheapest glasses you can find and even more amazing considering what is included.  I actually like these much better than my old sport glasses as they have this little ridge above the lenses (soft rubber/plastic material) that keeps sweat from going down the lenses as much and since they are away from your face a tiny amount I have not had as much problem with sweat getting on the lenses.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MD2CS595BCJC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AV54726#wasThisHelpful","R2MD2CS595BCJC","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Works well.  I already have relatively long eye lashes and this did a good job of keeping them out and adding some body to them.  This gave them a darker, thicker look that holds all day.  It does not make them any longer looking, but like I said I already have relatively long lashes and this just makes them darker and bolder.  My only complaint is that you have to make sure they get through the brush, otherwise they seem to leave clumps (this stuff is sort of thick and likes to clump), other than that it works great, I just have to make sure that the eyelashes go through the brush.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12E6WTYGXCC5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR67T66#wasThisHelpful","R12E6WTYGXCC5U","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love tennis, however, I do not get to plat that often since it is hard to find a free tennis court...  I got this to be able to have some tennis like fun at home.  The first thing you have to do is not expect to play tennis with this.  However, it is still fun and great practice for eye-ball coordination.First it is in a smallish carrying case that is small enough and light enough to carry easily.  It took me about 5 minutes to assemble it; it is just push in the metal pin and push the poles together, it is pretty basic and easy to understand, even without the instructions.  The net slid on nicely; I did have to put one side on a small amount and than the other side to get it on all the way.The tennis rackets that it includes are not full tennis rackets, they are a tad smaller and are more similar to a racquetball racket (except these have a tennis like rounded top).  They are surprisingly high quality rackets and are really well made!  I figured they would be cheap in a kit like this, but they are top notch, they had a good feel (good weight balance) and were easy in the hand (they did just electrical tape for the handle wrapping, but it works fine for a racket of this size).  The rackets are really high quality!!The balls are foam and feel like heavy Nerf balls.  They are solid (unlike a tennis ball), but work well with this game.I live in the city and finding a place where I can setup this is challenging, I could not find a place had a concrete base that I could use for this (they were all shared with bikes or cars).  So I setup in the grass in a park.  This surprisingly worked well!  The balls actually had a bit of bounce on the grass (I would say they bounced better on concrete, but the grass still worked well), and we could play on the grass with no issue.  The net went up and we went back and forth for a while.  It was surprisingly fun and challenging.  For a foam ball you could get some power behind it and spike it!  It had a real tennis feel, just without the first bounce.  We played keeping it in the air, but sometimes it would bounce and we could still play off of it since it would bounce up about a foot or two.When we were done we put it in the bag (everything just unlocked and snapped apart) and zipped it all up!  It went away nicely.I will say this was surprisingly fun and worked well on grass, when summer comes, I plan to take this to the beach and play on the sand, this is a great small game and was really fun!  I highly recommend for anyone wanting a fun playful game that is quick to setup and can be played nearly anywhere (as long as you do not get in anyone's way).  I cannot wait to play again later with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIIUCFCHBGY6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006U0X2S6#wasThisHelpful","R1UIIUCFCHBGY6","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always skeptical about these types of products.  However, this was pretty nice.  I am embarrassed to admit, but it actually took a bit for me to figure out how to use this.  Once I figured it out, I was happy with the odd applicator as it actually avoided losing any (like on your hands).  I have been using it for about a week now and my skin is more 'radiant', wrinkles are still their (without pulling the skin, I do not see those going) but the small wrinkles (like around the eyes) are not as noticeable.  They seem to be smoothing out and the skin has a more healthy glow to it (could be a sheen).  I am very happy with this and it is easy to apply without losing any and the results seem to be on parr with expectations, small wrinkles are not as noticeable (large wrinkles are still there, but that is part of being old).

"I got these to keep my rug from slipping on the hard wood floor.  I quickly found the rug just kept moving around and that was dangerous and annoying.  It is a full size floor rug and I was fearful that putting this on would be difficult, but it was surprisingly easy.  I lined up the rug with a line of wood panels and did one half at a time.  Just flipping the edge over and applying the tape (it was not super sticky so I had to carefully remove the backing as it kept attempting to pull off the rug.

"I got this to light up a dark trail when riding home.  I quickly found out that I needed a powerful light that did not just allow others to see me but allowed me to see.  I found my cheap strap around light was worthless when in the dark.  After a 1 hour, 5mph ride home trying to see the road ahead to avoid debris, potholes and those polls that they put up to keep cars off trails, I started looking for a bike light.  I tried a bike light that I found that seemed like a good buy (it is odd that NiteRider does not appear in searches for Bike Light, maybe they should work on their keywords?) but did not work right when I got it.I was desperate for a light so I went to Performance Bicycles and got this light (I later found it on Amazon and it is a great price for a light of this quality).  I got home and loved the fact that it used 2 AA batteries, super simple and after mounting it on my handlebars (aimed slightly out and down) and it was amazing!  It was super bright and lights up the path ahead for a good 20 feet (15 feet is the focal point of the light and than there is about 5 feet of a radial effect around it).It has three settings which is nice, the super bright setting, the dim setting (never use this) and the flashing (use this to be seen).  It also comes off easily (slides off the mount) so you can pocket it when going in for coffee or leaving the bike.This light is great!  It is small and does not take up the entire handlebars and is one item (no battery pack to run to it or anything) and offers a great level of light that makes it easy to see the road ahead and definitely be seen by cars.I am very happy with this and it works great!  It is a great price for a bike light with this power and is a name brand!  Highly recommend!  I just wish this showed up in Amazon searches for Bike Light and it could have saved me a lot of time searching for  a light.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVUEI5Y20RP70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008L5GC0S#wasThisHelpful","RVUEI5Y20RP70","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my Mom's car (2014 Ford Focus); this is the camera and the display.  We live in the city and parallel parking is a must and having a backup camera makes life so much easier (I have one in my Escape and it constantly amazes me how close a car looks in the mirrors compared to the actual distance (as seen in the camera).).Installation was as expected, not fun!  I will say that I was proud of myself the camera on the car itself looks great!  It looks professional, I included some photos!  I knew that it would be near impossible to get a professional (native) look for the screen.  so I do not love it, but it does the job.I used the hardware of the trunk's closing mechanism to run the wire and it worked really well (I did have to take the right side of the trunk off of its connector (not loving that), but it did allow me to run the cable in the opening arm which resulted in a clean install).  I also was able to use the button for the trunk release and the lip of the trunk to run the cable and hook in the camera without having to drill into the car (which I was happy about).  I put the camera right above the license place under the Ford emblem, which is where the camera is on my Escape, this made the camera look native to the car.I used those splicer cables locks (that go around existing cables and splices into them; they have them at auto places and Walmart and probably online, but they are really cheap so a real store may be a better option) this allowed me to splice into the hot cable of the reverse light for power.You will need to run power to the display, I find it much easier (in my opinion) to splice into stuff like the reverse light than into anything under the dash; so I ran a cable from the reverse light splice to the monitor for power; I also had to run the video one as well.I got the camera installed and put the back seat down and ran the video cable under the plastic moulding along the side of the car all the way along the driver's side.  I than ran the power cable along the same route (I ran the video first since it is fatter).I put the monitor on the left side of the dash, as I have a GPS unit in the center (would life not be great if I could just use that for the monitor...).  The monitor has two video inputs which means more cabling that has to go behind the screen (it is too short to run under the dash and make the connections their (you can see this in the photo I added).The monitor is lightweight and holds on nicely using a sticky pad.  The arm is very flexible and with a large radius of tuning so you can mount it in multiple ways.I got everything hooked up and it worked!  I do not love having a few cables behind the display, but they are too short to run anywhere else, you do not see them from within the car the way I have them.  So I guess it is will work.The camera has lines on it to help with distance and this makes backing up out of parking lots easier since you can see in both directions pretty far and this makes parallel parking much easier since you can easily see how far you got before you hit the other car.I am very happy this, I got it for about $40 and it works great!  I was able to install it myself (I consider myself pretty mechanical) and it was not super expensive!For an affordable solution to having a backup camera this is great choice!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRHT0AEEFZB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J9P0WO6#wasThisHelpful","R2LRHT0AEEFZB4","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATEI wanted to share the battery life.  After using this about every other day (just for my back) with it on the Power Burst it lasted from Christmas to the beginning of February before I had to recharge it.  This was great battery life!!I am hairy.  So freaking hairy....  With this I am no longer!!!  I have tried so many body groomers to shave my back, I use a razor for my upper arms, chest and stomach, but I can only reach the lower back with a razor.  The upper back has been a problem.  I have tried several other ones (like Phillips) and they just do not work for me.  The heads often pop off when pulling up around the shoulder blade or I cannot reach parts and go against the grain (I look like I am doing Yoga in the shower).  I got this as a Christmas present and after the first use I am amazed.  The handle and head all lock, so no popping off when the shoulder blade gets between the head and the handle, I can get a smooth stroke all over those rough terrains.  I use the head with the foil on it as that seemed to do the best job and left the back smooth!The wide head makes it a quick job and the handle expands to any length so I can get really low and all the way to my neck.  I use it with power boost on every time and I can shave my back in under 3 minutes!After I am done you cannot see any hair, it is smooth!  In the past other shavers have left a tiny bit of hair that is noticeable when you have black hair and white skin...  This gets it all and does it quicker and easier than any other shaver.It is not waterproof so I shave in the shower (with no water) and than put it away and than shower off and shave the rest with a razor.  The unit's head is easy to clean and I can just rinse it under some water in the sink and it folds to a small size that I can easily put in the medicine cabinet.I am so happy with this and wish I had received this sooner, it is has made shaving much quicker and gives a better result.  This is a must for anyone shaving their back!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O7R70GEXSP5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FULYKG4#wasThisHelpful","R2O7R70GEXSP5B","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these as a Christmas present for my Mom.  Whenever she goes out for a run she has her shoes come untie.  I am not sure, they look tight but they always come undone (I on the other hand, have never had a shoe lace come undone...).  Since she kept having problems I went to find a solution.  I came across these and figured they would make a great present.  I was right, she loved them!First off, they were easy to put on, you just lace the shoe with these like normal laces (they are elastic, so do not pull them too tight when lacing, she found it better to keep them loose when lacing; than the foot expanded them).  You than just put the lock on, cut to the excess you want (we did about 1.5 inches, due to her short feet) and clinch them together.They come with super long laces, so they should fit about any size shoe, I held them next to my shoes and they would fit my size 11 Nikes, and since you cut off excess they would fit my Mom's size 6 Nikes.We got Orange since he shoes are grey and orange, so I like that they have a range of colors.  The nice part is you can reuse them on future shoes since the plastic caps can be opened and you can relace them on other shoes when you wear through your current.She has gone on a few runs since getting them and loves them!  She has not had to stop (and lose her pace) since getting these and she actually said that they give her a better run as they let the foot move slightly when running (I guess the elastic) which gives her a more powerful push off and no restraints from tight shoes (I might have to get a pair for myself).She loves these and she no longer has to worry about shoe laces coming undone.  She said she is going to get some more for her other shoes (hiking/trail shoes) so she no longer has to worry and stop when running or outside!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V96M57VWU5JM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007DLVLD4#wasThisHelpful","R1V96M57VWU5JM","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got these for cycling and they do a great job!  They kept my arms warm and if I got too hot I can slide them down.  This is a great option over maintaining a closet full of long and short sleeve jerseys.  They stretch over your arm and for me went from my wrist to the center of my upper arm.  This was perfect coverage!  They kept me warm (where I live our lows are only about high 30s [rare] and mostly high 40s and low 50s) and did a great job!  They are cottonish so if you sweat they will get wet, but they seemed to a pretty good job at getting the sweat away from the skin.For cycling or running these are a great choice, they are cheap (money wise) and work great!  I am very happy with these, highly recommend!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUA7XXSOJ00D2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002EAZMC0#wasThisHelpful","RUA7XXSOJ00D2","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had my doubts on this, but this thing is great!I got this for a Christmas present, and this was a great buy online, I will note that the price on these have dropped since their initial release.  However, they are great, so do not think otherwise from the price drop.I always get the lowest fat content burrito grande size tortillas I can find (has to be 4g or less Total Fat), so that is the type of tortilla I use, I sometimes get different brands, but always the low fat ones.I got the pans and put them in the dishwasher to clean them (I always wash things before using them), plus these are dishwasher safe!  I preheated the oven to 400 and put the shelf in the center (it did not state this, but I did to keep the tops from burning).  I took the burrito grande size tortilla and pushed it in.  Surprisingly it went straight in and held its shape (I was fearful it would just keep trying to slide up, but it did not). I will note that I keep my tortillas in the fridge until use so they were cold, in case that is what helped.I baked it for about 7 minutes and the tops were starting to get a little dark, so I took them out (I baked two of them).  I turned them over the counter and they fell right out (pan was just as clean).  The tortillas had a bowl shape and maintained it!  The tops were more done than the bottom, so I just put them back in the oven and turned it off while I finished making the stuff to go in it (about 7 more minutes with no pan).  This was my trick, it made them all over a golden crisp that was great!I got all the toppings ready (chicken grilled in the skillet, onions pinto beans, salsa, cheese) and took them out of the oven, they were very hot (which also ensured they were warm when I was done and served them).  I put the pinto beans in followed by the chicken/onion, then cheese and finally salsa and sour cream (I kept it healthy, by using Fat Free Cheese, Fat Free Sour Cream and canned chicken; I grilled them in the skillet with no oil, so my high end non stick pans had to do their job)!Surprisingly, it was delicious!  It tasted like the ones that you get at restaurants, but without the oiliness.  I could break off pieces at the top and dip into the salsa and chicken and it was liked a nice chip and when I got to the bottom it had held its shape and texture and the beans did not soak through so I could pick it up and eat it.I am very happy with these and highly recommend them!  They were super easy to use and created a great tasting dinner that did not take long to make but looked and tasted amazing!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93KPYKZY13CC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008UA4POE#wasThisHelpful","R93KPYKZY13CC","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went for a ride to work on a beautiful day, when I got off work, it started to pour down rain...  I was not prepared and was not dressed appropriately (I now have a rain coat for future).  However, not concerning my clothe getting wet, I quickly found that my feet got soaked.  I guess all the water goes down my leg into my shoes and inside the shoes becomes a slushy mess.  The worst part is that the feeling of wet feet in shoes is one of my nastiest feelings; like sticking your feet in mud or something; it is just a nasty feeling.The shoes are Giro road shoes with Speedplay cleats.  They feel like leather or some type of faux leather and they do a good job of keeping water out that lands on them, but they are breathable so that lets water in when there is  a lot of water.  Plus the socks seem to soak it in from the top and that fills up the bottom and makes the padding like a squishy nasty feeling.The shoes are a EU 45 and US 11.  I got the XX-Large shoe covers as that seemed too large at first, since an 11 is about average in US and many are above that.  But from reviews they said go larger so I did.  The shoe covers fit tightly around my shoes and it does require some pulling to get them on (I am fearful of their longevity with this pull).  However, I fear that a larger size could result in the top being open or them getting loose and sliding over the cleat.  I think EU45 is in the middle of xx-xxx size.They do a great job and go up my leg a bit and have velcro to get a tight snug hold, which keeps water from sliding down.  They cover the shoe nicely and after a few uses they are easier to get on/off.  They do stretch and cover the shoe nicely.  The whole in the cleat is a perfect fit for my Speedplay cleats and they fit in nicely (so SPD and Look will fit even better since Speedplay has a large cleat).I am very happy with these and they do their job of keeping my feet dry during wet rides (and when it is cold having wet feet make me feel even worse).  They are easy to walk in and move in and do not interfere with any walking or use and I got the white which are easy to see (truthfully, I wanted to the black, but they were sold out; however, there is no reflective strips on these so the white is more visible, so I am happy now).I highly recommend these if you plan to ride in the rain or in the fog or in the after rain (throwback from the water on ground).  These are amazing and do a great job!  They also were a great price and are a brand I know and like (love my Pearl Izumi gloves).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2082599P8D634/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004N62K0U#wasThisHelpful","R2082599P8D634","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this after a terrible ride where it got dark early and I had to get home going about 5 mph since I could not see the path.  When I first opened this it looked great and well made.  I turned it on and wow, it was bright and lit up the whole garage (tried it in the garage before taking it on the road).  I was excited to get this at a great price (around $30).  Well to make sure it was on secure I bounced the front wheel a little bit and the case did not come off, but the light flickered...  I opened it up and checked the battery holder and made sure the back and front was super tight.  It was all good.  I quickly realized this was not a great light (glad I found out early).  I could turn it on and it was bright, later I could turn it on again and it was dim (I knew about the focus beam part, put that was not the problem).  I know some lights have a bright/dim setting, so I assumed it was just skipping for some reason. I tried a few times and it would either be bright for about a minute and turn dim or would just randomly turn off.  I tried checking everything and trying new batteries, but still had problems.  It just kept randomly dimming itself (which was super dim and worthless) or would start to flicker dimly, or just go off.For something related to safety, I was not going to take a chance with this on the bike (going down the Bay Trail light goes off, and I wind up riding right into the ocean...).  I ride on the San Francisco Bay trail to and from work and at night that trail is pitch black, and you have to be able to see debris and those poles that they put up to stop cars...I returned this item, it is possible that I got a defective unit, but the fact that it worked fine, just would not stay on made me think cheaply made and at around $30 this is not that cheap in my opinion.  I went to Performance Bicycles and got a Nite Rider light they had on sale for $25 and it works great and is brighter than this one and actually stays on.  For safety, I recommend a name brand; as I cannot risk losing light when riding.","1.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KP4R5T558UTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I00AGGA#wasThisHelpful","R2KP4R5T558UTJ","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case does feel very rugged and should do a good job protecting your phone.  I cannot say if it can protect from drops as I try to not drop my phone, but this case does feel very solid and gives the Note a rugged outdoor feeling.  I find the case to have good padding around the corners that might help in the dreaded spider crack that is the norm when dropping and hitting a corner.  The screen protector included is nice and feels very thick (I will see how it holds up, as in the past thick screen protectors have started to peel prematurely (maybe with the case always on it will be good)).This is a good case for anyone wanting a little more protection, it does make the Note a tad large and bulkier than it already is, however, if you frequently have to get to your phone in odd places that present a drop risk this would not be bad to have.  It is not a great choice for outdoor living, as water and other elements are still an issue, but for in the city and on the go it is a good choice.  I keep an outdoor case that I use when hiking or anything that is waterproof so this is great when riding my bike in the city.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14AX6WU42R3IM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O3AE9DW#wasThisHelpful","R14AX6WU42R3IM","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a neat idea and looks like a winner.  However, I was disappointed.SetupSetting up is easy and gives promise, I really wish the volume was initially louder, since when I turned it on I could not hear what the speaker said and she did not want to repeat herself, after unplugging it and leaving it for a while she said it again (I could not hear the URL).  I followed the instructions and it forced me to create a Rdio account (not happy about that, as I do not use Rdio; I am a Pandora person).  I used my iPhone to setup the account and it was easy and I cannot complain.  I finally got it setup and it was working (took me to NPR; I can now sound intelligent in conversations and hint that I have listened to NPR...)UseThe controls are cool and the turn fast for next station and turn once for next song was nice (although the turning is a bit tough; it is stiff, maybe after some time it will be a little easier for one handed operation).I was excited and I got ready to tell it a song to play ""Play L.A. Love by Fergie"", waited, and got some message about if I wanted to hear a specific song I needed a Premium Rdio (get use to this message).  It started to play some song I never heard of...I tried a band, and did play the Beatles, it took about 4 times before it actually played something by the Beatles.  Not a great start.I downloaded the iPhone app for the Cone, and it is very basic and not very useful (which makes me surprised they do not have Android yet).  It essentially shows you what is playing and gives basic controls.Here is my big issue, I cannot specify a song; and saying play artists plays a station for that artist which includes other artists that are 'similar'.  So if I want to hear a certain song I cannot do it from the device, I have to use AirPlay.I cannot use other sources in the Cone, mainly Pandora, which already has my stations, my favorite songs and everything I like.I also, never know (unless I get my iPhone and look at the app) if it successfully heard me and is playing what I want, I say Cee Lo Green and kept getting the message about not playing songs; finally it went through and started playing some hardcore rap (I am an adult and OK with adult content, but the hardcore rap it started playing was very sexual, and not appropriate for the living room...); not even close to Cee Lo Green; but I did not know if that was part of its station or what...What this showed me was that it is possible for it to misunderstand and start playing some real filth, that you would never listen to.  I like uncensored music, so I would not want to limit it, but I also never play extreme rock/rap that is sexual; even if there was parental control in Rdio (might be, did not look) I would not want to be limited to censored, but do not want really filthy music...Also, turning the dial to switch stations takes me to a random place, I have to wait and try to recognize the song to see what I am listening to.I am not sure the target idea of this speaker...  Is it suppose to be a speaker that learns what I like (Pandora already knows), will it start learning the time of day I listen to certain things, maybe in the morning I listen to Techno and in the evening I listen to local news?  I am not sure, but I will say for radios I listen to about the same thing all the time (Today's Hits or Calvin Harris Radio) and if I want talk/news I turn on the TV.It is a good speaker and has a  good sound.  I can stream from my iPhone which is nice, but now a days what WiFi speaker cannot do that?  The talking concept is neat, but without being able to specify a song, or know for certain that I am getting the station I want (I do not have a wide change in what I listen to) I would not recommend this.This thing is more of just a promotion for Rdio Premium (I have heard that message so many times and it is a long message).  I do not use Rdio and do not plan to.  If this had a wider support for different services (primarily Pandora), but others have their personal preference in online radio, this would be nice, the touch is nice, but something like ""Pandora Calvin Harris"" or ""Rdio San Francisco News"" would be nice.As it is, I would not recommend it.  Which is a shame as it is a nice speaker and looks and sounds amazing.  It is useful sometimes to quickly hear a band (assuming it hears you right), and it does a pretty good job of getting it.  I think if it had outside sources (other than Rdio) it would be much better.  I have to say that parental controls might need to be enabled if you like to scroll between channels, scrolling through I went from Goo Goo Dolls to Drake; which was not family friendly...  I did not ask for it, I guess it just picks random stations...--Also, the packaging is nice, but you could have shaved some costs off this by cutting down the packaging, that was a lot of cardboard, I kept looking to see if there was more stuff hidden in it...","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DMF32XGU82Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MCVPIJI#wasThisHelpful","R2DMF32XGU82Q5","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently moved to the city and I want to start using my bike more for my general getting around and not just exercise.  This basket was great as I can use it shop in the store (easily comes off) and can simple hook it to the holder on the front of the bike and go.  The mechanics are ridiculously easy which makes using this basket simple.  The basket locks on when the handles are down and unlocks when they are up so you can tilt it out).  It is a good size so you can hold about two reusable bags of groceries (or one if you really pack it in).  It is deep enough not to allow items to fall out and if you are not using a bag the bottom is mesh so small items will not fall out.  The basket is also very lightweight making it easy to carry on the bike (without adding weight).  and is very productive (although, on a race bike it does take away from the race look...) :)I am really happy with this and it is a great thing to have when you go to the store (no more bulky book bags for me!) and while not a sexy addition to the bike, is very productive and useful!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A75BE5RH3G5Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LVH6TZ6#wasThisHelpful","R1A75BE5RH3G5Z","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start with I should mention that I personally prefer high arch faucets. Therefore this is the idea faucet for me, I always find high arch and pull down are the best looking and the easiest to use in the kitchen.  This one is true on both fronts plus the bonus of being able to touch it to turn it on (very useful when your hands are covered with chicken juice or hamburger meat and you need to wash up).First off, the look is amazing!  This is a sharp looking kitchen faucet that adds to any kitchen.  Luckily my new place has a single hole kitchen sink, so this fit perfectly.  If you have an older three hole sink you will need a plate to cover the two other holes (or in the past, I have utilized those for putting dish detergent and hand soap around, but that depends on you and the setup (room)).  This does not come with a cover for the three hole setups.  The faucet is seamless where the pull down meets and with the weight in the perfect position goes in smoothly.Installation:Installation was on par with other sinks (and like other sinks, you will spend most of your time removing the old one).  Getting this one in was not that hard.  However, the extra hookup of the electrical stuff for touch was a little tougher.  As far as installation it is like all other sinks until you get to the electrical part.  It was simple to install and the use of the above the sink tightener made getting this straight and tight a breeze!When I got to the part of installing the touch electrical components it was straight forward, but I realized if you want hot water when you touch it you need another item (not included).  I was kind bummed, since I prefer to wash in hot water.  However, after reviewing the diagrams and reading on that item, I realized the item was just to make the water warm (mix in some cold).  So I just hooked up the touch to the Hot water supply, which works perfect!I finally got it installed.  I realized that when I turned on the faucet (from handle) it would not turn off.  Turned out the touch was activating.  I found out after reading through (the instructions were very lacking; mostly diagrams).  That I could adjust the sensitivity.  I went through each option (1-5) and found 2 to be the best for me.  It detected a brief pause of my skin on the faucet, but did not activate when touching the pull down or the handle.A strange problem I ran into was that when the battery cover was on it would keep resetting the sensitivity, I think the battery cover would cause the button to press inside and trigger the change.  So I just left the battery cover off.In the end this was easy to install (took me about 2 hours; removing old and putting in new and than fine tuning and dealing with problems) and looks amazing.

"My old quesadilla maker started to lose its non stick finish after several years of use (I love these, I get the low fat grande tortillas fill with non fat cheese (Kraft) and a little bit of Taco Seasoning and onions.  If I am feeling deserving, I also add some black beans and grilled chicken).  So I use it a lot!Well, I through the old one out when I moved since it was losing its non stick coating (scratched away from use); that was a mistake.  Iw went to all the stores looking for a new one and could not find it!  The only one I could find was a tiny 8"" one at Sears.So, I came online, which honestly, was also limiting.  I found this one which was an 11 inch (great for my grande tortillas) and got it!  It was a low price and was an actual quesadilla size.I made some last night and they came out perfect and had a nice toasted color to the top and bottom, cheese melted properly (I use Kraft Fat Free shredded cheese, so it does not get as melty as others, which works better here since it is less prone to coming out) and it tasted great!  I cut it up into the triangles (it leaves a mark/indent in it, and I use a knife or pizza cutter to cut it completely).  I find that I can half it (take three pieces) and some beans on the side and have a great dinner!  I also usually dip it in a little fat free sour cream.The package comes with the maker and a drip tray (never needed it; but if you use really wet fruits or soggy meats, you might).  You want to be sure not to use a knife or metal item to get it out as that will scratch the non stick.  I use the 'George Foreman' spatula that comes with the cooker, and also heat resistant plastic spatulas (be careful some spatulas are not heat resistant and will melt).I am very happy with this and find this is a great item to have to make quick and delicious dinners.  I am not sure why it was so hard to find, used to they were always around during Christmas for presents, but this year I could not find one.  However, I got this one and it is great!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KMUB3BPN2AXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GS8Q9K#wasThisHelpful","R3KMUB3BPN2AXL","A2V5M5EJPOD2IU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V5M5EJPOD2IU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To get it out of the way: I love this Immortalitea tea cup. It solves so many issues I have with making tea:1.) The mess.2.) The holding a cup awkwardly so I don't burn myself.3.) Being able to see the tea while it brews to the perfect color.It's definitely peculiar having an insulated ""warm cup"" of (very hot!) tea that will burn your mouth if you're not careful, so don't be fooled by the cup temperature - the tea will be boiling hot!My only complaint with this tea cup is that the infuser holes to let the tea through can definitely trap tiny particles of tea debris, and it's a little tricky to remove them. Not a huge deal, and you certainly won't die from a rogue tea particle, but it's something to bear in mind.Overall, though, I love this thing. Easy to make tea, easy to clean up (caveat aside), and fun to drink from.4.5 stars out of 5.

"Amcrest really is on a winning streak with these HD dome-style cameras. I'm fortunate enough to have this 720p model's bigger brother, the Amcrest ProHD 1080P WiFi Wireless IP Security Camera - 1080P (1920TVL), IP2M-841 (Black), and while this 720p model is still excellent, it doesn't quite have the resolving of fine detail as the above model.Pretty much all of the pluses and minuses of the 1080p model are applicable here. That means a little barrel distortion (solved by digitally zooming just a hair), and a still-imperfect app in iOS that's not been updated to support the 6, 6s, 6 Plus or 6s Plus (the app is scaled on those devices, but does work). This is especially a downer with the 1080p model camera, since the app is designed for the 1136x640 resolution of the iPhone 5, so 1080p playback on the 6 Plus or 6s Plus isn't... well... 1080p!Anyway, the 720p model puts out a great picture, but it's not quite as sharp as the 1080p model, even at a sub-optimal resolution in the iPhone app.Setup over wifi was a piece of cake on my iPhone 6s Plus. The included quick-instruction card runs you through this absolutely perfectly, and I had this camera set up within 60 seconds. The camera connected to my wireless ac Time Capsule over the 2.4GHz network (no 5GHz support) without any trouble, and two floors up it maintained a very good connection. Control from the Amcrest app from my iPhone is flawless, and I'm still incredibly impressed by the smooth playback and controls in the Amcrest app, even if the rest of the app is a bit of a letdown. It pans left/right/up/down extremely smoothly, and motion captured from the camera is equally smooth and lag-free over even half-decent connections. I also like being able to see both the 1080p and 720p cameras at the same time in the overview screen in the app, and being able to switch between camera feed with a single swipe (see, not all is bad in the app!).Overall, app aside (again!), Amcrest has another superb camera on the market. I'd still say if you can swing it, get the 1080p model if you'd like that slightly better camera system. But really, you can't go wrong either way. Another winner from Amcrest.4.5 stars out of 5.

"This really is a well-made and relatively compact Yoga-accessory bag. I'll get that out of the way first! I can easily fit my yoga brick and cloths inside without any trouble. I really like how it zips down the side, because it means the bag opening is much large than if it just opened like a ""regular"" backpack at the top.However, and this is a big one for me - my yoga mat is simply too thick when rolled up for the Gecko Active's mat straps to get around. They just won't make it around the entire mat. I accept that part of the problem is me: I'm 6'5"" tall, and thus my mat is longer - and rolls up thicker - than the ""average"" mat.However, for ME that's a downer. For my wife who is 5'4"", this is no issue since her mat is a lot shorter. So now she's taken the bag as her own... *cries*.So there you go. This is a great yoga accessory as long as you're not stupidly tall. I guess being able to see over everyone has its downsides after all...4 stars out of 5.

"The Vorbana Vertical Stand is... OK. Yep, that's probably the highest praise I can heap on it.But, it's only just ""OK"" for one big reason, - but first - the good things!1.) Very simple to set up. The PS4 fits perfectly into the PS4-shaped cutout on the right. It's then easy to plug the USB cable into the front.2. The two controller slots will also charge the Dualshock 4 controllers. They will also charge the controllers while the system is in standby, as long as you have USB power set to ON in the Playstation 4 power-save settings.But now... the bad things. Or, should I say - the one bad thing:1.) The fan noise. It's ugly. A nasty, grinding-sounding fan noise from both of the fans in the unit. I'm guessing these aren't brushless fans (not easy to tell since I can't read the labels on the fans to see the brand). The system itself does vent well, and the fans are pointing away from the PS4 and out the bottom, but the noise is just far too annoying for my liking. Don't get me wrong - the fans do work, - they just sound terrible while doing so.Bottom line: If your PS4 is nowhere (and I mean nowhere) near where you sit, - perhaps hidden away in a cabinet, -  you could certainly do a lot worse than the Vorbana Vertical Stand. But.., if the PS4 is out in the open, your mileage may vary as to how annoying you find the unit's dual-fan noise. For me, it was a deal killer.3.5 stars out of 5.

"The VcTsing CD/DVD-RW burner is exactly that, but it does come at a cost (or is it a lack of cost?)It burns CDs and it burns DVDs. I had no issues burning either when connected to my Elgato Thunderbolt 2 dock via a USB 3.0 port, or via the USB 3.0 ports on my 2014 5K iMac.However, the device feels cheap. No, scrap that - it SCREAMS cheap. First, the very plastic exterior is bound to get trashed if you throw it into a bag with ""other stuff,"" so may want to a small case to go with this if you're a laptop traveler. Plastic isn't always bad, but this definitely feels like the non-quality type of plastic. The same goes for the USB end.Second, the mechanism to eject doesn't feel altogether very solid. And, for some reason, there's an eject symbol on the right of the drive, but the actual eject button is further to the left of it. Huh?Third, there are several screws on the inside of the tray, and while they're supposed to be a silver color, one of the screws inside my drive is a little....how should I put it... brown? It looks like a slight rust sheen to the screw. Not exactly inspiring.Lastly the USB cable is connected directly to the drive, and there's no way to replace it. While this is reminiscent of Apple's own SuperDrive, it wasn't an ideal design there and it's still not an ideal design. If you put too much pressure on the cable where it attaches to the drive (both in the case of Apple's and VicTsing's here), the cable will fray/snap, and you'll be left with a dead drive.Overall, though, in terms of performance, the drive does indeed work. I'm not sure USB 3.0 was necessary for this burner, as I have several other drives with similar/the same specifications, and all of them work just as quickly over USB 2.0. If it were Blu-ray, the need for USB 3.0 is more obvious, but for a DVD burner? I'd have perhaps like to see that extra cost of USB 3.0 channelled into a slightly more premium feel to the drive.As an aside, I wanted to call into question the following from the description:""CLASSIC APPEARANCE. With exterior silvery aluminum grinding surface finish, this CD/DVD writer/burner is fashionable and scratch-proof.""OK, so classic appearance and fashionable are subjective. But scratch-proof? I took some keys and pretty gently rubbed them over the top of the unit (in the interest of science!). Nope, NOT scratch proof. This WILL get scratched up to all heck if you travel with it unprotected.So, the VicTsing does work fine. But, for less money you can certainly get a more premium-feeling drive from LG or Samsung on Amazon...3 stars out of 5.

"Anyone who drinks wine should have an aerator of some sort. This is just simple Wine-Drinking 101.This Anear wine aerator does many things right.

Second, it does a great job aerating, putting beautiful, temporary oxygenated bubbles in the wine you pour out.Cleanup is simple, requiring just pouring warm water over it to clean out any wine.Downside?

"This Dead Sea Essentials shower soap/bubble bath set is nice. It feels very ""fresh"" on your skin, and my overall experience with the shower gel is quite positive.However, there are a few issues:1.) As bubble bath it's pretty weak. Not many bubbles, - more of a bubble slick on the surface of the water. You can do MUCH better in this space.2.) The lid is just a screw top, which means it's a little more awkward than it should be when used as shower gel, since you have to take the top clean off to dispense liquid.Overall, I like the smells and feel of this soap (especially the hibiscus - love it), but it's more of a jack of all trades set.

"You know it's a good sign when your pet makes a beeline for a new carrier and curls straight up in it - and goes to sleep.And that's what happened here.

Given the huge head-room available here, that shouldn't be an issue.I'm impressed with the build quality here. Double zippers on both ends, and it stays rigid and upright when zipped up. My old carrier (similar style) just sort of collapses on itself so it was due to be replaced anyway.

"You know, reviewing eau de toilette is not an easy task. It's one of those things you generally really need to smell for yourself to decide if you like it.Helpful, I know.I could just say that if you like this Burberry Brit Rhythm smell, then you should buy it, and if you don't like this smell, then... you probably shouldn't buy it.No, still not helpful.I'll say this (trying to be helpful, truly) that it's a very pleasant smell. Some people tell me they can smell the cardamom, but I just give them a blank stare. I'm a guy, I admit it, so blank stares come often when it comes to describing odors. It's a very inoffensive smell in terms of the Annoying Everyone Around You scale, though. It's certainly classy, - but don't overspray it. Even one press on the snazzy-looking bottle can be enough, and the smell does stay with you for several hours.Overall, I've really enjoyed using Brit Rhythm (and being British, it feels just slightly better - for no tangible reason of course). It works for a casual event, or for business use. And unless you go completely crazy with it, the 3oz bottle will last an extremely long time.5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommended (...for me. For you?

"The Logitech K380 solves a problem I'm sure many of us have. We have multiple devices like iPads or Playstations or Macs/PCs, but we don't use them all at the same time, and it would be nice not to have so many keyboards lying around.Enter the K380, a very solid (literally) keyboard from Logitech.The first thing you notice when you pick up K380 in it is that it's surprisingly heavy. That's because despite being not the largest keyboard in the world, it's got a great heft to it. It's certainly not cheap feeling.Setting up the keyboard is simple. Open up battery compartment, put in the 2x AAA batteries (included), and then hold down one of the three yellow Bluetooth pairing buttons to put the keyboard into pair mode for that particular memory preset. Yes, you can pair with three different systems, and switch between those systems with just a tap of the same yellow button assigned to that preset.I have been successfully using the K380 with my 2014 iMac, my 2010 Sony Vaio laptop, and my Sony Playstation 4, without any issues. I'm very happy that all the shortcut keys for volume//mute/play/pause/skip track etc work great on Windows/Mac, but adjusting screen brightness doesn't work on the Mac since those keys are the Bluetooth pairing keys on the K380. No great problem, since I'm mainly using this keyboard for Windows and Playstation 4.In terms of key feel, I'm impressed. The keys don't ""clack"" very much, and have a solid feel to them. If I have one criticism, it's that I'd prefer if the keys were square instead of round, but I accept that this is a personal choice, and others may be quite happy with the keys here. At least they are about full-size!Overall, this is a great keyboard. With a claimed 2-year battery life from 2x AAA batteries, a low price, and an easy set up and switching between devices, it's really hard not to recommend this keyboard.4.5 stars out of 5.

"Given that you can buy Lightning cables for quite cheap these days (even Apple MFi cables), a dock needs to be a bit more than just a cable with a bit of plastic around it - to be worth this sort of money.The OZAI O!tool (what a name!) is well made, for sure, but there's nothing here that screams must buy, especially with a few issues it has.1.) The ""amplification"" is just essentially a channel for the audio from your phone to travel and out to the left. It's not electronic amplification, and it's just essentially channelling the audio to ""focus"" it. Yes, it's a bit louder than using the iPhone by itself, but it's still not that great. It's not recommended for music, but it does work fine as a slightly louder speakerphone on your desk.2.) You can't use this with a case that protects the bottom of the phone, no matter how thin said case is. That said, if you're using an Apple case that leaves that bottom edge exposed, it will work fine here.The build quality of this IS really good, though.

"Maybe I set my expectations just a little too high, but this Panasonic trimmer isn't quite as good I'd have liked. But it's certainly a solid option.I like a 5mm trim for my head shave. I found I had to set the trimmer to be 4.5mm to attain a 5mm length that my other trimmers hit. I suppose there's no harm in being conservative. In terms of trimming, it did so pretty consistently across my head, so no real complaints there. The trimmer guard is easy to attach and remove, and there's basically no danger of accidentally switching the trimmer settings by mistake. The pop-up trimmer did a decent job, but did not give as close a cut as my Braun Cruzer 6 Body Shaver, which has been soldiering on for about 4 years now without complaints.I do not particularly like having to oil the blade so often on this Panasonic, and the manual is very insistent that you do, so... bleh.On the plus side, I was surprised to see a world-wide 100-240V charger included. It's always best to check *your* charger, but if it's like the one I received, it's good to be used worldwide (you'll just need a cheap end-piece to convert US 2-prong to... whatever end you need). I can't think of a time I've had a trimmer with this sort of charger, so kudos, Panasonic.Overall, this is a decent trimmer. Perfect for travel with the world-wide charger.

"The Jabra ECLIPSE (why the caps?) is teetering dangerously close to form over functionality, but there's no questioning its design aesthetic. The headset itself has no straight edges. Everything curves delightfully, and it feels wonderful in the hand.The packaging is smart, and I'm happy to see that no power adapter is provided. Given the ubiquitousness of micro USB, grab one of the thousand of those cables you have (or use the tiny one in the box) and charge away via your computer, iPhone plug etc.The headset comes with four different size inserts for your ears (extra small, small, medium, and large), and I found the medium size one already installed was perfect for my ears. Experiment to find the one most comfortable. It's very comfortable in my ear, and very solid - it's not falling out. However, because of the design, it does give that slight ear-plugged feeling. On the plus side, it's easier to hear the person on the other end when there's lots of background noise due to the slight isolating nature of the insert itself.1.) Call quality is excellent. In a bathroom, the echo is reduced significantly, and people over FaceTime audio said I sounded extremely clear and ""full."" Background noise is reduced dramatically outside, and overall, this is a very pleasing Bluetooth experience with my iPhone 6s Plus. With the Jabra Assist app on the Apple App Store, I was able to bump the call quality to add a little bass, as the standard setting was just a little too thin for my liking.There are some problems, though:1.) Three hours of battery life. Jabra tries to get away with this by outfitting the charger/dock (which the headsets docks delightfully in, magnetically) with an internal battery as well - giving you an extra 7 hours for a total of 10 hours of battery life, but.. the bottom line is you're getting three hours of battery life from the headset at any one time. If you want more, you'll need to wait the two hours for a full charge in the charger before you can use the headset again. This is a real downer, especially when competing headsets have 7-10 hours of battery life all in the headset. The price of delicious aesthetics... 3 hours of battery life from 2 hours of charging. Oh the humanity...Yes, you can pop the headset in the dock/charger while you're out and about. Jabra even touts you can charge it in your pocket, but while small - it's not exactly tiny. I personally wouldn't want to have to charge the thing in my pocket.2.) If you lose the charging dock, you're out of luck. There's no way to charge the headset except in the dock.3.) There are no physical buttons on the headset. You can tap the headset (I find it easiest to do that where it goes into your ear) to enable Siri etc. However, it's extremely fiddly to use this touch method, and I suspect many of us will end up tapping at our headsets trying to get the feature to work. Yes, there's a learning curve, but it's still too fiddly. Ending calls to another person might end up with them deafened as you tap away at what is essentially a microphone with an earpiece. I would have preferred to see a little button above the word ""Jabra"" on the top of the headset to answer/end calls. Yes, it would have taken away from those delicious aesthetics, but usability is important, at SOME point!4.) Volume control is handled entirely on your phone. This is a bit annoying since my phone is often in my pocket. The Jabra assist will adjust volume (with the option on) depending on ambient noise, but I prefer to change volume myself.5.) The only way to turn off the headset is to put it in the dock. So, if you leave your fully-charged headset in the car, without the dock, it's just going to drain its standby time (7 days, according to Jabra) and its available talk time, of course, as a result.6.) Right ears only. You can get away with it in your left ear if you must, but it doesn't fit quite as nicely.7.) NFC/Bluetooth pairing is only available while the headset is in the dock, so if you're looking to pair your headset with a different phone while out and about without the dock, you're out of luck.8.) To check the battery status, you can tap the headset once and there's a green LED that lights up. You can also press the button on the underside of the dock/charger to see the same thing. However, it will show either a green light or a red light. A green light means the headset has over 20%, and a red light means under 20%. A green light for over 20% battery is not my idea of helpful... at all. When the the dock itself is charged (three white LEDs solidly on), there's no indicator at all of how charged the headset itself is, though. You'll need to take the headset out of the dock (which turns it on) and see in the Jabra Assist app the actual battery life (or the icon at the top of your iPhone screen).Overall, I do really like this headset. However, I feel it's better served for occasional outdoor use, or as a nice headset around the home. It means you can leave the dock/charger plugged in to your computer at all times, and when you're done calling someone, you just place it right back in there, ready for use later on. A perfect use-in-one-place companion.As an out-and-about headset for the on-the-go users among us, this really isn't your headset. No on/off button, poor continuous battery life, and just general user interface issues means you should probably look elsewhere.3.75 stars out of 5.

"There's not a huge amount to say that hasn't been said before. This is a great infusion pitcher, but I'm not loving it for sangria. The problem with is that you will end up with fruit high-up in the center fruit-holder, so much of the fruit is suspended ABOVE the liquid. D'oh! You can put more liquid in, but then your sangria is diluted too much. Most recipes for sangria call for 2-3 whole fruits per bottle of wine. You simply can't make that work here.But, for lemon/orange-infused water etc, this is a great product. I've really enjoyed drinking naturally-flavored (in the sense of real fruit!) water this way.Bearing in mind the sangria deficiency, it's definitely a great pitcher.4 stars out of 5.

"I've gone through more of these cameras than I like to admit. I'd been using a Foscam FI9821P for a while, and not been happy with it. Focus is poor, and the color at night under house lighting is a dingy orange (see picture!). I'd already exchanged one, but the replacement was no better, so I just gave up.Given the above, the chance to review the Amcrest ProHD couldn't have come at a better time. However, the setup procedure wasn't quite as smooth as I'd have liked it to be. If it had been just a LITTLE clearer, I'd have been happier. But let's start at the beginning..First, the box it comes in is excellent. Well-packaged, feels high-end, and overall is a positive unboxing experience. Unlike some other dome-camera systems, the wifi antenna is built in. There's no external antenna to connect, and in my experience checking signals in the desktop browser app, it hasn't needed it.I plugged the power cord in to the camera/wall, and then the included ethernet cable from the camera to my Apple Airport Time Capsule ac model.I'm an iPhone user, and setting up with my iPhone 6s Plus in iOS 9 was a little more confusing than I'd like. The setup card included in the box directed me to download the Amcrest Viewer (the free one is all you need if you're not needing push notifications etc). No issue, - downloaded in seconds.. Adding the camera was very simple by scanning the QR code at the bottom of the camera itself. At this point, it asked me to input my WiFi SSID and password to connect to the network. But... but... I don't want to use WiFi, because I connected the camera via an ethernet cable!Turns out, you don't need to worry. I entered in a network SSID the camera couldn't see (my 5Ghz network, for example, or you could use an entirely made-up network. Either way, the camera is not 5Ghz compatible). Type in a fake password, and hit connect. Voila, it will say ""Done,"" but really it's just using wired ethernet at this time because it didn't connect to WiFi. It's a bit odd you can't just pick wired and skip WiFi setup, but there you go.., you're done!For reference, more fine-tuning of things (like adding day/date stamps to your video or adjusting hue/contrast/night vision) can be done in the desktop browser, so log in to the camera and make changes there. This is pretty simple, following the setup card instructions. You can also completely disable the WiFi chip from the browser app on your computer, which I did. No need to even have it on if you're using a wired connection. This worked on my iMac running El Capitan, in the Safari browser, - no issues.At this point, on my iPhone and via the desktop browser, - I was very impressed with the image quality. It absolutely DESTROYS the Foscam FI9821P (see comparison picture). For one, the orange cast to the image under regular house lights is now gone. Second, the image is much wider, fitting more of the room into the image. Unfortunately, there is some barrel distortion on the edges, but this is to be expected at such a wide angle. The center of the image looks great, with very little distortion. To ""solve"" this, you can always zoom in just a hair in the app. Yes, it's digitally zoomed, but it makes very little image-quality difference, and does remove the barrel distortion on the edges.Moving the camera left/right/up/down is also very simple, and VERY smooth in the iPhone app, over both WiFi and LTE.One unfortunate thing, though, is that there's no native iPhone 6/6s support (including Plus models). I'm hoping Amcrest updates their app to properly support these devices. The app works fine in iOS 9 on those iPhones, but you can tell it's not optimized for their resolutions. The app is definitely a bit of a letdown, but it's not too far off the mark. It does the job, though, and is free.I'm very impressed with the camera quality. It's the best I've used. The colors, especially under house lighting at night, are surprisingly accurate. The room the camera is located in actually looks like this in real life in comparison to the video feed. Automatic switching to night vision works great, and the resultant image is also excellent. While out this evening, I was able to do a test run over LTE, enabling the speaker/microphone in the Amcrest Viewer app and having a conversation with my wife. It worked just great.Overall, this is a superb camera. With a few tweaks, the app could be great, which is my only minor complaint.4.75 out of 5.

"LifeStraw definitely have their game on with their Gravity-Fed water purifier.First, there's really not that much to setting it up. While the instructions are a tad confusing as to what EXACTLY the back-wash bulb is doing, the video on the product page makes it much simpler to understand, so I recommend spending the two minutes watching that video to give you a better sense of the product (over the tiny manual).It's very easy to use and very easy to clean. I admit, I don't travel all that much into the great outdoors. On the other hand, it's so easy to take running, clean water for granted, and so why not be prepared?To use the water purifier, it's as simple as this:1.) Fill with water (only to white line), roll over the top of the bag, throw strap over tree (or something else that will suspend it vertically), and snap around the bag. Connect stay to bag (making sure that both levers are in the horizontal position).2.) Turn red lever to either vertical position to let UN-treated water out for 10 seconds.3.) Turn red lever horizontally to stop UN-treated water flow.4.) Turn blue/green lever vertical to let clean water flow (it does so much slower than the red outlet as it's being filtered simultaneously).I do recommend, if you're able to while camping etc, let the untreated water out nowhere near where you'll actually be filling your drinking containers. You want to avoid cross contamination if possible!Overall, it would be impossible not to recommend the LifeStraw. If anything, it's a reminder of how lucky many of us are with running water.5 stars out of 5.

"The Spigen Apple Watch Stand works really well. Let's get that out of the way. I have very few complaints, so since it works so well, I'll just address the couple of niggles I have.1.) I do wish there were a way for the charging cable to come straight out of the back, rather than the sides. This would tidy things up a little, though this will depend on your bedroom/desk setup.2.) the 38mm adapter piece it comes with is a little tricky to get straight since it sticks down very easily. I suggest using a credit card to line things up against it as you stick the piece down. The nice thing is that in my experience the 42mm Watch works fine with the 38mm piece installed, too.Overall, this is an excellent stand. It does a much better job than several others I've tried, and the way it sticks to your desk is very smart. If you're looking at other stands currently, be aware if there's no lip like the Spigen, the Apple Watch will sag due to the strap weight, and I was getting obsessive about trying to balance it to get it rotated straight with a competing stand. Gaaa! I'm glad with the Spigen not to have to do this anymore.Overall, 4.5 stars out of 5.

"I was really hoping that for the money this Premium Ice Ball Maker would really make a whiskey-drinking experience that much better. But, alas, it really didn't. It just mostly annoyed me.First, the procedure of getting the water into the contraption is just one giant pain. You have to have finesse, a steady hand, and try to avoid over-filling or getting too much water in the top part. Inevitably, you won't be able to do all these things and so you'll suffer from one or a combination of the following:1.) Great difficulty removing the top part from the bottom after freezing, because the water on the top has frozen.2.) Cutting yourself on shards of ice that you try to remove from the top section.3.) Balls that aren't completely solid and are attached to each other by the swimming pool of water that froze around them in the bottom tray. (trying to separate the balls from the additional water that froze is really annoying).4.) Balls of ice that just aren't very attractive, with seams and cloudy parts where it froze unevenly. They fall apart too quickly in a glass of whiskey, too, because of the lack of solidity.I was mostly just annoyed by all of this. The balls aren't very attractive when chunks of additional ice are attached to them, and trying to get the water in without making a mess was for me more trouble than it was worth.2.5 stars out of 5.

"This is a really odd product, and I'm not really sure I *get it*.It's shatterproof, but only because it's essentially two bottles in one. The inner glass bottle (which is most certainly not shatter-proof in of itself), and then the outer plastic bottle which the glass one sits inside to make it ""shatter proof."" Yes, you fill only the glass part, but it makes me wonder what the point is? Your lips touch the plastic when you're drinking, and you're only really aware that it's glass because it weighs so darn much. The rest of the time you're just holding a plastic bottle. So why not just use a plastic bottle?Also, the drinking area is pretty rudimentary stuff, certainly nothing like the clever Contigo bottle caps out there. Doesn't feel great at your mouth, and I can't say I expect it to last as long my Contigos either.So there you have it.

"This Contigo Autospout is a great drinks bottle if you're out and about, but it has a few issues. There are plenty of reviews about how good it is, so I'll just point out the things that are an issue.1.) It's quite tall, where I think it could stand to be a little fatter and shorter so it doesn't take up so much vertical space. I have a hard time finding a cabinet to put it in since it's so darn tall for being ""only"" 24oz. It also may not fit in many dishwasher top-shelf areas due to the height, despite being dishwasher safe. It barely fits in my full-size dishwasher.2.) The noise you make while sucking on the straw is... not exactly subtle.3.) The locking mechanism (not the release button) for the spout is really tough to move, though you don't really *need* to use it. I doubt an elderly person would have the strength or dexterity to shift that without trouble, in any case.4.) The straw comes with this really, really annoying label wrapped around it that was a total pain to remove. I ended up using a pen knife to cut it off, and even then I had to get some residue off that was left on the straw. NOT COOL.Overall, this is a solid, inexpensive 24oz drink holder.

"I really, really wanted to like the Ear Force Stealth 450 headset. They tick all the right boxes. PC use, fully wireless, detachable mic, great sound etc.Unfortunately, there's one really glaring problem, and I'll get to that in a bit.Setting up the Ear Force 450 is really simple. Charge it up over any micro USB cable, and then plug in the included USB dongle, switch the headset on, and you're in business. It comes pre-paired. This even works on a Mac (2014 Retina iMac running OS 10.11 El Capitan). I was able to set the output to the Ear Force 450, and the microphone to the mic on the headset. Nope, you can't use the Superhuman hearing gimmick in OS X, but I'm not too bothered by this at all.So how's the sound?Excellent. I'm extremely impressed by the drivers in the Ear Force Stealth 450. No, they're not reference quality cans, but they put out a good sound for what they're designed for. Gaming and music. Listening to some Armin van Buuren through these is extremely impressive, and with the bass boost preset they seriously thump. A surprising amount of bass is available here.And the mic?Also excellent. Tested over Skype and FaceTime audio, I came across crystal clear to everyone I spoke to. I even used a voice recorder on my Mac (built into Quicktime player, if you're interested!), and my voice sounded excellent when played back.But... there are some problems. First, the minor ones. What's with the lights? Both sides of the headset have a white LED behind the logo, and they're both really bright. And the dongle features another - absolutely blinding white LED light. If you're a laptop user for gaming, you may want to put some black tape over the USB dongle. Crazy that it was made to be so bright.Second, there's a bit of audio feedback when adjusting the volume up or down quickly, - some little clicks/feedback. Not a major issue, but worth pointing out.Third, they're quite...plastic. They don't convey a particularly premium feel, that's for sure. This is subjective, but.. yeah. No.And here.. now, is the biggest issue. They are really, - and I mean REALLY - uncomfortable. I don't have a large head in width, and these things just plain HURT. The amount of pressure put on the side of your head is massive. I truly cannot imagine anyone finding these particularly comfortable, unless maybe it's a very young person using them. Sennheister HD598/590s these are NOT.It's actually a real shame, because if it weren't for the comfort issue I'd be using these every day. They sound pretty darn great, and the bass output is stellar. But I cannot wear them longer than 5-10 minutes without wanting to rip them off my head. They're THAT uncomfortable, and the feeling of relief when removing them from my head is beyond compare. I've worn a lot of headphones, and these are by far among the most uncomfortable I've ever worn.3 out of 5.

"The Spigen Apple Watch stand joins an ever-growing bunch of stands for Apple's newest addition. And it does a really great job.Pros:1.) The price. The MSRP is extremely reasonable. Spigen did a very aggressive job marketing this.2.) The area of the stand where the Watch rests is rubbery, so there's no chance of scratching your new Watch.3.) The ""puck"" of the Apple charger (not included) is very securely held when pressed into the Stand.4.) It looks very smart, matching the iMac/Mac aesthetic excellently.5.) Rubber pads on the underside to prevent scratching your desk/nightstand.Cons:1.) There's no cable hiding, really. You can see where the cable pops out the back. Not a huge deal, especially given the price.2.) It's not an especially heavy dock, despite being a slab of aluminum. It's certainly possible to knock it over if you're clumsy.3.) Early versions of this featured the Spigen logo and ""designed in California"" etc... information on the top side of the stand. This appears to be resolved (my two stands both came with the information on the underside of the stand - as it should be).Overall, this is a near-perfect Apple Watch stand. My only real issue is I wish it weighed a bit more, but this is easily overshadowed by the excellent price and build quality.4.5 stars out of 5. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LRHSK6DEQ4NT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSGVVNA#wasThisHelpful","R2LRHSK6DEQ4NT","A1RL1OTV8IJMVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RL1OTV8IJMVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Samsung T1 Portable 500GB USB 3.0 SSD does so many things right, which is why it's such a shame it does one thing terribly, terribly wrong.But let's start with the good.Pros:1.) It's adorable. I mean really, really adorable. And tiny. It's smaller than you think. At 0.8"" thick  x 2.0"" long x 0.4"" wide (and only 26 grams!), it makes regular 2.5"" SSDs in enclosures look and feel absolutely massive.2.) It's based on the 850 EVO with 3D NAND, so it should be very reliable in the longterm.3.) Comes with a dinky little USB 3.0 cable. While the cable design itself is unique to the T1 as far as I'm aware, you can use any USB 3.0 cable out there if you lose the one the T1 comes with.4.) Great speed. I recorded just a hair under 390MB/s writes and another hair over 430MB/s read speeds while connected to my 2014 5K iMac, and similar speeds connected to a 2014 Mac mini.5.) 3-year warranty.Cons:1.) When you plug this drive into a Mac, you're greeted by a small 128MB partition with Windows and Mac installation files. Given that with every external drive I've ever used I would just wipe the drive and start using the disk, I was surprised to see that this doesn't work on the T1. First, you can't format the disk in Disk Utility - it just hangs the application. And second, you have no access to the actual 500GB - it's simply not visible. Uh oh. So, against my better judgment I installed their utility, which put two kexts AND an executable application on my iMac. At that point, I was able to label the disk using Samsung's utility, and set a password if I wanted. As soon as that was done, voila - 500GB available for my usage.But this is simply not acceptable. While I understand the necessity of the software if you want to password-protect the disk, there's no reason to force the software installation for everyone. So, I loaded up the Samsung utility, disabled the password, and then was able to successfully remove the two kext files and the Samsung application from my computer. At that point, the drive was readable on my 5K iMac without any issue, and also readable on the Mac mini (that I had never installed the software on in the first place).So at this point I think it's a great shame that Samsung has forced a software installation that keeps a daemon running in the background on your Mac - when for many of us it will be completely unnecessary.So here's my guide to making this SSD work on your Mac (and subsequently ANY Mac) without any software running - assuming you're not setting a password on the disk:1.) Plug in your new T1 to your Mac (after marveling at how adorable it is).2.) Install the Samsung application.3.) Now your drive should show up fine to read  from and write files to.4.) Open up Terminal (quick way to get to it is hit Command+Space Bar, and then type ""Terminal"", and hit ""Enter"")5.) Type or copy the following, one line at a time. (you can also manually do this in Finder if you have the know-how):sudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/SATSMARTDriver.kextsudo rm -r /System/Library/Extensions/SATSMARTLib.plugin(This removes two of the three unnecessary files that Samsung installs)6.) Remove the Samsung Application and folder from within ~/Library/Application Support/You can achieve this this by doing the following:a.) Open Finder.b.) In Finder, press CMD+Shift+G.c.) Paste the following: ~/Library/Application Support/d.) Remove the ""PortableSSD"" folder. This folder should contain only the Samsung application, so the folder is safe to delete in this case.e.) Reboot.7.) You're done!What's really frustrating about what Samsung has done is that they do tell you how to remove the first two files before you install their software, but make no mention of the third file/application that keeps running in the background. I thought about docking this review to 3 stars out of 5 for that alone, but the drive quality ""makes up for it"" in many ways.Overall, this is a great drive. It's just such a shame that Samsung has shown a lack of professionalism by their underhanded driver installation process (a process that needn't exist for many).PS Samsung - if you're reading this: In future ship this drive ""open,"" i.e. a 500GB SSD with 500GB accessible OUT OF THE BOX. You can put the Samsung application on the SSD (maybe being completely truthful about what this entails...), but this then gives people the OPTION of whether they want your files all over their computer depending on whether they want password protection or not. Don't force it upon absolutely everyone who wants to use this otherwise excellent SSD.4 stars out of 5. Recommended with the above caveat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8BZVKCPZZJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWXVMRS#wasThisHelpful","R2K8BZVKCPZZJD","A1RL1OTV8IJMVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RL1OTV8IJMVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Western Digital's Passport Ultra 1TB USB 3.0 is a great little drive. It's really thin, quite adorable, and will work just perfectly with a Mac or a PC.Tested on a 2014 5K iMac over USB 3.0, formatted HFS, it gets about 110MB/s read and the same 110MB/s write, which is quite acceptable for a drive like this.Coupled with a 3-year warranty from Western Digital, it's hard to go wrong here.5 stars out of 5.

"The Kindle Voyage is easily Amazon's most premium Kindle yet, but it's not without issues.Pros:1.) Feels absolutely great in the hand.2.) Glass display still looks like paper - no mean feat!3.) Battery life is excellent.4.) The new magnetic Amazon cover you can buy for the Voyage is quirky genius.5.) New high-res display is fantastic.Cons:1.) Expensive!2.) The uniformity of the screen is still an issue... - This is a BIG one. Part of the reason I still tend to gravitate to my aging Kindle Touch is because there's no front-lighting system built in. That means that screen uniformity is excellent. Every Paperwhite and Kindle Voyage I've used unfortunately suffers from an uneven front-lighting system. What this means is that parts of the screen tinge green or pink with the front lighting system on. This isn't generally noticeable outside or under strong ambient lighting. However, in bed or in the dark when reading - this color non-uniformity is frustrating to my eyes, and it's the biggest reason why the Voyage doesn't come close to being a 5-star product. Having used several Voyage devices, it definitely varies from Voyage to Voyage, but I've yet to see one with a perfectly uniform display.I hope the next iteration of Voyage can improve on this issue, because until then, - yes it's the best reading device out there, but I wish it were better!3.75 out of 5.

"This is a really nice sleeve for the MacBook Pro 13"" with Retina display!Pros:1.) Easily fits the MacBook Pro 13"" with Retina display without squeezing.2.)

"Yes, other covers are cheaper - but to my mind never better - than Amazon's Paperwhite cover. It's extremely resilient to scratches due to its mottled nature, and the cover stays closed via the magnet, very well.It's a little tricky to remove the Kindle Paperwhite from this cover, but that's only a minor niggle. Quite frankly, - I can't see why you'd ever remove it.The Saddle Brown color is extremely smart, and does not dirty up with use over time.Overall, this is a great case.

"Like others, I had no idea this sort of thing existed, or that it would be so fast to use.Anyway, straight to the pros/cons, I think!Pros:1.) Shows up in a simple-to-open box (very much like Amazon's frustration-free packaging, except in color!). No tearing anything open or struggling to remove the device.2.) Comes with 2x AAA batteries to power the device. (We'll see how long they last, but for free I'm not expecting much!)3.) Comes with a sturdy pouch for your belt, that detaches with velcro so you don't need to remove your belt to remove the pouch. Very thoughtful.4.) Has a nice, big, backlit, color LCD. No it's not a super high-res display or anything, but it's very readable, and the backlight is extremely useful when you're measuring in dark places (under beds etc).5.) The buttons take just a minute or two to figure out (even with the manual) but once you get it, you GET it.6.) Lets you adjust whether to measure from the front of the device or the back. It defaults to the back always when you power on the unit, so you can place the rear of the casing against a wall and get an accurate reading without having to subtract the length of the case from the measurement. You can switch it to measure from the front if necessary. Again, thoughtful.7.) Does simple length, sq/ft, or cubic feet (or meters) with a single button press to switch between them.8.) Has a memory system to remember the last 10 measurements taken, even if you switch the unit off OR replace the batteries. Very nice.9.) Will auto-off after 3 minutes, or you can hold down the OFF button to switch it off manually. Having both options is good.10) Last but really not least, EXTREMELY accurate. One press to turn the unit on, another to have the laser mark the spot, and another to get a reading instantly. I've found it to be within 1/16 of an inch of my 25-foot physical tape measure.Cons:1.) Quite frankly, I've not found anything to complain about as yet. It's perhaps not the cheapest laser measurer out there, but it's certainly excellent.Overall, this is a great product. While it's certainly geared more toward professional use, I've certainly found it useful for measuring portions of my house for re-flooring.5 stars out of 5.

"This is (at the time of typing) Mediabridge's only reversible USB charger, and it's a good one.Pros:1.) Finally does away with struggling to figure out which way to plug those USB cables.2.) Comes with a detachable figure-8 cable, giving you more flexibility of placement.3.) Easily charges two tablets simultaneously.4.) ETL Certified.5.) 100-240V compatible, so you can just buy a figure-8 end wherever you are, and charge away!Cons:1.) LEDs. Good grief. Each port glows blue. And then there's another bright blue LED near the bottom, too. When you have devices plugged in, it dulls the USB port glow, but still - if you use this in a bedroom you may well be bothered by the amount of light leakage here. This is of course a personal preference, but for me it's a little too much. Because four of the LEDs are in those USB ports, you can't even really cover them with tape otherwise you'd have to mess with tape every time you plug or unplug something.

"While Mediabridge touts this as a 5-Port ""Desktop"" USB charger, it's actually very much at home at a desk OR by your bedside, ready and willing to charge whatever device you fancy. This thing will easily charge 4x iPads simultaneously for example (2A charge per tablet device), without missing a beat. No, it won't charge 5 iPads simultaneously, but.. somehow this isn't much of an issue for most people.I like that the unit ships with two pieces: the USB main section, and a detachable kettle-plug cord. This is exceptionally handy for traveling, as localized kettle plugs are readily available in most countries, and since the unit is 100-240v compatible you're set basically anywhere in the world without need for a hefty power converter. It also means you can have furniture pushed up against a much lower-profile kettle plug rather than the chunkier USB brick.Two really great things about this Mediabridge are aspects that it DOESN'T have:1.) No audible buzzing sounds from the unit itself, something I've encountered on lesser brands. That noise can be annoying by your bed at night.2.) No distracting LEDs at all to disturb you either at your desk or while you're sleeping.Overall, this is a top-notch USB charger for your devices, and with UL certification, it's an absolute no-brainer and the highest recommendation.5 stars out of 5.*Sample provided for objective review*","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKA81X9B4IALE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYWIW24#wasThisHelpful","RKA81X9B4IALE","A1RL1OTV8IJMVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RL1OTV8IJMVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're looking for an adorable (yes, adorable) laptop sleeve for your 13"" MacBook Pro with Retina Display, the Inateck MP1323 is it.It provides a very soft padding, and a neat little elastic loop that wraps around a wooden (well, it looks like wood!) button. The button is really, really sewn on there, so I don't see it ripping off unless you REALLY try.On one side, the patterned material is also a pouch, so you can put papers or a small folder in there, or perhaps an iPhone charging cable or two. Included with the case is another, small drawstring bag, designed to fit something like your laptop's charger + other cables. In addition, Inateck provides you with a screen-cleaning cloth (complete with Inateck branding, so you know they tried!).I really like the padding on this case. While not designed to protect against seriously hard drops, it will protect your laptop on its day-to-day journeys to and from work or while business traveling with it in a briefcase/backpack.On a rather random side-note, I really like that there's no ""odor"" to this sleeve. There's no smell at all. Makes a change from a lot of things I've reviewed in the past.

"I must admit I'm not much of a neck pillow person, but somehow, this VIVE Health neck pillow has changed my mind.First, it's got really excellent memory foam inside its removable cover. It's solid, without being too hard, and so far has held up very well. I expect years of enjoyment from it. Second, the cover (it zips up) is easily removable for cleaning, and is of very soft, cozy material. Good! And lastly, it's got a little elastic strap which you can stretch around a suitcase handle etc as you roll your luggage around the airport.So what's not to like? Well, it's not especially tiny, so you'll certainly want to take advantage of that elastic strap. Other than that, there's nothing that I've noticed to complain about it. It's just very, very comfortable.5 stars out of 5. An easy recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YXDZH69LTW5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYV5QME#wasThisHelpful","R2YXDZH69LTW5K","A1RL1OTV8IJMVD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RL1OTV8IJMVD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So if you're a beginner, and new to the yoga world, this book is for you. I currently took up a yoga as stress reliever for my medical health. My doctor told me to try yoga as it would help a lot. Of course I had no idea how to do yoga the correct way. But I was like how hard could it be? I need a guide and this book was right so I could do yoga from the comfort of my own home.So when I got this book, it seemed pretty simple. It starts out by explaining the basics of yoga and why people do it. Then we get into the yoga poses. Each yoga pose is displayed on the left and to the right of it there is a step by step little mini guide to get you into that pose easily. Including even how to breathe while in that pose.Further into the book it gives you a list of poses to do for each category you are trying to work on. Such as medical Heath, energizing, calming, strong legs, etc.The. The other chapters explain this such as nutrition and mediation. There's a lot of great info in here for beginners and even none beginners. It's a clear guide to help you get on the right path to relaxation and I just love it.

"This is a nice combo set for both cats and dogs. The dematting brush is great for long haired cats and dogs. I use that for my poodles hair so they don't get knots.The brush is very nice as well, you get a soft side brush (best for long haired dogs and cats hair) I use that side for my short haired tabby cat to get the extra hair off her. Then the other side is a regular brush for any dog or cats hair. I must say it fairly nice especially because it does not hurt your pets skin. You see each bristle has like a tiny ball point on each bristle so it doesn't scratch their skin at all.Each handle has a really soft silicone wrap on them so they are easy to handle and hold without skipping from your grip.Nice set, and worth it.

" 1:13 MinsI can't stop taking pictures of random objects with this kit haha It's so much fun and it's pretty cool. The pictures this kit produces are just amazing and it makes you feel like a professional photographer.It has 3 effects total:-Fish eye-macro-super macroYou get those 3 lenses plus:- 2 lens clips- 2 lens covers- a protective carrying case- a hook for your carrying case- user manual &&- cleaning cloth for your lensesI really like this kit because I always wanted one but the one I was looking at a few months ago made me paranoid about my camera lens. I was afraid it was gonna scratch it or mess with my phone, etc. so I did not get it. Than this one came along and it's just perfect. I use it with my case on my phone (that's why in some pics you can see the black on the edges) and it works just fine. It does not touch my cameras actual lens, and the clips just slide on to your phone and even have protective rubbers on them so it does not scratch your phone if you choose to use hear without a case on your phone.the pictures WIlL be blurry for the macro lens of the object is not close enough for you to take a oicture of. And you have to be pretty darn close for the macro lenses to work. The pictures I took of the lipstick are the exact closeness you have to be to the object with that certain lense, other wise the picture will be blurry.Perfect for anyone I would say, but specifically I would suggest this to people who are trying to take real close up photos such as droplets of waters on leaves, or capture the texture of certain objects.So worth it thou, and I was happy to be able to try this out as a sample to give my honest review on it to everyone.

"I love this little tracker. When it arrived, it was smaller then I expected it to be. It was quite tiny and I pictured it just bigger kind of like a watches size. I actually liked that it was a lot smaller because it's easier to put anywhere on your pants that you like. You can even clip it onto your shoe with no problems.It's very light weight and practically has no weight to it at all, and it's perfect for those trying to get fit. Right now I am very competitive so me and my sister both have one now and at the end of the day we see who walked/exercised the most and who ever did wins what ever we bet that day.This is the perfect thing anybody needs for those wanting to watch their weight or stay fit. It just amazes me how it only works if its like clipped on to your pants or shoe. I tried walking running in place with it in my hand and nothing happened. It's like it know which is pretty neat. You can't lie to it haha It does count your correct steps to. I counted my steps form one side of the house to the other 2 times, and then I looked at the tracker to see if it counted the same as me and it was spot on.Love my new little tracker, and I was happy to be able to try it out as a sample to give my honest review on it to everyone.

"This one fits me perfectly. I have been trying to find a perfect fitting waist trainer to hold my tummy in They go by china sizes thou so I always have so much difficulty finding one. Luckily this one fit me like it was made for me. I got the 5XL, and I am 4'11 and about 185 pounds. As I went to the products listing again to write my review, I just noticed it was latex! I am allergic to latex but this did not bother me in any way. The outside of it is latex, but the inside lining is 100% cotton so that's probably why.It's easy to get on, and I like how this one has straps on the top to go over your shoulders. You just slide it on like a jacket and button it up. The button hooks are on the front and located under a little piece of fabric you pull to the side that goes back over them so you can't see the hooks once you have it on.I wear a sports bra with it, and I would recommend putting it on first and then the waist trainer. It's a lot easier I learned lol Love this one thou, and when I wear it I feel more confident and better about myself. It's so comfortable while wearing and you barley notice it's even on you.

"This is a neat little 3-in-1 dental kit that's good to have in the bathroom.You have your:-  Dental Mirror- Plaque Remove- Tooth Stain EraserEach item is not just cheap little plastic you can get from the dollar store like I thought it would be. It's actually pretty good quality considering the price. What I found what makes this different from most I have had is the powerful little blue lights on each one of them. They are very bright and easy to see with with no problems. The batteries come installed inside of them already as well so you just hit the button on each one in use and you are good to go.The handles also are wrapped in silicone for easy gripping and no slips.

" 2:00 MinsThis is the cutest little shirt I have every owned for my babies. It lights up and just looks adorable when they are wearing them. I got a size medium for my miniature poodle and he is short and chubby a little so it's kind of tight under his arms. So if your dog is a little plum I would recommend getting a size bigger because especially if you wash it, it will shrink too.The battery back is located inside in a Velcro pouch by the neck. You can barley feel it through the material because the battery compartment is very thin which is good. It's not uncomfortable for your doggy. The batteries come pre-installed in them already but comes with two extras. It runs on two lithium 3V CR2032 Batteries at a time and the batteries are supposed to last for quite some time.The hoodie is very soft and cozy, perfect for the cold season coming up and even more perfect for CHRISTMAS! It literally has a hoodie on the sweater but it does not have ear holes. If it came with ear holes that would be even better but you can always make some if you really want them. My dogs just wear the sweater with no hoodie on their heads... they don't like that haha.It also has a hole on the back where you can hook a harness up to the leash through the hoodie. So they can wear it when you walk them outside. I love this shirt and I will be getting more styles for my babies soon.

"The whole concept of these are pretty cool kind of like show and tell ya know? But the sizing is way off. Tried fitting them on my whole family and they just would not fit at all. They are very small in sizing so if you have even a tiny bit of fat on your arm, good luck. Even on really thin arms they do not fit and go up all the way and if you do, they just roll of after moving a bit with them on.They MAY fit a very thin 8-9 year old kid, but that is about all.

"I have a few different I phone 6 plus cases I switch between, but this one is at the top of my favorites because it's not only mixed with my two favorite colors, but it protects my phone like you wouldn't believe. Now the purple is like a lighter purple in person then in the listing picture, but it still looks amazing.This is like a two-in-one case because there is two parts to it. There is a rubber case, then a hard case. The rubber part is inside and protects your phone and cushions it, while the hard outer case protects from hard drops to the floor. It sticks up above the screen so your screen is safe. I am not even sure why they make cases that don't cover your phone completely including the screen, I don't see the point in that as if your drop your phone, you're out of luck.The rubber and plastic are a perfect combination together.

"This watch is beautiful. I have never seen a wooden watch like this one before. It goes together perfect basically with anything you wear, it's water resistant but I would not suggest showering with it and submerging it in full water like that.It tells you the time AND what day it is. Like for example ""31"" You know it's the 31st then. Hopefully you know what month you're in hahaThe band does not pinch you any way, and is very comfortable. It's easy to read, and have had no problems with it. To me this could be a woman's watch as well, not just for men. It's all what your style is really, but it looks like it could be worn by a male or female and look perfectly normal.The only problem we had with it was the clasp. It was a bit tricky to open but then I finally got it. That would be the only improvement I would say that would be nice if they adjusted. Besides that, there is no negatives we can find about this watch. It's just beautiful and it even came in a nice little watch box with a cleaning cloth to polish the screen.

" 1:14 MinsSo let me start out by saying that the color is pretty different from the listing picture. And I am actually quite glad it is. It's like a marble color mixed with a white. dark blue, and sky light blue color forming a beautiful design.The whole cover is made of silicone and it is quite stretchy. It's very easy to put on your xbox 360 controller and A LOT better then those hard case ones that you can put on your controller. And I'm saying this because I have had a few of those before and it was just a mess putting them on, and the buttons and screws not fitting right. Silicone is so much easier, and you can put it on and take it off within seconds.It gives your controller a nice touch and not just a basic black color anymore. I just wish there was more colors to choose from for the covers. Really worth getting thou if you are looking for a skin cover for your controllers.

" 1:17 MinsThis case is great and I cannot believe I did not have one sooner. I have cables all over my house. I must have at least well over 20 different cables for different devices, including backups.I finally have a place to store all my cords and know where they are and not lose them. There is a bunch of loops and pockets to store cords and other things in. It's two layers as well for easier access.You can put other things in besides just cords, such as your MP3 player, iPod, phone, etc. whatever you want to put in really. This would also be great for the car I think.The outside is made out of a waterproof material as well, and the zippers are pretty great quality.

" 0:43 MinsThis is a nice projector. In my video, my outlet was to far away from the wall I wanted to project on so I had to put it closer to the wall. So the screen is only covering a small portion of the wall.I used my own HDMI cord to connect it to my computer and play a video. The picture quality is amazing and it's easy to set up. Just make sure you take the lens cap off, plug it into the wall, then into your computer, hit menu on the remote, and I put it to  ""HDMI"". I was then connected to it and begun my video to play it.I would say you can't be further then 9-10 feet or the video picture comes in a little blurry. At least on my wall. If you are putting it on a projector screen, I think you will be able to move it further away and be able to have it come in clearly with no problems. To adjust the picture clearness, just turn the lens slightly to the left or right for better picture to adjust. Also the movie I am playing in the video, is not HD. It's ""HOCUS POCUS"" and is just standard.It comes with a little stand, but the stand barley holds the projector up and my projector kept falling over. So I just took the stand off and laid it flat. The stand screws into the bottom to the left side. I think that's the problem. If it was located in the middle and a little stronger, it would be fine. That's the only problem I had thou.This is great for family time to watch a movie, and I am especially using this (Like right now) to watch Halloween movies. The movies look amazing and even scarier like you're at a drive in. Love it.

"I got these for my friend who is 5'6 140 pounds and I got a size medium which fits her perfectly.The pants are pretty stretchable and look like real leather once you are wearing them. They are not to tight at all, and are like regular leggings but with a leather look. They are about 41"" from the top to the bottom of the pant leg.

"These are perfect for me. It's exactly the kind of Jewlery I would wear on a regular basis, and it fits my style choice.The world we live in now of days we can never be to safe. I always have something on me to protect such as pepper spray. I now wear these rings whenever I go out, especially at night. If you ever have to use them, punch as hard as you can and aim for the eyes.I got 6 rings, each different shapes to fit different sized fingers and they all fit me pretty well. They have little spikes on each one of them that are pretty sharp and will really do some damage if used properly.Wearing these gives me a peace of mind while I'm out, and they look fashionable. So you can't even tell they are really a defense item until you actually use them. So it will not cause any suspicion. Would recommend these to anyone.I love these rings, and was happy to be able to try these out as a sample to give my honest review on them to everyone.

"So the size of this 35""Lx23.5""W X 3/8""Thick. So it's pretty big, and perfect size for any litter box. The bottom of the mat is rubber and doesn't slide around on the floor. It's pretty good weight, so once you lay it flat, it stays put.My cat likes to push the litter out of her box when ever she goes to the bathroom. So I am constantly cleaning up after her and sweeping it up. Luckily I have not had to do that with this mat. Because it's large enough and the pattern of it catches the litter into the mat. So I just shake the mat out into a garbage bag when I'm cleaning it, and the litter comes right out of it.It's a nice little design, and even has a cute little cat picture in each corner for show. This mat is safe,non-toxic, and is water proof which is a plus because the water bowls are right next to it. This mat is certainly easy to clean and especially because it is waterproof because you can just hose it down or spray it to clean.I don't think it really makes a difference to my kitty, but it sure does to me haha Looks nice, and less of a mess!

" 1:17 MinsThis case is great and I cannot believe I did not have one sooner. I have cables all over my house. I must have at least well over 20 different cables for different devices, including backups.I finally have a place to store all my cords and know where they are and not lose them. There is a bunch of loops and pockets to store cords and other things in. It's two layers as well for easier access.You can put other things in besides just cords, such as your MP3 player, iPod, phone, etc. whatever you want to put in really. This would also be great for the car I think.The outside is made out of a waterproof material as well, and the zippers are pretty great quality. The insides are padded pretty good too so everything you put inside is sure to be safe and protected from water and any kind of drops and damage.I was happy to be able to try this out as a sample to give my honest review on it to everyone and glad I can find my cords easily now hahaIf you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those right away for you.

" 0:43 MinsThis is a nice projector. In my video, my outlet was to far away from the wall I wanted to project on so I had to put it closer to the wall. So the screen is only covering a small portion of the wall.I used my own HDMI cord to connect it to my computer and play a video. The picture quality is amazing and it's easy to set up. Just make sure you take the lens cap off, plug it into the wall, then into your computer, hit menu on the remote, and I put it to  ""HDMI"". I was then connected to it and begun my video to play it.I would say you can't be further then 9-10 feet or the video picture comes in a little blurry. At least on my wall. If you are putting it on a projector screen, I think you will be able to move it further away and be able to have it come in clearly with no problems. To adjust the picture clearness, just turn the lens slightly to the left or right for better picture to adjust. Also the movie I am playing in the video, is not HD. It's ""HOCUS POCUS"" and is just standard.It comes with a little stand, but the stand barley holds the projector up and my projector kept falling over. So I just took the stand off and laid it flat. The stand screws into the bottom to the left side. I think that's the problem. If it was located in the middle and a little stronger, it would be fine. That's the only problem I had thou.This is great for family time to watch a movie, and I am especially using this (Like right now) to watch Halloween movies. The movies look amazing and even scarier like you're at a drive in. Love it. I was so happy to be able to try this projector out at a discounted price so I could give my honest review on it to everyone.

" 0:45 MinsSo, to start you get tree packages delivered. 2 square boxes with each a bag of foam ball filling for the pillow. Then the other box is the pillow cover. The filling is basically just foam shaped into tiny little balls. You have to put this filling inside the bag that goes into the pillow cover.The pillow cover is not a fabric material. It's like a hard fabric that kind of feels like a tarp material. So you're going to want to put a blanket over top of when laying on it. Now I was confused on the filling. Mine came in two plastic bags, but the bags look differently then some of the other pictures on here. Not sure why they came like that? You have to put the filling inside yourself, and let me tell you, this is the part I hated because the foam just went everywhere. I wish it was a lot easier to put in. But it didn't help any that the bag you're supposed to put it in, only has a small opening. Not sure why they don't make the whole bigger. Would be soooo much easier.  Now maybe mine was harder because of the bags it came in. If it would have came in smaller bags like I see in the pictures, it probably would have been easier to get it the cover.Once I got all the foam inside the the mesh white baggy, I put it inside the actually pillow cover. The pillow cover zips, then Velcro's over so you cannot see the zipper. It's so nice to lay on. It's more like a bean bag pillow then an actual pillow.  It's nice thou.It could be used more then just a pillow. Kids can use it as a chair to watch tv in, or you could even use it for a bigger dog for the floor. It could be used for whatever really. Right now I use mine on my bed to just relax on and watch TV. I throw a blanket over it and it's really comfy.From the pictures you can see how big it is. On a three person couch, it covers about 2/3 quarters of it and still hangs off on the sides. I really love it thou, and was glad I could try it out at a discounted price so I could give my honest review on it to everyone. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of the filling and the difficulty I had getting it in the bag. Definitely a two person job to get it in haha. Besides that, it's a great little bean bag Chair pillow.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will try and wander those for you right away.

" 3:22 MinsI am in love with this set. First let me begin by saying that the blue mouse pad that's in the picture/video is not what comes with the set. I misplaced the one that came with so am using my other one. I will post pictures of the one that comes with the set, when I find it(:MOUSE:It is a USB mouse as well as the keyboard. The mouse has a pretty good length of cord to it, but I just keep it bunched up because I don't need to extend it far at all to use it. It changes colors on it's own and smoothes in and out of each color. It's more like about 3 colors at a time that display through the mouse and change to different colors. I would say the colors change about every 5 seconds and go in and out. It's not like a blinking thou, just a light smooth in and out so it's nice. It has a great design to it and you can grip it very well and click with ease. You can also change the DPI (mouse speed of the cursor) by pressing the white button on top. Now in the description it says it has 3 DPI modes,  600/1000/1600. However, It seems like it has 4. So the other DPI speed may be 800. I am not sure of this thou, all I know is I can click it 3 times before it goes back to it's slowest speed (600).Onto the KEYBOARD:This is by far my favorite keyboard I have ever owned. I love all things that glow like gaming headsets, etc. But I have never owned a glowing keyboard before and I should have. At first I thought it only glowed red, but then I actually read the listing and saw the directions. You can change it to 3 different colors. Red, Blue or Purple. You can also change the brightness of the keyboard and even turn the color off all together.*******************************************************************************************************************Directions on changing the keyboard color:Press and hold the ""Fn"" key + ""SL"" key (At the top near right corner) at the same time. This will change your colors and you can pick the one you want.Directions on changing the keyboard color to switch in and out of the 3 colors:Press and hold the ""Fn"" key + ""PS"" key (Near the ""SL"" key) at the same time. This will fade in and out of the three colors.Directions on changing the keyboard color to flash the same color:Hold the ""Fn"" key + ""PB"" key (Near the ""SL"" key) at the same time. This will make it flash one color. Now when you first hit the two keys together, it always flashes red. If you want it to flash blue or purple, simple just press the ""Fn"" and ""PB"" again or until you are at the color you want to flash.Directions on changing the brightness of color:Press and hold the ""Fn"" key and then press and release the upper (Higher brightness) or lower (Lower brightness) arrow that are located down by the right corner.  I made a video of it too so hope it helps if you are having trouble with it.*******************************************************************************************************************This keyboard also has a windows key on it and some windows functions like like mail key and so on. It has volume keys to change the volume of your computer while playing music or a video too. They keyboard is easy to use and  makes very little clicking noise which I know can drive most people crazy with the annoying loud clicking. Everything is spaced out perfectly. It's such a cool keyboard especially to use at night sense everything glows. The whole look of it, I just love. It looks like thunder cracking when it's on blue or purple color. So pretty.

" 1:18 MinsI think this is seen as more of a couple item to use together, but you can so have fun by using this yourself for solo play.What it comes with:-Hard case to put everything away in-C-Shape Silica Gel Vibrator-Remote-Charger- And a little net baggy to put your toy and remote in to store.The vibrator is very flexible and can be bent each and every way imaginable. The remote runs on 2 AAA batteries that controls the vibrator. The remote has 2 buttons, ON/OFF and 30 button mode. To use this toy both buttons on both items need to be turned on. The remote has to be on the ON (Indicator Will light up red when on), and the vibrator has to be turned on. On the big piece of it, there is a little button you need to hit on (Indicator will light up red when on) so the remote can work.The remote is easy to use and has many different vibration patterns that switches between the two pieces. To change to a different vibration pattern, you just hit the ""30"" button on the remote and it switches to the next pattern in line.The vibration in it is very strong and powerful. Like I said this does not have to be used with a partner, you can use it by yourself. There is many possibilities how to use this, it all comes down to how you would like to use it really. To charge the vibration part, you just plug the wall charger into the big piece end and you are good to go. So that part runs on the charger, and the remote runs on 2 AAA batteries.This toy is a lot of fun and could so spice up the bedroom with your partner. So recommended to anyone.

" 0:20 MinsI put this on my kitchen chair because that is usually where I am sitting doing work on my computer. I like to sit forward but have my chair back because I get up and down constantly, and it's a pain to keep pulling the chair in all the way then back when I have to get up. So I love how this cushion fills in that little space for me.It feels amazing on the back thou, very soft, and actually helps you sit up more straight rather then slouching. The strap that comes on it already, is adjustable but it's still a little big and not tight on my dining chair. I think its more for thicker chairs, like a car headrest, or desk chair, etc. But it still holds it in place enough where it's not falling over on my dining chair.It also comes with an extender that just connects onto the belt that's already attached to the cushion. That extender can add an additional 18 inches and can also be adjusted for thicker chairs.I'm actually sitting back on it now, as I am writing this review and it relieves your back and just feels great. It has a breathable mesh cover on it so your back can breath as well and not get hot. That's a plus, especially when it's hot out. No body like sticking to anything, right?

" 1:02 MinsI have never had a strainer that collapses. So this is new to me, and the first time I have tried one. It's pretty neat and works great. That strainer basically has 2 different sizes to use to drain things as you can see in the pictures. You just push it out or in to get those sizes.The green handle has an indent on the top of it for your thumb, then 3 indents on the back of it for 3 of your fingers to go while holding it and you get a better grip. Then it even has a hole on the end so you can hang it up on a hook in your kitchen. Because it's collapsible, it because pretty flat and takes up even littler room, so space is not a problem with this, it's very easy to use and store. With the silicone heat-resistant handle, it's even better for me because I tend to burn myself in the kitchen, so I like that as well that the handle does not get hot.Then it also has another little white handle above the strainer part for you to hold while draining or you can put it up on a put to hold onto the side of the pot after you have your noodles on it, and ready to add the sauce, etc. It's easy to wash as well because it's dishwasher safe. So just toss it in the dish washer when done with it if needed, and you are good to go. I was very happy to have the chance to review this at a discounted price so I could give my honest review on it to everyone. Does what it's supposed to do, and even better .5 stars.

" 0:29 MinsBy far the best jump rope I have ever owned. The ones I usually have are just those basic plastic ones, I'm pretty sure everyone knows what I am talking about. So I was impressed with this one as soon as I opened it out of the box.To start with, the rope length is 9.18 feet but can be adjusted to any length desired by unscrewing the caps at the bottoms of the handles and adjusting the cord and tie-ing it so the length is shorter.The cord is pretty thick, hard to damage, and tangle free which always a plus. Who wants to sit there and untie a tiny knot from a rope, and how they got there in the rope to begin with, puzzles us all haha.The handles are thick and made of a tough foam for a better slip proof grip for both hands. It even has 4 indents in the foam for your fingers to go if you would like to use them. They are pretty far apart thou, and I have small hands because I'm small so I really don't place my finger in each indent, but it's an option for others.All around this is a great jump rope for work outs, or for kids to play outside with.. and I cannot think of any negatives about it. I was able to try it out as a sample to give my honest review on it to everyone, and I am very pleased with it's quality. Really recommended.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will do my best to answer those right away for you.

"I just love my little Fire HD. The picture is beautiful and so clear with colors that pop. I must admit, I thought this was for only things like reading books. I was never a big fan of reading books ever. But this is so much more then that. You can download apps, go on Facebook, watch movies, access Twitter, check you E-mail, look at recipes, and so much more.It's light weight and easy to store and out away places with no problems. It even has a front and rear facing camera that takes pretty good pictures. The screen is also easy to navigate and you just have to lightly tap the screen and swipe to move around from page to page, or open up new tabs/apps.

"It came in a plastic baggy and inside were 10 individual wrapped Lego men. In each indivisual bag their were 10 pieces each. So I think each bag comes with 10pcs to make each little lego guy. I'm giving these to my nephew so I did not wan't to unwrap them and put them togeather, wanted to let him do it.No 10 lego guys you get are the same, they come mixed and you get a random 10. Each one has theme to it. Like a chef, cop, pirate, cowboy, etc. They are regular little lego men thou. You can attach them onto the lego pieces as well, so they seem like legit lego pieces, not sure why it doesn't say it in the listing? But they look and act as real legos and the kiddies will sure have a blast with them. By Nephew is going through a lego phase right now. Lego pieces, EVERYWHERE. If you know what I mean, then you understand how bad a lego hurts when you step on it..Great set thou, and totally worth getting. Would also be a great idea to get a few packages or a larger pack and give them away and goodie bags at a party sense they come individually wrapped already, you just throw them right in.

"I love how there is numerous uses for these nets and it even shows in the listing pictures. For example, you could use them for the towels like it shows, or stuffed animals, etc. What you get is the net, and the hooks and everything to pin it up to the wall.I am using mine now for my dogs. I put it practically on the floor in the corner, and put all their squeaky toys and bones in there. They take them and go as they please. They have a lot of toys and bones all over the house so it's easy to just throw them in the corner net on the floor, and then when they want them, they can grab them their self.

" 1:13 MinsThis is very nice quality grill brush. Our family loves to BBQ and have cookouts with the fam all the time so this comes in handy every time we decide to cook out on the grill.The brush is made very sturdy, and is strong. Nothing seems to be out of place on it. The bristles are tight and straight, and ready to take a good scrubbing. Then you have the top of it which is the scrapper to clean of your grill and get it looking all new again. Who wants to cook on dirty grill? I don't think anybody does haha. What I was impressed with on the scrapper was the sides of it. It has a place where the grill bars can fit perfect on the side of the scraper so you can clean each grill par perfectly. Love that.Then the hand is slanted and even has an indent where your thumb can go while you are using it. It also has a hole where so you can hang the brush on a hook. Hoping this brush lasts us awhile, seems like it will thou. I was very happy to be able to try this out as a sample to give my honest review on it.

"This has so many tips for the business world and about the trading industry, it seems like the book never ends. There is actual useful information on everything you could possibly want to know about it.Unfortunately, I would not suggest this to beginners. It's more suitable for people who are already familiar with this type of work. That's just my opinion thou.

"I am very clueless when it comes to anything like this. Believe it or not, I have quite a few friends who do canning and see pictures from them from time to time on FB in my newsfeed. They have gardens and make their own sauces and such. They go on about how it taste so much better then store bought sauces or fruits.I have plenty of free time so I want to take up a hobby and start something new, and this looked interested. I have learned so much step by step on how to do this and I can't wait to try my new skills out. It is a very delicate process and I had no idea how much you actually needed to know to get it right.

"About a few months ago, I had purchased some silicone wine glasses. Before that I never even tried silicone wine glasses, so I said what the hey, and I got myself some just to see how they were. When they arrived, I regreted my dession real fast. They smelt AWFUL. I am not sure why they smelled, but they had a distinct smell to them that I could not drink out of them. I scrubbed, and scrubbed them and the smell would just not go away. I tossed them out of course. Not sure what the problem was, but it may be of how they came packaged, still unsure but it was not worth it.So then I seen these colorful wine glasses, and I wanted to try them out and give silicone glasses another try. I did not regret this decision. They have no smell to them what so ever, and they smell clean. The colors are vibrant and pretty as well. Each one holds 12oz of what ever you want to put in them.Now I know what you're thinking if you never had silicone glasses before, because this is what I thought before I tried them out. When you think of silicone you are probably thinking of flimsy not being able to hold anything in them, right? Well that's what I thought. But that's not the case with these. They are kind of like a silicone hard plastic. They hold their shape very well and are not like if you move the wrong way and hold to tight your drink will be all over you, no. If you hold them like a civil person they will be just fine haha. It even comes with a carry bag for them which is great if you're going out on a boat and need to pack them up or such.They do what they're supposed to do, and they are quite the little cups. These would also be great for the kids at parties (NO WINE OF COURSE) but to put some apple cider or something in so they can feel like the grownups at dinner. I was happy to be able to find and get these at discounted price so I could give my honest review on them to everyone.

"This sponge is great for all skin types. I have very sensitive skin so have to use soft things to wash with. Like I cannot use washcloths because they are to hard. So I was very happy with this sponge when it came. It's very soft and gentle on the skin. It's a very pretty pink, and holds soaps/cleansers well and makes bubbles to clean the skin.It has a strong holder on it, so you can hang it on the shower knob or any hooks. It is a lot better then ones in the stores and is great quality.

"This is a very nice stand for your iPad, apple watch/any watch, and your mobile phones. Currently I do not have a an apple watch, but I plan on getting one in the future. As of right now I use this stand for iPhone and iPad while they charging.  The stand can hold up to 3 iPhones, a watch, and 3 pens. Or 2 iPhones/phones, iPad, watch, and 3 pens.The holders where your phones and/or iPad go have silicone in between them to better protect your devices from scratches which I like. They are wide enough where your device can have a slim case on them and still fit. But I had a wallet case on my iPhone 6 plus and wouldn't fit between the slot holder right as it was to wide.You can charge your iPad and iPhones if they are laying on their side so you can get to the charger ports. As for the where the apple watch goes, that part is magnetic and can either be taken on or off, up to you. The magnet is quite strong thou and goes right into place and stays there with no problems. It has an indent on the side where your charger cord for the watches goes and can connect to your watch.The pen holders in the back, there is 3 spots. 2 of the holes are the same size, and then the other one is a bit bigger for bigger pens or if you want to turn your pen upside down and put the cap first.The whole stand itself thou is very smoothe and it looks great sitting on my night stand next to my bed when I charge my devices at night.

"Nice little night light. I got the white one and it looks perfect in my kitchen and adds just the write look. It has 3 settings on it, SOUND/PHOTO/OFF. It's a button on the side where you switch it to the setting you prefer. The SOUND setting works by voices. When it's plugged in, and on this setting, it will light up every once and awhile where there is sound, even where it is light in the room.The PHOTO setting works by the light and is a sensor. When it is on this setting, and you turn the lights off in that room, the night light will turn on and stay on until the lights come back on in that room.When it is on the OFF setting, it will stay off and not turn on until you turn it to either the SOUND or PHOTO setting.It's a nice little light thou, and would work perfect for the kitchen, bathroom, or even a child bedroom that is afraid of the dark.

"Castor oil is great for many uses such as, acne, sunburn,stretch marks, hair, age spots, and many kind of skin conditions. The reason I wanted to try this out was because I have severe eczema. I am rarely ever comfortable and my skin dries out so fast. I am constantly putting lotions and creams on but it's not a fix, just a temporary solution.So I begun to use this castor oil and so far it has been helping me severely. It helps with itching and dry skin the most and my skin has been getting more clear because I have not been scratching so much anymore. I have only been using it for a few weeks, but it has been helping so much where I am upset with myself I have not tried this years ago. I use medicated creams and such and all this time I could have been getting castor oil for a lot less money and it works better... haha go figure.  I guess sometimes cheap is better.It comes sealed and with a different nozzle which I have on it. What's nice about the nozzle is you can twist it. And by twisting it, you can open and close it, but also control how much oil comes out at a time. Like I always just twist mine a little so only a few drops come out at a time. About just 10 drops can cover your whole entire arm. So this does last awhile.It has the feeling of I would say vegetable oil. It's thick at first and feels like vegetable oil, and even looks like it, but when you put it on your skin it thins out and doesn't feel heavy and weird. It does however leave a greasy feel but with my condition, I prefer that so it locks in moisture and keeps my skin hydrated. It doesn't really have a smell to it either which is good.I really am so happy with this and was able to try it out at a discounted price to give my honest review on it to everyone. If anything changes with it I will edit my review but I think it's been long enough to safely say I cannot find anything negative at all with this.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will try and answer those right away for you.

"These are such cute little clips. It comes with 48 colored clips. 12 blue, 12,pink, 12 green, and 12 orange. I know the description says yellow, but it's not yellow at all, it's orange. So that is the colors you get. Each color has the same exact face for that color. For example, the orange has a smiley face on all 12 orange clips. Then the pink clips have a winky smiley face on all 12 pink clips, and so on.They hold and have a really strong grasp and they are great quality.

"So I got the black sheet set for my queen sized bed. The sheet set is very soft and comfortable and matches my black lacquer furniture and purple blankets perfectly. The sheet set is a light black and then the stripes on it are an even darker black.I have had some sheets where they sounds like cardboard. Like when you moved on them, they would make like a wrinkly sound and it would be so annoying. After experiencing that, I had to switch to more softer sheets, and these are even softer then my other soft sheets which is amazing.

"I opened these up and saw 9 rocks. 3 of the bigger stones were engraved with gold writing which read, ""Body"", ""Relax"" and ""Soul"". Then the other 6 were just plain rocks. I thought to myself, they're just rocks. So I looked up ways on what to do with them. A lot of different things came up.. things that could really help and benefit myself, which I was surprised by.One of the best uses I found that could help me the most was the cooling therapy method which helps with inflammation. I have eczema and my skin becomes inflamed sometimes during breakouts and I usually use ice or something cool because I feel relief from it. I put the rocks in the freezer for about 10 minutes, then places them on my skin. Let me tell you, it was a lot better then ice. It helps me greatly. The soothing cold feeling of the rocks can help with a lot of things. You can use these for massages and even warm them up if that's what you prefer. It's all up to you and your preference. There's many possibilities thou.They even come with a nice little carrying pouch. However, the 9 rocks won't fit neatly inside the little pouch.

"This stone is a light Amethyst color. It's a very smoothe rock, with a carved thumb indent where you place your thumb and rub it.

"So I got these for my my niece who is not yet here yet, but I wanted to leave a review on these blankets right away. So I used my puppy to demonstrate these swaddling blankets haha. What you get is two very colorful vibrant 47"" blankets. Each blanket is made out of 100% muslin cotton, and they have adorable vibrant color patterns on them of sea animals. One of them has starfish, fish,and bubbles. When the other has, bubbles,starfish, seahorses, and little squids.They're a very light material and not heavy at all which is good because in the summer your baby will not get to warm. In the winter when it's cold you can just wrap the blanket around more then once like a cozy cocoon and make it warm for you little one as well.They are not just for swaddling blankets thou. They could be used for many things such as to just line the crib so your baby can lay on it, or you can use it to put down when you have to change them. The large size can offer many possibilities.The seller is very nice and you can tell cares about her/his customers. They even list their contact E-mail on the back of the packaging if you need anything at all.

" 0:55 MinsThis is pretty easy to use. Some may be like oh why go through all the trouble of having this machine that just shoots water, when I can just buy some dental floss? Well I'll tell you. For myself I have really sensitive gums. I mean really sensitive, every day when I brush and floss my gums will just bleed like someone knocked me in my mouth. It was really bad. I have been using this and ever sense my gums are not that inflamed anymore. When I brush my teeth they don't bleed as much at all. And when I floss with this machine, my gums are perfectly fine.So let me describe the machine starting from the bottom to the top. At the bottom it has grips so when it is on a counter it is not sliding all over the place. This is also where the power cord connects. Write into the bottom and it will tell you in the manual where.Then we have our middle part. In the middle we have the one button which powers the machine ON/OFF with just one touch. Then we have the piece of course where the attachments connect to. It has different settings, and to change the settings, you just slide it up or down with your thumb while in use. This is connected to a tangle free cord which I was impressed with because when your done with it, the cord automatically goes back to how it was before in circles so there is no cord everywhere.Now to the left we have a little compartment that stores up to 9 attachments. This machine comes with 5 different attachments. 4 of the same one but is different colors along the base so multiple family members can use their own attachment. Then it has a tongue attachment which cleans and washes your tongue.Now the top is the cover for the whole machine but it also converts into the water holder for the machine. You just flip it upside down and fill it with water and then turn your machine on and start washing your mouth.I must say, I could not believe how much this cleaned my mouth. I brushed and flossed my teeth very well like any other morning and the first time I got this and tried it out, I just could not believe. It really does work and it is simply amazing. I felt like I was at the dentist getting professional cleaning. You know the feeling when you're just done getting your teeth brushes, washed, flossed and you just feel so refreshed?

" 0:44 MinsThis is just Simpy great in every way. My short haired tabby cat is constantly shedding all over the house, especially because of the warm weather now, the hair she drops off of her can be made into another cat. You wouldn't believe it.This deshedding tool fits in your hand perfectly with a nice curve so your hand is comfortable. The brush part at first, looked very sharp to me. I was hesitant to use it at first so I tried it on myself at first. It did not hurt one bit. So I used it on my cat and she loved it. She purred and just stood there as I brushed her coat out. I gathered up so much hair just by brushing her from the neck down to the tail a few times. Surprisingly, all of it stay locked into the brush and didn't go to the floor.When I was done, I just went over to the garbage can, pushed the button on the back of it that pushed the hair forward on the brush so I could just wipe it right off into the trash can. I love this brush and so does my baby. I am happy I was able to try it out as a sample and give my honest review on it to everyone. Very pleased with it, and especially happy it's not all on my bed anymore where I have to take a lint roller to it! hahaIf you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those right away for you.

"So these came in the mail, and when I took them out, I thought they were finger rings. Thy are about the size of a soda cap but are very stretchy. These can be worn by adults or children because of the size. They are a bit snug on the wrist, but not like tight where it's going to hurt you at all. I actually like how they feel and how they are snug because I have had wrist bands before and once you put any keys or something on, they weight the wrist band down and it just slips off your wrist easily.So with these, I love how I can put a few rings or keys on them and they stay put on my wrist. I also like how a child could where these as well and won't lose them off their wrists so easily. I guess it all has to do with how big your wrist is. If you are a very big man, then no, I would not suggest these for you. But they are fine for women with thin wrists and children.The colors are very vibrant and colorful and I like that as well. I think the colors you get are all random, but I am pleased with the colors I got and I was happy to be able to try this out as a sample to give my honest review on them to everyone.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those right away for you.

" 0:55 MinsThis is pretty easy to use. Some may be like oh why go through all the trouble of having this machine that just shoots water, when I can just buy some dental floss? Well I'll tell you. For myself I have really sensitive gums. I mean really sensitive, every day when I brush and floss my gums will just bleed like someone knocked me in my mouth. It was really bad. I have been using this and ever sense my gums are not that inflamed anymore. When I brush my teeth they don't bleed as much at all. And when I floss with this machine, my gums are perfectly fine.So let me describe the machine starting from the bottom to the top. At the bottom it has grips so when it is on a counter it is not sliding all over the place. This is also where the power cord connects. Write into the bottom and it will tell you in the manual where.Then we have our middle part. In the middle we have the one button which powers the machine ON/OFF with just one touch. Then we have the piece of course where the attachments connect to. It has different settings, and to change the settings, you just slide it up or down with your thumb while in use. This is connected to a tangle free cord which I was impressed with because when your done with it, the cord automatically goes back to how it was before in circles so there is no cord everywhere.Now to the left we have a little compartment that stores up to 9 attachments. This machine comes with 5 different attachments. 4 of the same one but is different colors along the base so multiple family members can use their own attachment. Then it has a tongue attachment which cleans and washes your tongue.Now the top is the cover for the whole machine but it also converts into the water holder for the machine. You just flip it upside down and fill it with water and then turn your machine on and start washing your mouth.I must say, I could not believe how much this cleaned my mouth. I brushed and flossed my teeth very well like any other morning and the first time I got this and tried it out, I just could not believe. It really does work and it is simply amazing. I felt like I was at the dentist getting professional cleaning. You know the feeling when you're just done getting your teeth brushes, washed, flossed and you just feel so refreshed? That's what I felt like. It can go up to a very high pressure for an even deeper cleaning, but it's still gentle on the gums and feels kind of like it's massaging your gums. After your done you just keep running the machine until all the water is out of it, wipe the machine off because your bound to get some water on it with all the cleaning, (At least I did), then store it away back in the box under the bathroom sink and you're good to go.I simply love this machine and I happy I was able to get this at a discounted price so I could give my honest review on it to everyone.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those right away for you.

"These are nice little pins for keeping things closed such as chips, cereals, breads, etc. They are a bit smaller then regular sized clothespins, so I would say these are mini ones. You get a total of 40 in the pack. 10 yellow, 10 green, 10 red, and 10 blue.They are not completely that strong, but they do grab and hold pretty well. I just wouldn't say they have the best grasp on them. They work great for keeping foods fresh and sealed thou, like chips which is what I mostly use them for. So for that kind of thing they work great for. For holding and hanging clothes up on a line, I don't think they would be that great for honestly.They are cute thou, I like the colors, and I was happy to be able to  get these at a discounted price to give my honest review on them to everyone.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those for you right away.

"These pans are absolutely gorgeous. They can pretty much match any kitchen and add a beautiful touch to them. They came packages so neatly and when I took them out they were so shiny I did not even want to cook them. I just wanted to put them up on my stove and be like ""Hey! Hey! Look how shiny my pots and pans are!"" haha.The set includes:10.5-inch Fry pan1.75-quart Sauce pan1.75-quart, 2.25-Quart, 3.25-Quart, 5.75-Quart Casserole with lids.The 10.5-inch Fry pan even has a handle on the side as well which a lot of frying pans don't have. They only have the one handle. All pans and pots come with their own glass lid that is very clear and you can see through while cooking. Each lid has an easy to grab handle and not one of those little tiny knobs like others do that you can barley grab (I'm guilty of having those before). Also each lid has a tiny little hole in it so the steam does not fog up the whole glass lid. This is also very great for gas stove users such as myself because I have had pots/pans before with lids but no holes on the lids, and because of this, it built up so much water on the lids, dripped down the sides and put out the gas flame. That was not good at all. So I really like how these differ from others.The large handles even have thumb indents where your thumb goes when you pick them up. They are just such a beautiful set that are well made. I was very happy to be able to get these as sample to give my honest review on them to everyone and I am very pleased.

"Length:: 0:48 MinsThis Oximeter seems to work pretty well. I tried it on multiple people in my family, and the results came up about the same how their supposed to.It runs on 2 AAA batteries (Not included) which at first I did not know how to get them in there and was confused. Then I figured it out. On the back part where it says ""TPHealth Pulse Oximeter"", there is a silver button. Press that in and hold it, then slide the whole thing down and that's how you open the the battery compartment.It is very light weight and easy to use. The manual it comes with basically tells you everything you need to know about it and how to use it. The screen is very clear and the numbers are as well. While you are taking your pulse, you can even click the button on the top by the screen, and change the screen direction to which way it is facing.It also comes with a strap where you can put in on the Oximeter and then be able to wear it around your neck or your wrist so you don't lose it. How ever I was not able to put the strap through the tiny hole so easily. It's located it a tight spot so it's kind of difficult, for me at least. I will keep trying and will use a pin then hopefully I'll get it through. Other then that, I think it's a pretty good finger pulse meter and I was happy to be able to get it at a discounted price to give my honest review on it to everyone.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those for you right away.

"So I got a large size for my toy poodle. He has frequent accidents and likes to lift his leg on this when he is upset or when I go out anywhere. He is very small and only weighs about 5 pounds. His waist is tiny and this fits him perfectly just right and snug. The material is very stretchy and seems very comfy and not at all like a stiff material. I like how these are made very much because the ones I have now I got form Walmart by simple solution I believe, it cuts into their skin because it is very tight around the edges. This wrap by JD Gems is nothing like that thank goodness.Inside it there is a little flap that you can easily put a pad in there. I put a little maxi pad in there for the accidents so I can just change those out frequently instead of washing it every time he goes in them or lifts his leg on anything. It's a cute little design, you just get rando colors. They kind of look like little tutu's haha. But based on how small the large was, I don't think the sizing would be good for any doggy past the size of about a 12 pound poodle, and that's for an XXL I would suggest.I like it for my baby and I ma glad it fits him, I know these sizes tend to run small so I wanted to get a size up. I was happy to be able to have the chance to be able to get this as a sample and give my honest review on it to everyone. I love it, and recommend it to any doggy that likes to lift his leg on things and still has accidents.If you have any questions at all, just comment below and I will answer those right away for you.

"The Lumenata Pro mouse is by far the best mouse I've ever owned. The box has a nice window so you can view the product before opening it. It has a manual and a mini cd that will download the software onto your computer to better customize your mouse to fit your needs. It has a 1.8 heavy duty braided cable that is a 2.0 usb gold plated.It has 5 LED colors indicating different profiles and different characters or games. it weighs 170g so its just the right weight for in my hand and my husbands large hand. This mouse has a insane 12000 FPS rate and 8200 DPI!!! It also has a soft rubber black matte finish on the top and partly on the sides so it feels great in your hand so I had no problem playing with my husband for a couple hours without hurting my hand.This mouse has a omniscroll so it can scroll in 4 different directions. It  also has a programmable X&Y axis and it has 11 buttons on it and 9 are programmable so it helps take my other hand off the keyboard so its very easy to do macro and kiting.My husband has a $100 mouse and we fight over using this bad boy. I catch him using it more then his own, But I'm a nice wife so I let him borrow it lol.I (and my husband apparently) were very happy to receive this mouse at a discount to review!

"The Rooted gaming mouse pad comes in a really cool hexagon packaging and is pretty sturdy so it does not get crushed in the mail.It's large which makes it perfect for gaming but we still use it as an everyday mouse pad as well. It is a slick black design with a deep red circuit board look to it in the top right.With a medium friction level pad it is perfect for me doing everyday computer work and my husband and kids playing computer games. My husband loves that his mouse glides across it while hes fully immersed into his games, while the bottom being natural Eco friendly rubber the pad doesn't slip or slide around no matter how vigorously its being used.This mouse pad is able to keep up with my husbands mouse that he plays at 8200 DPI and hasn't given him a single issue. He loves Sentey's gaming products and that is all he uses now.This Sentey gaming mouse pad is amazing! I was thrilled to get this as a sample to give an honest review on it.

"I love this case because I have a tendency to bring my phone in the bathroom to play music every day when I am in the shower. They say this is bad for your phone because of the steam and could get water in your phone. So this made me nervous and I'm glad I got the opportunity to give my honest review on this case to everyone at a discounted price.The case is water proof now from steam drops etc. But thank goodness I did not have to experience dropping it completely under water or anything.  Phew... I don't want to either! I got the pink case and it's just great and protects your phone all over the place, from the plug ports, to the screen, the sides, all over 360 degrees.What I was real impress with was how this case already comes with a screen built into it. BUT I already a REALLY thick screen protector on my phone that was tempered glass and I mean probably the thickest screen protector you can get. So as I was putting on the case I jsut kept thinking to myself, I really hope I don't have to take my screen protector off, because I'm not doing it for this case. I was worries it was going to register my finger when I touched the screen because it basically would have 2 screen protectors that were really thick on top of one another. Thank goodness that was not the case! It works just fine! So no, you do not have to take your screen protector off to use this case.The design is pretty cute (Well for the pink that is) and where the thumb print is, that works perfectly as well with no problems. So it's not just water proof, but it will hold up and protect your screen if it falls on top a hard floor. I know the falling part for sure because I dropped it twice already. Once when I got out of my truck, than again on my kitchen tile floor. My phone was alive still thank god, but no surprise there.It also comes with a little wrist strap which goes on the corner of the case so you can carry around on your wrist, I really needed this for how clumsy I am. Then it comes with two extra port plugs in case you rip your off or something I guess, and a screen cloth. I also like how it is clear on the back side so you can see what color your iPhone actually is. I don't see that with my other cases and now I can. I mean you pick the color you want, to be able to see it right? So get a case where you can.If you have any questions, just comment below and I will answer those right away for you.

" 0:59 MinsSo I don't read the descriptions very well as you can tell, I was not expecting a hard mouse pad. I have other gaming pads from this company Sentey that I use, and they are all fabric. So I did not know how much I was going to like this one. It's a hard plastic pad that is not bendable nor can you roll it up or anything. It is flat at all times.The bottom of it has the same kind of material that is on the back of a fabric mouse pad, but the top is completely plastic. Now I have never used one of these pads before so I am not use to how it feels when I am gliding my mouse on it yet. It feels like you are using it on a plastic surface which is exactly what it is. Now the real why I like it thou is because, when your mouse is on it, it does have a better performance with it. Your mouse can move a lot better and quicker.

"Amope's Pedi Perfect is aptly named...if you want to get your feet pretty for sandals, this is the gizmo for you. I've been using it for several weeks, and my feet have been transformed. After using boots for many months, my feet were neglected, tough, and quite ugly. After several sessions of Pedi Perfect, they look rejuvenated and feel so soft. It got to the point I was snagging my tights on the bottom skin of my toes. All that roughness is gone!Good idea to keep up the routine during the colder weather...so your tootsies don't get snaggly. And it is so easy to use. Just take the cover off the roller head, twist the middle silver band to the ""on"" position, and start rolling! I started to feel the difference at the first try...and by the fourth use, beautiful feet! My toes were worthy of some nice polish, and open toed shoes.

"This is a very special pet blanket. With three cats, I have quite a variety of throws/blankets for them, and this one is by far the largest, and also the prettiest! The colors are bright and clear, and the blanket is of very good quality, and washes and dries beautifully. It has a threaded edge that looks very sturdy and should last a long time and through many washes. It's 100% polyester, and the suggestion is to wash warm/dry low. I washed it in cold, and drying did not take long at all.It has a fleece side, and a plain side. Strangely, my youngest cat likes the plain side best (perhaps the fleece side will be preferred in the winter).

"I've compared Kind Organics Women's Once Daily to the brand I've been using and it compares most favorably with it, with the added assurance that the ingredients are certified organic, and non-GMO. The tablets are vegan, and listed under ""other ingredients"" there are things like organic tapioca and brown rice, which I assume is used as a binder (the one I have been using has carnauba wax...so I guess all vitamin products need something ""sticky"")The capsules are nicely coated and easy to swallow, with a very faint fruity aroma...and this may seem insignificant, but it means a lot to me: The packaging. It is so aesthetically pleasing. From the embossed box to the lovely container label, it tells me that Kind Organics cares about their product.

"Mead's Academie Water-Soluble Watercolour Pan Set is ideal for travel, for small projects like card making, and taking outdoors for a plein air session. The sturdy metal container (so nice to have metal instead of plastic...feels like the ""good old days"" when things were made to last) is light and opens easily, but also shuts firmly with a ""click,"" so no danger of losing your brush inside. The brush that comes with the set is surprisingly good too...I was about to use my own brush (I'm fussy about brushes), but decided to try the one in the box first, and stayed with it. I was amazed at how well it did even the very detailed sections of my ""test picture.""There is a good selection of colors in the set, and they are rather ""light and breezy"" shades. There is no bright red, for instance, but rather a delicious hue of deep pink...what I like to think of a ""watermelon."" The colors are very well suited to painting landscapes and seascapes (the blues perfect for the ocean)...and the inside top of the container, divided into 3 sections, serves as a palette for mixing the lovely subtle colors.All in all, good quality item and excellent value.

"I have 3 cats, and the youngest of the family (now 5 years old) took possession of this wonderful cat bed and said ""mine mine mine""! She snuggles down in it, and since it has a ""roof,"" it gives her more privacy then the other cat beds I have scattered around for their use.It is light and soft, and can be flattened for mailing or storing. The fabric is a lovely design and is aesthetically pleasing, and since it has a peaked ""roof,"" looks a little like a modern stained glass window. It is also washable (wash warm/dry low) and looks very sturdy in its construction. The ease of washing it appeals to me a lot. With 3 cats, I like to keep everything exceedingly clean.With any new cat furniture or accessory, I always sprinkle a tiny bit of catnip on it, to encourage the fur friends to investigate it. This bed did not take long to be discovered, and Frankie, the little diva baby, got there first. The size is perfect for a small to average sized cat, and a large cat who likes to sleep curled up will appreciate it too (my plus-sized Maggie tried it and liked it until Frankie sent her packing).I'm thrilled with this cat bed...and Frankie thinks it's Purrfect!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OTES963GZ73F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I00LJ34#wasThisHelpful","R3OTES963GZ73F","AQ8DU6XVA3USJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Kind Organics B-12 spray is an extraordinary way to get your B-12 intake; fast, easily absorbed in your body, and furthermore, delicious! It is sweet and fruity. Raspberry, and an organic raspberry flavoring are among the ingredients, and it's the raspberry that is the most immediate flavor for me.The packaging says ""promotes concentration and energy"" and with my summer garden in full swing, and learning a new language (Russian!) I need a lot of both. B-12 also helps your metabolism and immune system, and at 70 years old and with cancer, I need both of these aids too.Shake the bottle well, stick out your tongue, spray, and voila!

"This WattsBeauty bottle says: ""Works great on ageing skin, uneven skin tones, dry skin, blemishes and more""...I have all of these things, and the ""more"" would be wrinkles and incredibly sensitive skin. I'm 70, and most skin creams, and all sunblock that I've tried on the market today irritate my skin. This WattsBeauty product feels wonderful, with not the slightest bit of sensitivity or irritation.With just a few days of using this WattsBeauty serum, I can feel the tightening and smoothing, and can see the difference too. It's excellent to put on after taking a shower. I wait a few minutes, and then put on a moisturizer, usually Argan Oil. It has a handy pump that puts just the right amount in the palm of my hand, and a little goes a very long way. Just one squirt will do your whole face, and neck too.

"I've tried many dandelion teas, and this one, from Traditional Medicinals, is absolutely the best I've tasted. Made from both the leaves and root, it's organically grown and caffeine free, and non-GMO. Since it helps with digestion, it's great in the evening after dinner, and soothing enough to relax the body and mind before bed.The taste is delicate and very subtly, mildly sweet. It's a very gentle tea, with a slightly grassy aroma. The bags are sturdy...not one of those where the label tag falls off, and you're left with a bag in hot water and a floating string, as some herbal teas are packaged! And they are individually wrapped in easy to open packages. This is a top quality product, and very delicious.If you follow the ""Blood Type Diet"" for diabetes prevention, dandelion tea is in the ""Super Beneficial"" category for all 4 blood types.

"This Mead Academie Sketch Book has several things I really love: 1. The size. 9 x 6 is a perfect size to carry with you; not too big so that it screams ""I'm an Artiste,"" but big enough to get your drawing done with necessary detail. Fits comfortably in a large purse. 2. That it is wirebound so you can flip open the top and get a flat surface. 3: that you have the option to tear out the entire sheet of paper, or just the ""neat sheet"" perforated part of the paper which is 1/8th of an inch away from the spiral holes. 4. As you open the cover, there is a thick manila insert with a useful pocket on each side (I really like useful pockets).The quality of the paper: 1. It is acid free and lignin free. I had to look up ""lignin."" It's a chemical they put in paper to make it stronger, but alas, it also breaks down in time...so if you want your work to last, acid free and lignin free is the way to go. 2. I tried several different mediums and they all worked well. I don't have any charcoal or pastel, so could not test those. Pencil, pen and several markers were all excellent.My favorite mode of sketching is with a Waterman pen with a bold gel insert. And I bear down heavily with it. Finding paper that doesn't fall apart on me is a lovely thing, and the reverse side of the drawings I made on this Mead Academie Sketch Book only show slight indentations, so this is strong, heavy paper, even without the lignin! This is a wonderful sketch book, at a very affordable price, and it is also SFI Certified (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) so you know the paper stock has been sustainably harvested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/REWAZX87F4L5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00260S6LM#wasThisHelpful","REWAZX87F4L5I","AQ8DU6XVA3USJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Scotch Bi-Directional Filament Tape is amazing stuff. I do a lot of shipping, and some of my packages go for long distances, so I will appreciate using this super strong tape that will keep my box together no matter what. It is fantastically solid, and you wont be able to make a cut  in the tape and rip the rest. You have to slice or cut the entire width of the strip.Very sticky, it firmly adheres to cardboard, and several other surfaces I tried it on (paper/plastic/wood) so it works like a super tough duct tape. Not only will it bind your packages for transport, it will help hold all kinds of things together. And it's quite attractive, with its transparent satin shiny finish. Every box I prepare for shipment will need a lot less tape when I use this. This is the king of tapes, and a little will go a very long way.

"This is really great guidebook, with all the essentials, and more. I have Paris as #1 on my bucket list, so have seen and bought other guidebooks. This one is the winner, and the one I'll be taking with me. It's so readable, the larger maps are within each section (Paris is divided into 8 sections) for easy reference. Aside from these 8 sections, they have 3 ""Day Trips,"" to Versailles, Disneyland, and Giverny, Monet's house and garden.I really like the ""Neighborhood Walks,"" which map out a leisurely pace (about an hour a mile) through the best sights...tack on an additional hour for me...I'd be hitting the cafes and restaurants! One of the final sections is ""Paris in Focus,"" which gives you a smattering of history, food and wine, shopping, etc. , and then there's the essential ""Survival Guide,"" where there's a list of the pros and cons of staying in a hotel in various districts, as well as a minimal list of hotels (this is probably better found on the internet, but it gives you an idea of prices vs. amenities vs. location), and all the other things you need to know, like transport, business hours, etc.  There is also a basic language page (""bon-zhoor"") and a nice pull-out map at the end.I'm a big fan of the DK Eyewitness Travel books, and have the one on Paris. The one thing that makes them a problem is the weight. Lonely Planet's Discover Paris is several ounces lighter,  of the thickness, and almost an inch shorter. There are things that are not as ""in depth"" (there are 9 pages on the Louvre in DK, 6 in Lonely Planet for instance) but much of what you will need once you get there will be included. Since I travel with only a carry-on bag, weight is an issue with me.

"The immune system is a very complex subject, making Part I, the first 30+ pages of ""Boosting Your Immunity for Dummies"" not quite for ""dummies,"" as it's hard to simplify such a complicated topic. In this section the ""Parts and Functions of Your Immune System,"" as well as the pros and cons of vaccinations are discussed, a decision few really think about before taking those ""shots.""Part II, ""What Happens When Your Immune System Goes Off Track"" has the chapter that was important to me. Diagnosed with stage 4 cancer over 3 years ago, I have been reading everything I can get hold of about how our bodies work, and how we feed them, and this is a great chapter. If you take chemotherapy or radiation, (I didn't take that route) it shows you how to decrease your chances of recurrence, and what foods to eat, and it teaches about ""breathing through your heart,"" something that has helped transformed my life. It also deals with allergies, and so much more.Nutrition is a big chunk of the book, and in Part III, talks about cleaning out your kitchen of the listed ""no nos."" It gives great advice on pg. 223: ""If you decide to have a sweet, you're better off going out and getting a single serving rather than keeping it in your house."" So true!

Haagen Dazs cups, even if they cost so much more in small quantities, because you know what happens if I buy a pint...I eat the whole thing.There's a lot of unusual and intriguing recipes, tips on avoiding colds and flu, exercises, getting kids to change their eating habits, and as with other Dummies books, some cute cartoons by Rich Tennant.

"This CobraCo pot holder is a lovely addition to my balcony, which I keep clean and simple, with 6 plants that need to be high off the ground to get any sunlight. This is the first time I have tried a holder like this, and it's ideal for my smallest pot, that has a 6.4"" saucer. This size saucer fits very comfortably inside, so I'm sure it could take one a bit larger if needed.My balcony is cement, and about 5 ½ inches in width, so the adjustment was easy, and this holder is sturdy enough so that I just used 2 of the bolts on each side to make it fit. The holder has a ""bumper"" at the bottom which balances against the wall and adds to the sturdiness when it's in place. It's made of ""Durable, vinyl-coated, rust-resistant steel,"" and looks quite attractive. It was also very easy to assemble, with 2 brackets and 6 (I used 4 of them) bolts.

"It only takes a handful of San Francisco Salt Company's wonderful Sleep Lavender salts to turn your bath into a luxurious, relaxing spa experience. As the rose colored salts turn to a pale purple color as they dissolve in the water, the aroma of lavender rises up and smoothes out the wrinkles of a stressful day. These superb quality sea salts include the lavender essential oil, as well as vitamin E, and aloe vera, so your skin is moisturized by the oils while it is exfoliated by the salts; the results are a velvety feel to your skin, and if you don't want to take a long soak in the tub, you can add a little of the salts to your shower gel, or sprinkle some on your soapy wash cloth. You won't get the benefits of the relaxing, detoxifying soak, but your skin will still feel fabulous after your shower, and you'll have the pleasure of the aroma.San Francisco Salt Company makes a variety of high quality salts, and the health benefits are enormous. They help release the toxins your body takes in (this is especially true of us city dwellers!) and combined with the warmth of the water relaxes your muscles. And skin just glows afterwards....such a nice reward for taking that extra time to be good to yourself. I love all the San Francisco Salt Company salts I've tried, and perhaps the Sleep Lavender most of all. It's pure luxury, and feels rejuvenating and uplifts the soul.

"Barilla Plus Pasta has become a favorite for me. I don't like to eat ""empty calories,"" and these rotini have a combination of ingredients that provide fiber and nutrition, without giving up flavor and texture.

There's a terrific recipe on the box, but I have a very restricted diet, so can't do the usual recipes with tomato and parmesan, but tossed with olive oil and feta cheese, and topped with sauteed crimini mushrooms and fresh herbs, and served with a nice big salad, Barilla Plus rotini makes a wonderful, healthy meal.The list of ingredients if full of things we need to add to our diet, like flax seed, and the value of Omega3 has been researched and found to be of great benefit.

"This is a magical book for all ages. It's labeled ""9 and Up"" but smaller children will love the colorful, wonderful illustrations, and it's never too soon to read to your children books that are written in a full and rich language. Even if they may not understand every word, the hearing of words like ""embellish"" and ""tranquil"" is good for the youthful mind and soul, and adults will never tire of reading this lovely book to them.The chapters are a delight, with Diego Rivera's fantasy version of his life, his social concern and love for Mexico and its people, his ambivalent feeling for taking money from the pre-revolutionary and corrupt government that he despised but provided his education, his relationships with the women in his life (notably the great Frida Kahlo) as well as Trotsky and Zapata. All exquisitely written by Carmen T. Bernier-Grand, in a fluid, readable and poetic style.The mixed-media illustrations by David Diaz are fabulous! The colors are brilliant; the yellow/oranges combined with the blue/greens jump from the page and the designs are beautiful. Also included are a cubist piece from 1914 by Rivera I had never seen before, the famous canvas, the ""Flower Festival: Feast of Santa Anita,"" a section of  the ""Land's Bounty Rightfully Possessed"" mural, and ""The Watermelons,"" painted in 1957, the last year of his life.The back of the book has ""The True Life of Diego Rivera,"" a glossary, a chronological index, notes, sources, and the last page has some marvelous Rivera quotes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRUGXMWIHBNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761453830#wasThisHelpful","RRUGXMWIHBNR","AQ8DU6XVA3USJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Usually I'm not fond of the healthier varieties of pasta, but thought I'd give this one a try. Though it still has a slight grittiness  to the texture (though much less than some other ""healthy"" varieties), it has a good deal of robust flavor, and can stand alone as a meal with a salad, or a make a very nice side dish.The box is slightly deceptive in that it gives the Protein/ALA Omega-3/Fiber breakdown for a 100g serving, but recommends a serving size of 56g (which is an excellent portion for a side dish). Nevertheless, it does have some great stuff in it (like legumes and flax seed) and though it might not taste like the pasta you had on your Roman holiday, it's still very good.The recipe on the box, ""Barilla Plus penne with spring vegetables"" sounds delicious, and I might try it minus the tomatoes next time. My diet is so limited, and does not allow regular pasta, but I can have feta cheese and olive oil, which is how I tried this pasta, on a bed of arugula, and it was a fine meal.Update! I just made my recipe for minestrone and added these Barilla Plus penne on low heat with some fresh shelled peas for the last 15 minutes...Oh! What a soup.

"From its cranberry red shiny metallic exterior to its sturdy black stopper, which screws down firmly to the base with a "" washer, and opens with a metal clasp and push button to release the top with the hole that has the ""Smooth Flow Design,"" this high quality Thermos is a beauty.This one will carry you through the day, with 12 hours for your hot coffee, or 24 hours for a cold drink, and a 24 oz. capacity. Perfect for your beach picnic, or even your all day whale watching excursion! Or less exciting but equally necessary, a hard day's night at work.

The look of the two-toned bamboo wood, the incredibly smooth feel of it, and the pleasure of using these implements to cook and serve your food with makes them one of the best additions to my little kitchen...ever!The spoon, slanted stirring spoon, and slotted turner are sturdy and beautiful utensils. They have elegantly shaped holes at the top of their handles should you want to hang them on hooks. The folding tongs are a big favorite. They fold for storage, and when unfolded (there's a small dowel that holds the wood pieces together) the design gives it a ""tension spring,"" to grab anything you want easily. Great for mixing up my kale salad.The tool that is getting the most use is the fabulous Spoonula. Perfect for my favorite Rachael Ray Hard Anodized II Nonstick Dishwasher Safe 8-Quart Covered Oval Pasta Pot, Orange that I make my one-pot meals in. The deep orange matches the orange of the handles on the pot, and the silicone spoon head makes sure my lovely pot remains unscratched. The handle on the spoonula also has the hole in the handle for hanging. Other than the silicone spoonula head, which is removable, these gorgeous tools must be washed by hand. Take good care of them, and they will become heirlooms!This 5 piece set was a much appreciated Christmas gift, one which I will enjoy daily, with many thanks to the most generous and thoughtful giver.

"I started to take Resveratrol a few months ago because it has been seen to help many diseases, including cancer, with helping to stop malignant cells from metastasizing. Other benefits seen in studies (lots of rodent studies) are help in preventing/alleviating Alzheimer's, diabetes, and heart disease. And as Jarrow says on the label, it's for ""Healthy ageing"" and is a good anti-oxidant. Maybe the first clue to Resveratrol's help in heart disease was how people in France had such a lower rate of heart disease, even though they ate so much cream, butter, and cheese. It was the red wine that went with it that was helping them!Jarrow Formulas are a reputable, excellent company for supplements, so their Resveratrol Synergy should be top of the line, made from grape skin extract, grape seed OPCs and green tea extract.

"This Davidsbeenhere Neck Pouch fits my every need. The construction is simple, sturdy, and light as a feather. The neck cord has a little gizmo that enables you to adjust it to your specifications, long, short, and I guess you could use it across your torso if you wanted to. Since my main purpose for traveling on my next adventure is a concert, this neck pouch is the ultimate in what I'll need to enjoy the music and not worry about a purse, leaving my hands free for applause. The front has a full length slot for my concert ticket, a shorter slot that fits my ""little black book of everything"" (it's a journal/emergency #s etc. book), a tab for a pen, and a see-through card slot for hotel card, ID, and credit card. The back has a zippered slot for cash. This slot is open at the top end so you can reach in with a couple of fingers and remove a bill when needed. And the neck pouch fits like a hand in a glove into the inner pocket of a vest I'll be wearing. If you're planning on going down dark alleys, or without a vest/jacket in warm weather, you can wear it under your shirt.I've tried a belt pouch in the past and found it uncomfortable, awkward for removing anything, not to mention unattractive in those photos where you want to look good for the folks back home, and not get remarks like ""What WAS she eating?""Full disclosure: I was offered this product for an honest review, but did NOT take the offer.

"Not for my skin, anyway.  Granted, this is old, sensitive, and dry skin I'm walking around in. These Ponds Luminous Clean towelettes say they will ""...work gently without drying skin,"" but the results for me were otherwise. After using, my face turned beet red for a few seconds, then I watched in astonishment as the skin crinkled up like tissue paper with dryness, a dryness so intense it hurt. I needed to slather moisturizer on my face to recover its normal texture. In the past, I have tried astringents that produced the same reaction.The towelettes have a texture that perhaps aids in exfoliating (though nothing is said of this on the package), and claim to draw out ""trapped make-up and impurities to brighten dull skin."" I have one problem area on my nose that I was hoping would look better after using this towelette (I bravely gave the towelette a 2nd chance just applying it to my nose), and noticed no difference at all afterwards. So while this product may be convenient and useful, and work the way it is supposed to for some less sensitive, oilier skin types,  it did nothing for me. I can also smell the re-sealed package from a few feet away, so the fragrance is also a little heavy, and maybe this is what aggravated my skin. It's nicely packaged, and stands up in the little ½ box it comes in, for space saving. A very convenient item, if only I could use it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SS7S8V72Z9L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089JVDPK#wasThisHelpful","R3SS7S8V72Z9L","AQ8DU6XVA3USJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The default mode of the human heart is to replace our central focus on God and replace this void with idols at the center of our lives. The prolific author and Theologian D.A. Carson has stated it this way, ""Whenever the periphery is in danger of displacing the center, we are not far removed from idolatry."" I believe that to ask the question, ""Is the Bible Sexist, Racist, Homophobic, and Genocidal?"" - is at its core a misunderstanding of what's at the center of our worship - God or self? Are we going to maintain a God-centered focus or capitulate to cultural relativism with ourselves at the center? In this important e-single from a chapter in Morrow's larger book entitled ""Questioning the Bible"" Morrow tackles this question with theological precision, biblical erudition, and logical acumen.Morrow opens this essay by dealing with the question: ""Does the Bible endorse slavery?"" He then answers this question by carefully developing five biblical responses: (1) Christianity did not invent slavery. (2) He shows how the ancient Near Eastern cultural context was very different from the modern postcolonial context. (3) Christianity tolerated slavery and was instrumental in its abolishment. (4) Jesus was not silent on slavery; he simply understood what the root issues were--and they all reside in the human heart. (5) The Christian worldview best accounts for human rights and dignity.The second question addressed by Morrow is ""Does the Bible approve of genocide?"" In five points  Morrow sets the record straight in understanding the biblical stance on genocide: (1) Things are not the way they ought to be - Israel as described in the Old Testament is not God's ideal society. (2) The divinely given command to Israel of herem (Yahweh War) concerning the Canaanites was unique, geographically and temporally limited, and not to be repeated. (3) Genocide and ethnic cleansing are inaccurate terms for the conquest of Canaan. (4) We must allow for the possibility of rhetorical generalization in ancient Near Eastern ""war language."" (5) The Canaanite incident should be read against the backdrop of God's promise of blessing for all the nations.The third question tackled by Morrow is perhaps the most culturally sensitive one at the moment: ""Is the Bible homophobic?"" He answers this question with five biblical points: (1) The Bible includes homosexual behavior among a long list of sinful behaviors outside of God's design for human sexuality (1 Corinthians 6:9-10, 18; 1 Timothy 1:9-10; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Hebrews 13:4; Genesis 1:26-27; 2:18-24; 19:4-9; Leviticus 18:22; 20:13; Romans 1:26-27 are passages discussed in great detail). (2) The Bible does not teach that God created people to be gay - Jesus affirmed that God's intention was the complementary sexes of male and female committing to a permanent one-flesh union (cf. Genesis 1:27; 2:24 with Matthew 19:3-6). (3) While the Bible does not teach people are born gay, it does teach that all people are born sinful (Romans 3:23; 5:12-21). A helpful distinction is quoted by Mark Mittleberg on this point: ""We must correct the idea that because desire seems natural it must be from God and is therefore okay. As fallen humans we all have many desires that seem natural to us but that are not from God."" (4) The Bible teaches that change is possible for all those who struggle with sin (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). (5) Lastly, the Bible teaches that holiness, not heterosexuality, is the goal of the spiritual life. Morrow writes, ""All of us are broken; we just express brokenness in different ways. As we repent and are empowered by the Holy Spirit, we pursue holiness. The goal is being conformed to the image of Christ (cf. Romans 8:29). Unfortunately, when these goals get talked about in the context of homosexual sin, some well-meaning Christians have indicated that the goal is for this person to live a heterosexual lifestyle. This may or may not happen. But we need to be clear that whatever our struggle, holiness is the goal.""The fourth and final question addressed by Morrow is related to setting the record straight biblically on ""Is the Bible sexist?"" (1) Morrow states, ""God's creational ideal is that women are made in the image of God and therefore possess the same dignity, honor, and value as men (Genesis 1:27; 2:24; Ex. 20:12). (2) Polygamy was tolerated and regulated in order to offer some measure of protection for women in an ancient Near Eastern context. However, this was never God's plan. Morrow writes, ""We hear echoes of God's ideal when he warns that Israel's king should not 'acquire many wives fro himself, lest his heart turn away.' (Deuteronomy 17:17)."" (3) The realities of women in the Greco-Roman world were harsh. (4) The apostle Paul had a high view of women, and the teachings of Christianity began to elevate their status (cf. Paul's high view and co-laboring with women in Rom. 16:1-16; Phil. 4:2-3; 1 Cor. 1:11; Col. 4:15; Acts 16:14-15, 40; Galatians 3:28 and 1 Tim. 6). (5) Jesus appearance on the scene is indeed very good news for women - Morrow elaborates, ""With the harsh Greco-Roman backdrop in mind, we can see how radical Jesus' view of women really was. First, he healed several women of diseases (Matthew 9:18-26), interacted with women of different races (John 4:9), and extended forgiveness to women who had committed sexual sin (Luke 7:36-50). Jewish rabbis of the day would not teach women, but Jesus had many women followers and disciples (cf. Mark 15:41) and he taught them (Luke 10:39). Women supported his ministry financially (Luke 8:1-3), and he used women as positive examples in his teaching (Luke 18:1-8). Jesus' women followers were the last to leave at his crucifixion and the first at his empty tomb.""Morrow patiently, wisely, and practically articulates that appearances and sound bites on these difficult issues are often messy and moral change is painfully slow in a fallen world. The reality is that Jesus came to liberate us from all of our idolatries and bondages to sin. We find our satisfaction in Jesus at the center of all of life. Many of the issues we struggle with as sinners in a fallen world are blind spots that can only be identified and remedied through the lenses of God's revelation as revealed in the Scriptures. The good news in this little book is that Jesus has come and fulfilled Isaiah 61:1-2 in Luke 4:18, ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed."" Morrow reminds us that in all of our personal and corporate sin against a Holy, Just, and Loving God He has ""thankfully...not left us to die in our brokenness and rebellion; he has redemptively pursued us with the everlasting love of a heavenly father.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WYJMA4N1XSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N2COYXM#wasThisHelpful","R14WYJMA4N1XSI","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the most difficult things for churches to do is to stay missional when they are established or become missional when they are plateaud or declining. For years theologians and pastors have asked the question: ""How can we outgrow the ingrown church?"" Jonathan Dodson and Brad Watson have planted thriving churches that are missional and constantly reaching out in the context of community in their respective cities: Austin, Texas and Portland, Oregon. There are many ways to be missional as a church, but perhaps one of the most simple, flexible, and successful ways is via small ""missional"" groups. This book is written as a guide or handbook on a proven and effective way to reach out in your community without compromising the Gospel, edification, or fellowship.The error that most churches fall into is establishing small groups that are ingrown - what I like to call ""holy huddles."" These are groups that are inward (people already in the church) focused. There is nothing wrong with care groups or specialized groups for individuals that are focused on certain needs. However, churches also need to have groups that are outward focused and missional if they are going to keep the gospel alive and thriving in their communities. In this guide the author's model and teach how this can be done in your own church context and community.The goal of this guide is to establish and equip missional communities so that the church can be outreach oriented, focused, and intentional. The author's define a missional community as ""a group of people who are learning to follow Jesus together in a way that renews their city, town, village, hamlet, or other space. They aren't fancy. In fact, they can be a messy community of everyday citizens who are devoted to Jesus, to one another, to their neighbors and their city."" In writing this guide the authors will help you ""imagine and form a missional community that is true to your calling"" of being salt and light in your community. Crucial to the success of a missional community is in its intentional application of the following: (1) sharing life together; (2) a focus on the gospel and its daily application of faith and repentance; (3) care for your city; (4) caring for your neighbors/hood; and (5) making and multiplying disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.The guide is divided into three parts designed to be studied and applied by a small ""missional"" community group. Each week the session consists of a biblical theme with handouts composed of key themes, verses, and applications and ideas for next steps for missional endeavors in your community. The appendix contains weekly handouts; leadership role distinctions (each group is composed of a host, discussion facilitator, prayer coordinator, meal coordinator, and missional leader - the qualifications and roles for these individuals are described in detail at various points in the guide). Missional communities invite people into a community that ""isn't centered on their needs, hobbies, or passions but the gospel of Jesus and His mission (essentially the opposite of most small groups).Part One consists of four sessions/weeks on the Gospel: (1) What is the Gospel? (2) The Gospel is Personal. (3) The Gospel is Missional. (4) Living the Gospel. Crucial to the success of a missional community is its understanding of, implementation of, and application of the gospel which they define as: ""the good news that Jesus has defeated sin, death, and evil through His own death and resurrection and is making all things new, even us."" The gospel is essentially composed of three aspects: (1) The gospel is doctrinal: it changes what we believe about ourselves and Jesus. (2) The gospel is personal: it changes who we are by transforming us into the image and likeness of Jesus; (3) The gospel is missional: it changes where and how we live for the sake of Jesus and His glorious Kingdom. The focus of these four sessions is that the gospel ceases to be something you agree with or can recite and rather becomes something you live in community with your missional community. This bucks against the individualism of western culture and is actually a return to the model that Jesus set for His own disciples - ""missional community.""In Part Two the focus of weeks five and six are on how the gospel of Jesus is at the center of community by reminding one another of the gospel. Community is based on the early church model from Acts 2:42-27. Both what makes for biblical community and what does not make for biblical community are studied and discussed with great ideas for the application and implementation of true biblical community centered in the gospel. The focus is very much on meeting needs in your neighborhood and with your neighbors as you live out the gospel in community together.Part Three is composed of what it means to be a ""missional"" community and how to be missional ""together"" in your community. The last session (9th week) talks about the commitments that the missional community will make with one another. These commitments are based on what the missional community will do ""by God's grace."" The authors give multiple ideas for the application of what it means ""specifically"" and ""intentionally"" to live out the gospel in community. There are many examples of ways that missional communities can attempt to be outreach oriented in their respective cities.I can't recommend the concept of ""missional communities"" highly enough, and this book is a wonderful place to start to launch your own missional communities wherever you are. I hope and pray that this book will be the first of many guides in helping outgrowing the ingrown churches of America and beyond. I personally want to thank Jonathan and Brad for writing this book and hope it's the first of many to be written as a  very practical guide to help churches make and multiply disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10VYOAB54YKSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVOG498#wasThisHelpful","R10VYOAB54YKSD","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just because this e-book is short (approximately 60 pages) does not mean that it is simplistic or not weighty. This treatment by Craig packs a wallop. At the outset Craig lays out the outline or skeleton for his cogent articulation and reasoning for the existence of God thus: “A good argument must obey the rules of logic; express true premises; and have premises more plausible than their opposites.” Put simply, a good argument for the existence (or non-existence) of God must meet three conditions: (1) obey the rules of logic; (2) its premises must be true (correspond with reality); (3) have premises that are more plausible than their opposites.Craig begins with the Cosmological argument for the existence of God in by developing the following formulation: (1) Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause. (2) If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God. (3) The universe exists. (4) Therefore, the explanation of the universe’s existence is God. He then gives philosophical and scientific evidence demonstrating that the existence of a God that is a necessary, uncaused, timeless, spaceless, immaterial, personal Creator of the universes makes more logical sense than the plausibility of His non-existence given by atheistic philosophers and scientists.The second argument unfolded by Craig is called the Kalam Cosmological argument and is set out in this simple formulation: (1) Everything that begins to exists has a cause. (2) The universe began to exist. (3) Therefore, the universe has a cause. Craig delves into some complicated mathematical arguments in this section to show the amazing cogency of the Kalam argument. He also gives some compelling evidences from astronomy via studies by Arvin Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander Vilenkin. He also appeals to the Second Law of Thermodynamics and thus concludes: “On the basis of both philosophical and scientific evidence, we have good grounds for believing that the universe began to exist. Since whatever begins to exist has a cause, it follows that the universe has a cause.”The third argument developed by Craig is the Teleological or Fine-tuning formulation: (1) The fine-tuning of the universe is due to physical necessity, chance, or design. (2) It is not due to physical necessity or chance. (3) Therefore, it is due to design. Here Craig tackles Richard Dawkins central argument from his book “The God Delusion” head on and proceeds to tackle his seven objections one at a time. Craig carefully dismantles Dawkins objections and gives a very plausible defense of the argument of design as a reasonable explanation for God’s existence.The Moral argument is simply stated by Craig in the following manner: (1) If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist. (2) Objective moral values and duties do exist. (3) Therefore, God exists. Craig concludes his ethical defense for God’s existence in this way: “The moral argument complements the cosmological and design arguments by telling us about the moral nature of the Creator of the universe. It gives us a personal, necessarily existent being who is not only perfectly good, but whose commands constitute our moral dues.”Craig’s last argument is based on the classic Ontological argument as espoused by St. Anselm in the 11th century and in the modern era by the great theistic philosopher Alvin Plantinga: (1) It is possible that a maximally great being (God) exists. (2) If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world. (3) It a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world. (4) If a maximally great being exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world. (5) Therefore, a maximally great being exists in the actual world. (6) Therefore, a maximally great being exists. (7) Therefore, God exists.Taken together the five arguments developed by Craig make a compelling case for the existence of God – especially when compared with the counter arguments atheists give in their own apologetic of plausibility for God’s non-existence. I highly recommend this clear and intellectually sound defense of the cogency of God’s existence as the best plausible argument for our own existence which brings purpose and meaning to one’s life through the culmination of God revelation in sending His Son Jesus so that through Him we can be reconciled and restored in a right relationship with Him by His grace and for His glory.Craig concludes why the defense of God’s existence continues to such an important window to the Gospel in our day stating, “Christians who depreciate theistic arguments because ‘no one comes to faith through intellectual arguments’ are therefore tragically shortsighted. For the value of natural theology extends far beyond one’s immediate evangelistic contact. It is the broader task of Christian apologetics, including natural theology, to help create and sustain a cultural milieu in which the Gospel can be heard as an intellectually viable option for thinking men and women. It thereby gives people the intellectual permission to believe when their hearts are moved. As we progress further into the 21st century, I anticipate that natural theology will be an increasingly relevant and vital preparation for the reception of the Gospel by thinking people.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLVKCRG7GH6EF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPP3HG2#wasThisHelpful","RLVKCRG7GH6EF","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was in my teens I read a great book (still in print) called Decision Making and the Will of God by Gary Friesen and Robin Maxon. It was a watershed book for me in helping me with how to make wise decisions. Over the years I've recommended the book to many who have who have sought my counsel on the question ""How can I know the will of God for my life?"". The problem with the book by Friesen and Maxon is it's length (It was based on Friesen's doctoral dissertation at Dallas Theological Seminary). It's a great book, but it's length is prohibitive for many. Here's the distinct advantage of DeYoung's book - essentially the same principles and content - in 300 pages less!DeYoung focuses on the facts of what God has revealed in the Scriptures so that we can best discern wisely what he wants from us. He makes a good case that God never intends for us to know ""specifically"" what He wants us to do (vocation), where He wants us to live, or who to marry (among many other questions we ask); however, DeYoung shows what God wants us to be like (Jesus) and how this purpose (sanctification) informs our decision-making. In the final analysis DeYoung writes: ""Live for God. Obey the Scriptures. Think of others before yourself. Be holy. Love Jesus. And as you do these things, do whatever else you like, with whomever you like, and you'll be walking in the will of God...the will of God for your life is pretty straightforward: Be holy like Jesus, by the power of the Spirit, for the glory of God.""The author does a wonderful job of using practical illustrations to show how we worry, procrastinate, and flat-out sin by not doing what we know to do, as we put out fleeces, wait for signs, and pray as we wait for God's discernment. He shows that oftentimes we are paralyzed by the fear of making a wrong decision or being out of God's will, when what we really need to do is focus on what God has revealed in the Scriptures clearly that we are to do (principles, commands, and boundaries). Just Do Something is biblical, practical, theologically astute, and can be read in a few hours. I highly recommend it for any Christian of any age whose chief end is to glorify God by enjoying Him forever. This will now be my new ""go-to"" book when people ask me: ""How can I know God's will for my life?""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIUETI0Q5DNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3V4X0W#wasThisHelpful","R1UIUETI0Q5DNS","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having already read Suffering and Goodness of God (2008); The Glory of God (2010); The Deity of Christ (2011); The Kingdom of God (2012); and Fallen: A Theology of Sin (2013) I was anxiously anticipating this sixth installment of the Theology in Community Series. Heaven (as all the other books in this series) did not disappoint. Each book in this series features chapters written by different theologians; pastors; and scholars that demonstrate how the particular theme is taught in history, systematically, biblically, and its practical relevance and ramifications for the modern Church.Robert Peterson (PhD, Drew University; is Professor of Systematic Theology at Covenant Theological Seminary) opens the book up with four ancient and modern stories of how false teaching on Heaven has resulted in some cases tragically. He then examines the Noetic effects of sin on our understanding of Heaven. In closing his chapter he asks and answers seven common questions people ask concerning Heaven: (1) Will everyone go to Heaven? (2) What happens when believers die? (3) What about purgatory? (4) Will we recognize others in Heaven? (5) Will we be married and enjoy sex in Heaven? (6) Will there be sorrow in Heaven over those in Hell? (7) What kind of bodies will we have in heaven?Raymond C. Ortlund Jr. (PhD, University of Aberdeen; is Senior Pastor of Immanuel Church in Nashville, TN.) tackles six key texts on Heaven in the Old Testament: Genesis 28; Exodus 24; 1 Kings 22; Job 1-2; Isaiah 6; and Daniel 7. In each passage Ortlund mines exegetical, theological, and practical principles that we learn about Heaven as taught in the Old Testament. Earth and Heaven are currently very distinct, but the unfolding revelation of Heaven from the Bible as Ortlund makes clear is that Heaven and Earth will one day be transformed together into the dwelling place of God.Jonathan T. Pennington (PhD, University of St. Andrews; is Associate Professor of New Testament Interpretation at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) writes about the language of Heaven in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts. The word we typically translate as ""heaven"" in English from the Greek is used 161 times in the Synoptics and Acts. Pennington demonstrates in his chapter that the word for Heaven conveys various ideas. He brings out the crucial aspects of how the worldview of the biblical writers and of our own day are in conflict and how we need to return to a biblical worldview in order to make sense of Heaven as a real physical and non-abstract place.Stephen J. Wellum (PhD, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; is Professor of Christian Theology at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary) approaches Paul's teaching on Heaven in three distinct ways: (1) How Paul understands Heaven according to the Old Testament; (2) How Paul thinks about Heaven in a Systematic and meditative way; and (3) How Paul hones in on Heaven as the believer's final, and future state prior to and as a result of Christ's Second Coming.Jon Laansma (PhD, University of Aberdeen; is Associate Professor of Ancient Languages and New Testament at Wheaton College) writes concerning how the 8 general canonical epistles (Hebrews, 1&2 Peter, James, Jude, 1-3 John) represent the distinctive perspectives on heaven by sketching out their primary concerns and contours with references to their pastoral intentions. He is very helpful in showing how the Christological elements of Heaven are tied to the practical concerns of Christians on Earth.Andreas J. Kostenberger (PhD, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; is Professor of New Testament and Greek at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary) explores the distinctive contributions that John makes in his Gospel and the book of Revelation to helping us understand what Heaven is and what it is like.Robert A. Peterson writes his second essay in this compilation on Pictures of Heaven that are portrayed throughout the Scriptures. Taking into consideration the story line of the Bible (creation--fall--redemption--consummation) Peterson demonstrates how the Bible is a picture book that sketches the gospel story of these four stages of the story line by using five pictures to illustrate the gospel: Heaven and Earth; Sabbath Rest; The Kingdom of God; The Presence of God; and The Glory of God. Peterson presents a masterful biblical theology of Heaven and ties it into the macro-storyline of the Gospel from Genesis to Revelation.Gerald Bray (DLitt, University of Paris-Sorbonne; is Research Professor of Divinity at Beeson Divinity School) writes about two themes in his essay: (1) Heaven as Understood before the Coming of Christ; and (2) Heaven as Understood since the Coming of Christ.Stephen F. Noll (PhD, University of Manchester; is Vice Chancellor Emeritus of Uganda Christian University) gives a biblical theology of angels (good and evil) and about their relationship to God and us in Heaven as revealed in the Scriptures.Ajith Fernando (ThM, Fuller Theological Seminary; is Teaching Director of Youth For Christ in Sri Lanka) addresses how the reality of Heaven helps Christians who are being persecuted historically and in the present. He spends the bulk of his chapter showing how the ""biblical foursome"" of (1) Evangelism triggers (2) persecution. (3) The presence of Christ helps us bear the persecution and gives a foretaste of heaven. (4) The Heavenly vision helps us be faithful amidst persecution. Fernando reminds us the prospect of Heaven is a great motivation to be faithful in taking up our crosses and following Christ.David B. Calhoun (PhD, Princeton Theological Seminary; is Professor Emeritus of Covenant Theological Seminary) closes out the book by writing about his own struggle with cancer and how suffering and pictures of the hope of Heaven are crucial when going through the hard trials and tests of life.All of the essays in this book were biblical; theologically thought-provoking; dealt with current practical scenarios; and were gospel centered and Christ exalting. I highly recommend this book for Christians who want to learn what the Bible has to say rather than much of the subjective drivel that is being churned over Heaven in many of the popular books of our day.*I was furnished with a copy of this book for review by the publisher and was not required to write a favorable review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA42HITVZ30B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEU6WRS#wasThisHelpful","RA42HITVZ30B","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a Senior Pastor one of the most difficult challenges I've faced over the years is how to keep and shepherd a flock in holiness and influence the world without being contaminated by it at the same time. Tim Keller is a pastor who has been able to do both. Tim writes the forward to this book and his own churches vision statement is as follows: ""We at Redeemer Church (Manhattan, New York) seek to build a great city for all people through a gospel movement that brings about personal conversion, community formation, social justice, and cultural renewal in New York City and the world.""What Dr. Forster does in this book is show how this type of vision is desperately needed in the Western Church today. He shows historically how churches in Europe and America were once the primary influencers in culture and how that now they are more influenced by the culture than influencing culture. Forster's knowledge of history and theology allows him to make penetrating insights into how Christianity has lost ground in influencing society, and yet offers hope in how to turn this paradigm around.According to Forster the ""exilic challenge of the Israelites in Babylon is the permanent state of the New Testament church. If so, we should consider the Lord's instructions to His people during the Babylonian Exile: ""But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare"" (Jeremiah 29:7). Forster uses this passage as a stepping stone to develop the idea of ""whole-life"" discipleship which encompasses the walls inside and outside of our churches. He forges practical ways and examples to penetrate our communities with the gospel in the context of our families, workplace, educationally, socially, and politically.In the final analysis Forster has written a book that is especially helpful for Christians and Churches that have become ""ingrown"", ""inward-focused,"" ""isolated,"" and ""self-absorbed."" He gleans principles from the Bible and the Reformation that are particularly helpful in getting the Church back on track in the balancing act that is theologically deep and practically relevant. I highly recommend this book for pastors, lay-leaders, and Christians of all stripes that seek to become ambassadors for Christ who make a difference in our communities and in our world for our joy and God's glory.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ2W6BUI9OGRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HDHUUE4#wasThisHelpful","RZ2W6BUI9OGRL","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had the privilege of taking four classes from Dr. J.P. Moreland while a student at Talbot in the late 80's and early 90's. Honestly, I had an easier time understanding Dr. Moreland when he lectured than reading his books. J.P. is a deep thinker, brilliant philosopher, and  most importantly - an ardent follower of Jesus. While in school I read his book Christianity and the Nature of Science three times before I really got the gist of what he was saying. The Soul is a wonderful primer on the case for the existence of the soul in a sea of naturalistic thinking.I am constantly dealing with proponents of physicalism or scientific naturalism as I seek to share the gospel with those who do not believe in God or the soul. I found that Moreland's book was still challenging to read, but well worth the effort. The book gave me a good overview of the worldview of the proponents of scientific naturalism, and the case to be made for the soul known as substance dualism. Moreland constructs a strong case of both biblical and non-biblical arguments for the existence of the soul.I highly recommend this book especially for college students and Christians who regularly engage in evangelism and apologetics. It is great place to start before getting into some of the more formidable books on the subject by Moreland such as his Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview; Debating Christian Theism; Consciousness and the Existence of God; Christianity and the Nature of Science; and Body and Soul. Moreland knows his stuff. He has put the cookies on the bottom shelf in this book to help Christians understand the importance of the soul's existence and how to present the case for the soul with skeptics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZNUQIX0TV5R6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1327LW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZNUQIX0TV5R6","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Who better to address how to approach the finish line of life successfully than 88-year-old and world-renowned theologian - J.I. Packer. Some people say when E.F. Hutton talks people listen, not me. However, when J.I. Packer talks I listen and if you are wise, so should you.In this short book J.I Packer tactfully and theologically addresses the excuses that the ages 65 and beyond crowd make for ""coasting"" or ""relaxing"" in the final years of life. It's a well-known fact that retirement doesn't exist in the Bible, so what Packer does is show how we can learn from the Apostle Paul and how he finished his life by: seeking opportunities to invest in those who would outlive him; making the most of his maturity and wisdom (working smarter, not harder); with humility (as opposed to living pridefully); and with great intensity and zeal for the things that will last beyond the grave in eternity.With his characteristic theological precision and humble guidance Packer will motivate you to live for those things that bring glory to God by investing in that which will outlast your own life by living for others. Joy comes to those who seek Jesus first, then in increasing the joy of others by pointing them to Jesus, and lastly by the joy that results for you in delighting in God and others. This book will definitely increase your joy and help you to finish your course well because of Him, and for Him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWH3QVT8RUTDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HS4QBXQ#wasThisHelpful","RWH3QVT8RUTDP","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is almost a word for word account of R.C. Sproul's DVD teaching series entitled ""Foundations: An Overview of Systematic Theology."" Having watched this video series in the past I immediately recognized the content. I'm glad this series has now been made available in book form.R.C. is a master teacher and in this book he covers the subject of Theology in its broadest sense. Theology not only refers to the study of God, but to everything that God has revealed to us in the Bible. In sixty short, but jam-packed chapters R.C. unveils with depth and clarity a summary of what the Bible has to say about its most important themes: Theology Proper - The study of God; Anthropology and Creation - The study of man; Christology - The study of Jesus; Pneumatology - The study of the Holy Spirit; Soteriology- The study of salvation; Ecclesiology - The study of the Church; and lastly (no pun intended) - Eschatology - The study of last things.This book is an excellent introduction to all of these subjects and the sub topics they address. As R.C. Sproul says, ""Everyone, is a theologian, but either a good or bad one."" You will come away from reading this book having learned a ton of important truths that will help you become a better theologian. With profound depth, clarity, historical, and practical wisdom Sproul will delight and intrigue you in helping you grow in your journey and intimacy with God - using your head, heart, and hands for His glory and your good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YFZZ4O1OYZAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IPLHY64#wasThisHelpful","R1YFZZ4O1OYZAZ","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received the French Coffee press quickly and was excited to try it out. I simply read the directions on the box - which were very easy to follow. The process of making the coffee took about five minutes to (1) ground my course ground coffee with one rounded table spoon into the glass beaker; (2) heat my water (not to a boil); (3) pour the water into the beaker; (4) gently stir the coffee; (5) put the plunger on the beaker; (6) held the handle attached to the beaker and began to slowly lower the plunger into the pot; (7) plunged gently up and down using minimal pressure for about two minutes; (8) I'm now drinking a great cup of coffee!The whole process was very simple and provided me with a great cup of coffee!

"In 1943 in Great Britain, when hope and the moral fabric of society were being threatened by the relentless inhumanity of global war, an Oxford don - C.S. Lewis was invited to give a series of radio lectures addressing the central issues of Christianity. Over half a century after the original lectures, the topic retains it urgency. Expanded into book form, Mere Christianity set out to provide a rational basis for Christianity in an era of modernity.Fast forward to the 21st century. We now live in a post-modern era in the western world. When Lewis wrote in 1943 lines of black and white, right and wrong were very clear, not so anymore. How can we believe in a personal God in an age of skepticism unlike the times of fifty years ago? Are there any cogent reasons to believe in God in an age of relativistic thought? Enter Tim Keller.Tim Keller's Reason for God has provided for modern Christians and skeptics what C.S. Lewis provided in his time - a reasoned defense over the main objections to Christianity: (1) There can't be just one true religion; (2) How could a good God allow suffering? (3) Christianity is a straightjacket; (4) The Church is Responsible for So Much Injustice; (5) How can a loving God send people to Hell? (6) Science has disproved Christianity; (7) You can't take the Bible literally...and then in provided seven offensive cases for the coherency of rational Christianity: (1) The clues of God; (2) The knowledge of God; (3) The problem of sin; (4) Religion and the Gospel; (5) The true story of the cross; (6) The reality of the resurrection; (7) The dance of God.In reading the book one finds a step by step macro level picture of why a reasonable belief in God is rational and compelling in a postmodern world. All other world-views leave one full of loopholes and contradictions. Only Christianity  gives one the comprehensive lenses by which we can see ourselves, the world, and a personal God more clearly and logically. Life, relationships, and our place in the universe has meaning, purpose, and hope if there is indeed the existence of a Holy God who came and died for us to know Him and to make Him known.I highly recommend this book for both skeptics of Christianity and believers in Christianity. It will answer the most important questions we can ever ask about faith, life, the after life, and the most important issues of our day. Tim Keller answers the profoundest questions we have with humility, sensitivity, biblically, and practically. It is one of the ""must reading"" books for our times. I especially would like to see Christians giving this book to their unbelieving friends and reading the book with them. It is a great book for discussion and building bridges to the gospel - and thus opening the door for a relationship with God through His Son - Jesus Christ.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E6JCAMLUY6LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000XPNUZE#wasThisHelpful","R2E6JCAMLUY6LR","AT9Y7KOIUO9I7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT9Y7KOIUO9I7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my first experience with Bulgarian Lavender and it was unexpectedly different than traditional lavender. There's a unique quality to the scent that I'm undecided about; there's a light chemical undertone to it. Considering the label says ""for external use only"", this leaves me wondering it's because it's a different type of lavender, or if it's even pure essential oil? It's definitely a lot thinner than most high-grade oils that I've purchased in the past. I use this oil in my diffuser which seems to fill a room nicely.

"I've had the opportunity to test a handful of these which has been really exciting because they're the new craze right now. The material quality of this one definitely stands well against the competition! Also, if you're going to get one, the Bluetooth is a huge added bonus! This one has a wristband which I quite like as well, in case you drop it, it's a saver!My only reservations with this particular model are: it's inability to collapse to a more pocket sized device, and the sensitivity of the power button. Also, if you have a thick phone case, it may not fit properly as there isn't much leeway. I have an iPhone 5s with a slim case and it fits nicely.And this had no factor on my review, but I would have LOVED to see nicer packaging.

"My review is based on a couple of factors:1. Practicality: Obviously I knew what I was getting when I purchased a ""manual"" grinder. However, it's a heck of a lot more effort than I expected. Mostly due to the assembly of the handle; it is not secured go the top and flies off if you get too carried away griding. If you were traveling, I could see this being okay, or if you wanted to impress someone on a date... But it is not something I'd use every day. There are lines to measure, but it's hard to see as the coffee grinds stick to the clear material as it falls down.2. Material Sustainability: I believe it's stainless steel? It feels very heavy and reliable. My concern is with the plastic gear/plate inside. I'm not sure how long that will last. It also seems to grate heavily on one side, so I fear it may wear down unevenly.3. Appearance: It looks fancy, and blends in nicely with my stainless steel appliances.Conclusion:It delivers on its purpose, but falls short on its promise.

"Training a dog is not an easy task! And personally, I'm not a fan of spraying them with water or screaming at them - how would you like it if someone did that to you?

"If you're seriously considering these, the first thing you have to ask yourself is ""Am I trying to save money or am I looking for convenience?"". Understand that with this particular product, you won't get both.With the standard k-cup, you pop it in and dispose of it... no fuss, no mess. The drawback is that they can get costly, and I imagine not very Eco-friendly. With these, you have to fill them, empty them, and clean them. For that, it's almost easier just to get an ordinary coffee maker. On the upside, you save a few bucks every week.As far as the product quality, I found that these had some minor (avoidable) issues. It's not unique to this particular brand or model however. As a general rule of thumb, here are some good guidelines when using re-usable k-cups:- Careful not to overfill the cup. The metal strainer is so fine that the water doesn't flow as fast as with the disposables. Only fill it 1/2 to 2/3 depending how strong you like your coffee, or it might leak!- Avoid fine-ground coffee. It clumps faster, increasing the water blockage with the strainer - which can lead to leaking.- Wait for the grinds to dry before dumping unless you plan to rinse it down the drain (which I advise against). The more wet they are, the more they stick to the mesh.Overall, I didn't mind this product, but I found it to be more of a hassle than anything. It also took a few runs of trial and error before overcoming the leaking issue.I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TD28WPZ3RBYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YFXML32#wasThisHelpful","R3TD28WPZ3RBYK","A23VBW7L9DH7HA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VBW7L9DH7HA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The clothing styles from Doublju are always so unique! I'm a relatively thin guy, so it's hard for me to find fitted clothing without spending a fortune. The only thing is that most of the clothes run significantly smaller than U.S. sizes (though they do specify that in their listings).  It should be noted however, that even though it's not too hard to get a good length and waist size with these s***s (typically order one size larger), the sleeve length has always run too short for me. I usually end up having to roll up my sleeves or they end up 2 inches above my wrists.

The amount of aroma diffused is FANTASTIC as well.

"Idealistically, this concept seems fun, but it's far from practical. When considering the price, the materials aren't half bad, though I wonder if the lid would sustain a good fall without cracking. Once you've filled it with fruit, you are supposed to shake the bottle, but the holes on the infuser pouch get significantly larger towards the top. Because of that, I strongly encourage putting a decent amount of fruit inside so that it doesn't have too much room to shake up - or you'll end up with pulp and seed in your water. This bottle is pretty decently sized, so I do wish that there was a little more room for actual water.I've only had the opportunity to try a few concotions, but I'm sure there are a variety of unique recipes that you could play around with (maybe using basil, mint leaf, or other accent flavors). Health wise, I can see how this would be a cleaner alternative to the artificial sweeteners sold at the grocery store... however, the amount of fruit it takes to get a good flavor feels wasteful (unless you eat it). For best results, make it the night before so the fruit has time to infuse the water fully.

"My review for this product will be continually updated to track the progress of its effectiveness. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion, and this is the only way I feel most comfortable doing so.8/5/15 - I noticed a decent boost in energy about an hour after taking. It's only been the first day, so that's exciting. I did eat before taking them (approximately 30 mins before working out), so it's possible it should be taken with a lighter meal or no meal at all. Otherwise, you'll find yourself getting energy AFTER the workout.8/6/15 - Because of the delayed effect yesterday, I decided to take this today on an empty stomach. During the workout, I experienced a more profound boost in energy, though I now have stomach cramps, racing heart, and diarrhea. I'm not sure if this is from the supplement? Will do my next update in a few days to see.8/7/15 - 8/8/15 - I ate approximately an hour before working out, and took half the usual dose before working out (1 pill instead of 2). That small adjustment made a significant improvement to how my body reacted. I no longer have the cramps, racing heart, or diarrhea.8/9/15 - My body has completely adjusted, and I've resumed to the recommended dose of 2 pills 30 mins before working out. No side effects, but not noticing the same energy boost either. Have been urinating A LOT more than usual which is probably part of the ""aids in weight loss"" claims (mostly water weight, and some calories from the energy that allows me to exercise a little longer).

"I am not much of a necklace person, but this piece is so delicate and elegantly made that I love wearing it. It adds a very feminine touch to my look. The pearls paired with the gold chain is a different style. Usually, pearls are the center of attention here the chain is. The hook is strong enough to prevent the necklace from unlocking and sliding off your neck. I would recommend avoiding direct contact with water and perfumes to prolong the life of the necklace.Sample provided w/o any obligations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AS0GM4FVLKDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI8H5X4#wasThisHelpful","R1AS0GM4FVLKDM","A2JQ02A3OV117X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JQ02A3OV117X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"1D came a long way as they have recorded their 5 albums...their first album of straight bubble gum boy band was a guilty pleasure.  No shame in that.  But the 5 guys had a surprisingly strong vision for the direction that they wished to take their music, honing their songcraft somewhat and maturing the instrumentation.  Four was actually a very strong album, and one that any pop band should be pleased to put out.  Zayn left, and many felt that this was the death knell for 1D.  I'm pleased to say that Made in the A.M. is probably the strongest album that they have yet made.  ""Perfect"" is a fantastic gem of an earworm, Love You Goodbye and History both pull at hearstrings pretty well.  Harmonies are tight and impressive, and the entire album comes off like a good time had with friends.  If this turns out to be 1D's last album, it is a good one to end on.  I suspect that this is not the end, however, and that these guys may continue to make music for a long time.  Here's hoping they continue to grow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H644VPBRAHPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015N3EYH8#wasThisHelpful","R2H644VPBRAHPA","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Ryan Adams.  Against my better judgement, I have come to also love Taylor Swift--and at her best, I think she is a very fine song writer.  I also really love it when talented people cover really good songs in an original manner.  When I heard that Ryan was covering 1989 as if he were covering Nebraska by Springsteen, I knew I wanted a listen.  Damn if he didn't knock it out of the park.  He is in awesome voice, and his instrumentation is neither spare nor overbearing....it really is like he treated all of these songs like his own children,  this album can easily stand up to anything that Ryan has done on his own (and that says a lot) and is a viable alternative to Tay's own outstanding effort.  His version of Blank space is naked, painful, a paean to loneliness.  Style becomes a funky, punky strut.  Shake it off starts with a greasy organ and a rim shot and soon becomes a romp through a haunting nightmare of misunderstanding and isolation.  Amazing.  When the pedal steel kicks in...I got chills.  Listen, if you love Tay and are not scared to see how her songs stand up to reinterpretation, you will love this with good reason.  If you love Ryan, yiu will go nuts for this bad boy, heart on the sleeve love letter to some great songwriting.  Nonstop awesome.

"This disc is a steal at any price for lovers of the art song.  Lee Hoiby knows how to write a beautiful melody and imbue it with magical accompaniment.  He reminds me of Barber meets Sondheim by way of Ravel, and these songs are wonderful.  Modern music can be harsh, but not here...both the soprano and the baritone sing sweetly without cloying preciousness, and diction is great.  The recording could have been miked a little better, but a little twiddling with your equalizer will likely help you find a setting you can enjoy, and once you dig into this music, you won't want to emerge. Standouts include the clever and fantastic setting of Lewis Carrol's ""Jabberwocky"", as well as the title tune ""Pocket of Time"" and the sweet and lovely ""The Lamb"".

"I am an opera snob.  Musically, I prefer the 20th century and beyond, and I get tired of the old repertoire.  But sometimes, even confirmed 12 tone enthusiasts like myself enjoy a little Bellini.  Let's face it...the great masters were, well, masterful.  This dirt cheap collection has eliminated the need for me to pull out individual operas to get just the loveliest arias.  Here the all are, glittering in the sunlight, sung by some of the finest sopranos of the last 40 years.  Sumi Jo's definitive version of the aria for the Queen of the Night from Mozart's Magic Flute is worth the price of admission alone. These arias are instantly familiar to opera buffs, but the casual listener will know many of these, and it is an easy way to bring new converts in to the fold.  Listen, this music is glorious, tuneful, exquisitely sung, and a wonderful way to sip at the chalice of immortal music.  Sound is generally excellent.  The collection would be a bargain at 10x the price, and there is absolutely no reason not to pick this up at the crazy bargain price of $1.  Yes, even you folks who usually prefer Wozzeck.

"Amy has been a companion across the years, and I have shared tough times, good times, times when I questioned my faith, times when I exulted in my faith...all with her music.  For me, her high point was the incandescent Lead Me On, especially the heartfelt ""Saved by Love"" and ""1974"", followed close on the heels by Behind the Eyes.  This album is definitely in the tradition of those albums--full of genuine faith, full of heartache and joy.  This is not a full on gospel album, and that is fine with me.  What it is is an album by a woman of faith about a life lived in faith, working out the nuts and bolts of life through her faith.  Her voice remains as gentle and husky as ever, sweet and melodic.  After all these years, I know her every turn of phrase, her every melodic trick, and I fall for it every time.  Song wise, I enjoyed the whole album, but really responded to the message of ""Don't Try So Hard""--it's message of Christ's all sufficiency to cover over all our sins, all our defects was so timely and helpful for me.

"I never know what to expect with the Flaming Lips--but I'm always willing to take the ride.  If you are reading this review, I assume you are too...but let me warn you, this ride is not for the faint of heart or the suicide prone.  The Terror plunges the listener into a maelstrom of pulsing sounds, distant and insistent thrumming, humming, drumming--all alienating and somehow fearful.  It seems as if you are setting out into a darkening sea, the cold wind picking up and the knowledge that a storm is just around the corner.  I got a visceral reaction, the bottom of my stomach dropping out at times, especially in the extended soundscapes of ""You Lust"", where disembodied voices whisper over a droning bass...and I was listening in the middle of the day in a brightly lit office while I was typing.  I had to stop typing for a while and just let the music surround me, fill me up, to surrender to its majesty and fear.  This album is a slow motion, matter of fact presentation of an emotional nakedness, a rough look at a raw soul that is so much in pain that there is no simple way to express the feelings.  Words and music combine in despair and loneliness, but also beauty.  The wild thing is that there is very little in the lyrics that overtly reveals the pain that Wayne expresses so easily with every anguished note.The Flaming Lips have produced a harrowing masterpiece here, an album that will haunt you, teach you, and terrify you.  Remarkable, and a must listen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MJQHZU9P9F90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7LYJYE#wasThisHelpful","R1MJQHZU9P9F90","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm wild about Ed Sheeran and his guitar wizardry, his optimistic lyrics, and his sweetly melodic voice.  I was unfamiliar with Yelawolf when I gave this a first spin.  I was impressed by his flexible rhymes, his rapid flow and the thoughtfulness of some of his rhymes; that isn't to say that he is a new Marshall Mathers; he lacks the extreme playfullness and creativity that marks that man's best work.  I also didn't always like his tone, which was fairly monotone snarly. Now, I need to be honest here--I'm not a huge hip-hop/rap fan, and although I've got a couple of Eminem albums in my collection, and I've been known to give old Run DMC and Beastie Boys a spin now and again, I am definitely not the go to guy for rap reviews, so I'll leave it at that.  I came to this album because Ed's name is on it,and I really wanted Ed's presence to be a lot more up front.  When he is there, he is refreshing and talented, but this is not really for Ed's fans, however, as he is mostly just a back up boy for Yelawolf, contributing some guitar and a chorus or two.  If you like underground rap, then this might be more to your taste.  Also, note, the ""explicit"" label is earned, as the cursing is impressive.  I'd give this 2.5 stars if I could.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MX9RMTQQ4KJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007T2X94G#wasThisHelpful","R1MX9RMTQQ4KJ2","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know that I shouldn't be surprised that Bowie is putting out a genuinely great album.  Why would that be surprising?  He's been doing it for 40+ years.  Some might argue that there were a string of duds in the 80's (Tonight, Never Let Me Down), and in the interest of full disclosure, I would tell those folks that they need to go back and re-listen to those albums with fresh ears.  Both of them have some fantastic songwriting and while neither matches ""Lodgers"", ""Heroes"", or ""Hunky Dory"", they both merit affection. But now you know my bias and can hear what I have to say.The Next Day is inevitable.  It is a wonderful album that builds upon all that has come before, by turns nostalgiac and exploratory.  This is an album that does not seek to be the next Bowie album, but rather an album that seeks to be a good album period.  There have been a lot of song by song breakdowns, and I won't do that, but what I will try to convey is the feeling that you get when a great musician puts out a record at the top of his game.  This is one of those records.  The music is urgent and compelling, full of energy and life, mesmerizing.  His voice sounds great still, although it is not as rich as it once might have been, it still has many shades.  There is a sadness, an ache, and a power to provoke wonder as you listen to the record unfold; there is much reflection on love, and a life lived for love, and for change, and identity.  But mostly, it's music that you want to listen to--it's music that is enjoyable with or without the context of David over the last 40 years--music that my kids find compelling and I find wonderful for completely different reasons.I hope that this album triggers a new creative season for David, but if not, this is a fantastic album to have left us.  Pick it up.  5 stars, unreservedly, passionately.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15CHKBU4C6O6F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AYHKIZ6#wasThisHelpful","R15CHKBU4C6O6F","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have 5 cats, and when we leave for a weeks vacation, we always have someone come in every other day to make sure that they have fresh water/food/clean litter.  Even so, I always worry that something will happen while we aren't there and the cats will be out of water.  For that reason, we have 2 previous drinkwell fountains--one small one in our upstairs bathroom, and a 1 gallon number in our kitchen.  The cats like it because they enjoy drinking out of the running water.  This 5 gallon product is essentially the same; it is designed for outdoor use, but we use it indoors in our basement.  Once more, it gives me peace of mind that there is a big quantity of water available for our cats if needed.  This would not be a good choice for outdoor usage in a place where it freezes frequently, but otherwise it is a nice water dish for a medium sized dog or other animal.  Drinkwell fountains have been sturdy for us, working without fail for the last 3 years, pretty good, and no signs of giving up yet.

Foam rollers are very painful at first to use, but the more you use them, the more amazing a stretch you get, and now I can't imagine trying to get a good stretch in without one.

"If your chief object is to find a ""squirrel-proof"" feeder, then this is not the feeder for you.  Maybe we just have genius squirrels, I don't know, but our squirrels defeated this little contraption in about 45 seconds.  they would hand from the top upside down and still get the seeds.

Birds feed from it easily, and we actually love the squirrels, they are so fun for our cats to watch on the back porch--we call the whole bird/squirrel show ""kitty TV"" and the cats can't get enough of it.  The feeder is easy to load, holds a good amount of seeds, and is light and easy to hang.

After that album, I wanted to embrace their follow up ""Work"", but it was a little more of a glum affair without any relief, and although I enjoyed it, it didn't have the same longevity with me.  I approached Optica with a little more trepidation--would this be more ""Work""?  Or something else?  I am happy to report that this has all the sass and sweetness of ""Our Ill Wills"" but has also gained an even lighter touch with production, never sounding cloying or downtrodden, and by the same token, avoiding an overly precious wrong turn as well.  This album does what well done pop is supposed to do--it gets into your brain and your heart, starts your fingers snapping, and next thing you know you are singing along to songs you have only heard once.  Now, that is not to say that all the lyrics are about bunnies and rainbows--we are still talking about a band that does heartbreak like it should be done--sweet and bitter enough to break your heart all over again.  But somehow, hearing it from these guys makes the pain sweet, the nostalgia for things lost somehow brighter, and the hope to carry on a little easier.  It's a wonderful ride, and a great example of indie pop at its finest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6OF52TFC4BKX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJXO3CY#wasThisHelpful","R6OF52TFC4BKX","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've listened to 10,000 Maniacs since ""The Wishing Chair"" came out, and yes, of course, I love Natalie Merchant.  However, I am not a fair weather fan, and I've stuck with the band through thick and thin, including the enjoyable ""Love Among the Ruins"", and the dreamy ""The Earth Pressed Flat"".  I liked both of those albums, and they certainly get time on my turntable when I have a 10,000 Maniac mood, so I am not someone who knocks Ms. Ramsey just because she is not Natalie.  Indeed, Mary's vocals have gotten more comfortable, more assured, and stayed warm and melodic through those albums and remain just as engaging on this outing.And yes, ""Music From The Motion Picture"" is a very engaging album, full of pleasant, jangly, guitar based music that 10,000 Maniacs does very well--and there is nothing wrong with that.  My criticism here is that the album never rises above ""pleasant"" or even ""nice"".  Melodies are certainly hummable, but do not stick with you for long.  The band sounds relaxed and very comfortable with each other, which means that all the songs seem well put together--but nothing sparkles. There is no moment where I sat back and said ""ahh, that's what I've been missing, that's what I need"".  All of these songs could have come from any of the previous albums, but would have been album tracks there, nothing more.If you adore Mary Ramsey's voice, then this is going to make you happy, as she sings beautifully; but if you are looking for a breath of new life in 10kM, then this is not going to take you very far.  I hope that this album is just another step on the road for these musicians, and I look forward to more music in the future from them, but I think that this album will be one that I turn to less often when I want to hear them shine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MU1K5CA3NXX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1CGFBY#wasThisHelpful","R1MU1K5CA3NXX1","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued to hear this music, because a) I love Radiohead b)I very much enjoyed The Eraser and c)I was interested to hear what Flea and Nigel Goodrich, not to mention to a combo of electronic and acoustic percussion could do.  As it turns out, for me, this is an album that is greater than the sum of its parts.  I've noted that a number of reviewers have remarked on the almost intellectual and academic merits of this album, but I think that the appeal of different for me.  For me, it is a visceral experience--it's like I've been mainlined into the music in Thom and co's heads/hearts.  I suppose that I could admire those skittery rhythms from a sheer originality of composition point of view, but for me, it's like waking up in a new soundscape, looking around (synesthesia-like) and finding new colors around you--but I'm never afraid because I have Thom's voice leading me deeper in, guiding me towards the light (as it were).  This album is beautiful, fascinating, deeply trippy, and in the same way that New Order used profound sterility (think Blue Monday) to arrive at gut wrenching emotion, Atoms for Peace use electronic manipulation to advance a bewitching music for the heart and mind.  Absolutely fascinating, intense and beautiful.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CM9WHEEQCYVX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AIFTHFG#wasThisHelpful","R2CM9WHEEQCYVX","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yea, I know, the name, right?  Ignore it.  Or better yet, embrace it, because this music wants to embrace you.  Groovy electrofunk that starts and doesn't stop, mixed with swirling guitars and synths out of some acid dream-pop fantasy.  Vocals that remind me of some of the most insistent Maroon 5 choruses, in the best way possible--i.e. catchy beyond belief and a heck of a lot of fun.

"This is a perfectly designed collection of infectious, immaculately produced pop tunes.  These guys evoke the things you love about Coldplay (perfectly tuneful, deeply emotional), Snow Patrol (aching vocals, sweet longing), and even Train (something grander is out there, let's find it together); but they do it in their own way.  Synths are the order of the day, pulsing but never cold, waves of fluid emotions washing over and around.  This is a record to play on road trips and on cloudy days, to share with friends, to dance and to read by.  That's a lot of mandate, but this is a lot of enjoyment.

"The Foals continue their hot streak with Holy Fire, perfecting the insistent dance-rock rhythmic magic that makes them so fun--but at the same time, the driving guitars and melodic invention keep the album fresh and more than just a dance album alone.  Yannis Philippakis voice is urgent and smoky, with a lazy slide that invites you in but then won't let you go.  Inhaler is an early standout track, it was a single in the UK and it is absolutely impossible to listen to at anything less than maximum volume.  It begs you to take the floor.  My Number was also an early single from the album, and has a really funky guitar figure and  a relentlessly catchy beat. Overall the album has a sense of busy-ness--there is always something exciting happen, leaving you waiting for what is coming next, knowing that there is no way that they can shock or surprise you again--and then they do.  Holy Fire is my jumping on point for the Foals, and it is one of my favorite new finds.  Pick it up if you like 80's inflected dance funk delivered with creativity, style, and a double dose of attitude.  Big fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EUX6CC5JEINQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A18KCSQ#wasThisHelpful","R2EUX6CC5JEINQ","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Curt is being a little coy with the title on this one, and I am happy to report that this album is every bit as fulfilling as Mayfield, perhaps even more so--Seven of Sundays, Halfway Pleased, and Addict easily stand as some of his best work; the album as a whole is very nicely put together--everything fits together smoothly.  Lyrics are a little cryptic, but his vocals are always crystal clear, full of his sweet tone and very emotional.  I was happy that he included a live version of Snow Hill (one of my favorite of his solo songs), and I appreciated the acoustic Version of Seven of Sundays as well.  This is simply a great release by a very talented pop artist; the fact that his voice is an old friend makes it simply better.

"I'm not sure why I resisted getting Curt Smith's solo works for so long--I picked up the TFF ""Raoul"" and ""Elemental"" sound unheard when they came out and loved them...but really missed Curt's lovely tenor on those records.  I read some non-complimentary reviews of Curt's solo work, and didn't even bother to give him a listen for some reason.  My loss, fortunately now rectified.  I've always loved his flexible vocals, his sweetness and lyricism, and it is clear to me based on Mayfield that he is a first rate song writer on his own.  Each of the tracks is enjoyable, not a dud among them, and the instrumentation is strong and innovative.  If you love TFF, this is a simple decision--give this a listen, you will be glad you did.  Musically, it sits somewhere between Seeds of Love and Happy Ending (which is exactly where it fits chronologically as well), and it is fascinating to see how much Curt contributed to both of those releases; no slight against the magnificently talented Roland, but tales that RO was the creative force behind TFF I think are obviously over-rated.  Curt deserves to be recognized in his own right for his contributions.

"I got this for my kids who adore monopoly.  I like the game as well, but wish that it moved faster--this game solves some of the issues that make monopoly a little hard on some players.  You know that point in the game when you are pretty sure you know who will win but you still have to play 3 more hours to fully bankrupt them?  Well, this game changes the rules a little, so you just need to build skyscrapers on a certain number of properties.  You can buy properties before you land on them, which changes the initial strategy somewhat, and speeds up the initial rounds of play.  Because you are playing to build and not to bankrupt your co-players, there are fewer hurt feelings (remember when your old brother made you cry as you landed on Park Place...again?).  Overall, this is a nice overhaul of a classic game to make it a little faster, still strategic, and a little kinder on the little ones.

"First things first, I am exceedingly pleased with this lock.  I'll go into its features in a moment, but I wanted to get installation discussed first, as this was something that I found intimidating at first.  It isn't really that hard to do, but does require a little time and some faith that you can do it!  If I can do it, you can do it.I am sure that this will come as no surprise to anyone, but you are going to need some tools to install this lock--you will at least need a screwdriver and a little know how to remove your old lock if you have one.  We installed this one in a door that did not previously have a deadbolt, so it was a little more complicated for us.  I had to buy a chisel (to chisel out a receiver space for the locking bolt), and I had to buy a hole saw (it is an attachment for your drill) to drill out a hole for the lock itself in our door.  Because our door has a metal lining, we had to get one that would cut metal. There is a template included in the lock that shows you where and how to make the hole in your door, and where and how to make the receiver hole.  Once the hole in the door was drilled out, the lock went in easily; the screw holes in the two halves of the lock were not perfectly aligned, but with a little jiggling, we were able to get them lined up well enough to screw the lock in securely.  We had a few problems as well with perfect alignment of the dress plate (the shiny metal plate that covers the edges of the receiving hole), but we used a Dremel tool to file this out perfectly so that the bolt would slide smoothly.  I am not a handyman by any stretch of the imagination, and I was able to do this, so if this sounds at all concerning, take a deep breath and know that you can do it.  It is entirely possible that the minor difficulties I had were due to my own imperfect installation skills. None of these things would likely have been a problem if I had been inserting this lock into a door that already had the holes drilled out, so if you are just changing the lock, this will likely be easier.  Even with the extra steps I had to do, this was all accomplished in about an hour.The lock is big and clunky, very satisfyingly solid.  When the bolt slides home in your door, it feels very secrure.  I like that.  The locking mechanism is easy to turn, and easy to tell when it is completely extended.  The lock comes with two keys, which fit perfectly for us and turn the lock smoothly and easily.  Of course, the big features of this lock set are the electronic capabilities.  I am happy to report that these work smoothly also, and are very easy to use.  The set comes with two key fobs that look kind of like car locking mechanisms on your car remote--just a lock and unlock button.  Easy.  You can also program your keypad with a 6 digit code to lock and unlock your door; the code is programmable with a multistep process that requires a ""master"" code included in your instruction book, so don't lose this documentation.  The process for programming is about 4 steps, and is not difficult but may require a little pre-reading to get everything right, because you have a limited time to complete the full operation.  I succeeded in programming everything on my second try.  Total process took about 4 minutes from start to finish with instruction reading/false start/final success.  Optionally, you can also program the lock to lock itself with a single touch of a lock button.  I think that this is an excellent feature, and while it is not defaulted, it is easy to turn on.  The keypad is sturdy feeling, lights up when you use it (great if you are in the dark), and is easy to see and feel.I am absolutely delighted with this lock.  I now won't worry if I lose my keys (I can just use the keypad!) and I feel a little more secure with this deadbolt on a door that previously didn't have one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFZ35M0H9OKF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008EX66GC#wasThisHelpful","RTFZ35M0H9OKF","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I already have the Mr. Beams under cabinet motion sensitive lights, and we have been delighted with them, so I had high expectations for this set. I have to say that it is better than I hoped it would be.  I hate being in the dark when the power goes out (who doesn't?) and it always seems to be a shuffle to find where the kids have hidden/misplaced the flashlights.  These little lights sense when the power is out (you plug a central switch into a plug, and when the power goes out, the switch sends a signal to the other lights) and they all turn on.  I put the three over head lights in the living room, over the kitchen table, in in the upstairs hall.  I put the three smaller lights in the bathrooms (who likes to use the restroom in the dark :-)?  Not me).  The lights all come with plates that can be used to mount them with screws, but I decided that I would do something a little different and installed them all with industrial strength velcro.  This made installing them securely on the ceiling a snap, and I think it is a great choice also if you don't have tools available.  The sensor switch can also be used to turn all the lights on with a single button, even when the power is functional.  The sensor switch can be unplugged and used as a flashlight, which is kinda nifty.These lights are LED's, so don't use much in the way of battery power.  Also, the light they give is pretty bright, and mounted on the ceiling, they give enough light that we will all be happy to sit around the kitchen table and talk when the power is out.I am very pleased with this system.  I think it is an easy to install, excellent choice if you want some power outage lighting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA9X4VF3H1BTU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005R2T8MM#wasThisHelpful","RA9X4VF3H1BTU","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like shrimp, and I like chocolate ice cream.  I don't usually have them together.  So when I heard that there was a bluegrass album of 80's songs, I thought, hmm, chocolate ice cream shrimp.  Nah.  But I couldn't get the idea out of my head, so I gave it a chance.  I am an 80's music fanatic, and a blue-grass picker and singer, so I felt pretty qualified to give this album the dressing down that I was sure it would deserve.  To my surprise and pleasure, this is an album full of talented folk doing blue-grass justice to a bunch of fun 80's songs.  No one here is trying to take themselves too seriously, but everyone is playing songs that they clearly love, and are playing their hearts out.  Standouts include a really creative version of ""Take on Me"" (I am an a-ha fan, so I was glad that this was given a good version), ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" (great great musicianship, the voice is too one note to get it right but still enjoyable), and a truly fantastic version of ""Come On Eileen""--Once more the voice is fine, but the banjo pickin' is absolutely in-freakin-credible.  This album is a good time from beginning to end, none of the songs are unlistenable, although I'm not wild about the comparatively dull version of ""Kiss"" (gone is the heavily rhythmic funk that made that song so irresistable).  I think that this would have been a great party to attend, as it must have been an absolute party to record!

"I wasn't sure where Mark Hollis could go after the classic duo of Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock.  I sort of think that perhaps he wasn't sure where to go either, because there was no more Talk Talk after those albums, and no more Mark Hollis for 7 years.  This album is simply a revelation.  He is no longer dealing in forms as abstract as those of Laughing Stock, but the songs are just as thoroughly composed and carefully instrumented as those post-rock masterpieces.  The difference here is that his songs seem more intimate than grandiose, lyrics whispered and intoned gently over acoustic instruments--I often can't tell what he is talking about because he sings so softly, but the emotion comes through as clear as day.  This is a singular album, a marvellous achievement, and a crown to Mark Hollis' storied and incredible career; my only sadness is that after this album all we have is...silence.

"The Colour of Spring is a magnificent piece of 80's songwriting--both of the time, and timeless.  The songs are well constructed, perfectly played, and sung with luminous intensity by the great under-appreciated Mark Hollis, who really must be one of the most accomplished soulful pop vocalists of his time.  This is simply an extraordinary album, and well worth the time to check out.

"I love Talk Talk.  They are an enigma to me--how could a band who put out a competent and well composed but ultimately not especially original album like their first album suddenly make a leap forward like this?  And how did they get from here to their ultimate magnum Opus Spirit of Eden?  (Laughing Stock is amazing, but I don't enjoy it quite as much as SoE).  I'm not sure.  This album still manages to enchant me even after all these years.  Renee is simply searing in its agony, and It's My Life is a classic of the New Wave.  I'm not sure what to make of Dum Dum Girl, but it is infectious enough that I sing it in my head.  Anyway, a great album for fans of the New Wave, but I implore you, if you are investigating Talk Talk, don't give up before you get to the end of their output.

"I'm a child of the 80's, but I somehow managed to miss Japan.  I've heard about them for years, because I listen to Dali's Car, and I'm a fan of Duran Duran; Japan always seems to come up in discussion of these artists (for good reason).  Recently, I've become a fan of Ryuichi Sakamoto, and through him of David Sylvian.  That pathway led me finally to this--Gentlemen Take Polaroids.  I'm now incredibly frustrated that I resisted the siren song of Japan for so long, for this album is a masterpiece of the New Romantic--sonically, a fascinating mixture of pulsing 80's synths, suave vocals, insistent beats, and amazing bass work.  Sylvian's voice is different here than it is now--less mannered, less full of vibrato, but still rich and smooth, a perfect counterpoint to the excellent songcraft on display here.  This is simply a perfect encapsulation of all the promise that the late 70's/early 80's cutting edge pop had to offer--danceability, mystery, excitement.

"This looks to be a great album, and in some ways it is, but it has a giant caveat:  you are about to listen to a ton of great music as interpreted by someone different than you are expecting.  These are not the original versions--these are all covers by competent professionals, and the songs are pretty darn good, but unless you have a strange need to hear cover versions of Bond classics, then this is not going to be the album for you.  Essentially, this is well performed karaoke.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RL2FEKB6EYQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009THY560#wasThisHelpful","R2RL2FEKB6EYQE","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My 5 year old read this to me the minute we got it, and had a ball.  He has read it several times to himself.  I was a little put off by the bizarre drawing of the cows nose (it looks like a hot dog) but clearly that was an artistic/stylistic choice.  It certainly didn't bother my kiddo, who was charmed by the otherwise excellent illustrations.  The writing is simple and engaging, and the story was fun.

"My kindle fit easily into this case, and is very secure.  I like the way the case looks--it is very stylish.  It is cushiony and I think would protect the kindle from a short fall.  The kindle paperwhite is light, and is pretty sturdy on its own. The fact that the case extends a little beyond the border of the device makes me feel that a reasonable bump would not transmit much force to the screen.  The case is light and easy to hold; all in all I like this case very much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R306729MMTGT4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008MF3QMO#wasThisHelpful","R306729MMTGT4X","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have 3 dirt devil products--two hand vacs, and now this full size pet vacuum.  First off, I have 5 cats and they shed, so I was excited about this vacuum designed for pet issues.  I couldn't wait to try the little pet hair attachments, and they worked pretty well.  Is this going to be a panacea for pet hair?  Well...no.  But it is at least as good as any other vacuum, and the rubberized attachments do seem to pull hair off couches pretty well; I guess that my cats just shed more than any vacuum can be expected to pick up easily.  I didn't expect magic, so I'm pleased with what I have.There's more to love here also:  the cannister vac is great.  I love not having bags to change, and the suction power is good.  I wish the cannister were a little bigger, but you can't have everything.  The vacuum was pretty easy to assemble, and it is light enough to carry up and down stairs easily.  The motor has a nice zing to it and helps move the device across the floor at a good clip.I like this little vacuum a lot; I dock it one star because of the cannister size and because I'm not sure that it is more than ""somewhat better"" than my regular vacuum at picking up pet hair, which is its advertised function.  Still, it is powerful, easy to maneuver, light, and simple to use.  A very good little vacuum which I think would be great for a small apartment, or as an accessory vacuum in a big house.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHC9RLEHZ5WCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008L5F5C4#wasThisHelpful","RHC9RLEHZ5WCN","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have some dark areas under counters, like everyone does.  I didn't think that putting a light in the area would make that big a difference, but now that these are installed (very easy in about 2 minutes), I am delighted.  Motion sensors turn the light on when you move near them, and the light is bright and clear.  The lights themselves are thin and can't be seen when they are stuck up under the counter.

"This case is sort of adequate, in that I believe that my Kindle is probably more secure in it than it would be out of it.  Pros: Sturdy back is lightweight and simple, easy to fit kindle into it.  Cons: There is very little (read: virtually none) protection if you drop your kindle.  This is not a padded/bumpered otterbox style case.  It is designed to be form fitting and not add much to the size factor, and if that is the most important thing to you, then this is fine.  But if you are more interested in protecting your investment, I think that one good drop to the ground from your night stand and I'd be worried about my screen.On the subject of the screen, let's discuss that lid flap.  In a word, virtually useless.  There is no closure to it, so while it does lay flat over your screen while your device is level, if you tilt the device, the screen cover will slide down.  There is an elastic band on the back that you can use to close it, which is fine, but I find my lid slipping a little even with the band in place, exposing the edge of the glass--exactly what I do not want.  The stand feature is a ""one size fits all"" type--the lid bends up and attaches to a groove in the back of the case. There is only one setting, so I hope that does it for you.I don't care too much about style, but if you are into style, then this takes ""simple"" to a new level.  There is essentially no additional pizazz added to your device.  That might be important for some, so I mention it.This is a no-frills case.  It is functional, and it is lightweight.  I'm not sure if it is going to do much to really protect my Kindle from a drop, and it certainly won't help with a spill, so I guess I'm going to need to invest in a case for my case.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHYI2XECLZWLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009X00E18#wasThisHelpful","RHYI2XECLZWLR","A17M1HL6U2GS7M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A17M1HL6U2GS7M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It never ceases to amaze me how Sufjian can put out as much music as he does at such a high level of creativity and quality--but he does.  Here, I found myself enveloped in a thoughtful, joyful, playful mix of Christmas music all sung sweetly and sincerely by someone who clearly loves Christmas as much as I do.  I love Christmas music, but so often, there is just one more retread of the same songs--you won't really find that here.  The songs you know are new again sung by Sufjian, and the new tunes fit in really well with the old.  The fact that there are 50+ tracks in this set is unreal, and an absolute delight.  I cannot recommend this Christmas set highly enough for anyone who loves Sufjian or Indie pop.  If you are looking for something to set the mood and keep you in the spirit of the season, this is a great set.

"So how big a portal fan are you?  If you are like me, pretty big. In fact, if you end up on this page, you are almost certainly a big portal fan, because let's face it, this music is not going to be burning up the top 40 charts any time soon.  So, Mr. or Mrs. Big Fan, here you go--four discs worth of portally goodness to listen to as you are testing (or doing anything else you want).  There's all the tunes you know and love, including some tracks from Portal 1, and some vocals from GLaDOS (you murdering fiend).  Please be aware that many of these tracks are available for free from the Official Portal site, but if you need to have a physical copy, then this will suit you just fine.  I give it five stars because I admire the obsessive completion that lets it span four discs, and the composition is all top notch--but you knew that, because you've played the game 15 times already.  Haven't you? Well haven't you?

"I'm finding myself in the Christmas spirit already due to a pair of albums just released.  Katharine Jenkins just released a Christmas album that is lovely and traditional, with a big orchestra and an elegant feel.  That album is a wonderful accompaniement to night time, but I'm gonna need something peppier to listen to as I decorate the tree with the kids, and Holidays Rule fits that bill perfectly.  Starting off with a really fun (I know, I went there) rendition of Sleigh Ride by (you guessed it) Fun., the album is full of original and delightful versions of Christmas classics.  McCartney's ""The Christmas Song"" is such a pleasure--his voice sounds 30 years younger.  ""Green Grows the Holly"" is done by Calexico (one of my fave bands), and Holly Golightly reminds us again why she is so incredible with her perfect rendition of ""That's What I Want for Christmas"".  If you want to enjoy Christmas tunes you know in some delightful arrangements (including the marvellous ""Wonderful Christmastime"" by the Shins), then pick this album up.  Great fun, good spirit.

Her lovely rounded mezzo is clear and pure, and the orchestra is full and warm.  Together, they envelop you in a holiday feeling suitable for cozy evenings by the fire with a cup of hot chocolate and a good book.  Her O Come O Come Emmanuel is especially lovely, and I was delighted to see the John Rutter piece ""I Wish You Christmas"" included.

"Author Andreas Clenow has done an outstanding job writing a landmark book for readers interested in systematic trend following of futures. He gives basic systematic trend following strategies with entry and exit parameters, position sizing, and shows the watch list for futures markets needed for proper diversification. He explains systems based on breakouts and moving average crossovers. It's amazing how his backtested returns correlate closely to the returns of some of the top managed futures trend following firms in the industry.The trend following system examples are a great place for a trader to start to develop their own system that fits their risk tolerance levels and return goals. The book does a great job taking the reader through a year by year breakdown of the system's performance, and explains the emotions that would be experienced trading the system in real-time. The book does an outstanding job explaining the needed discipline and proper position sizing that must go side by side with the entry and exit signals to make the system work.The key lessons are that the leverage of futures provide the opportunity for out-sized returns for relatively small position sizes. The money not needed for futures positions can be used to gain interest in bonds to increase earnings. From a money managers perspective, you have to communicate to your investors and explain the system to help avoid withdrawals during drawdowns. Trend following works primarily through the diversification available through the futures markets, and profitability comes from large trends that pay for all the small losses.This book does the best job I have ever seen explaining the principles of trend following with managed futures. This is a great book for anyone interested in creating their own trend following system for their personal account, or even aspiring to be a money manager in the industry. Andreas Clenow does a wonderful job explaining the process step-by-step, as well as the pitfalls and rewards available in the industry.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNFLGPLYLTXZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118410858#wasThisHelpful","RNFLGPLYLTXZF","A3V1EPSE6XDC0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1EPSE6XDC0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andreas Clenow’s new book takes the reader through creating a mechanical trend following system using momentum ranking for stocks in the S&P 500 index. This is an outstanding trading book because it shows the reader year by year performance, and explains the emotions that a trader goes through during drawdowns in trading capital. Mr. Clenow does an amazing job of explaining the realities of trading, including how an equity curve can cause traders to abandon long term winning systems due to short term losses.I like that he emphasizes that you will only be profitable by focusing on your trading principles for risk management and capturing stocks that are moving with momentum, and not a magical optimization of a system with historical data, or finding the perfect indicators.He uses a 200 day simple moving average on the S&P 500 index as his primary going to a cash position for his momentum stocks. This is the same one I use as my major trend indicator, and it can cut your drawdowns in half during corrections and bear markets, and his system proves this. He explains the difficulty of trend trading downtrends through selling short, because the stock market tends to be more volatile and often rallies during bear markets. This makes it more difficult to capture downside momentum and trends.He illustrates the necessity of learning coding if you want to create thoroughly backtested mechanical trading systems at a professional level.This book is a must have for every trading library. His concepts, warnings, advice, and systematic quantified trading approach are important for any trader. It is one of the best trading books I have read because it brings together all the important trading principles and concepts and explains how they can be implemented in the real world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE2MYCZPKCDQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YPHZO3W#wasThisHelpful","RE2MYCZPKCDQ4","A3V1EPSE6XDC0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1EPSE6XDC0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I appreciate Mark Ritchie sending me a review copy of this book. I have the utmost respect Mr. Ritchie's market successes and interview in Jack Schwager's ""Market Wizards"" book.This book is much different than other trading books you will read as the author begins with a warning that trading is probably not for you and your time could be best spent in a pursuit of an easier path in life. Mr. Ritchie warns sternly that the pursuit of profitable trading can be a brutal path filled with pain that few can handle. He even spends the first chapter discussing all the people that he knows were financially ruined by trading and the dangers of suicide in our business. The reasons for these dangers is why I always discuss the importance of risk management and managing of the risk of ruin in my own trading books and blog.After reading hundreds of trading books this book still stood out as one of the best explanations on how hard it was to trade through a long term equity curve and the mental and emotional pain of drawdowns in capital during losing streaks. I also found his explanation of how impossible it was to mathematically be a profitable trader for any length of time if you are risking too much on any one trade very concise. Mr. Ritchie shows with mathematical examples how the results of a string of wins and losses is affected by percent of capital at risk per trade.His approach for explaining drawdowns through a sequence of wins and losses and not just losses in a row was one of the most important perspectives that a trader can gain in understanding the importance of position sizing and stop losses. One of the best explanations I have ever heard.The book also directs the reader to Ritchie's app that simulates an equity curve based on capital at risk and a trader's win/loss ratio.It is like a future test for your own systems equity curve.Ritchie is a devout Christian and writes about trading through a biblical perspective and about the hypocrisy of many in the Christian world. The book also dives into Christian Apologetics and gives answers for his faith.This is one of those books that explains the realities of trading, the good, the bad, and the ugly. It can help take a trader to the next level that reads it and really takes it to heart. The risk per trade, the dangers, and the rewards are all there for those who are disciplined and focused enough to follow the right path.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLJVYB2UDU43/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0964695200#wasThisHelpful","R1NLJVYB2UDU43","A3V1EPSE6XDC0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1EPSE6XDC0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Out of the many car cell phone holders I have reviewed this is my favorite. The clasp fits firmly in the vent so it does not slide or fall out, but it will allow the phone to rotate while in the holder. This makes it convenient to place your phone where you can see it while in the car. The holder itself that the phone fits into slides on one side and then hugs the phone so it locks in place. This is a very high quality device that will last for years and adjust to the size of your phone. No magnets needed on this one like so many others.

"These shorts are meant for those that are active. The fabric is interesting that it draws sweat away from the skin so you stay very dry even when working out.

"This book is truly a map to the human pursuit of happiness. This book shows the reader how to pursue and find harmony within our self and on our journey through life's circumstances. The author brings to life the ancient wisdom of Lao Tzu for modern readers that relates well to our current world and circumstances. One key is the understanding between physical pain and mental suffering and that we are the cause of most of our mental pain through living a life of imbalance. The book suggests the path to a quality life with serenity flow from balance. Excess and indulgence is shown to be the path to unhappiness and frustration. The keys to life balance are found in quietism, self restraint, and meditation. The power of Tao lies within us. Its exercise does not depend on any external being. While Buddhist are focused on alleviating suffering the Taoist are dedicated to sustaining the personal harmony that overshadows suffering and avoids it in the first place. The books takes the reader through the how to use the Tao through all areas of life step by step. The definition of what soul mates truly are by fulfilling all four meanings of love from the ancient Greek meanings. This is a landmark book and one of the few life maps you will really need to guide you to a life of harmony and happiness.

It has less than 10 calories and 4 grams of carbohydrates per teaspoon which is 40% less calories and 75% less carbohydrates than sugar. Xylitol does not cause tooth decay, is low glycemic, and has zero aftertaste. It is a more healthy alternative to regular sugar.

"I have taken fish oil for over a decade for its health benefits and anti-inflammation properties. With essential omega 3 fatty acids missing from the American diet this is the perfect way to get your daily dose. I typically had bought my fish oil at GNC but I am thrilled to have found this particular product here on Amazon. It is pharmaceutical grade fish oil which is as pure and high quality as it gets so no burpy after taste of fish. This oil is derived from wild caught fish not farm raised for a much better quality of oil. The distillation process removes all the heavy metals normally found in fish so this is 100% safe and healthy. It contains 1,250 mg of fish oil pure pill since it is double strength.

"This is different from other blue tooth speakers that are compatible with phones and tablets becasue it is waterproof. This is very convenient for those that want to listen to music in the bath, shower, out side, or while boating. The shape and size are incredibly convenient and I use it all the time even while at my desk. The suction cup on the back is meant for the shower or bath tub but works anywhere for portable convenient music. It takes a few hour to charge but can go for ten hours on one charge and comes with a USB port cable to use for charging. I am very impressed with how easy it is to set up on blue tooth so it can be used wireless to turn phones and tablets into little stereo systems.

"I am very impressed with these compact candles that come in so many amazing scents. They are hand poured in the United States in glass jars. They come packaged in a thick cardboard box that keeps them safe from breaking during shipping. Cotton paper wicks are used for a consistently smooth and slow burn and the fragrant oils really bring a nice smell to a room. They are smaller and more compact than most other candles but still burn 20 hours and stay looking much more clean than the bigger messier commercial candles that are so popular. They provide a nice soft light in a dark room. These are very nice and I enjoyed my set of three.“I received free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSQVY4WVRMQT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MX6F36U#wasThisHelpful","R3HSQVY4WVRMQT","A3V1EPSE6XDC0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1EPSE6XDC0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first read the original version of this book over eight years ago and it was the book that finally gave me the overall structure I needed to understand all the dynamics of my trading. I have read hundreds of trading books and this one still stands head and shoulders above the rest for its handling of the dynamics of managing the risk to your money, the trader's mind, and the developing and following of a trading method.I really like the clarity of the charts in this new edition using charts from the StockCharts website that I use daily,If you read and follow the principles in this book you will make enough money on your trades to pay for this book many times over. I have been an active participate in the markets for over 20 years as both a trader and investor and I agree with Dr. Elder completely having lived out the greed, fear, and mistakes he talks about through out the book.Read this book and save yourself a lot of unnecessary losses of both financial and mental capital.The first section of this book teaches you the psychology of successful trading:1). You must be committed to being a trader for the long haul.2). Learn all that you can, but be skeptical, go with what works.3). Develop a method for analyzing the market.4). Develop a money management plan.5). Do not get greedy and rush into trades.6). Understand that you can be your own worst enemy through greed, fear, and emotions.7). You must change to be a profitable trader .Dr. Elder explains his own trading tactics and methodology.In the Risk Management section he covers the most important strategy of when to exit? He suggests setting a stop-loss on every trade so you keep losses small and the importance of protecting profits with trailing stops.He also suggests never risking more than 2% of your account on any one trade, and never losing more than 6-8% of your account in any one month.He makes a great point that all true professionals in any field do not count their money daily. Traders should focus on their trading not their daily paper profits. Traders should focus on following their trading plan and let the profits take care of themselves.Buy this book, you will profit from it, whether you are a beginner or an advanced trader, it will make you more professional and logical. It will show you that traders are only profitable by trading a winning method using risk management with discipline by managing their own thoughts and emotions.Dr. Elders background in psychology really makes him perfect to be the one that wrote one of the most all encompassing trading books on the market today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F1S9ALP817LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118443926#wasThisHelpful","R1F1S9ALP817LM","A3V1EPSE6XDC0C","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3V1EPSE6XDC0C?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very handy light that does not need to be plugged in it runs off 4 double 'A' batteries and the cover slides off so no need for a screw driver. It has three setting on/off/ and auto. It gives off a very soft light that is good for dark places. It attaches with an adhesive strip to most surfaces. I would advise not putting it where it can be rained on because the adhesive can not get wet and still hold. It has a motion detector that makes it come on when something moves near it. It is convenient and very easy to use. I only wish the light was a little brighter for better outside uses.

"I liked the chocolate peanut butter flavor bar over this one. I had to give this flavor to my daughter since she likes other types chocolate mint flavored items. She ate them but did not love this flavor either but she liked the other flavors it comes in. But from a nutritional standpoint it is excellent for Vegans. This nutrition bar was created for vegans with 12 full grams of plant-based protein derived from brown rice and peas. It can easily be added as a meal replacement to anyone's diet for a dose of healthy protein. With 270 calories and 34 carbohydrates this bar was intended to be utilized as a meal replacement not to add it on as extra calories in addition to three meals a day. It has more calories than most candy bars but it does deliver nutrients like omega 3 essential fats, pro-biotics, and antioxidants along with vitamins and minerals. It is great for those concerned with GMO ingredients it is free of them; and it is a vegan product with no animal products used and is also gluten-free. It is light and delicious with each bite having the taste of rich chocolate, peanut butter with an additional crunchy layer of seeds and nuts.

"I would take another star off for the marketing hype. There is nothing innovative here. The word ""dynamic"" should read ""elastic"" and the term ""progressive resistance"" as ""you can pick one, two or three straps"". The exercise guide is nothing that is not obvious from the pictures you see on the offering page here.  I did not take off the other star because the above is normal when dealing with a simple product imported from China. It works as one would expect, so it gets four stars.To get five stars, all that would have been necessary would have been to include a couple of other sets of bands marked with their resistance value. That way, you could have a nicer gradation of resistance. That way, you could choose to have a more effective workout depending upon the demands of each exercise, and whether you were going for maximum stress or longer sets of repetitions. Obviously you could also have a finer gradation as your strength increases, if that is your goal.As it is, one strap is a good way to do the exercise pictured where she stretches both arms out, and doing several sets of, say, ten repetitions. Or as the picture where he is stretching one arm with the other stationary at his sternum, using all three is not difficult. Just remember that when two straps is chosen, take out the middle strap to maintain balance. The straps are removed easily and replaced securely with this design.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13A6VH4KVAVAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146N7F4A#wasThisHelpful","R13A6VH4KVAVAZ","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Makes sense Hall would start his selection of old poems with ""My Son the Executioner"", since he is living it out some sixty years later. Seems he still agrees with what he wrote about an instrument of immortality. Makes sense that many of his selections are on aging and some deaths.No preface or introduction, he pitches lines strait at us. He poses more questions than he answers. Besides that immortality, why does he say that most gunslingers are left handed? Is that a symbol for sinister? No matter, he is fun to read when he lets out the sun.  I like his ""unfriendly birds (they really are, you know) -- and out comes his little nods to Poe.For a kid that went to a bunch of snooty schools, Exeter, Harvard and Oxford, he emerged awake and aware. He has not been not afeared of poetic form and structure. Early on he punched above his weight landing combinations of meter and of rhyme. Must have been all those good years at Michigan. A few baseball selections are here. ""Old Timer's Day"" is one; his dad had taken him to see Ted Williams in his prime. But the stinker leaves out his brilliant nine stanza, ""Baseball"". He figures those who like that stuff will go buy a copy of ""Museum of Clear Ideas, where it is the lead-off poem.Not to give the idea at all that the subject is overdone with him, baseball is hard to write poetry about, as if any subject were easy. He does it without any of that phone George Will boyish, cuts-pie drivel. He wrote a book of essays on sports, too. Late in this slim collection, Hall returns to baseball, but as a means to his long dead love, Jane, and with a few other ingredients into ""Meatloaf"".Finally, a brief Afterword. Like Milton, he decided on poetry early. If this book is your first, it may well lead you to others.

"I remember my lengthy time reading Heidegger (""not the man, but the matter of his thinking"") as a protracted mental hernia.The memory of that pain, because it is a memory, nostalgic and rose, returned in some part of its true agony as soon as I started Trawny's splendid little volume. Early on he remembers Junger's characterizing Heidegger's home as the forest -- the untrodden and the uncertain. Great; back to a place where home means its own opposite. Again a queasy guest at Heidegger's home, I was home again.Heidegger rode Nietzsche's horse into the end of the 19th century and came flying out the other side in an airplane. His horrible style, knotty language, is the torture of creation. The horror is his unbearable butchery of a dozen millennia of pleasant error. Syntax and etymology are his flashing cleavers.Truth is nothing out there just waiting for discovery. His hacking, slashing and gutting blows are what eventuate truth or meaning. Plato's Idealism, Kant and Hegel's Absolute, any eternal truth is a mug's game. Even the more durable truths like mathematics or physics are in the ruins of incoherence and incompleteness, those jaws of Godel's Kerberos. [ I think Heidegger is blown into the swamp here because he errs in being forced by the sheer gale of his own thought into taking math to be objective and therefore not truly true.]Trawny throws himself into this muck like the old anarchist (brilliantly rendered by Fernando Rey) in Wertmuller's ""Seven Beauties"", when the concentration camp inmate hurls himself into the cess pool. Hmm, movies can eventuate truths where no mere language alone can. Trawny dances around Heidegger's ashes to conjure his truths of the Schwarze Hefte for us.But what is there for Trawny to do about the elephant in the lebensraum? What good is any of this in the face of anti-semitic National Socialism? His already slender volume shrunk further still in my hands. Trawny attempts to pull a rabbit out of Heidegger's hat. He wills to be the magician he has shown Heidegger to have been. To shut down his philosophy in this conclusive guilt is to join the guilty. Trials reach conclusions, but philosophy cannot, even in madness. Anti-semitism, in full flame of evil cannot be proscribed because no proscribing can be legitimate a priori.Sophistry? Yes says Trawny. Guilty again.  Old Marty was a sophist, an alchemist and a true devil worshiping theology. But what of Hanna and her testimony of his greatness? Nothing. No thing. Nothing? Still guilty and still concluded. So just how is one to disentangle thought and action? For ten thousand years the brain followed the hand. Then and more and more the hand began to follow the mind -- for good and for ill.""When Thales, contemplating the sky, fell into the well, the Thracian girl laughed""So might all our thinking be the proper object for ridicule.

Write! and Talk...rinse and repeat...Thank you for your patience","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NA51J1JBED2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074569523X#wasThisHelpful","R2NA51J1JBED2F","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a handy pry bar to get good leverage in hard to fit tight spaces. It offers superior range of motion from fixed bars. I will include photographs that show the extreme ranges allowed. It was exactly what I needed to replace my car’s serpentine belt, a very light duty job.In my opinion this pry bar is suited for light and medium duty.  I personally would not trust the adjustable indexing gear for extended heavy duty use and depending on what I was lifting, I might be concerned about safety. But that’s just me. To my feel the indexing gear appears to be the stress point on the tool. The company has a very good video on YouTube and I recommend viewing before purchasing to help you visualize and answer questions you might not think of. The video demonstration shows removal the indexing gear from the metal bar and handle which makes me think that the gear is designed to be able to be replaced.The handle is not padded and does not have a comfort grip. I prefer the steel grip handle because it allows me to be brutal. The GearWrench is manufactured in China for Apex Tools.I like the tool. It’s a good addition to my tool box.

"This toy is pretty cute to look at, but I wish there were a few adjustments. The concept is basic: baby stacks blocks onto the head, or drops one in the mouth. A dropped block will make arms move, and then exit either the left or right foot, so it's a surprise for baby.Con 1: The drop is almost instant, and even I don't have time to really notice the arms move or the block fall. I wish it were designed with more resistance in the arms, so the movement was slower and baby could actually watch the path of the block fall. This would give a better sense of cause and effect: how the moving blocks move the arms, and how the arms change the path of the block.Con 2: There's no way to store the blocks inside or with the zebra (they are designed to always fall out), so that I can put the toy away and easily keep all the parts together.These are biggest points. But, like I said, the design is cute, and it's also sturdy. The blocks are good for stacking or rolling on their own. Maybe I can find a way to gum up the arms, so the toy is more fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9WV0IZ2W1LW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO7H0BS#wasThisHelpful","R2I9WV0IZ2W1LW","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I started working out with a personal trainer after a hospitalization a few years back. Patrick has done a world of good for me but he can’t be there all the time. He’s not there while I’m stuck all day at the computer on conference calls, writing, creating reports and managing project workflows.  I focus on work and forget that my body needs attention too; I simply forget to move until its too late and everything hurts.The gentle reminder of the Pivotal Living Band keeps monitors my movement and inactivity.  It is an easy, painless way of keeping my needs in alignment even when I’m under stress.Yes, I could schedule more time each week with Patrick. But the band costs less than one additional session and its with me always, even monitoring my sleep. Patrick agrees, this wearable monitor is an important addition to caring for my health. I can use the Pivotal Living App to graph for Patrick my last few days so he has a better idea of what my workout should include.The only potential concern that I can see is personal security. You register and use the app from your phone or tablet. After that I don't control  my data and for what I can tell, have no user privacy. The phone and tablet point back directly to me with no filtering of identity. I do not have control or assurance  that HIPAA protections are being observed to keep my identity and health monitoring records confidential, non-discoverable and away from anyone to whom I don't care to divulge. I don't know how my records may be used. This may be a concern for only a few but it is a concern that each person should consciously decide if it's important.The Pivotal Living Band has significant potential advantages for improving health. I would just prefer if Pivotal Living gave me greater assurance and control of personal data.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PX7BWN3FXGL3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015121DP2#wasThisHelpful","R1PX7BWN3FXGL3","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our daughter rolled in the night and falling out of bed was a problem.  We never needed a trip to the emergency room but I worried about it. We used a hard plastic bed rail and that solved the problem but it was ackward removing the rail each morning.This bed rail is mesh around an aluminum frame; instructions describe how to fit the bottom straps under the mattress box spring or platform to hold the rail in place against the side of the bed. The rail becomes part of the bed fixture.The mesh center is soft and will hold a child’s weight but with enough give to encourages her movements back into bed, or so I believe. A hard, firm rail gives the illusion of permanent edge support; I suspect registering in the child’s mind that the side of the bed is safe. The mesh is removable and machine washable.I like that when you depress two buttons at adult’s arms reach, the hinge folds to allow the rail to fold down out of the way so our child can get in and out of bed comfortably. Since the rail fits twin, full and queen size mattresses, I would feel comfortable with an infant co-sleeping and nursing in bed at night as mom rotates with her infant.Grey is a nice neutral, soothing color.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJHZWQDU42NXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XR1LSMI#wasThisHelpful","RJHZWQDU42NXJ","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love these Merino Kids Sleep Bags and have bought several at different sizes.  I researched heavily before ordering and purchased along with Merino Kids infant line, Cocooi Baby, a Winter Schlummersack and a Kangapouch Down Sleepsack. We like to keep our house cool for night time sleeping and all these allow us that continued small treat without worry that our baby will get too cool because she kicked off covers.My favorites of all the bags are the Merino Kids. Yes they are expensive and they last years. They are not as expensive as the Canadian Kangapouch. They are more expensive than Schlummersack’s winter down. I eliminated many competitors that were less expensive because I think Merino Kids are better quality and durable for both winter and summer wear. We made these purchases early with our first child and will be able to take full use of their value. I expect these will last through several children.Merino Kids is an award winning New Zealand company. They have a US website which gives greater detail on their Sleepsacks.I really like the design. The winter-weight sleep bag has a merino wool lining with an organic cotton outer layer. The merino superfine wool lining is soft and thin, but not too thin. Stitching is well done. I love wool because it is very breathable, absorbs and releases moisture, and regulates baby’s body temperature. Merino Kids colors are pretty and make it attractive. Arm snaps are used to make the torso and arms smaller for use with an infant. Shoulder snaps are on one arm to keep the sack from accidently coming off a standing child. Snaps and bottom round zipper are solid quality and makes it easy to get the sack on and off or to change diapers. Front and back slit openings are handy for checking to see if diapers need changing and for easy placement through a car seat carrier or stroller. The zipper is designed for parents, easy to slide and easy to open to change a sleeping child (without having the fabric all bunch up) yet harder for exploring fingers to figure out. The generous bottom size and design helps me feel like our daughter is comfortable while sleeping.We will co-sleep with our daughter. I expect to careful place her on top of our covers and blankets where she is less likely to be hurt by night time rolling or falling out of bed. Cocooned in a sleep sack she doesn’t need the additional warmth from our covers and blankets. I'm sure to check sleeping arrangements carefully with the pediatrician for specific suggestions.This sleep bag is washable (special care instructions) and dry-cleanable. To keep the wool soft and not scratchy, I mix well a  teaspoon of Lanolin in a warm solution of Eucalan soap until it is cloudy with no visible strands of lanolin, before adding to my wool laundry in a delicate/hand wash. Be sure to mix well or the lanolin may leave stain spots. I’ll consider dry cleaning at end of season hoping that can extend the life of the sleeping bag for our next child","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LGO51O12OADJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EU8EVQW#wasThisHelpful","R3LGO51O12OADJ","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When our family travels, we prefer to listen and share audiobooks or watch movies. In public places listening has been unavailable both because we need low volume to not disturb others and the volume needs to be loud enough to hear. Sharing simply has been more difficult than it needed to be.Now my wife and I can listen with good sound and we can share with our kids when the mood suits them. Getting stuck at airports, long flights, drives or long waits at the doctors offices no longer means boring, lost hours. Our test of the splitter adding different headphones found no discernable problems.  We are ready for our next trip and Belkin Splitter will find a permanent home in the carry-on bag.Nicely, an extender cord is included so one listener can be 2 feet further from the source.

It is soft and thin, but not too thin almost a midweight and to my feel, about the thickness of a good quality cotton kitchen towel, except in wool. Stitching is well done. This style for infant is perfect for day or night time wear. Its good for day wear because you don't need an extra blanket. We can move our child from room to room easily and unencumbered by extra stuff.Cocooi line colors are earthtone.  I believe the colors are attractive and neutral even in our raspberry or Honey Oat, for either girl or boy. The Kimono style wrap top makes it easy to go on and off through the bottom round zipper. It’s easy to get the sack open to change diapers on a sleeping baby. Front and back slit openings are handy for checking to see if diapers need changing and for easy placement through a car seat carrier or stroller. The zipper is designed for parents, reasonable to slide open to change a sleeping child (without having the fabric all bunch up).We will co-sleep with our child. I expect to place her in a basket for the first couple of months and then to careful place our child on top of our covers and blankets where she is less likely to be hurt by night time rolling or falling out of bed.  We’ll check with her pediatrician for suggestions.

This sleep bag is washable with special care instructions. It also may be dry-cleaned. To keep wool soft I will use an approved wool washing liquid with lanolin. And I’ll probably consider dry cleaning at end of season to save it for our next child.The only con for me is:The cost for 3 months of wear for a single child. But as I’ve written, I do expect that this Cocooi Infant sleep bag will last for several children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TYPXR30NDPI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J93UVLC#wasThisHelpful","R2TYPXR30NDPI2","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Omega 3 is thought to be important for babies’ brain development and mom’s mood. But I find it difficult to eat enough fish that is low in Mercury, high in Omega 3 and tasty.Even though I'm taking prenatal vitamins not all prenatal contain DHA. I have have an easy time swallowing these soft gels. If your pregnancy pills don’t contain DHA you probably also need to supplement and should ask your doctor.I read in WebMD that a baby’s developing brain, is designed to accumulate large amounts of DHA during gestation and the first two years of life. Interesting to me, this two years corresponds to WebMD reporting that researchers found that babies born to mothers with higher levels of Omega-3s and especially DHA in their blood at delivery have higher levels of attention span into the babies’ 2nd year.So taking DHA and Omega-3s is thought to help my gestating baby’s brain and eye development and concentration.I have my doctor’s approval. I am in late stage pregnancy and mixing with the supplements I current take will not cause overdosing. My doctor cautioned that many women unintentionally overdose all sorts of vitamins and he emphasized with me that overdosing could hurt baby and mom. I am going to continue taking through pregnancy and breast feeding because DHA is transmitted through mothers milk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DF35VYKUO5FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014JTF2LO#wasThisHelpful","R2DF35VYKUO5FM","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received in the mail a 1-month HP “SmartFriend Complete Plan” tech support card, good for a single PC or tablet. Service must be registered within 6-months of purchase, so it’s a good idea to keep a record; I wrote the date on the front of the card with a permanent Sharpie and plan to save for immediate use in the event of a malware issue.It looks like a credit card or gift card. I will register by calling a toll free number, give them the card pin and use as needed. The techs offer the choice of walking you through the problems or with my authorization, log onto my computer and solve the problem by remotely looking at and having access to my computer screen and programs while I look on. Once we sign out of the session, the tech cannot get reauthorized to back into my computer without new input from me. I’ve done remote tech service before and I highly recommend it.Since I’m saving the card for potential future malware / virus issues, if our daughter were to develop a problem I could conference a call with her and tech support and activate the 1-month service on her computer across country.Services listed on the website for 1-computer include:➢24/7 phone support with remote login assistance➢Virus, spyware and malware removal➢Help with software problems and error messages➢Software installation and setup➢Learn how to protect and back up your photos and documents➢Setup and troubleshooting of wireless network or printer➢Performance optimization for slow-running or non-booting PC➢Help with managing your smartphone, tablet or other device from your PC➢Protection from online threats and social media privacy exposure➢Assistance setting up parental controls➢General how-to’s, tips and tricksHP defines average sessions as lasting for a several minutes to an hour depending on the scope of the problem. The month service lasts one month. I can call multiple times for help with the same computer. HP warns that if “excessive or abuse is detected, customer will be notified and access to service may be restricted or terminated.” Therefore it is also a good idea at registration to ask the tech to define “excess” and “abuse”. My smartphone allows me to video so I will ask permission to video the registration process and if approved, I will keep a temporary record of answers for my protection.HP Subcriptions Plans include SmartFriend Complete Plan for a single computer, SmartFriend Family Plan for up to 4 devises or a SmartFriend Tutor Plan for a single devise.I appreciate the ability to start service on my terms for my defined problem.

"There’s a lot I like with HP’s premium new ENVY 13.3-Inch notebook. HP made its laptop lighter, more portable, thin (less than 1""), built it with solid state storage, three 3.0 USB ports, and Touch Gestures! HP included an SD card slot, glass display -- solid graphics, HD webcam, an HDMI-out; got rid of extra keyboard key largess, enlarged the touch pad, and accessorized.Let me say up front that the product"" instructions"" included in the box refers buyers to HPs web pages. So, I thought, might as well have a look before hitting the remorse button. When I went to the pages a message appeared explaining that the pages have not yet been loaded. I could not verify which features are upgradable or which accessories are available. The web link states “Coming Soon. Information about this product is not yet available but will be added shortly.”IN THE BOX:HP ENVY 13-d010nrAC adapter and plugSetup InstructionsHP Worldwide Limited Warranty and Technical Support printed in grey in what appears to be 4pt font (unreadable)THE COMPLETE LIST OF FEATURES in the “Quick Tour” of the Setup Instructions are:Wireless antennasInternal microphones (2)Webcam light and WebcamMute key and lightPower buttonCaps lock key and lightSpeakers (2) BANG & OLAFSEN hey-hey!Windows key: displays the Start menuTouchPadFingerprint readerAirplane mode keyMemory card readerUSB ports (3)Audio-in (microphone)/audio-out (headphone) combo jackPower lightHDMI portAC adapter and battery lightPower connectorI’ll describe details that are important to me for professional and personal use. THINGS I DON’T LIKE are not major so I list them first.CONS:' 30 G of the hard drive is reserved for the system recovery software. Before a single document was created or software subscription applied, 33.4 GB out of 118 GB is registered as “used”. Wow. I’m going to need external storage.' Back-ups to external spinning drives are important because SSD are more susceptible to melt downs. Having solid state drives makes things like surge protection more important and it makes the computer more vulnerable to some high tech security malware.' The external optical drive is so handy it’s a shame it wasn’t included and has to be bought separately. Especially nice to have the USB hub to connect a mouse, monitor or other devises.' I read that intensive memory game graphics will need to be played on low-medium setting with 720p resolution for smoother frame transition.' Ethernet connectivity is not available.' Requires a deliberate push to connect and pull to disconnect the charger; the charging port doesn’t magnetically attract and connect the charger; magnetic connections like on Apple devices are nice but no biggie for me.' Annual subscriptions to Windows 10 and McAffee Live Safe software are required.' Box disclaimer states: “Not all features are available in all editions of Windows 10. Systems may require upgraded and/or separately purchased hardware, drivers and/or software to take full advantage of Windows 10 functionality.”I list other disclaimers printed on the box that I consider impactful for purchase decisions:1 “GHz refers to internal clock speed of the processor. Other factors besides clock speed may impact system and application performance.”2 “This system requires a separately purchased 64-bit operating system and 64-bit software products to take advantage of the 64-bit processing capabilities. Given the wide range of software applications available, performance of a system including a 64-bit operating system will vary.”3 High-Definition content (eg WMD HD files) is required to view high definition images. Most current DVDs do not provide high-definition images. In some applications the colors displayed will appear to be similar to the actual colors, but not exact renditions, due to RGBW4 color subpixel design.”THINGS I LIKEPROS' An internal battery life of between 6 and the advertised 7.5 hours.' 6th Generation Intel Core, i5-6200U Processor (2.3 GHz)' USB 3.0.--10x faster then USB 2.0, this has been the standard for several years now, but, because of the increased cost, the 3.0s are not always included. USB 3.0 is backward compatible; but not all 3.0s are created equal. The fastest drive seems to achieve its speed by using “four channels of flash” memory instead of one. SEE: Howtogeek's article on usb-2.0-vs.-usb-3.0-should-you-upgrade-your-flash-drives. Again without HPs web pages for this ENVY, I cannot locate any information on the USBs.' High Resolution 3200x1800 13 inch screen. Color resolution, brightness and viewing angles appear nicely. The display gives a bright, clear, crisp resolution. It appears to enhance color with richness and graphic detail for front and side viewing angles. Pictures from digital camera show nice detail on this screen and when displayed on our large screen TV. You cannot fully appreciate the screen unless you get the 17""+. But nice it is even notebook size.' 128GB solid-state hard drive (SSD!). I love solid state storage because it is faster, and does not crash like spinners. In solid state, important files stay put. I’ll store my programs on the SSD. It’s good to have both types of drives so I’ll use an external spin drive for documents and back-ups. If it gets too hot, SSD can melt or fry circuits (SEE: Pros).' Wireless WLAN and Bluetooth connectivity only.' Audio output uses Bang & Olufsen audio system! I won’t need additional computer speakers to listen to high fidelity music while I work.' Appearance: All metal aluminum and magnesium-alloy chasse; the magnesium shell reduces the weight. Smooth, clean brushed metal on both sides of the enlarged touchpad; nice and soothing for resting fingers while I’m thinking. Glass display panel. Keyboard is angled up for more comfortable typing.' Infrequently used buttons, are half normal size; this shrinks the overall size of the keyboard area and it looks less cluttered. I am neutral about ENVY having added both the back and delete keys on keyboard; I don’t mind using one key for both.' Smaller AC adapter; easier to transport.' Large Touch track pad with right and left click and center turns on/off and top left corner to turn touchpad on/off. Touch pad supports gestures tap/double tap, two-finger pinch zoom. When the ENVY is in TouchPad mode, then two-finger click and two-finger scroll and in touch screen mode, one-finger slide is supported.As an aside, other reports state that the track pad on ENVY can be frustratingly unreliable especially if you are use to Apple and do a lot of scrolling. Reports say it is not as reliable and responsive as Mac’s Trackpad. Scrolling gets stuck and sometimes does not register as a scroll. If it should become an obstacle, we will need to turn the Touch pad off and connect a Bluetooth or wireless mouse to the small USB hub on an External optical drive. We would need to purchase the external drive separately as an accessory. This has not happened to us so it is only a rumor. This ENVY model is so new that the problem could even be fixed. So I’ll leave this comment here with the pros but I mention it because I believe in being aware and watchful. If it does happen to us, we will report back.' The compatible External optical drive (Blu-ray or DVD) is rumored to have a small USB hub on back so you can connect keyboard and desktop. We have not seen nor ordered an optical drive; again because with HP’s webpages under construction, we're not sure which to order. If rumors are true, I like it because while the ENVY is portable, I won’t always need the optical drive with me. I can leave the drive on my desk and when I return plug in to devises is fast and easy.' ENVY has a standard HDMI out port; nice and convenient for displaying onto a large monitors or TV in a hotel room to watch Netflix or other movie subscriptions.' Adding our printers and scanners was as easy as clicking a button; it was nearly automatic.' I like that I can set up to use the ENVY in “tablet mode”. I can even select to make Windows more “touch friendly”. I have the option to download maps to search for places or get directions even when not connected to the internet.' I like that I can turn off shared connections and pushouts to Outlook, Skype contacts and FaceBook friends.' I like that the “Network + Internet” page tells me my data usage for the last 30 days.' Built in front facing HD Webcam with dual microphones for Skyping or video recording. I find iPad’s dual facing cameras and mics surprisingly useful.' HP ENVY notebook comes with temporary Windows 10 and McAfee LiveSafe software.I want to consider buying HP’s 3yr Service Care Pack for $190 or 3 yr Amazon protection for $160. These service agreements give me piece of mind and allow me to better control purchases so that I’m upgrading at the same time.I see HP’s advertised comparisons to Apple’s MacBook Air; I suspect because of the ease of portability, a better comparison for me might be November’s release of the iPad Pro. Once released, I’ll make that comparison. My local Costco sells the 15” ENVY and I was able to physically view it there for comparison before I received it in the mail. Amazon Prime gives me free shipping and depending on whether the vendor has brick and mortar in my state, my Amazon taxes may be less than my local Costco.In all, I'm VeRy happy with this ENVY. It gives me all the functionality I need in a Windows environment, in a small package and at an attractive price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P85GBNIWO5YG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015AD1ZFA#wasThisHelpful","R2P85GBNIWO5YG","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a 1st quality dish from (American made) Lenox with the only visible imperfection being the gold border is slightly askew but it doesn't detract from the beauty. The 6x6 inch square plate is perfect for displaying holiday cookies, candies or buffet sandwiches for the kids. It dresses up my living room table for winter and is perfect display on my dining room table making regular meals festive.I love porcelain because of its brilliance and durability; porcelain doesn’t break easily. It the comes out of my dishwasher gleaming and I have not noticed any loss of gold trim, fading or dishwater removal to the holly or red cardinal decoration so I expect our family will enjoy these for years to come.I have gotten both the Lenox Holiday Square and the Winter Greetings Square dishes. When I unpacked the plate I thought it could make a nice Christmas gift.  I toyed with keeping both as my extra presents on hand under the tree in case I’m caught short.

"My wife and I use disposable gloves when handling harsh household, pool or hazardous chemicals. These work fine and are comfortable. They are thin but quite suitable for protecting hands from much of everything from cutting up and handling chicken or pork, cleaning cat litter, using pesticides or pouring pool chemicals. There is no powder inside yet they are easy to put on and take off unlike the latex disposables I generally buy from Costco.

"The scent is of sweet watermelon. It pours and feels thin and covers well, but not exceptionally. It takes time to absorb on my skin and after 10 minutes, still feels tacky. The ingredient list is written on the box in hard to read, light grey lettering.If I didn’t know the manufacturer, didn’t see the advertising, was given a blind sample and told a 7 oz tube would cost me $43 and then asked, would I buy it? My answer would be a simple, no. There are other products I like better, absorb better, at the same price or less.I love body creams and body lotions. For me, this is not above average; nor are the ingredients organic, exceptional or high quality; mostly they appear to be synthesized.

"Let's start with the positives. This baby monitor provides sufficient quality video and audio directly to your smartphone or tablet. Yeah, I've seen higher frame rates--but it is a baby monitor after all. Babies don't move that quickly. The camera automatically determines whether the video streams in color or black-and-white (for night vision), but the image is clear in both. I operated the camera from my Droid Moto X. The interface wasn't pretty, but it was functional and intuitive. The interface also allows you to take pictures and video of your sleeping baby. Also, I'll note that set up with my phone and WiFi was pretty easy.Physically, the baby monitor is attractive with a small footprint. The camera is mounted to a swivel base. It is very lightweight (this is good or bad, depending on how concerned you are with stability.) I wish the power cord were longer, but this isn't a major issue.A neat feature of the baby monitor is that it has a speaker. You can talk into your smartphone and the baby monitor will relay your voice to baby. It also has a nice selection of lullabies and other soothing classical pieces that it can play for baby. (Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata sounds too sinister to play to an infant, but maybe that's just me.)My complaints? First, I downloaded the firmware update required to get push notifications delivered to your smartphone. (That is, you can set certain motion and volume thresholds, such that if the camera detects high levels of motion or sound your phone chirps or vibrates or displays an icon, much as it would when you receive a text.) However, I have never received a push notification, despite checking that I have the settings correct multiple times. Could I be doing something wrong? Possibly. But I still fault the manufacturers because setting up push notifications shouldn't be this hard.So what do you do without push notifications? Well, you leave the app open with the speaker on. First, this is annoying because it means you will be exposed to white noise. (If you mute it, you won't hear your baby.) Secondly, it is a real drain on the batteries. My phone went from fully charged to drained within 3 hours.Finally, I really wish you could use your laptop to interface with the baby monitor. Why limit it to smartphones? I'm more likely to be near a plug for my laptop than my phone, and I am generally less concerned with my laptop's charge than with my phone's charge. I'd say over 50% of the time, I'd rather use my laptop than my phone.So, I have a few reservations about this product. But let's look on the bright side: firmware updates, software updates, and a new app for laptops would address all of my concerns. If the manufacturer's continue to support this product, I would up my review to 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB2FW5VAHPV9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3GKO36#wasThisHelpful","RB2FW5VAHPV9D","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Babies are slippery when lathered. Bath time makes me nervous that my infant can slip from my hands. Slipping in a hard bathtub or our step down jetted bathtub could be dangerous and it’s a concern.Muchkin’s Cradle Tub makes bathing less stressful because bathing is safer and rinsing easy.  We are expecting our daughter next month.  I like that we will be able to wash her from our sink countertop. The cradle fits securely and did not slip or slide in our test even when the countertop surface was damp.  Since our daughter will be born in the winter, room temperature is a concern. Our kitchen probably has the most comfortable temperature in our house and is most easily adjusted.The design and use in a standing position, helps in control of our infant should she wiggle around. It is a great saver for my husband’s and especially, my back after a long pregnancy and back pain.I am confident that the design of high side walls and cradle will support our baby and help insure that our daughter is comfortable and secure as she’s lathered, rinsed and dried. I intend to place a Motherhood bamboo washcloth behind her as I wash her because it is soft and will wash her back at the same time. The washcloth is easy to remove before rinsing and drying.The single recline position helps protect that baby does not accidently become submerged in a shallow filled tub or get water in her face or ears. On the counter-top, she can see my face and I can wash and rinse her head, ears and face as I comfort her. Bath time can be relaxing for baby and me.I especially like that rinse water drains directly in the sink for easy clean-up. So when she’s ready to be dried, I can dry her front torso, legs, arms and head before moving her. Because these are dried and I’m only reaching to dry her back, I feel more comfortable that there is less chance she will slip and fall as I pick her up.I also like that the Muchkin Cradle means I do not have to buy 2 products, an infant bathtub and a separate sling hammock for an infant; with the Muskin, I have no problem about drying the cradle tub nor concern for mildew or rust.Eventually, when our baby is able to sit up independently, I can move to the tub and use a Bath tub ring chair for older infants and toddlers. While she is an infant, this is an ingenious solution for bath time and I appreciate the simplicity.Problem Solved.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LEVXB78YSHJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZOBT1M#wasThisHelpful","R3LEVXB78YSHJA","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfect ultra soft washcloths for anyone with sensitive skin. Holds soap and rinses clean.I was hoping that these would be as soft as my favorite bamboo socks that I found years ago.

"I’m happy to rid myself of my clunky docking station and replace it with this much more easily connected, sleeker vertical docking stand. For me, it is a lot easier maneuver.  I don’t have to contort to get behind my older horizontal station as I try to figure out which slot to use. I can pick this up and look. This unit was designed to use the 2 front 3.0 USB standard ports for new quick external storage devices and flash drives, and the 3 rear USB 2.0 ports for existing peripherals like keyboard, mouse, printer, and 2 HD displays. It has 2-way audio support with an audio headphone port on the front side.This appears to have been made for Windows users with Mac as an afterthought. It is compatible ONLY to Mac OS 10.9; this is annoying to those Mac users like us with OS X Yosemite v 10.10.5+ that we have on all of our Macs say nothing about upgrades to OS X El Capitan. The website does not have updated Mac drivers as of this review. It cannot be used as a charging station. It has a 2-year limited warranty.  What’s in the box? TU3-DS2 unit, CD-ROM with drivers and guide, Quick Installation Guide, power cord adapter and 35 inch USB3.0 cable and a VGA to DVI adapter.I originally intended to hook this up in our living room to our Toshiba widescreen, printer, Windows, Mac and Oppo components. However, for now I’m better off connecting in my office with my simple, basic Office Windows used for work and Mac so I can have better access to a larger Windows display. It’s nice to have the added features of TreadNet’s Universal USB 3.0 Docking Station but I’ll need to wait until the upgrades to get the power out of this that I had hoped for. My recommendation? If you are heavily a Mac user, wait for the upgraded software.I’ve purposely kept this as an overview.

"This is a good quality waterproof cotton over poly fill mattress pad that works as advertised: It protects our baby mattress from diaper wettings. Our bassinet mattress was more expensive than I thought it would be and I’d like not to replace it. Here’s good insurance that it stays clean and prestine. A second pad allows me to air-dry after wash. The vinyl waterproof backing is layered over with a cushy quilted poly fill and 100% cotton overlay; my cotton sheets insure baby is in comfort.

"This mobile is designed to visually stimulate an infant during development. The instructions clearly lay out how this mobile is supposed to be used, and how to tell if a baby is interested. As the baby needs something new to look at, or gets older and more developed, you can switch out the pictures.Because the mobile is meant for infants, who are only beginning to  develop sight, it may be much less appealing to you or me, as adults with more or less fully developed sight. The design is a little utilitarian: plastic parts, no motorized movement, and designs that are more about high-contrast than being cute. So not typically what we think of for a baby's room. But, since infants have better peripheral vision than center vision and poor resolution, the high contrast images are theoretically better at capturing a baby's attention.This is a rare instance when the user is first, unlike so many things that mean to sell to the parent to the pet owner.

"There is a lot to like about this stroller and car seat combination. First, the stroller is attractive. Assembly was a breeze, especially compared to some other baby-related accessories I've had to assemble lately. The toddler stroller frame has two positions, it reclines good enough for a snooze but not for lying flat. Forth, it steers reasonably well and seems to handle Philadelphia’s uneven pavement around our house. Fifth, it has a nice unfoldable hood for shading.I'll single out a few features for special notice. I love the stroller's folding mechanism. It's a quick twist with the wrist and the stroller collapses. As the stroller folds, a latch automatically catches so that the stroller won't accidentally reopen while you're trying to carry it. The stroller is light, fortunately, though slightly ungainly. (What stroller isn't?)The stroller also good wheel locks. The rear wheels lock so that they are incapable of rolling, while the pivot on which the front wheels are mounted locks. This disables the steering. This is important to us because we've noticed how many new parents around our neighborhood dine at restaurants outdoors with their baby in a stroller parked next to them. Having a good wheel lock system means that we'll be able to join them.The wheels are just big enough to negotiate easily though they are not wheel bearing for smooth turning. The frame took a lot of stress and torque from me with no ill effect.As for the car seat, there is less to say. It lifts in and out of its base well. I like the big handle you use to carry it (which also has a nice lock system). The shell itself is strong enough and has a nice cushion insert to cradle my infant’s head. The most confusing thing for us was figuring out how to dock the car seat in the stroller. It wasn't intuitive, and we're still a little clumsy doing it, but we're sure it will be second nature soon. This is of course a wonderful feature, as you can transfer a sleeping baby from car to stroller seamlessly. Also, there is a nice hood on the car seat, so that when the car seat is in the stroller both hoods can be fully extended to almost entirely shelter baby from the elements. Very nice.The manufacturer's instructions say the parent carrying tray can carry 3 pounds and the underneath tray 10. That's enough to carry a purse on top and a baby bag underneath. We are warned not to attach bags to the push rail so although the Graco Literider satisfies basic transportation, it is not really as well suited for carrying groceries or purchases like I need in an urban city. Not a baby SUV, but priced cheaply enough and easy to have around and about.The largest negative to our mind is Graco's record with flame retardants. Consumer Reports and other public watchdogs have picked up on studies of carcinogenic flame retardant use in car seats. Unfortunately, Graco rates worse than other companies according to this study. We wish that in the future Graco would switch to fewer and safer chemicals in their products for children.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DQZOJNMI37KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZKTVI66#wasThisHelpful","R1DQZOJNMI37KI","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We recently removed the glass enclosure to our tub so I've spent the last week looking at shower curtains. This DII Oceanique compares to the cloth shower curtains I found at Bed, Bath and Beyond where the range, even on clearance was still $20-60. I did not find any that I thought were great. All are pretty basic and the pattern provides the color. This pattern works for us because of the darker lines become lighter as the eye moves up the pattern so the curtain does not appear fatiguing in our opposite full glass mirror.  The mauve color is soothing. In my opinion the fabric weight is light, not exceeding light, but still light.We have a white Restoration Hardware bath rug and the two compliment. I installed a curved shower rod pretty high up the wall. The length of this DII Oceanique falls about where you see in the advertised picture which suits. $20 at the time of this review and Prime Shipping would make this  an easy choice for me since I couldn't find any that I liked a lot.

"Nice looking, not expensive looking, evening wear. I see no flaws in the pearls even under a magnifying glass.The larger cubic zirconia gems, at the pinnacle and the lower connection point give nice sparkle to the earrings. The smaller zirconia surrounding the top surface of the lines and the petals which attach to the pearl, provides nice elegance. These smaller zirconia are more visible to others  when your face is at side profile.The metal, more prominent from the small silhouette of sides of the earrings which someone looking directly at your face is likely to see at a glance, does not look like white gold, platinum or silver.  Although when I reread the description, I read the metal is sterling silver, it does not appear so to me. To my eyes, it is an unidentifiable metal and looks more similar to chrome. My wife and I assume there is some stealing with the metal alloy, but silver is not what our eyes see. I assume that the instructions not to spray perfume and void contact with lotions, hairspray and other chemicals is meant to protect the metal as much as the stones.The earrings are a comfortable weight for my wife who does not like heavy earrings and she says they do not have an over pull on her lobes. She does mention that if someone is allergic to metals there may be a concern.I am trying to be more critical in this review because these are difficult to see in a picture and I am trying to accurately describe what my eyes see close up.  I go back to my first comment, these are lovely earrings for evening wear but they are not meant to impress the discriminating person who knows their jewels. My wife and I are not one of those persons, nor are we overly discriminating in jewelry.This set of earrings is a nice finishing touch for evenings out for dinner and concert.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7MJISTL5YALC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UA9KUL0#wasThisHelpful","R7MJISTL5YALC","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I particularly like the bunny decals on this MAM white bottle. The 5 oz size is perfect for nursing mothers like my daughter who need to express and leave newborn a feeding for dad or even granddad.I also like the bottle design for 3 big reasons.1. The ventilated bottom is supposed to reduce colic (just remove the silicone bottom). Our neice is pretty gassy. While I can't definitely tell if she's doing better on these bottles (we aren't using them exclusively), her mom and I believe there are fewer bubbles in the milk while she feeds and she seems to have less gas and spit up at burping. This is a nice observation for me because we are expecting our baby this fall.2. The bottle is self sterilizing. Which means not having to carry around extra stuff when dropping her off with family, or worrying if it will fit into narrow hotel microwaves.3. The orthodontic nipple promotes proper sucking and tooth placement in oral development. The flat nipple design with the hole at the top allows milk to hit the roof of baby’s mouth rather than the back of the throat. Less air is needed for swallowing; milk mixes with saliva and helps with baby’s digestion.I am happy that Silicone has no BPA. I am somewhat concerned about D4 and D5 siloxanes, compounds generally found in silicone, which theoretically can migrate and accumulate in baby’s delicate human tissue. I do not find any reference to these compounds in MAM’s literature. But in other literature, I learn that these two compounds don’t break down or decompose. I repeat and emphasize, somewhat concerned or at least aware, because the compounds tend to remain stable at temperatures up to 300 degrees. But because the compounds can migrate at higher temperatures and when combined with fat, I will not wash the silicone nipples in the dishwasher or boil for extended periods even though I know that our newer model Miele dishwasher heats well below the threshold at only to 156.8F on SaniWash and 164.4F on Pots and Pan Scrub. I also will throw away any that become discolored or show signs of white and I will replace silicon nipples every 2 months regardless of wear. If this is a concern for you, please rely on your own research.I am so appreciative for high quality design in the MAM bottle, and I think the ventilation and self-sterilization are great additions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NXC86WISUCDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DYOQLNO#wasThisHelpful","R2NXC86WISUCDW","A2DYMDOAJURO5F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2DYMDOAJURO5F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Before I start describing the cat tree itself, first let me point out that while all humans are dumb, my male human is particularly stupid when it comes to assembly.  He is an idiot that has not yet found something he can't install backwards or in the wrong direction!  You have to forgive him a bit with this one though.  The instructions were a bit more idiot prone than others: just a sheet with an exploded diagram and some numbers. Here's a hint!  Put the #1s in first, then the #2s, then the #3s, then the #4s.  You are going to end up building it upside down.  The poor instructions almost knocked this down to a 4-star review, since it took him a while to figure that part out, but he seems to have been able to assemble it reasonably quickly without much cursing or injury to himself.  That said, he did install the hammock incorrectly four times.  FOUR TIMES!!!  It only goes two ways.Typically, I don't like cat trees...or any toys the human gets for me.  This one's different: it's definitely high quality, and very heavy.  While he was assembling it, I assumed it was a trap from the vet, but as soon as he went in the other room to get catnip and treats, I had already started exploring.First, I love the carpet.  It's really soft, which feels great on my tummy, and light colored so I can see when I get cat hair all over it.Second, there are all sorts of interesting ares for me to explore.  The little house is great for me since I can get in there, but my big fat sister doesn't have a chance.  The sisal covered scratching posts are okay, but they're all vertical, which is good for me, but my sister prefers horizontal things like Cosmic Pet Double Wide Scratcher, or even better, the ottoman and couch.Lastly, the hammocks and other moving parts must seem appealing to humans, but as we've already covered, humans are dumb.  No way would I get in one of those things, no matter what treats you put on it.  I'm avoiding those things like the plague!  That said, this is still a great cat tree, and who knows, maybe I'll try one of them one of these days...Please note the size was surprising to my female human, even though she's generally smarter than my other one.  It is quite clearly labeled as 23.4""W x 31.3""D x 46.5""H, so you should definitely make sure you have room BEFORE ordering, because this could be an expensive mistake.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CAQGW683HA5M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XY250YC#wasThisHelpful","R1CAQGW683HA5M","AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We bought our Xbox One because of Just Dance 2014, and Just Dance 2015 is pretty much the only thing we use the Xbox One for nowadays.  From the technical point of view, this even better: it does a much better job of recognizing little kids, and the ability to select avatars definitely appealed to both my kids.  The one downside is that by putting actual Disney stars, instead of blanked out people shapes, made my daughter only want to play about a third of the songs: just those with a female lead.That said, the music is really bad.  Maybe kids who watch Disney more than my kids do will enjoy these songs more than I did, but I sure didn't.  My kids didn't seem to mind, but they definitely didn't recognize any of the songs even though they do occasionally watch shows such as Austin & Ally.The dance routines were easy enough to follow, which was great, but be careful of arm flailing with these party games.

"This is a much easier install than TED, Sense, or similar products because you can install this yourself without an electrician, and don't even have to open your electric panel.  On the other hand, it's harder to try to track down exactly which appliance is causing the power consumption: you basically have to go around turning everything off, then turning on one appliance at a time.  Furthermore, the website sort of indicates there is a way to track the usage of individual appliances like, say, the dishwasher, over time, but they tell me that's with a Bidgely partner app that they no longer integrate to.I had a tougher install than most because I had a bum unit, but even then, it's definitely not an iPhone level ease of use.  They have a really good and responsive support organization.The app and website also have a lot of room for growth, shall we say.  That said, it's much easier for them to upgrade the app and website than it is to swap out the device, so they actually have the basics already in place!

"I've use Epson products for years, and in general I associate them with very robust, but lower quality (and lower priced) equipment.  I have an Epson Workforce printer with some cheap plastic buttons that I could probably drop out the window and would still be able to print (the scan ability would probably be impacted since the screen is made of glass, but honestly I use my smartphone for virtually all my scan and fax functions now).  This printer completely breaks that mold.  It feels very high end, with tonnes of bells and whistles, including an output drawer that automatically opens and closes, a high resolution touch screen, and even the touch screen automatically angles out...BUT, I see a ton of stuff that can break.  I'm seriously concerned about it's longevity.  Given the price (full disclosure: mine was provided gratis through the Vine program) I would be very hesitant before I laid out the cash for this if it was going to be at the curb 6-9 months later.Some other concerns:1) This sucker is HUGE.  Seriously, check out the dimensions before buying because the pictures don't really convey the size properly.2) The six cartridges of ink strikes me as costly.  They're small too, so if you are printing out large photos on a regular basis, I expect you will be hurting.  Go price out the cost of ink for this sucker before you lay out the cash: would a color laser printer make more sense?3) Epson has this amazing, huge touch screen but still has a very clunky user interface.  For instance, it still makes me type in the WIfi password using a keypad so that the number 2 means I have to press 7 times (ABCabc7).The biggest point of this review that I hope to convey is that this is NOT meant for the casual user.  There are many other printers out there for a fraction of this cost: check out Epson WorkForce WF-2630 Wireless Business AIO Color Inkjet, Print, Copy, Scan, Fax, Mobile Printing, AirPrint, Compact Size  So why do you want this printer?  Easy: the photo quality.  I happen to be in that market because my wife is a professional photographer.  That means she won't even use Snapfish because the color isn't exact enough for her.  I hope that the money that Epson sank into the touch screen didn't come out of their ""photo quality"" bucket!  Also, even though the advertising says ""professional quality,"" I have to see how well it does printing out 25 or even 50 prints at a time, on a regular basis (see my longevity concerns above).[Update 15Nov2015] Wow, we just printed out the photos.  The HP (on the left) wasn't even close.  It's way too yellow, and there are lines introduced by the printer.  The Epson XP-960 on the right is legitimately pro quality: the colors are right on, and the image is perfect.

"Dutailier is the best glider brand I've found, and this is amazingly smooth motion.  It was also easy assembly.  With my first kid, we spent twice this on a Dutailier and it is still my favorite chair in the house.  For the second, I bought a SherMag from a local Baby store and that was a waste of money.  For our third kid, we tried to split the difference: get a Dutailier, just a less expensive one.  From what I can tell, the chair and gliding mechanism are pretty much the same, but the cushion is way less comfortable.Also, if you have a baby, get the ottoman.

"With our other babies, we had found that Huggies led to blowouts and Pampers were the only ones that fit properly, but with #3, we're rather happy with these Huggies so far.  The umbilical cord cutout is making us happy (I think with the other two, the cords fell off earlier).  So far, no blow outs!The one thing that we would have preferred is if Huggies offered a sensitive version. The little guy's butt is SO small and he has such delicate skin that we're very worried about giving him a rash or other irritation.  None yet, but you know the anxieties of ""new"" parents...[Update 29 October 2015] Okay, looks like we're seeing blowouts.  YUCK.

"This set is amazing from the get-go.  Even the packaging was amazingly designed, with my only quibble being around the thick plastic that holds the tracks: it was surprisingly tough to open those!This is totally amazing:the technology is first class, and puts it squarely in five-star territory.  The re-configurable track keeps it there, especially given that there are expansion sets.  The only technical thing missing is a camera to give a first person perspective, which I think would be very helpful.The track is a bit of a mixed blessing: it's HUGE, so you need a large area of bare floor space; I'm pretty sure that carpeted floor is not the optimal surface, but a table is even worse since the cars could fly off and get damaged.  The issue with keeping it on the floor, though, is pets: my cat thinks this is an awesome thing to sit on, which I'm pretty sure is bad for the track.The cars CAN fly off the track, and go under beds, cabinets, etc.  I wish there was something that could help with that.Surprisingly, there is a single player mode that allows you to compete against an AI driver.  That's pretty awesome.However, my biggest gripe is really around the app.  There are some parts of it that are really slick, but it's also really confusing.  Without going into massive details, it feels like the game designers took a lot of great ideas and then threw them together in a complicated mish-mash.  It's absolutely amazing that Anki pushed this into five star territory by taking this beyond just a racing game and adding weaponry and strategy to it, but my son and I just want to race cars.  The nice thing is that this is easily fixable with a software update, and I will gladly update the review if they introduce - or I discover - a basic mode that makes simple multiplayer racing easy (without any levels).Also, regarding the recommended age, my now 6-year old son had added Anki Drive (the first generation) to his Amazon wishlist two years ago, when he was just 4....  but obviously it's too sophisticated for that age.  I had hoped that as a 6-year old he might be close enough to the 8-year old minimum recommended age, but he's definitely struggling with it.  Hopefully with practice he will improve, but I think this may end up being something that really should wait until 8.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L1SLWMMI8BXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V6951I0#wasThisHelpful","R3L1SLWMMI8BXQ","AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hasbro really got EVERYTHING right in this game.  First, the princess figurines are awesome just on their own.  My 3 year old daughter was playing with them in a Little People castle playset and just having a grand old time.  She LOVED looking at the board and spotting all the characters she knew, and telling me everything about the castle.Regarding the gameplay, there are a bunch of cards to pop out, and possibly to make a mess and/or lose, but it's very clear to a little kid who can't count well or read numbers yet (she actually is pretty good at both, but this is much easier), and doesn't have any dice or spinners which can be tough for a little kid's dexterity.There are also modified rules for younger kids, which is awesome and makes gameplay simple.The only issue is that this is SO princess oriented that her big brother (5yo) will not even touch it.  I would have suggested throwing princes in as well, but that would have ruined some of the draw for her, so I guess you have to use your best judgment.  She doesn't like playing Marvel Superhero Chutes & Ladders with him, so maybe they can switch off or something, I don't know!

"The pail is nicely constructed, and both my wife and I were impressed at the metal.  That's really the big draw to this, actually.  That and the fact you can use your own bags.I did also like the fact that we could go with whatever bag we wanted, but the pail is so small that my big Glad bags are mostly wasted, and frankly the diaper genie rolls can come on Subscribe & Save here on Amazon for a not horrible price.  In fact, Ubbi also sells their own bags for this, which I'm sure I would end up getting.Just to reiterate: the pail is quite small.  The size is really a disadvantage.  You can say ""it's full of diapers, you're not going to let it fill up, are you?"" but with my other two,we did in fact let the Diaper Genie XL fill up quite a bit.  Little ones go through 7-10 diapers a day, and a lot of those are #1.  If the pail contains the smell, letting it sit there for the whole day - or even two or three - isn't going to have a huge effect.  And when they're little and you're waking up every three hours....  you start to get behind on chores, shall we say?Also, you have to bend down if it's on the floor.  I think this is a countertop device, but my wife disagrees, and the picture does depict it on the floor next to the changer.The slide function and lock work okay, but there is no foot pedal so if you're holding a baby in one hand and a diaper in the other, this is hard to access.

She likes moving the pieces, and it helps her counting.I agree with all the comments about the low quality materials, but I've sort of come to expect it.  They're paying for the character licensing, so either the customer has to pay more (I got this free through the Amazon Vine program) or they have to cut back on construction cost.

"My first reaction upon unboxing was that this feeder was MUCH smaller than I thought it looked in the picture, but just as cute.  Check the measurements first so you're not surprised: it's only about 8 or 9 inches tall.  The mushroom cap is awesome since it theoretically will keep the squirrels out, but it's so small that I'm not sure it will be effective.  I have very determined squirrels around here, so I will watch them and update the review.A lot of folks have complained about the mesh letting the sunflower seed out.  That's sort of a design flaw, isn't it?  The mesh has to be large enough to let the birds get the seed out, but at the same time the mesh has to be small enough to hold the bird seed in.  My experience was that this made a complete mess when I was trying to fill it.  A bottom platform would ruin the mushroom theme but would probably make this much more effective.A bottom cap would also lure a better variety of birds.  I love cardinals but they need some sort of hopper.  This only attracts clinging birds like finches and goldfinches.[Update 12 May 2015] As feared, the mushroom cap is a bit too small for my incredibly acrobatic squirrel population.  Check out this squirrel that is hanging upside down by his claws and *just* making it to the feeder.  I'm going to try relocating the feeder.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5IT57KVTV5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JG02V84#wasThisHelpful","R5IT57KVTV5T","AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is sort of the gold standard for lawn seed, isn't it?  Looking at the reviews, it's interesting that some people love it, some people hate it.  I had good luck with this seed on a bare patch.  I *did* put down fertilizer first and also covered the patch with peat moss to keep in the moisture and protect from the birds, so I'm not sure if that helped.  Personally, for a patch, I prefer the EZ Seed, which includes fertilizer and paper mulch (instead of peat moss), and has a mix of fescues, ryegrass, and bluegrass.  It's less work, though more bags.It had a nice color, but not the crazy deep green I've seen with some seed.  For reseeding my existing lawn, I couldn't really tell how well this grew.  Again, I didn't follow the instructions, instead I used a seeder machine (not just a spreader) to put this down.The big question is if you want the Kentucky Bluegrass variety or more of a turf type tall fescue.  The Bluegrass is a bit more heat resistant even with short roots, whereas the TTTF needs to have long roots.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IFFEW1U31AU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001Q1QZWY#wasThisHelpful","R2IFFEW1U31AU9","AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AVJJ2D4G5I0Z4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As I was reading through Sucker, I was reminded of the very popular movie, Sin City. It has the same kind of feel as that, but this one is even better in my opinion. Author Mark Lingane did an excellent job with Book 1 of this series, and I am extremely interested in reading what's next to come. This is a true detective novel, which reminded me a lot of how good detective books used to be. What's even better is that a supernatural twist is thrown right into this one, which really helped to peak my interest. Lingane does an excellent job of describing each scene very vividly, so you feel as if you are a part of the story with all of the characters. It's an extremely fast paced read that's going to be over with before you know it. It's definitely heart pumping, and will literally ""suck you"" right in. Great job overall, can't wait for the next ones.

"It's extremely rare when a book comes along and truly touches me in such a way that I think about it days after I finish reading it. That's exactly what Bowl of Fruit, by Panayotis Cacoyannis, has done to me. I finished it a few days ago, and had no words to describe it immediately after finishing it. However, I have been thinking about it ever since, and feel compelled to post a review, due to how touching it was to me. Cacoyannis clearly has a lot of talent, and has blown me away in words that I can't even describe. Between the amazing character development, unique plot line, and excellent imagery, I just couldn't seem to get enough.Leon and Anna are two completely different people - It's hard to see where they may fit together. However, as the story moves along, we see that there are many hidden secrets intertwined, as they both go backwards in their lives. Anna is a ghostwriter, who knows way more about Leon's history than even he does. Leon agrees to meet with her, even though he is extremely unsure about it. As they trace their pasts backwards, many secrets get revealed; some of them devastating, some of them uplifting. They soon figure out that their paths aren't as different as they originally would of thought.I don't want to give too much away, as this is one that I feel any avid should pick up and read. Cacoyannis has a lot of talent, and it really shows through in this work. I can't wait to see what this author has in store for us next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PVUO3UHP5ZBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0142CQC8A#wasThisHelpful","R3PVUO3UHP5ZBU","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're looking for a good read that contains war, romance, action, suspense, etc., then The Butcher's Daughter is a definite must. Written by Mr. Mark M. McMillin, this story will have you on the edge of your seat wanting more and more. It's based on true Historical Events as well, which made it even more interesting. Being a teacher, I do already know a lot about history and I know that the events in this book were pretty spot on to factual events. However, the characters and the overall fiction aspect of it really kept it interesting for me.The King of Spain is currently creating one of the most powerful armada's that the world has even dreamed to be possible. His main goal is to evade England and depose of the Queen. In order for England to stand a chance, they need to think up a powerful way to stop it.

"Super Daddy Bedtime Questions, by Nicolas Pavlou, is such a great children's book! Not only have I read it to my nephew, but I've been reading it in my classroom as well and the kids absolutely adore it. It's funny and sweet, and filled with common questions that kids ask. What I LOVE about this one is that it focuses on ""Daddy"", more than it does on Mommy. I feel as if a lot of children's books are catered more towards the mom, and It's refreshing to come across one that goes the other way. The kids always get a kick out of as well, which is really what It's all about.Kid's LOVE Superheroes (yes, girls TOO!), which is really what gets my classroom kids so excited whenever they see the cover. It's written in the form of a poem, and each Daddy response is a rhyme, which is amazing. It also teaches kids that their Dad doesn't have to be a superhero in order to be a super dad, which is an excellent concept for all children to know and understand.My students make me read this story to them at least once a week - they just can't get enough. I HIGHLY recommend it for It's originality and humor as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTU232IDCSDO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EITVE0#wasThisHelpful","RYTU232IDCSDO","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eterlimus, by Azis Hamza, is an excellent read that I'm really happy I decided to check out. Hamza is a new author to me; I hadn't heard of him before this one, by the storyline was so interesting, I had to jump right in. It's also a short read, at around only 100 pages. That allows readers to have a good idea of what kind of writing style Hamza has, which is what I appreciate. By the end of the book, I was hoping it was longer, though. It was so exciting and engrossing, I didn't want to put it down.This book focuses on the Roman History, in a less confusing way than normal. I am a big fan of Roman times, and felt as if this was pretty spot on. Imagery was excellent as well, and at times I felt like I was back in time with the characters. Main character Eterlimus is one of the few who survived King Tarquinius. Flavius rescued him, and the two of them bonded very well. I loved the character of Eterlimus, and feel as if he was well written and full of life. Such a great hero to have around.Overall, this was an excellent read and one that I would definitely recommend.

"Sons of Abraham is a complete Sci-fi trilogy written by Joseph Ray. I remember reading just Volume 1 not so long ago, and being blown away by it. When I saw that the entire set was now up for grabs, I immediately purchased and read right through them all. It's a massive collection, but one that you won't be sorry for reading.. There is so much action and suspense involved, with such intricate storylines, you won't ever want it to come to an end.Set in 3026, things have changed dramatically. Somewhere around the 2500s, mankind as we know it struggled to sustain life on earth, due to limited resources and billions upon billions of new population. People were left starving, with no real way to cope. When the powers to be can't figure out a solution, the next best thing is to build the greatest mind. This is when the Cybers were invented. They were extremely hard to solve every complex issue, in order to help mankind. And help is what they did. However, 500 years later, mankind still has a ton of issues to contend with. The Cybers are now in their third generation, and they are called upon to help out once again. However, certain people aren't thrilled with the way they are operating, and take it upon themselves to harness their power. It is now up to Nathan to David to help the world, and stop the terrorism in order to save mankind.There is SO much more to these stories than I can ever get into. All I can say is, I'm blown away by the writing of Joseph Ray, and I truly feel as if this is the best Sci-fi trilogy out there today. It is filled with action and adventure, and will definitely keep you wanting more.

"Flatlander and the Rise and Fall of Mike and the Ravens, by Peter F. Young, really appealed to me. I did not grow up in the Rock N Roll era, but my Father did. This meant that growing up, I would constantly hear about all things Rock N Roll; between the music, the great artists, and the rise and fall of some of the big celebrities during that time period. This book touches on that subject, in a very interesting kind of way.In this memoir, Young recalls his time between the small towns of rural Vermont and Northern New York State. Like other young boys during that generation, he dreamed of being a rock star himself - and it almost happened for him. Mike & the Ravens were almost a huge hit in New York State, but didnt quite make it. They did, however, get signed by a record company, which made them regionally famous. With any hardcore Rock N Roll, there also comes a bit of trouble, which they got themselves into, landing themselves in jail.This was a very enjoyable read, with a lot of humorous moments thrown it. I found it to be exciting and interesting, and glad that I got to peek into Youngs past. Five stars all the way for originality and good storytelling.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31JVR017ATU6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y8JCJB2#wasThisHelpful","R31JVR017ATU6R","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Water Flows Uphill, by Beryl Shaw, is definitely a different kind of a read. There are a lot of elements to it, which are sure to keep you hooked. There is suspense, romance, and twists and turns along the way. What really got me interested, though, was the fact that I learned a lot more about water than I thought I would from a book like this.Main character Dr. Armand Croft wakes up with no idea who he is; he's suffering from amnesia. The only thing he remembers is that he's currently working on a water project in Las Vegas. There is a shortage of water in the city, The water is going to be drained out in the ranches in order to get enough supply for the people. This causes many problems in itself; one of which being, making the ranchers angry. Croft is confused on which way he's supposed to go, but he has no problem falling in love with lovely Stephanie.

"DEEP EARTH, by R Julian Cox, is Book 2 in The Hanford Chronicles series. I must admit, I have not read book 1 yet, but this one is easy enough to follow along with without having to read the first one. This was an extremely different type of read for me, and I wasn't sure how I would feel about it. However, I was drawn in by the 3rd page, and did not come back to my own reality until I was finished reading. '49 days remain, that pretty much sets up the tone for this book. A remote British Past and an American Present are still at it. The deadline is quickly approaching to a project that is set to save thousands of American lives. Just when they believe the problem has been solved, another terrorist cell is threatening to strike once more. A Scientist is trying to find his way back from the past into the present, but this proves to be extremely challenging. The race against time is approaching, and the main question is, can the terrorists be stopped?I don't want to give too much away, but this is a very deep read but one that you will quickly be able to pick up on and follow just fine.

"Brett Matthew Williams has done a great job with Time is Relative for a Knight of Time. It did start out a little slow so I was unsure about it in the beginning, but it quickly picked up and became almost addicting to read.

Then his father the alcoholic decided to abandon him, and now he's sleeping/living in his car. One night he makes an amazing discovery; he's able to slow down the flow of time, which sets him on a journey. He ends up in the early 19th Century to fight General Andrew Jackson. He comes across the Knights of Time, who help him to discover the mystery of his mothers murder. This was actually a very interesting concept that I couldn't seem to get enough of.

"There was a lot going on in One Stick and a Waco, by J.M. Taylor, and I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of it. This is a shorter read, so it didn't take me very long to get through it. It's pretty close to factual, so I can appreciate that. I love all things World War II; I am actually fascinated by that point in history, especially in Europe. There is a lot of clipart in this book, along with several maps and references. I have read many WWII books since I am so intrigued, but I must say, this was one of the better ones. Even though the characters in this novel are not factual, the storyline's surrounding them definitely were. J.M. Taylor's biography truly blew me away, and It's no surprise that this book was so well written. He has extensive knowledge on this subject matter, and it shows through. A lot of things written in this book I did not know about before, so that was refreshing and also eye opening.Overall, I am extremely impressed by not only this book, but also by the author.

We not only have a great time travel novel here, but we also have an incredible love triangle that will leave you wanting more as you keep reading. I love the fact that there are twists and turns involved in this one. Everytime I thought I knew what was about to happen, I found myself completely wrong. I love the character of Roxanna, and I also enjoyed both Philip and Darren. Obviously I was rooting for one over the other, but I liked them both equally as much.

"A Ladder In The Dark, by Alan Eisenberg, really pulled at my heart strings. It made me extremely sad, but also enlightened at the same time. Bullying is such a major issue in today's world and as an educator, I take the subject matter very seriously. It breaks my heart to read stories written by those who have been bullied, but It's a reality that we face in the world. I give Alan Eisenberg so much credit for putting his story out there, and for not being ashamed. Eisenberg does a great job in stressing the fact that being bullied is something that stays with us our entire lives; it doesn't go away just because the bullying stopped. It's an extremely traumatizing and emotional thing, one that a person can't simply just escape. I love the fact that he also talks about his own faults as well. As time goes by, Eisenberg does begin to grow a self acceptance overall, which is a wonderful thing. His story being out there will hopefully serve as an inspirational guide to those of us who have been bullied in any time of our lives. It was very well written, and definitely an eye opener. I would highly recommend this one to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QLBNBD8BKRTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJ0MDEW#wasThisHelpful","R3QLBNBD8BKRTT","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got finished reading Legends of the Collective and I must say, I'm very impressed. It was definitely better than I expected, and most certainly not what I expected going into it. When they say don't judge a book by It's cover, this is a true example of that. Author Michael Kirk has a lot of talent, and It's evident in this book. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games, then you definitely can't pass this one up.This story is set in the future; year 5847 to be exact. Jaden and William are two brothers who have had an extremely difficult life. Joanna and Alicia are two sisters, who are looking for a journey. They decide to join the boys into the forbidden forest, on an illegal type of journey. Joanna ends up getting maimed, and Jaden and William are sentenced to prison (death). When a series plague hits the land, the only real solution is to get the antidote out of the Diggers bellies - but they isn't an easy feat.Every character in this book was enjoyable, and I couldn't put it down until I reached the very last page. I couldn't help but to root for the brothers, and felt very badly of them. If you are a fan of The Hunger Games, or Sci/Fi in general, than I would highly recommend Legends of the Collective. Great read overall!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RHGKK67U015Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011S8OCD8#wasThisHelpful","R2RHGKK67U015Y","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Girl On a Dolphin, by Vic Warren, is the second book in The Neptune Chronicles series. It is a two part series, both being equally as good. This is such a refreshing read, that will make you feel good by the end of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the writing, and would definitely be interested in reading Vic Warren's other works.In Girl On a Dolphin, main characters Jamie and Mercy have been living on a small island for the past 5 years. They have a daughter named Saffron, who seeks adventure. One day she runs in to tell her parents that she just saw Neptune's on a dolphin! Their goal is to travel on both sides of the globe in order to stop the Dolphin War. The main purpose is to get the Neptunes and the humans to come together in peace and harmony.I loved the characters in these two books; they definitely did seem to come alive. This book had a lot of character, and I almost felt as if I was in the story alongside them. Would definitely recommend, especially if you are looking for something light and amusing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y86A48K252P0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011TAL206#wasThisHelpful","R2Y86A48K252P0","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"WOW, is all that I have to say after finishing A Simple Soul, by Vadim Babenko. So much went on in this novel, it was impossible not to be completely captivated by it. This is definitely a different type of storyline from your average romance novel.Elizaveta is a very attractive Muscovite who gets sucked into something that she wasn't prepared for. She gets followed, receives strange gifts and calls. These are all coming from Timofey, who is her ex lover. He now lives far away, but feels threatened when a local mafia boss wants him to marry his daughter. His only way out of that is to get married, and who better to marry than Elizaveta? Soon enough he manipulates her, and the two of them find themselves in some serious danger.I enjoyed this story, and found the relationship between Timofey and Elizaveta to be refreshing and unique. I would highly recommend this one; It's better than your average romance novel!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MCS0HGCOV9GZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2C6MR8#wasThisHelpful","R1MCS0HGCOV9GZ","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just read a very similar book by the same author and falling in love with it, I was excited to come across Love in a cala. I wasn't sure that I would enjoy it as much as the first one, but it took me by surprise. This is not really a sequel as the characters are different, but I enjoyed these characters just as much as the ones in the previous novel. These are such wonderfully written books, you can't help but to be engrossed by them and wanting to come back for more.In Love in a cala, Tessa is completely fed up with men. Her bad experiences have made her want to wash her hands clean and be done. In comes Luke, who is everything that Tessa doesn't want in a man. Luke likes casual relationships, with no strings attached and no commitments. When Tess gets hurts swimming and Luke's dog comes to her rescue, It's inevitable that the two of them will meet and sparks will fly. I couldn't help but to root for the two of them to be together, as the sparks were literally flying off the pages.I love how the author makes the reader feel like they are a part of the story, right in the middle of the Mediterranean. Can't wait to see what she's going to come out with next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYTPINZZ5UKX1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NHQSLQ#wasThisHelpful","RYTPINZZ5UKX1","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Love in a boat, by Carla Prince, really did surprise me. While at the beach I was browsing through different books, and came across this one. From the cover, I knew it was going to be a fun read so I gave it a shot. I got absolutely HOOKED into it! I ended up staying on the beach for an extra 2 hours just because I was so engrossed in this one, I couldn't get up. It's a romance novel, which is right up my alley.This book takes place on a yacht and a pier; both locations I adore. I almost felt like I was there with the characters, that's how clear the imagery was. Main characters Flynn and Kate were priceless! Obviously I was rooting for them to be together very early on. Kate has absolutely no experience with men, which makes her pretty clueless. Flynn just purchased a luxury yacht, and never had imagined getting involved with a woman who was so inexperienced, such as Kate. The two of them come together, and magic happens. Obviously there are obstacles in between, but it wouldn't be a good romance book without that.This is a pretty light hearted read, but definitely a lot of fun! I would highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKNAGVEGCAP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013NH6WR6#wasThisHelpful","R3CKNAGVEGCAP4","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Semmant, by Vadim Babenko, is a book for this generation. It is definitely unique, and the storyline isn't something that I have seen touched on many times before. I was pulled in from the very beginning, and did not get pulled out until the very last page. This is an extremely well written piece of fiction, filled with characters and plot development that fascinated me.When you start out reading Semmant, you feel as if the storyline is going to be simple, overall. However, as you continue turning the pages, the storyline becomes more detailed, complex, and very interesting. Main character, Bogdan Bogdanov, is a cyber geek, as you may say. He develops a robot, named Semmant, that is the most intelligent robot known to man. In Bogdan's eyes, Semmant is perfect in every way possible. The two of them team up together to start working on the stock market together, and they quickly become a success. With such a brilliant team, how can they possibly fail?Sure enough, a woman begins to cause a wedge in between them. Her name is Lidia, and Bogdan quickly falls in love with her. The only issue is, Semmant was built in a way that he begins to have feelings of his own, and his feelings develop towards Lidia as well. He is starting to become almost humans, with real emotions and thoughts of his own. Semmant is no longer your typical robot; he is now fully capable of true human experience, which becomes extremely unpredictable for all of the characters.I felt the character of Bogdan to be extremely relatable. He definitely has a unique personality, and you can say that he is a genius. His mind process is not the same as an average person, as he is far beyond, but he still manages to feel the emotions of life just the same as everyone else.What I like most about Semmant is that the plot is complex and makes you think and ponder, long after you have finished reading it, due to the many underlying meanings involved. At the same time, the author writes in a way that is still simple and easy to read and follow along with.I was truly engrossed, and felt as if I was transformed to another world, a world that is a possibility of our future with the way technology is developing. I feel as if there truly could be a ""Semmant"" one day, and this book had me wondering what it would be like to be in the same place as both Bogdan and Semmant. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPDVUJO9ASNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1QB2FI#wasThisHelpful","RAPDVUJO9ASNP","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Words To Die By, by Jeanne Lamb-Carlin, is Book 2 in the Allison Taylor series. I am absolutely loving this series so far! I find the storylines to be intense, thrilling, with a nice mystery element to them. The characters in these books also suck me in, and make me feel as if I'm a part of the story with them. There is also some romance in this particular story, which is something that I like even better.Allison Taylor is having some serious trust issues going on in her life. A woman from Mark Ryan's past pops up in Spring Hollow, and she makes no secret about the fact that she may want him back. Elizabeth Meade is writing a murder mystery at the same time, which ties in nicely. The issue is, people in real life are dying just like in the novel. Mark Ryan doesn't want Allison involved in too much investigation; instead, he wants her to leave that to him. Instead of listening, Ally decides to enlist her friends to help her figure out the mystery.I loved this one, and look forward to reading the next series in this collection.

"I found Swimming With Sharks, by Jeanne Lamb-Carlin, to be refreshing and full of life. I thoroughly enjoyed the introductions of a large amount of characters at the very beginning; I find this kind of thing to be exciting, and keeps me wanting to read more to figure out who everyone is. I also enjoyed and appreciated all the background information that was provided; it helped me to understand what was going on. There are quite a few twists and turns in this one, sometimes very unexpected.Main character Ally has some issues going on. Her ex-husband, Jack Doretta, shows up and tells her he has some money issues. These money issues have put a major strain on his new marriage, and begs Ally to let him crash at her house for a few days. She doesn't really want to, but she ends up giving in anyway. However, she soon begins to regret this as nothing but trouble arises since allowing him to stay. Suddenly strange men are coming to town, and her life gets threatened. She is desperate to figure out what he's hiding, and enlists the help of her bestfriends, Elizabeth Meade and Larry Jones, to figure out what's really going on.A good mystery all in all, one that I thoroughly enjoyed.

"Eye of the Storm, by Ray Williams, is a masterpiece in my opinion. A definite must read for anyone who is in a leadership position, or an entrepreneur. Williams goes into detail on how to improve your business and those who work for you, in order to make it a more peaceful and pleasant environment. It's a known fact that when you have a positive work environment, your business does better due to higher quality employee work ethics. Most leaders face a lot of troubles and difficulties when it comes to managing their workers and keeping things running smoothly. I myself have worked for several people who had no leadership skills whatsoever, and I'm pretty tempted to forward this one to them.This is a well written book, that has easy to follow instructions on how to turn things around. I love that Williams writes in such a way that everyone is able to understand, without getting confused. It's obvious that this author has a lot of knowledge, and I'm truly grateful that I stumbled upon this book.

"I have read some of Thomas Drago's other books, and have been extremely impressed by his writing style and unique storylines. Queensboro is no exception. This is such a thrilling suspense/mystery/horror novel that keeps getting better as you turn the page.

She had everything going for her, and was heading in a great direction. As local natives turn up dead in the woods, we must figure out what's happening and why. More importantly, where is Ashley and who has her? If you enjoy reading vampire books, you will love this one! Especially since it involves the classic spin on vampire/supernatural type of stories.

"The Crash Between Heaven and Hell, by Michael Edmonds, really did take me by surprise. When I started reading the prologue, I was extremely confused as it contained a lot of violence and erotica as well. I wasn't sure what kind of book this was that I got myself into, but I decided to keep reading them anyway. I was intrigued by how vivid the entire chapter seemed to be, and it continued that way throughout the duration of the book. Each chapter starts out with a very descriptive, vivid illustrations.

"If you enjoy romance reads, then you absolutely must read Love Out of Time, by Joyce Zeller. Not only is this a romance read, but there are also some parts of History thrown into it as well. This was very well written, with an interesting concept surrounding divorce. Divorce is extremely common in today's world, so this book is going to be relatable to a lot of people. I enjoyed the characters and the concept very well.Main character Sara Burkhart is suffering from a divorce, and decides that she needs an escape. She rents a beach house in New Kensington, which is located on the Jersey Shore. Her main goal is to re invent herself as a single woman, and find herself again. The problem is, the house is haunted by two ghosts; Thomas and Caleb. They were sea captains from 1860s. On top of that, she gets sent back in time, to 1865. The weird part about that is, the people she meets there resemble the people in her current time period. She finds herself meeting Caleb, and suddenly realizes that he's the man she was always destined to be with. The problem is, in present time, he is no longer alive. She finally realizes that in the town she's staying in, everyone is a time traveler and they get killed by Hurricanes every year.

"Being an educator, I am always on the lookout for new and refreshing books to read to my students. I'm tired of the storylines always being the same, and It's been difficult finding originality these days. When I came across Meet Franklin Bean, I was instantly attracted to the cover of it. I knew the kids would like it, so I decided to purchase it and give it a chance. I was pleasantly surprised, and this book is adorably cute, with a great concept of a storyline and wonderful characters.Ten year old John and his mother move to a new city where they are a lot of financial worries and bullies hanging around. They adopt a Boston Terrier named Franklin Bean, who helps him out in more ways that one would ever imagine. Franklin Bean teaches him how to deal with bullies, but even with that skill, there are always other dangers. A real superhero is needed to tackle some of these bigger issues, and Franklin Bean may just be the one to do it.What I loved most about this book is the fact that it deals with real world issues that a lot of children are facing today.

"Vengeance Always Delivers, by Geoffrey Sleight, may be my favorite book so far this summer. I was instantly drawn in to the interesting storyline and plot development taking place. I found (some) of this book to be extremely relatable, and thoroughly enjoyed the main character of Steve. As I do agree that the delivery was a bit too fast paced, I found the story so interesting that it didn't really make much of a difference to me. The writing was excellent, and the dialogues were realistic.Steve Holland is an average man who just happens to have terrible luck in his life. His wife left him, his company went under, and his financial state is not looking good at all. Steve is never happy with anything in his life, and is convinced that most other people have it much better than he does. He pretty much gives up on this changing anytime soon, until fortune hits him. He meets a stranger randomly, who offers to help him change his luck around. Steve's life is suddenly turned right away, when he's given fortune that he never dreamed that he would have. However, what Steve doesn't know is, he will have a price to pay and it will be a hefty one. Revenge is approaching him, far worse than he would of ever possibly imagined. I don't want to give too much away, but I will just say that It's an extremely compelling read.Five stars for originality and interesting storyline.

She takes her daughter Melanie, and they move away together to the town that she spent summers in as a child. While there, she is reunited not only with her old friends, but also with her surrogate mother, Frannie. Another twist happens when she finally meets up with a long lost love who she hasn't seen in over 12 years (who also happens to be a cop). She believes that she's finally on the path to rebuilding her life, when suddenly a murder occurs in the town. Many secrets are let out, and Allison is once again at a loss of who to trust, and what decisions to make in her life.All of the relationships that were displayed in this book were extremely realistic, and all tied into each other nicely. Especially the relationship between the three friends. Many people can relate to the character of Allison Taylor, which is probably why I enjoyed this one so much. Would highly recommend, and I can't wait for Book 2 to come out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VLIE5JUDO2HU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009KU144W#wasThisHelpful","R2VLIE5JUDO2HU","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Dazzling Darkness, by Paula Cappa, definitely did It's job in dazzling me. This is a unique twist on a pretty common story; a little boy gets lost on his way home from school. The biggest question is, where is he, and can they get him back, safe and sound? A definite nail biter almost from the beginning, and kept me hooked until the very end. Excellent storyline and plot, great characters, and a lot of emotion.When two parents lose their son, Henry, they have no idea where to even begin looking. It's every parents nightmare. They are sure he's been kidnapped, but there is way more to it than that. Henry has somehow gotten behind the locked gates of the cemetery, and Elias Hatch is protecting the secret power that's buried inside. Detective Mike Balducci comes to the rescue, and discovers the crystal sculpture buried inside Old Willow. Secrets will come to light, and It's up to Mike to figure out what it all means.A kidnapping mystery novel with a twist, who wouldn't love that? I give this book five stars for excellent plot and intriguing storyline that kept me engrossed from start to finish. Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8EQ041EY67C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJH944U#wasThisHelpful","R1A8EQ041EY67C","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I start out my review, I just want to say how impressed I am with Donald D. Allan. His writing style blew me away. His attention to detail, engaging plot, and interesting character development really had me hooked on this one. DUILLEOG is the first book in this series, and I have no doubt that there will be many more books to follow after this one. I was drawn into this from the very beginning pages, and simply couldn't believe how well Allan did on this particular subject matter.Not much is known about the ancient druids; there wasn't much left behind about them during that time period, and most people just speculate what they were all about. Because of those reasons, many people don't bring them up, or they are forgotten about completely. When I saw that the druids was the topic of this book, I was immediately intrigued because It's not a subject matter you see done every day.This particular novel is about a man named Will Arbor, who is the last of the druids. Once he realizes that he has certain healing powers, he goes on a journey in order to find himself. A lot is going on during his journey, and the action packed feel you get from it keeps you wanting more. There is conflict with the Church of the New Order, who desires to destroy the last of the druids. They also want to remove the Lord Protector, and regain control over the people of the Realm. Will Arbor is there for all of this, witnessing the greed happening all around him. His main goal is to change the world, and he will stop at nothing to make this happen.Definite must read. It's a story that is a bit out of the box, but will definitely keep you entertained. Can't wait for the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPMWOUSKR577/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0103EAM6O#wasThisHelpful","RAPMWOUSKR577","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I thoroughly enjoyed Looking Glass Killer, by Floyd Merrell. I believe that you need to have a certain type of mind frame in order to enjoy this one, and truly appreciate the storyline. I found it to be intense at times, along with fast paced and somewhat original. The writing was excellent, so much so that I was glued to it from beginning to end pretty much. There is a mix of suspense/mystery/thrill all in one, something that I personally can appreciate.There is a dangerous serial killer on the loose; one who likes to play all sorts of games; word games, puzzles, rhymes. At each murder scene, this killer leaves a note behind with a new puzzle attached to it. Detectives Lucia Viera and Mike Ramsey are the ones in charge of solving these crimes and bringing the killer to justice, but they are constantly being toyed with and it makes their job that much harder. On top of it all, someone in the force is leaking information to the press. The only way Mike and Lucia can solve this case is by putting their thinking caps on, and going back to the Lewis Carroll novel, ""Through the Looking Glass"", for clues. I absolutely loved the incorporation of that.Excellent read overall, one that I thoroughly enjoyed. Floyd Merrell has an abundance amount of talent, and I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ECC3HM8C1GEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1493145711#wasThisHelpful","R1ECC3HM8C1GEV","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jessika Klide did an excellent job with UNSTOPPABLE; which is Book 2 in the series. I was able to really feel the unbelievable chemistry between Siri and Aurelius throughout the novel. There are so many explicit sex scenes involved in this book, which really helped to spice it up quite a bit. But there is more than just sex involved; there is also love and deep feelings. The two of them fall hard for each other, and can't seem to keep their hands off one another, either. The only real issue is, Aurelius has some pretty deep, dark secrets, and if they stand a chance at being together, these secrets need to be known and accepted by Siri. She had plenty of secrets of her own, but they got through it and they'll now have to get through his. It's not an easy road, but love isn't always easy. Can't wait for Book 3.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LDCX93YAI25M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UINPV1W#wasThisHelpful","R2LDCX93YAI25M","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What do you do when you finally meet the man of your dreams, but he's already attached to someone else? That's exactly what happened to Lacey, after walking away from a destructive relationship and moving to a whole new town on her own. She knows no one, until she meets Ben. Ben is a successful lawyer, who is extremely good looking and has a lot to offer. He befriends Lacey instantly, and they hit it off right away. But he's about to be engaged, which means that the two of them can ever only be friends. As the story develops, the reader can't help but to root for them to finally get together. Their chemistry is off the charts, which is obvious. Ben is torn, between right and wrong. I can't wait for Book 2 to come out, I really enjoyed Book 1 so much.

"I just finished reading this collection, and I am so impressed that I felt compelled to write a review. NR Bates is an excellent author, who truly knows how to draw readers in and not let go until they reach the last page. The Fall of Icarus contains three short stories; each one with a different premise, all equally as enjoyable as the next. What I love most is how each of these stories are set up; you know what to expect but at the same time, you really have no idea. There are no ""real"" endings to any of these stories, but I feel as if that was done on purpose, in order to evoke some thought into the reader. You kind of have to use your imagination with these, as to what you think may happen next. That's something that I found so enjoyable about these stories. Can't wait to see what NR Bates has in store for us next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MC7SJW8E5BOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VETGVAE#wasThisHelpful","R1MC7SJW8E5BOY","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fun mystery novel with delicious recipes included? Who wouldn't enjoy that? I really couldn't put The Heir to Villa Buschi down. This particular book is part of a series, and after reading this one, I am definitely going to go on the search for the others. It was fun, fast paced, and action packed as well.Lily Bilbury has a lot going on in her life. Not only is her current boy off filming a movie in the jungles, but she also has to deal with raising her kids, getting divorced, and now solving a mystery in Villa Buschi. When the ex-owner died, he leaves behind a ton of mysteries that Lily has no choice but to solve. She enlists the help of her friends Rupa Brunetti and Francesca di Campo, who all come together to solve the mysteries.

"A Science Fiction novel mixed in with environmental issues? I was instantly sold as soon as I read this description. Brilliant writing, great character descriptions, and excellent imagery is portrayed in A Benwarian Fix, by L.W. Samuelson. This is a story about a different species from a different planet, wanting to help and protect planet Earth from suffering the same faith as their own planet did. I loved it, and found it to be an extremely interesting concept.Once their planet has gotten destroyed, the Benwarians get on their spaceship and begin searching for a new place to call home. Once they find earth, they quickly figure out that It's in the same kind of shape as where they once came from. They decide that earth is worth saving, and will do everything in their power to make this happen; including decreasing the human population. The leader of the pact is more humanized, and does feel extremely emotional and guilty about this, especially after meeting with three scientists from earth. The question being posed in this book is, will human population be wiped out completely, or will the Benwarian leader figure out another plan to save earth?I deeply enjoyed this one, and would highly recommend it to any Sci Fi fan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21WPZ5Y93VLE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00332FJIA#wasThisHelpful","R21WPZ5Y93VLE8","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are a fan of science fiction novels, than you will definitely enjoy Exile. This book is filled with action, drama and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I have read the first two and enjoyed them a lot, so I had to purchase this one as well. I finished it within two days, so you know that it had to be good.The two main characters in this book are Guy Erma and Teodor, both with something in common. One is trying to return home, while the other is trying to run away. When their paths cross, they form a bond unlike any other. However, bonds and trust can both be broken just as easily as they begun. They are in for a wild run with one another.The target audience for these books is Young Adult, but even as an adult I enjoyed it just as much. Sometimes YA novels are even more fun for adults than those written specifically for adults. The authors imagination just blew my mind, which is not the easiest task in the world. Very well written, great character development/description, and good storyline. Don't miss out on these.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27V7XDK0RHCPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJ1Q3TQ#wasThisHelpful","R27V7XDK0RHCPF","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"EPIPHANY - The Silvering, by Sonya Deanna Terry, is the second story in this series. Having read the first one and thoroughly enjoying it, I just had to pick up this one as soon as I saw it was released. I absolutely ADORE this author and her writing style, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed by this one and I wasn't.The first book in this series is mostly mystery/fantasy based. It is about a tarot card reader who is also reading a story from the 1770s. Both stories collide, which I found absolutely fascinating because I never saw this happen before. There was a certain cliff hanger in that one, which the author picked right up in this one.Terry did a wonderful job tying up all the loose ends in this one. The great writing style/mystery/fantasy was more present than ever in EPIPHANY - The Silvering, and I actually enjoyed this one better than the first. I love the characters involved in this book; they came alive and had a certain flare to them. There is so much positivity in this novel, you can't help but to feel good.I would highly recommend this one - It's a worthwhile read and a GREAT conclusion to the first.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFZRC9SEGNH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RK8WOX6#wasThisHelpful","R1MFZRC9SEGNH9","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasnt really sure what to expect when I read, ""The Butterfly Room"", by Saurav Dutt. I read the book description and was extremely intrigued by it, so I decided to give it a chance. Im happy that I did, as Its written well and the storyline is so intense I was drawn in from the very beginning. Its a sad story and definitely does not contain a happy ending, but thats what makes it so realistic I believe.This story revolves around a family. Rohan, husband and father, is not the greatest person in the world. His wife and children all fear him, for good reasons. Lakshmi is Rohans wife and also the mother of his children. Her main goal is to keep her children safe from him, and acts as a buffer on many occasions. Her storyline is extremely sad; she is abused by her husband, and attends a support group to help her with her grief. Her biggest fear is that her children will head down the same path as shes in, and thats the last thing she wants to happen.Her son, Vikram, is set for an arranged marriage. Anita is the oldest daughter, and in an abusive relationship herself. She is forced to stay in this marriage, due to the fact that she has a child. Sunita is the youngest daughter, and Lakshmis favorite in my opinion. Both Sunita and Lakshmi do not want her heading down that path, and will do anything to avoid that from happening.This book is extremely realistic, as these situations do happen often in real life, unfortunately. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though some parts of it were depressing. I was sucked in and reminded that life is not all peaches and creams as some people would like to pretend that it is. Highly recommend this one, Its worth the read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XWNNG04KDHRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT2CFUU#wasThisHelpful","R2XWNNG04KDHRA","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author John Anthony Miller has created an action packed novel entitled, ""To Parts Unknown"". I knew that this was going to be an exciting read from the beginning; Miller has a way of sucking the reader in and not letting go until the very end. This is unlike any novel that Ive read so far this year, making this one of my top favorites so far.Main character George Adams has a lot going wrong in his life. He is a journalist from England, who lost his wife and gets rejected from all the branches of the military. He goes to Singapore to cover what is happening there in terms of the war threats from Japan. While there, he meets Lady Jane Carrington, who is an English aristocrat from India, along with Thomas Montclair, who is a French spy. When Japan starts to invade, the three of them must escape from Singapore in order to stay safe. All three characters have their own back stories and own reasons for wanting to escape, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The storyline between George and Jane definitely had me hooked.Being a teacher, I always enjoy reading a good Historical Fiction War Story, and this one did not disappoint. The author has a very unique writing style, and the storyline flows very nicely. I would highly recommend this one, as Its a worthwhile read that will keep you hooked.

As much as she wants to feel that connection, she just doesnt.Even though this book borders unconventional ideas, Its interesitng to see what grief can truly do to a person.

"I am a huge fan of historical Paranormal fiction novels, but feel as if a lot of authors just dont fully get the concept. C. C. Spivey hit the nail right on the head with, ""Reborn"". This book has so many different elements to it, Its hard to exactly describe how I felt after reading it - aside from blown away.Reborn has a little of everything in it - from extreme horror (I admit I was frightened at times), to romance, to erotica and suspense. Main character Mayan was born into a difficult life of slavery. Unlike other African Americans, Mayan is fair skilled with beautiful bright eyes. Soon enough, Tytarion finds Mayan hiding under a rock and immediately takes her under his wing. His main goal is to bring her into immortality, and have his vampire baby. It gets a little sick and twisted at times, but thats what I enjoyed most of time.The writing for these characters, along with the dark storyline, makes this a must read. I have not enjoyed a paranormal novel like this in quite some time, and it definitely surpasses the more popular ones on the market today. I highly recommend this one to any fan of this specific genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G538D806L4PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FXEKT0O#wasThisHelpful","R3G538D806L4PC","A1NDXC8HMT7UP7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NDXC8HMT7UP7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bed, by Nikos Vlachos, truly pulled at my heart strings and reminded me that relationships arent always easy. The story of Joe and Sara is not only well written, but extremely relatable as well. I was hooked from beginning to end, not wanting to put this one down for even a second.The story starts out in 1983 in Chicago. Joe was a struggling artist, while Sara was a nurse. They meet each other and fall instantly in love, and end up getting married. Soon enough, however, they find out that marriage isnt as easy as they might of thought it would be. They face challenge after challenge with one another, but Its the strength of their love that keeps them fighting to hold on to one another.The love between Sara and Joe reminded me of one thing; marriage, or relationships in general, are not easy. However, it doesnt mean we give up. Instead, we must work through with each other to come out stronger on the other side.

"Fifteen short years after he became Lakewood Church’s senior minister, Joel Osteen had become the embodiment and achieved the fulfillment of his own message—positive thinking, self-encouragement, and belief that God’s consequential blessings inevitably bring progress and advancement—the story of salvation with a smile, according to Phillip Sinitiere in this book.The book starts with the story of John Osteen’s background, his transition from Southern Baptist into neopentecostalism, and his philosophy of ministry at Lakewood. It then goes on to describe how Joel stepped into the senior pastor position upon his father’s death in 1999, and his own distinctive philosophy of ministry.Based on analysis of Joel’s sermons, the author says that Joel’s prosperity gospel has four parts: positive thinking, positive confession, positive providence, and the promotion of the Christian body as a site of improvement. It seems to me that there are parts of the Bible which can be used to support each of those themes, but those themes are not an accurate representation of the message of the Bible.The author did not have access to Joel Osteen or other key people while writing the book, and as a result the book often feels like an academic analysis of writings and sermons rather than a lively personal story. Nonetheless, it does provide some interesting insights into the senior pastor of the largest church in North America.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DXQD0L0RZURL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814723888#wasThisHelpful","R1DXQD0L0RZURL","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Faced with the emergence and speed of growth in the information economy, organizations have an urgent need to adopt IT governance best practice, according to Alan Calder and Steve Watkins in this book. The authors define IT governance as ‘the framework for the leadership, organizational structures and business processes, standards and compliance to these standards, which ensures that the organization’s information systems support and enable the achievement of its strategies and objectives’.There are so many different things that can go wrong with an organisation’s IT resources that it is hard to know where to start even identifying the possible risks, let alone working out how to get them under control. The old risks of data loss due to hardware failure and financial loss due to project failure still exist, but there are vast numbers of new risks including the risks of data theft or destruction by highly skilled malicious agents who are bent on finding ways to harm your organisation.Only large organisations will have the resources to go through the full ISO27001 certification process, but in its discussion of the various controls needed for certification, this book provides a very useful overview of the steps which an organisation can take to protect against a large range of information security risks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z4W93J584MZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074947405X#wasThisHelpful","R2Z4W93J584MZX","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fit leaders and fit companies mindfully and intentionally pursue a well-defined course of action that makes them stronger, faster, and more agile over the long run; they engage in rigorous, scientific thinking at all levels of the organization to analyse and solve problems, and they eliminate the fear that shackles employee creativity and liberate employees to close the baps between where they are today and where they want to be tomorrow, according to Daniel Markovitz in this book.The author compares a fit organization to a fit athlete, recommending that you start not by trying to emulate the very best but by doing exercises so that you gradually improve your competitiveness in all relevant dimensions. The six principles are:• Commit to improvement: have a clearly defined improvement program to reach your organizational goals• Increase value: monitor, fix and improve your operational processes instead of trying to cut costs• Think horizontally: instead of thinking in functional silos, view the entire process by which the company adds value from the customer’s perspective• Standard work: the people who are actually doing the job define their current understanding of the best way to do it• Visual management: create a visual management system which allows you to see the quality and pace of the work• The coaching triangle: the elements of a successful coaching relationship are: participate, go and see, and show respect.I am not fully convinced by all of the author’s ideas – for example, I am not sure that visual management is for everyone – but I do think that most readers will find plenty of helpful content in this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25OY21X1YRL0T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1259587177#wasThisHelpful","R25OY21X1YRL0T","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A fundamental shift is indeed taking place all around us: more and more, today’s businesses find that, rather than asking or forcing individuals to step into line with the organization’s needs, they must adapt and transform themselves to attract the right people, keep them, and inspire them to do their best work, according to Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones in this book.So what are the key elements of a highly desirable workplace? Based on their extensive research, the authors have concluded that there are six broad imperatives:• Difference: an organization which allows individuals to express the ways in which they are different and how they see things differently• Radical honesty: letting employees know what is really going on• Extra value: an organization which develops and adds values to employees• Authenticity: an organization which stands for something that employees can be proud of• Meaning: where day-to-day work has real significance; and• Simple rules: where the same sensible rules apply to allThese attributes of good places to work are not particularly surprising, but they are quite difficult to implement. Many of the example organizations cited by the authors rated highly on one or more of the attributes, but not all of them. Nevertheless, the book provides a useful framework for those seeking to improve their organization’s standing as an employer of choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16H2BFAEXJZIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1625275099#wasThisHelpful","R16H2BFAEXJZIJ","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whatever the cause of a sense of entitlement, the end result is that the entitled person believes that he or she doesn’t have to play by the rules of responsibility, ownership, and commitment. And the end result of entitlement is predictable: The entitled person feels good and lives badly, while those around him feel bad about the situation but have more successful relationships and careers, according to John Townsend in this book.The common characteristics of entitlement identified by the author include:• An attitude of being special• An attitude of being owed, of deserving something• A refusal to accept responsibility• A denial of one’s impact on othersWhile it is usually fairly easy to diagnose someone else as a sufferer of entitlement disease, it is often harder to admit that you are suffering the disease yourself. The book is ostensibly written to show readers how to help others who are stuck in an entitlement rut, but it also provides a helpful range of ideas for identifying and dealing with your own failings. The various chapters discuss motivation, discipline and structure, creating a helpful self-image, assuming responsibility, doing hard things first, keeping inconvenient commitments, respecting the future, admitting errors, facing up to pain, and taking meaningful risks.I am not confident that entitlement can ever really be “cured”, but I think that this book provides a range of useful things you can do to help manage the disease.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S78RDQXW1WBW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310330521#wasThisHelpful","R3S78RDQXW1WBW","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rooting out corrosive behaviours is not simple, since they are often mutant excesses of laudable aspects of organisational life and group behaviour. Slowly these sabotaging behaviours become part of the working culture, and spotting them, much less extricating them, is not easy, according to Robert Galford, Bob Frish and Cary Greene in this book.The nine particular forms of sabotaging behaviour dealt with by the authors are:• Sabotage by obedience: following processes that are not working, instead of using personal judgment• Sabotage by speech: speeches which deliberately or inadvertently lead teams away from good decisions• Sabotage by committee: delegating work to a committee with no accountability and no deadline• Sabotage by irrelevant issues: subverting a team’s agenda by introducing a burning issue or a side issue• Sabotage by haggling: wasting energy arguing over minor issues rather than concentrating on the major task• Sabotage by reopening decisions: trying to get a matter re-decided without bringing any new arguments to the table• Sabotage by excessive caution: killing creativity by preventing people from taking any form of quick action• Sabotage by is-it-really-our-call: failing to make decisions because of ambiguity in accountability• Sabotage by CC: sending copies of emails that get overlooked because of their frequencyThe book is based on an entertaining concept – the Simple Sabotage Field Manual published by the US Office of Strategic Services during the second world war – and it provides straightforward strategies for dealing with each of the types of intentional or inadvertent sabotage identified above.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X4913Z5TQXME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062371606#wasThisHelpful","R2X4913Z5TQXME","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A church without volunteers is an unhealthy church, because the act of volunteering is an expression of worship, it serves people, and it builds relationships. Churches are among the few organizations where the same people are the owners, the funders, the staff, and the customers, according to Leith Anderson and Jill Fox in this book.Part 1 of the book addresses the issues involved in building a volunteer culture, Part 2 discusses ways of recruiting volunteers, and Part 3 covers volunteer training and care. The best method of recruiting volunteers is said to be using other volunteers. Happy volunteers are keen to recruit others, so one of the key ways of maximising recruitment is to take good care of the volunteers you already have.In addition to providing the theory, the authors provide some useful practical tools. Appendix 1 provides a training plan for staff and those who lead volunteers, covering 5 key steps of volunteer development: recruiting, training, building the team, appreciating and celebrating, and empowering. Appendix 2 provides an outline for a personal Volunteer Development Plan.I am not a big fan of the distinctions large churches tend to make between “staff” and “volunteers” which tend to assume that staff have the skills and volunteers are unskilled. Nevertheless, church staff are usually the ones responsible for making sure the ministry gets done, and in my opinion this book provides some useful ideas to help with recruiting, organising, deploying and maintaining lay ministry teams.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HP05IHHP0XND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310519152#wasThisHelpful","R2HP05IHHP0XND","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Inspiration is a very poor foundation on which to build substantive change, and the leadership tales we hear, stories that often have only modest amounts of validity, routinely make things worse, and possibly much worse, according to Jeffrey Pfeffer in this book. The author goes on to make his case with a number of non-validated propositions supported by inspirational or perhaps de-inspirational anecdotes.The introduction describes the “enormous leadership industry” co-existing with overwhelming numbers of “dysfunctional workplaces”, and concludes that “the leadership industry has failed”. A fairly obvious way to test this hypothesis would be to compare the extent and nature of leadership training, if any, received by leaders of dysfunctional workplaces with that received by leaders of high-performing workplaces, but the only evidence provided by the author is anecdotal.In chapter 1, while debunking the value of inspirational stories, the author refers to two unnamed people who claimed to him that the conduct of Bill George while at Medtronic had deviated in an unspecified manner from the type of behaviour he recommended in his book “True North”. This seems to be an excellent example of how bad business books use gossip and innuendo to demonstrate points for which they fail to provide any statistically defensible evidence.Chapter 2 is largely devoted to explaining why narcissism is better for you than modesty, chapter 3 creates a straw man of “authentic leadership” and knocks it down, chapter 4 explains why lying brings greater returns than honesty, chapter 5 claims that trust is not essential to organisational functioning or effective leadership, and chapter 6 explains that leaders overwhelmingly look after themselves first.The book’s main purpose seems to be to advocate for a more evidence-based approach to leadership education, and for a stronger form of organisational governance that makes organisations less dependent on the whims and personalities of a single leader or a small group of leaders. I fully support both of these goals, but there are plenty of books available that provide better ways of achieving them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8QYR6PZ5OUPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062383167#wasThisHelpful","R8QYR6PZ5OUPL","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leadership doesn’t require a written invitation. It isn’t something that only “important people” can do. It isn’t a function of money, power, or title, although these elements can certainly affect, for better or worse, your ability to pursue your aspirations. Leadership is a way of thinking that engages your special talents now and, ideally, for the rest of your life, according to Robert Kaplan in this book.Given the range of views experts have as to what constitutes leadership, it is necessary to start out with an appropriate definition. The author says that effective leadership means having an ownership mindset, which involves asking the following questions:• Can you figure out what you believe, as if you were an owner?• Can you act on those beliefs?• Do you act in a way that adds value to someone else: a customer, a client, a colleague or a community?• Do you take responsibility for the positive and negative impact of your actions on others?The leader needs to master some processes that will help develop the leader’s capacity to lead and enhance the leader’s ability to think and act like an owner:• Vision, priorities and alignment: Identify and articulating how you distinctively add value, prioritising tasks critical to adding that value, and aligning your decisions with accomplishment of those aspirations• Understanding yourself, your motivations, strengths and weaknesses, and developing habits that will enable you to keep learning about yourselfIn my opinion this book will be very useful as a resource in a leadership training program. It is fairly short and interesting to read, while at the same time asking some profoundly challenging questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G1K3F5GXOEEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633690555#wasThisHelpful","R2G1K3F5GXOEEL","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today’s availability of technology means that any business in any industry can develop an audience through consistent storytelling. No longer does the company with the biggest marketing budget win the most attention. Businesses are now rewarded on the substance of their message and on the audience they can attract through the consistent flow of information, according to Joe Pulizzi in this book.The author’s model for using content marketing to build a business involves six steps:• The sweet spot: finding an area where your passion overlaps with your expertise• The content tilt: finding a way of differentiating your content• Building the base: publishing consistently in a single core channel• Harvesting the audience: converting casual readers into subscribers• Diversification: expanding the publishing process to additional channels• Monetization: selecting products and services to bring profit to the businessThe book contains numerous stories of people who have created remarkably successful businesses using this approach, but will it work for everyone? It seems to me that if you happen to be an expert in an area that many people are keen to discover more about, and no-one else is already filling that niche, then you have a real opportunity to succeed thought content marketing. If, however, your expertise is in an area that excites little interest or your area is already overwhelmed with content produced by competitors, your prospects of “Content Inc” success are much lower. But maybe the biggest barrier to success is generating the motivation to produce a steady stream of content in the first place.I enjoyed reading the book, and I think it is an excellent guide to the practicalities of content marketing. The author writes in an engaging manner, and seems to be a very helpful and friendly person. Even if you decide that content marketing is not for you, you can still benefit from reading the book to gain an understanding of the relationship between cultivating an audience and gaining commercial success on the Internet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BR79QBTQOXPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125958965X#wasThisHelpful","R3BR79QBTQOXPX","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The image of weak and declining churches has been carried forward in the last twenty years by news services in the United States, consistent with their general sense that religion itself is a dying relic of the past, according to Ted Campbell in this book. While the church as a whole clearly is experiencing decline, the reality is not as stark as the headlines seem to suggest.The book lists a number of facts in support of this argument:• Historic Protestant churches were never the dominant center of American religion they are supposed to have been in the twentieth century.• The preponderance of lost membership has been of inactive members.• The numbers of active members of congregations are higher than weekly attendance figures reveal.• Historic Protestant churches today have a strong core of committed believers.The author also describes a number of good things which have come from historic Protestant churches, including ecumenical engagement, postmillennial optimism and social engagement, roots beyond America, doctrine and liturgy, strong expectations for the Christian formation of adult church members, institutions for multigenerational transmission of cultures, and benevolent infrastructuresNot all readers will appreciate the author’s distinctive sense of humour or writing style, but those who are looking for a realistic appraisal of the current situation and immediate future of the churches often referred to as “mainline” will find some useful information in this book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9CMQ8HYRAR4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426785941#wasThisHelpful","R9CMQ8HYRAR4P","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The crisis for Australian charities is one of identity. They are in crisis because so many of them do not know who they are and they do not know why they are doing what they are doing. And what is sad is that many do not even understand the concept, according to Stephen Judd, Anne Robinson and Felicity Errington in this book.The book contrasts charities which have remained true to their original purposes with charities which have allowed their mission to drift until it is no longer clear what that mission is. According to the authors, Australian governments have historically outsourced much of their social welfare programs to existing charities, so that the charities have been pressured to mould themselves into whatever shape fits the government policies of the day, and the result is that the charities have lost their own distinct identities and their original supporter bases.Part 1 of the book describes how charities have gone astray, and Part 2 describes how they can recover their identities by becoming purpose-driven, rather than money-driven or government-driven. A proactive charity needs a purpose-driven strategy, with a purpose-driven board, purpose-driven leadership, an engaged workforce and a healthy relationship with its community.Some of the chapters seem to be a few years out of date, but the references to the Australian not-for-profit environment is otherwise quite accurate. Most of the content will be relevant to non-profit organisations in other countries. In my view this is a very interesting and helpful book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQPYILRZ2APJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZQOIAI#wasThisHelpful","RQPYILRZ2APJW","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few exceptionally well-informed and far-seeing individuals manipulated events in the aftermath of the Second World War, so that they gained control of a public relations machine of unprecedented power, according to Richard Milton in this book. The Ministry of Information had been created by the British Government at the start of the Second World War to counter German propaganda, but it was supposed to be wound up after the war, rather than being appropriated for peacetime political use.The book describes how Herbert Morrison, the deputy prime-minister in Britain’s post-war Labour Government, secretly re-purposed much of the Ministry of Information machinery, using its propaganda abilities to push through the Labour party’s nationalisation program. Hundreds of skilled media professionals were pressed into service to promote the government’s social engineering schemes.Although the author also describes how Anthony Eden’s conservative government used similar propaganda techniques to induce support for an unjustified war with Egypt over the Suez Canal, most of the book is devoted to describing the machinations of Clement Attlee’s government and how the mostly sincere believers in social reform justified the use of propaganda, funded at public expense, to persuade the public to support their programs.It is an interesting tale, demonstrating a strong correlation between government public relations and misuse of public resources. The production of large numbers of government films including animated films forms an interesting part of the story. The book provides a fascinating insight into the misdeeds of a government more than 60 years ago, and leave one wondering how writers in 60 years’ time will view the misdeeds of current governments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P0QV1RKTN8ER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUR98KI#wasThisHelpful","R1P0QV1RKTN8ER","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a world of ever-expanding online opportunities, it is essential that we stop treating the Internet as a distraction to be resisted and instead see it as an ally in the battle for focus, productivity, and personal effectiveness. But the Internet can only be your ally when you know how to use online tools effectively: when you start by thinking about your priorities and working style, and then customize your digital toolkit accordingly, according to Alexandra Samuel in this book.The book aims to provide an integrated road map of how to use some essential tools that have the biggest impact on professional capacity and effectiveness. These tools are: efficient use of email, Evernote, Twitter and Hootsuite, and LinkedIn. Different users may have a different mix of needs for these and similar tools, but the author contends that effective use of these tools in combination will significantly improve the professional effectiveness of most people.Most professionals and officeworkers will have had at least some exposure to a majority of the tools described by the author, but all but the very tech-savvy will discover in the book a number of useful ways of harnessing software to create a significant personal productivity improvement. This is the type of book which is really best read while actually trying out the tools, in order to obtain a more immediate understanding.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLNEUAPOPE15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U2RQJCY#wasThisHelpful","R2MLNEUAPOPE15","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Professional services firms have to recognize that they are no longer in business just to provide technically excellent products and services; they need to go the extra mile to anticipate, understand and deliver commercial solutions to their clients, in a manner and style that not only resolves their clients’ challenges, but also delivers a great experience in the process, according to Nigel Clark and Charles Nixon in this book.The professional services environment has changed rapidly, and the marketing tactics which may have worked ten or twenty years ago are no longer sufficient. A marketing department which is simply generating newsletters which nobody reads and glossy brochures containing unsupported boasts about the “leading” nature of the firm’s services is adding very little value to the business, even if the partners in the firm think that that is what the marketing department should be doing.The book focuses on five key themes of the successful professional firm marketer’s role:• Growth: identifying and choosing markets and clients• Understanding: listening and responding to client needs• Connecting: building a conversation with clients and stakeholders• Relationships: developing and managing client relationships• Managing: influencing the marketing organisationAlthough it is usually difficult for editors to maintain consistent quality when different chapters are written by different contributors, I found something of interest in every chapter of this book.

"Does a leader’s character really contribute to the organization’s bottom line, or are strong business results simply a reflection of a solid business model and positive macroeconomic forces? That is one of the questions asked by Fred Kiel in this book. The findings of the book are based on a large number of surveys of employees of substantial organizations, concerning their leaders, as well as interviews with the leaders themselves, and also financial information relating to those organizations.So do organizations whose leaders show high levels of integrity and moral character do better or worse financially than other organizations?According to the key research findings, character-driven leaders deliver nearly five times the return on assets delivered by leaders near the bottom of the character curve. Moreover, it is possible to develop the habits of strong character and unlearn the habits of poor character.The research methodology used in the study necessarily relies on subjective interpretation, so the outcomes are unlikely to impress a hardened statistical skeptic. Nonetheless, the book does create a persuasive argument for the business benefits of integrity, responsibility, forgiveness and compassion, and the surprisingly high correlation between those attributes and effectiveness in decision making, strategy, and other leadership skills.As the author says, people are hungry for information that allows them to believe that we can and in fact must demand more from our leaders. This book is an excellent step in that direction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI2VR2GS0NAX7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O92Q6DA#wasThisHelpful","RI2VR2GS0NAX7","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The U.S. economy is increasingly run by a “visible hand” instead of Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.” Large sectors of the economy are guided by a few powerful companies. The question is whether the visible hand runs these sectors with Smith’s “enlightened self-interest” or with just “self-interest”, according to Philip Kotler in this book.The book enumerates fourteen different problems which the author sees with capitalism, ranging from increasing income inequality and persistent poverty to the dangers of narrow self-interest and the ways in which politics subverts economics. The identification of the fourteen issues is largely uncontroversial, although some might categorise them differently or combine some together. It is the author’s prescriptions for change which are likely to be wildly controversial.It seems ironic that capitalism, as a system apparently built essentially by neglect as each person pursues his or her own interests in a rational manner, should be the subject of passionately held beliefs raising it almost to the level of a religion. I suspect that, by proposing a number of solutions which interfere with the sacred tenets of the free market, the author will be calling down on his head the wrath of the devotees of laissez-faire.Readers who have little or no knowledge of economics and how capitalism works will find this book helpful if they keep in mind that many of the author’s simple-sounding solutions are highly controversial and unlikely to be adopted by any government which relies on support from wealthy citizens.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G9VYAPKDC4F7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814436455#wasThisHelpful","R3G9VYAPKDC4F7","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brands operate in sectors, and each sector is a separate playing field, according to Kartikeya Kompella in this book.

"Thinking and acting in new ways is not safe for many congregations, according to Jasmine Rose Smothers and F Douglas Powe Jr in this book.

They are not safe for our congregations.The authors’ “commandments” for older church members include:• Thou shall chill (Be willing to let go)• Thou shall not front (Be authentic to God’s mission and calling)• Thou shall not trip (Be willing to discuss difficult subjects without getting upset)• Thou shall sample (Be ready to combine the old with the new)The authors’ choice of language and the issues discussed suggest that the primary target audience for this book is leaders of African American churches. As a non-American reader I experienced difficulty in understanding some of the authors’ terminology and style, and many of the issues which they have raised are not ones which I have encountered.

"Jesus did not come to start a religion; I doubt that he ever said to himself, “okay, now I am going to begin something called Christianity,” according to Mike Slaughter in this book. Instead, the rebel Jesus came with a renegade gospel to start a revolution that would be propelled by a counter-cultural community of people on planet earth. The book aims to describe what it means to live a revolutionary lifestyle when we get serious about the real Jesus.Hard-hitting statements made by the author include:• It is a heresy to value, honor and prioritize a worldly system, ideology and politics over the Kingdom of God• Too often we allow talk-show pundits to become the genesis of our values, rather than looking to the Kingdom, will and Word of God• When we privatize our faith we cease to be salt and light in the world• We don’t pray to get to heaven; we actively work and pray to get the Kingdom of Heaven into earth• Faith is acting on Jesus’ directive to follow, which means that his lifestyle becomes our lifestyle• We act as if the narrow way belongs to the pastor, the wide way to the lost, and the middle way, somewhere between the other two, to the rest of us• Through the ages and continuing today, the church has used the written word as an excuse or justification for not obeying the directives of JesusAlthough it is short and written in an engaging style, this is not an easy book to read, just as the lifestyle which Jesus proclaimed is not an easy one to live.

"Real-world examples of exceptional leaders are few and far between, since so many would-be WOWs stop short of their full potential. But in the fictional world of television, where anything is possible, there are a plethora of examples from which to draw inspiration, according to Sheri Staak in this book. If we look beneath the surface of the drama, comedy, sentimentality, and occasional horror of what we see on TV, we find layers of truth. We can relate to it, understand it, and learn from it.The book goes on to illustrate numerous aspects of leadership by reference to televisions shows and characters. Good leaders are referred to by the author as WOWs, while bad leaders are referred to as DUDs. The WOWs are honest, trustworthy, humble, respectful, dedicated to self-improvement, authentic, goal-driven visionaries, effective communicators, invested in others, inspirational motivators, agents of change and bold decision makers and problem solvers. The DUDs are power-hungry, greedy, egotistical and self-serving.While the author has many useful things to say about good leadership, in the real world there is not such a sharp distinction between the good and the bad. Someone possessing most of the WOW characteristics, for example, may still be a very poor leader if he or she is not sufficiently assertive or resilient to be able to overcome entrenched opposition. On the other hand, some people with obvious character flaws such as oversized egos still manage to become very effective leaders.Unfortunately I was not familiar with most of the television characters referenced by the author, and that may have adversely influenced my level of engagement. The book contains numerous checklists, which some readers may find helpful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FEI4MS0JLTZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQU4MGQ#wasThisHelpful","R3FEI4MS0JLTZR","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today, strategy in business has fallen into disrepute; the expensive large-scale strategic planning exercises that were common in the late twentieth century are no longer perceived as providing commensurate returns in terms of contributing to the firm's success. What really sealed the fate of these exercises was the fast-changing, increasingly dynamic and complex business environment, according to Johan Aurik, Martin Fabel and Gillis Jonk in this book. Nonetheless strategy, when properly understood and executed, has never been more important.If the traditional form of strategic planning is no longer relevant, what should take its place? The authors advocate an approach which they call FutureProof Strategy, which consists of three principles taken in combination:* Draw inspiration from the future, by identifying fundamental trends that are affecting the firm now or could do so in the future* Be organizationally inclusive, by engaging people across and up and down the firm in formulating it* Take a portfolio approach, by identifying and managing competitive opportunities on an ongoing lifecycle basisWhile this approach does not offer the neat convenience of a ""blue ocean"" strategy, it does provide a helpful new perspective. A firm's strategies are no longer laboriously drawn from a detailed analytical process based on historical data, then fixed until the next strategy cycle. Instead, they are inspired by trends noticed anywhere within the organisation, and they are adopted, modified and abandoned as soon as their increasing or decreasing usefulness is perceived.I did not find the book as easy to read as Blue Ocean Strategy, Expanded Edition: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant, but I do think the general principles which it provides will be very useful to many organizations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A5BGUHWIY2CP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0071848746#wasThisHelpful","R1A5BGUHWIY2CP","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the decade since the first edition of their book was released, the ferocity of competition in existing industries and the pressures on costs and profits have only intensified, according to authors W Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne in the latest incarnation of their best-selling book, “Blue Ocean Strategy Expanded Edition”. That is why there is a rising call for creative new solutions and such an allure in the idea of escaping from cut-throat  “red ocean” markets into competition-free “blue ocean” market space.While most businesses and organizations are trapped in very difficult competitive environments, there are plenty of examples around of organizations which have carved out their highly profitable blue-ocean niche. Is their success attributable solely to rare strategic brilliance or luck, or is there a systematic way of coming up with winning strategies? According to the authors, there are systematic ways of finding blue oceans, and the book provides a number of tools designed to help the reader do just that.Blue ocean strategy is fundamentally based on value innovation; that is, finding a new way of providing compelling value to clients or customers by pursuing both differentiation and low cost at the same time. To do this, you identify the different strategic factors applicable to a particular industry, and then select some factors to be reduced well below the industry’s standard, some to be raised, some to be eliminated and some new ones to be created. The result of the process needs to be a focused strategy which diverges significantly from the industry’s average profile, and which comes with a compelling tagline.However, a truly sustainable blue ocean strategy also needs barriers to imitation. These can include:• Alignment barriers, making it difficult for competitors to align their value proposition, profit and people in the same way• Cognitive and organizational barriers, whereby the particular form of value innovation conflicts with competitors’ conventional logic• Brand barriers, whereby the value innovation conflicts with competitors’ brand image• Economic and legal barriers, such as patents, a natural monopoly or a cost advantage driven by high volumeWhile not every reader of the book will discover a perfectly formed blue ocean strategy, almost every reader who spends time and effort working through the tools provided by the authors will come up with some creative strategic ideas which might not otherwise have arisen. This is one of my favourite books on strategy and, although the changes between the first edition and the expanded edition are not substantial, they are still enough to justify the price of buying the new edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13DV1F33HJFS5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4CRR7Y#wasThisHelpful","R13DV1F33HJFS5","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It requires courage to voice your vision, to stand up for it, and to battle the resistance you’ll inevitably face in return, because an effective vision by definition has to be original, and therefore to some degree be provocative, maybe even slightly controversial, according to Rob-Jan de Jong in this book. That is one of the reasons why leaders are often reluctant to espouse a compelling vision, and yet vision casting is one of the key components of effective leadership.The book aims to explain how anyone can become more visionary, by describing:• Visionary content, including techniques for imagining a range of plausible future scenarios• Visionary practices, including methods for seeing things early and connecting the dots• Visionary self, including ways of developing your own integrity, credibility and authenticity as a leader• Visionary communication, including how to harness the power of language and how to use stories to make your message more accessibleAs the author states at the beginning of the book, vision is one of the key attributes required of leaders, and yet there are very few resources available which explain how to get and communicate a vision. In my opinion this book succeeds in breaking down the visioning process into achievable steps. It won’t turn you into an inspiring orator overnight, but it will give you a manageable path for finding, capturing, embodying and communicating a vision for your organization or cause.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVK5W2ZBNK87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWH6PEQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VVK5W2ZBNK87","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, the history of the human species suggests that all too often groups fail to live up to their potential. Many groups turn out to be foolish; they bet on products that are doomed to failure; they miss out on spectacular opportunities; they develop unsuccessful marketing strategies; their investments and strategies go awry, hurting millions of people in the process, according to Cass Sunstein and Reid Hastie in this book.Whereas in theory groups should be smarter than individuals, they often end up making worse decisions than would have been made by the average individual in the group. In the first part of the book, the authors identify four different ways in which this can occur:• When the group amplifies rather than corrects the individual errors of its members• When the group members follow the leader instead of revealing their own opinions and knowledge• When the group tends to become more extreme as a result of internal discussions• When group members concentrate on shared information and ignore critical information that only one or a few people have.The second part of the book provides a number of suggestions for reducing the risk of group failure, focusing on group deliberation and how to make it more effective, the importance of separating the process of generating possible solutions from the process of selecting a preferred solution, ways in which combining information from multiple group members can result in statistically better decisions, the role of experts, and the use of tournaments and prediction markets.Unfortunately the authors sometimes stray from their area of expertise, describing the two-stage process of identifying then selecting ideas as “Darwinian evolution”, whereas in reality there is no natural selection or multiple generations involved, so that the process is more akin to a beauty contest, still subject to the preferences and prejudices of the judges. Nonetheless, the book does provide a very useful resolution of the differences between those who argue for the wisdom of crowd and those who argue that the popular decision is almost always the wrong one, and it provides some very helpful ideas for optimizing the group decision-making process.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K831UZNSEDAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O4CRR9C#wasThisHelpful","R2K831UZNSEDAW","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At the most basic level, leadership succession and transition is a continuous process of organizational transformation: a people decision, an organizational decision, and a strategy decision all rolled into one, with not infrequently a crisis call thrown in for good measure, according to Noel Tichy in this book. Leadership succession and transition is simply the most politically and culturally charged, technically challenging, and critical leadership assignment of all the many judgments that business leaders are obliged to make in the course of doing their day jobs.This is the book which the author’s life’s work has prepared him to write. Noel Tichy has been involved as a participant or consultant in more key leadership succession decisions than just about anyone else. The book is filled with descriptions and analysis of succession decisions that went wrong and ones that went right. Nearly always, a good CEO succession starts with building a pipeline of capable leaders within the organisation, giving those leaders crucible experiences, and selecting one from amongst a number of worthy internal candidates when the succession time arises.The book does describe a few cases in which the hiring of outside candidates has led to success, but those cases are by far the exception rather than the rule. In most cases, in the author’s opinion, the hiring of a CEO candidate from outside leads to disaster, and occurs only because the organisation’s board has failed in its duty to have a viable succession plan in place. There does, however, seem to be a difference between highly structured organisations such as the US Special Operations Forces, in which it is essential to build up the leader from within, and highly unstructured organisations such as universities, in which the leader can be recruited from outside with equal prospects of success.Most large organisations probably spend at least a nominal amount of effort considering succession, but this book makes a convincing argument for the benefits of spending very considerable effort over an extended period of time on getting the leadership pipeline flowing. As such the book makes compelling reading for board members.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PBHBETTWKFJT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L1EA0#wasThisHelpful","R1PBHBETTWKFJT","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In our schools and workplaces, groupthink is rewarded. Those who question decisions and advocate for different ways are often ignored, ostracized, or fired. Yet without rebels, our systems, companies, schools, churches, government agencies, and healthcare organizations become rigid and sometimes even dangerous, according to Lois Kelly, Carmen Medina and Debra Cameron in this book.So, what makes the difference between a bad rebel and a good rebel? Bad rebels complain, are self-focused, exude anger and pessimism, alienate others, vocalize problems and point fingers. Good rebels are creative and mission-focused optimists, who generate energy, ask questions, see possibilities and pinpoint causes. The problem is that management often finds it hard to tell the difference between good and bad rebels, so good rebels have to tread carefully; hence the need for this book.The book goes on to explain how a good rebel can gain credibility at work by listening closely to pick up important signals, how to navigate the organizational landscape by understanding work politics and types of bureaucratic behaviour, how to communicate your ideas in a convincing manner, how to manage conflict, and how to deal with fear, uncertainty and doubt. There is even a chapter for your boss on how to get the most out of good rebels.In my opinion this is a very helpful book. Employees who are able to think creatively are much more valuable to their organisations than employees who just follow orders, but they tend to have their ideas squashed because of the inbuilt assumption that all good ideas will come from the people at the top who get paid the big money. Hopefully this book will help many good rebels to get their ideas heard and adopted.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CXMAQKDOLX9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P9WL3WS#wasThisHelpful","R3CXMAQKDOLX9V","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like our world today, Roman citizens were bombarded with new cultures, new commerce, new foods, and new ideas, as well as new philosophies, cults, and religions; theirs was an era of massive disorientation, and at the same time, it was exactly the right environment for Christianity to emerge and thrive, according to Christine Chakoian in this book.The author’s thesis is that the church today could work out how to respond to the current difficult times of change and crisis if only we could recover our memory of how the early church managed to thrive.• Technology is causing massive disruptions today, just as the new Roman roads and technologies were causing disruptions in the ancient world.• The shrinking world has brought religious pluralism, just as the Roman roads led to a melting pot of many foreign religions.• The early church had to decide which parts of the faith were essential and which parts were not, and we have to deal with similar questions today.• The early church had to struggle with finding authority in community, and we face similar struggles in today’s authority-questioning environment.• The early church had to find ways to reach out to a non-Christian culture, and we face a similar task.There are plenty of interesting ideas in this fairly short book.

"The purpose of a church board is ultimately to mind the ""bottom line"" of the church--to make sure the church is operating in such a way as to accomplish its mission; but the bottom line sometimes looks different to different people, according to Stan Toler in this book. Even if all board members agree that the church's purpose is to fulfill the Great Commission, the board members still may interpret success differently.Thus it is necessary to reach at least broad agreement on the board's purpose, roles and expectations. This book provides a useful guide to those three things in its first three chapters, and then goes on to discuss how to run effective board meetings, how to use the board to stimulate progress, how to conduct strategic planning and develop long-term strategies, how to manage conflict, and how to equip new board members.Unfortunately the people who put themselves forward and get elected to church board positions often are not the best candidates for the roles. This short book provides some useful suggestions for proactive ways in which pastors can help to get the right people on the board and then help to get them aligned and working as a team. Church boards will always be imperfect, but there are nearly always ways in which their current level of functioning can be improved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKEFE2RZZRCD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GTW3YSI#wasThisHelpful","R3KKEFE2RZZRCD","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Engagement is powerful; it simply requires the right keys to unlock that power; the organization that gives its people the tools, encouragement, and freedom to become the best people they can be--to really, truly engage--will also find itself rising to unimagined heights of success, according to Tracy Maylett and Paul Warner in this book.The five keys which the authors have identified from their extensive research conveniently form the acronym MAGIC:* Meaning: Your work has purpose beyond the work itself* Autonomy: The power to shape your work and environment in ways that allow you to perform at your best* Growth: Being stretched and challenged in ways that result in professional and personal progress* Impact: Seeing positive, effective, and worthwhile outcomes and results from your work* Connection: The sense of belonging to something beyond yourselfThe first three of these keys appear essentially to correspond with the three aspects of human motivation identified by Daniel Pink in his book Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us: autonomy, mastery (growth) and purpose (meaning).The authors' advice will come as a very helpful and salutary read to most managers. Engagement is a two-way process. Employees have to choose to be engaged, but managers have to provide conditions which encourage engagement. Most managers get promoted into management positions without appropriate leadership training, and they are usually unaware of their own incompetence at drawing the best from their teams. This book will help to fill the knowledge gap.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M7DR77KQPINP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162634115X#wasThisHelpful","R2M7DR77KQPINP","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When the four biggest advertisers in the Toad Hollow Gazette band together to demand a big cut to the newspaper’s advertising rates, the newspaper’s publisher, Hedgehog, is left with an awkward dilemma of the type faced by many business leaders in the face of digital disruption and the other forces which are making it harder to run a profitable business. The outcome of Hedgehog’s dilemma is described in the allegory by Jen Lawrence and Larry Chester, presented in this book.According to ancient Greek wisdom, the Hedgehog knows one big thing, while the Fox knows many things. This makes the Hedgehog good at running a stable business in his field of expertise, but when he encounters uncertain times he is often blinded into thinking that only one or two obvious courses of action are available. This is where he needs to consult the Fox, who can generate numerous options which the Hedgehog would have overlooked.Hedgehog and his team, with the guidance of Fox, eventually come up with a non-obvious solution to their dilemma as the result of working through the authors’ critical thinking process, which involves gathering information before making a decision, generating ideas using a fresh perspective, evaluating options using a logic-driven process, and agreeing at each stage of the process.The allegory provides an engaging and compelling vehicle for presenting the critical thinking framework advocated by the authors. Rather than simply describing the framework, the book shows how it can be used to achieve a creative result which would have been overlooked by normal decision-making processes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AQAO0SY165IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626341230#wasThisHelpful","R1AQAO0SY165IA","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most businesspeople know how to manage their business down to the last product requirement and decimal place, but they don’t know how to lead their people with the same degree of sophistication, according to Timothy Thomas and Charles Tilden in this book. Star performers often race ahead of the people problems they leave in their wake, until they reach a point where their continued success depends on leadership skills they do not possess.The authors go on to describe a number of very practical leadership skills, including:• How to recognize the differences between bureaucratic, supportive, directive, traditional and collaborative leadership styles• Key elements of strategic planning• How to overcome common obstacles to effective communication• How to inspire motivation and engagement in employees• Techniques for giving effective positive and correctional feedback• Understanding conflict and different ways of handling it• How to optimize the execution of organizational strategy• How to anticipate and overcome resistance to changeThe book is presented in a number of chapters of practical information interspersed with fictional conversations between “Frankie” and his grandmother. The fictional conversations were presumably introduced to make the book more engaging, but I suspect that they will instead give many reluctant leaders an excuse to dismiss the book as irrelevant. In my opinion, the book contains an extremely practical and useful collection of leadership tools.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IOSNZC4XOE41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626341273#wasThisHelpful","R1IOSNZC4XOE41","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moxie is the essence of what makes a leader tough on the inside and soft on the outside; these people know what it means to get knocked down, but better still they know how to get back up;  they also stick up for others, especially when the chips are down, and you want them on your side, and lucky for you, they most often are, according to John Baldoni in this book.The book goes on to discuss what the author considers to be the five elements of “Moxie”, namely:• Mindfulness, being awareness of the leader’s circumstances, strengths and shortcomings• Opportunity, which needs to be seized in order to make good things happen• X-factors, which include the disposition to succeed and the inner resourcefulness to persevere• Innovation, which includes the willingness to engage with the risks associated with doing things differently• Engagement with others, in order to achieve sustainable goals for themselves, their teams and their organizationsEach chapter includes the story of a well-known person who embodies the particular characteristic being discussed.As is the case for most leadership books, there is scope for debating the leadership characteristics which have been described as essential and those which have been omitted.

"How does one become a better and faster learner, and how does one build an organization that is more adaptable and learns better and faster than the competition? Those are the questions which Edward Hess aims to answer in this book. The book aspires to synthesize recent developments in the understanding of how people learn, the role of emotions, and environmental factors which can assist or inhibit learning.According to the author, a high performance learning organization requires the right kinds of people, in the right learning environment, using the right learning processes, to continuously learn faster and better than the competition. The right kinds of people are those who have the right motivation for and approach to learning. The right learning environment is an organizational culture in which curiosity and creativity are encouraged. The right learning processes include effective learning conversations.While Part 1 of the book describes the theory, Part 2 tells the story of three different learning organizations, with the major example being Bridgewater Associates, LP. Bridgewater seems to have an extraordinary culture in which every employee’s performance is continually being reviewed. The firm is run according to an extensive list of management principles written by the firm’s founder Ray Dalio. The firm is an idea meritocracy where learning and self-improvement are cultural pillars. However, the author’s description left me with the feeling that the firm’s environment might be a bit too controlling for most people.The book draws ideas from a number of different management, leadership and educational experts. I suspect that most business leaders do not give organizational learning the priority that it deserves; this book should help to redress the balance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8CHTLPV97XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0231170246#wasThisHelpful","RY8CHTLPV97XH","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Your team members are creative and intelligent and want to make a difference; you can give them the permission they need to do this, according to Maxine Attong in this book. Embracing this concept will enable you to shift your leadership style, which will further your own goals and ultimately benefit your team’s performance.The book describes how the author has created the concept of a safe space and used it as a management tool to facilitate enhanced team performance. The safe space is a room in which team members are free to release emotions, get past negative feelings, and take risks that lead to rewards. What happens in the room stays in the room, so team members can reveal their weaknesses but still leave with their dignity intact. Benefits include:• Providing a dynamic environment for the free exchange of ideas• Receiving honest feedback• Convincing team members that their thoughts and contributions are valued• Raising the level of trust in the team• Giving team members shared ownership of the team’s successes and failuresThe author writes in a clear and concise manner, so the “safe space” idea is well explained; however, I am not sure I am entirely comfortable with it. Some of the aspects seem a bit too cold and calculating. For example, the author says that some team members may see the safe space as a management trick that allows the leader to extract work, and she goes on the admit, “And they may be right.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LC5ZGS4HZCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632990091#wasThisHelpful","R13LC5ZGS4HZCJ","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A critical area of competitive advantage nowadays is the ability of organizations to lead rather than follow changes in the market and this means having the ability to roll out the right changes quickly and reliably in a way that delivers a return on investment for the organization, according to Helen Campbell in this book. What most organizations haven't yet managed to do is build the capability to respond reliably to needs for change, let alone stay ahead of them.The author's model for organizational change is built around a Cycle of Change, which includes the following steps:* Direct: The direction, destination and path of the proposed change need to be clearly articulated* Drive: There needs to be sufficient energy and momentum applied for the change to succeed* Deliver: Success depends on delivering the right solution, on time and on budget* Prepare: Everything that needs to be in place to support a change must be ready* Propagate: Changes need to be made to stick, and fixes applied where required* Profit: Benefits of the change need to be articulated, measured, and kept visible throughout the change processFor each of the steps, the author outlines ten possible traps and ten ideas for achieving success. In my opinion this book is more useful as a reference into which you can dip to find ideas about a particular topic rather than as a story for reading from start to finish. There are numerous brief case studies, but they appear to be fictional or to have their names and facts altered, because I have been unable to find any of the mentioned organizations in real life.The best-known book on organizational change is probably John Kotter's Leading Change, With a New Preface by the Author, and an Appendix of the current book shows how the steps in the author's Cycle of Change map to Kotter's eight steps. While Kotter's book is a concise outline of the change management process, the current book is more a compendium of ideas about things which can make changes fail or succeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TOA8G4PF2G4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749470836#wasThisHelpful","R2TOA8G4PF2G4I","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To accomplish more, do less. To bear more fruit, prune. To see God work more powerfully through you, listen and obey and trust, and quit trying so hard. In our workaholic culture, these words almost always come as a surprise, but they are also almost always welcome words for weary spiritual leaders, according to Eddy Hall, Ray Bowman and Skipp Machmer in this book. Embracing this basic truth that our ministry is more effective not when we do more, but when we do fewer things with our whole hearts, is the first step in becoming a more-with-less church.The book goes on to describe several ways in which a church can achieve more with less:• More-with-less ministry: eliminating over-programming to concentrate on a small number of highly effective ministries• More-with-less staffing: concentrate on achieving more through team work and using paid staff more to equip others than to do the ministries themselves• More-with-less buildings: re-use existing buildings in multiple ways in preference to investing in new buildings• More-with-less finances: operate within the income God provides, instead of living by the world’s financial system.The book contains plenty of advice which challenges common practices, supported by the extensive experience which the authors have had in church building and consulting over many years. Most church leaders will find in the book a range of possible solutions for problems which they are currently facing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SL5EX3HD7ZF8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDN85EC#wasThisHelpful","R1SL5EX3HD7ZF8","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Entrepreneurs and family businesspeople who enjoy long-term business success all follow a common procedure: they continually reinvent themselves, their businesses and, when relevant, their families, according to Lloyd Shefsky in this book. While this sounds challenging, it is quite achievable because successful reinvention normally occurs one small step at a time.The book is filled with stories of entrepreneurs and businesses which have achieved great success through their readiness to change course and reinvent their businesses when they encountered significant obstacles and opportunities, including: Tom Stemberg (Staples), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), Junior Bridgeman (restaurant franchisee), James Freeman (Blue Bottle Coffee), Michael Krasny (CDW), Maxine Clark (Build-a-Bear), Gil Mandelzis (Traiana), Larry Levy (Levy Restaurants), Jim Sinegal (Costco), John Osher (inventor of numerous successful toys) and many more.Unfortunately there are no transferrable rules for identifying and implementing a successful business idea. Different entrepreneurs take many different approaches. What the author has identified as common between entrepreneurs who succeed for more than just a brief season is the unusual continuing ability to notice critical obstacles or opportunities when they arise and reinvent their businesses to take advantage.The book also has quite a bit to say about family businesses and ways of managing successful generational transfers. The author has a background as a lawyer, business advisor and management educator, so he brings a well-informed perspective to his observations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AV21SGQ0K26F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LI363GS#wasThisHelpful","R1AV21SGQ0K26F","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You need to know that having questions and doubts doesn’t make you a bad person or a bad Christian, and God is certainly not disappointed with you, according to Jonathan Morrow in this book. But you also don’t want to let those doubts just sit there, because when doubts go unaddressed they inevitably steal the vitality of our faith.The book addresses a number of important questions, including:• What can we really know about Jesus?• How do we know what the earliest Christians believed?• Has the Biblical text been corrupted over the centuries?• Is the Bible unscientific?• Is the Bible sexist, racist, homophobic and genocidal?In my opinion, most of the questions are answered quite well, in a persuasive and even-handed manner. On the other hand, I think that the author’s arguments on slavery are weak, his first point being that “Christianity did not invent slavery”. In fact, the Bible is from end-to-end an anti-slavery manifesto, with the Old Testament describing the escape from slavery in Egypt and the New Testament describing the escape from slavery to sin.Similarly the author’s argument that the Old Testament slaughter of Canaanites was about idolatry rather than ethnic cleansing does not, in my view, properly address the question. A Christian understanding of the Old Testament requires that it be interpreted in the light of the New Testament, and Jesus’s commands to love our enemies, to do good to those who persecute us, and not to resist an evil person but to turn the other cheek. A proper interpretation of Old Testament passages apparently condoning violence needs to involve a discussion of Jesus's position on violence.Notwithstanding these issues, most Christians will find in this book some very helpful answers to some difficult questions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5GIZ8ZHAX1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802411789#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5GIZ8ZHAX1A","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are several common problems with business presentations, including failure to relate the message to the lives of the audience, failure to prepare adequately, and trying to cover too much information in too little time, according to Luis Cubero in his book Business Storytelling Guide: Creating Impactful and Compelling Business Presentations Using Storytelling Techniques. Each of these problems can be addressed by taking a storytelling approach to the presentation.While the use of stories in presentations is well known, the author’s approach involves structuring the whole presentation to follow a particular story structure known as “The Hero’s Journey”. This structure has 12 stages, starting with the ordinary world and the call to adventure, passing through other stages including meeting with the Mentor and the big ordeal, and ending with the resurrection and the return with the elixir. The author provides a parallel for each of these suitable for a business presentation; for example, the “call to adventure” is the business needs or objectives, while “meeting with the Mentor” is your value proposition.I was not entirely convinced about the appropriateness of the Hero’s Journey framework as a complete structure for a presentation (objectives don’t sound like much of a call to adventure to me) – and perhaps a fully worked example might have assisted in this regard – but I do think that this reasonably short book provides a method of creating business presentations which will help many people become much better presenters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27E39TR2BSW1K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KU5HK1W#wasThisHelpful","R27E39TR2BSW1K","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Organizations must learn how to drive innovation from both the technology side and the customer side. The challenge for companies is how to get better at bringing those two sides together, according to Marion Debruyne in this book. The essence of customer innovation is that the organization and its ecosystem are a united force in addressing a market demand.To flesh out these ideas, the author examines customer innovation through three “lenses”. The first lens is the close-up lens, focusing on existing customers, staying tuned-in to their demands and reacting quickly to shifts in customer requirements. The second lens zooms out a bit to view the entire customer journey, to understand what customers are trying to accomplish using the organisation’s products and services. The third lens zooms out further to look at emerging changes on the periphery of the market, to anticipate bigger future changes.Established companies have always needed to keep their existing customers happy, and most reasonably attentive organisations can manage gradual change in the demands of those customers. However, in a climate of greater change and competition, an organisation needs to look for other products and services which it can offer customers to meet the customers’ full requirements more closely. And in a world of digital disruption, companies need to stay alert to unexpected developments outside their normal field of business, which may completely disrupt the existing marketplace.I personally found the author’s analysis particularly helpful. As I was reading, the book gave me several ideas which could be applied in my own business context, particularly with regard to collaborating with customers in developing innovations. I have read several books on innovation recently, and this is one of the best.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFBYKNWMQ7P5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749471646#wasThisHelpful","RFBYKNWMQ7P5R","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Intel’s greatest strength has been its willingness to take huge risks, even betting the company, according to Michael Malone in this book. On the occasions when those bets have failed, the company has clawed its way back into the game through superhuman effort and will,... and then immediately gone on to take yet more risks.The story starts in September 1957 when the “Traitorous Eight” employees of Shockley Transistor left to form their own company, which became Fairchild Semiconductor. When Fairchild started falling apart a decade later, two of its key scientists and leaders, Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, decided to start a new business, and Andy Grove joined them as their first employee at Intel. The book goes on to describe Intel’s ups and downs over the ensuing 45 years.Gordon Moore had first observed in 1965 that the complexity of integrated circuits was doubling every year, and in the 1970s the doubling of computer chip performance every two years became known as Moore’s Law. Intel Corporation, as the keeper of Moore’s Law, proceeded over the next several decades to innovate at the required rate, using a combination of science and business cunning to stay ahead of its competitors.It is a well-crafted story, although perhaps a bit longer than necessary. Intel seems to have “come roaring out” or “come roaring back” after downturns quite a few times, and the traits of some characters get repeated a bit. I have no personal knowledge of the key individuals, but can’t help suspecting that they have been a little bit stereotyped. For example, I suspect that Andy Grove’s attitude towards Bob Noyce was more nuanced than the animosity portrayed by the author.Notwithstanding these minor issues, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Intel Corporation has had a profound effect not only on the field of electronics but on the world as a whole. It has been one of the key players in the digital revolution, and there is a great deal to learn from the manner in which the company has been run, and its successes and failures over the years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R235PU9GOL7J49/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G2A7WL2#wasThisHelpful","R235PU9GOL7J49","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can listen to strategic advice for leading virtual teams such as “build a culture of trust” or “encourage social interactions among your team” all day long; but if you don’t get specific tactical steps that you can implement straight away, those strategies won’t be of much help, according to Hassan Osman in this book. Hence the author provides a range of tactics, rather than strategies.So, what kind of ideas for working with virtual teams does the author recommend? These include:• Always set deadlines which are reasonable and 100% clear-cut• Assign the responsibility for tasks to specific individuals, using direct language• To increase trust in your team, you need to increase the level of reliability and the level of likeability• Effective emails are short and concise, with your calls to action highlighted• Virtual meetings can work only if there is a designated leader• During a virtual meeting the tone of your voice is important: it needs to convey energy and confidenceThis is quite a short ebook, and it does not cover the whole field of what you need to do to make virtual teams work effectively.

"Too often, leadership is a Faustian bargain. Most leadership experts play off your ego. Few actually help shape your ego, which must be neither too large nor too small in order to manage effectively and to get out with your soul intact, according to Rob Ashgar in this book. The book aims to help the reader find the right balance for his or her own life.The author goes on to discuss a number of topics which leaders are often reluctant to consider, including:• How you can be unaware of your own flaws when they are obvious to the people around you;• The strong temptation to try to keep other people happy instead of achieving the organisation’s goals;• The problems that arise when you pursue the organisation’s goals and your own agenda without adequately considering the feelings of others;• Having the courage to recognise when it might be better for someone else to be the manager;• The perils of being driven by a need to win approval;• How to help others shine, rather than needing to take all the glory for yourself;• Avoiding addiction to the power and status that come with leadership.There is a great deal of wisdom in the somewhat uncomfortable reading provided by the author. It is usually only some time after a person assumes a position of leadership that he or she discovers that successful leadership is as much about self-leadership as it is about leading others. This book is a helpful resource for thinking through the self-leadership issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FG2GMJTL682/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K58L6F0#wasThisHelpful","R34FG2GMJTL682","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last century the communications environment was typified by hierarchy, information control, broadcast and audience passivity. In the current century, communications are characterised by interconnectedness, speed, transparency, surveillance, and diversity, according to David Cowan in this book. The book aims to provide advice on internal corporate communications in the new information space.While communications are faster and cheaper than ever before, there are also more pitfalls to negotiate. In order to help readers navigate through the complexities of internal communication, the author provides a tool called the “dialogue box”. The dialogue box contains four quadrants: intelligence, emotion, narrative and interpretation. All of these should be taken into account in devising a communication.An interesting claim made by the author is that “corporate culture does not exist”: employees are a collection of individuals engaged in a range of cultures and subcultures, and that explains why internal communication is a difficult and frustrating task. While I agree with the proposition that employees have different personalities, ethnic backgrounds, political beliefs etc., I am not sure that this negates the concept of corporate culture. Every organisation tends to have behavioural norms that grow over time and make that organisation different from other organisations.For a book relating to communications, I found some of the author’s sentences to be a bit more complex than expected. Nonetheless, the book contains plenty of helpful insight for anyone who has responsibility for internal corporate communications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16C12Z6T1IDPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749470119#wasThisHelpful","R16C12Z6T1IDPK","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By changing what decisions are made in the business model, when they are made, who makes them, and why they are made, you will be able to come up with business models that better manage information and incentive risks and, as a result, outperform existing business models, disrupt established ways of doing business, and lead to a sustainable competitive advantage, according to Karan Girotra and Serguei Netessine in this book.Traditionally, in order to find significant new growth in a business it has been necessary to come up with a breakthrough product or process innovation. But those sorts of innovations are difficult to invent and there is a lot of uncertainty involved in commercialisation. According to the authors, it is possible to produce significant new growth while delivering existing products based on existing technologies to existing markets, by innovating with respect to the business model.How exactly do you go about innovating with a business model? The authors suggest that you can innovate with any of these factors:• What: For example, Zipcar changed the car rental business model by offering hourly rentals rather than daily.• When: For example, Zara changed the fashion clothing model by leaving the clothing design step until a few weeks before sale, rather than many months.• Who: For example, in the early days Amazon arranged for its suppliers to fulfil customer orders, whereas now Amazon is in the order fulfilment business.• Why: For example, in 2004 the US Department of Defence adopted performance-based contracting so that contractors were paid for the time jet engines were working rather than for the time they were being repaired.I found this to be the type of book which prompts the reader to think about many new possibilities for his or her own business situation. In my opinion the book, and particularly the business model innovation matrix which it provides, is likely to be a very useful resource for any business strategist.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9L01S6A2Z7W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1422191532#wasThisHelpful","RG9L01S6A2Z7W","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When you are facing a future that cannot be predicted with any accuracy, traditional approaches for problem solving (e.g., forecasting, planning, in-depth research) don't help you much. You need to acknowledge that and find alternatives, according to Charles Kiefer, Leonard Schlesinger and Paul Brown in this book.For the majority of people who are not natural entrepreneurs, the thought of an unpredictable future in which carefully laid plans and investments might be wasted is not a comfortable one. The authors say that essentially everyone will be facing this dilemma, other than skilled tradesmen, people who can live with how their profession is evolving, and people who can coast safely into the sunset.What is the best way to go about surfing on a sea of uncertainty? According to the authors, we need to copy the typical steps of a successful entrepreneur in what they call the ALBR process:• Act: Work out what you want to do, and act by quickly taking a small step towards your goal using whatever means you have at hand.• Learn: After taking the small step, stop to see what you have learned.• Build: Use what you have learned as a foundation for your next steps.• Repeat: Keep following these steps until you are happy with the result or you decide you don’t want or can’t afford to continue.I suspect that a typical non-entrepreneur who reads the book won’t take a lot of comfort in the ALBR formula. The authors are obviously a lot more comfortable with uncertainty than the typical non-entrepreneur. The book still doesn’t tell you where you should go or where safety can be found, because there is very little safety in a rapidly changing business environment. But if your ship is sinking you are much more likely to survive if you are generating options for action rather than living in denial.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BRV7NN487VEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HSUWM74#wasThisHelpful","R2BRV7NN487VEF","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leadership requires crafting an agenda, working in a deeply political world and working closely with other people. Schools do not teach this. Business school fails dismally to teach this, and most corporate training swings wildly between technical training (accounting and systems) and tree hugging, raft building and team building on the other side, according to Jo Owen in this book.The book aims to provide a framework for observing and learning from leadership experiences, by briefly describing a large number of different leadership skills. The skills are grouped into mindset skills, career skills, people skills, moment of truth skills, daily skills, organization skills, and values and behaviours.While reading the book it seemed to me as if the author had overlooked a number of important leadership skills, but after making my own list and re-reading the book I am satisfied that the book does cover almost every skill I could think of, although not in the terms I would have used. The author’s forthright and sometimes Machiavellian advice includes:• “The received wisdom about (the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) is that there is no ‘bad’ category. This is a fiction used by facilitators who want an easy time with the groups they lead.”• “Managers use numbers the way drunks use lamp posts: for support, not illumination.”• “(To motivate people) try to figure out how to appeal to fear, greed and idleness.”• “An effective leader needs to be unreasonable, selectively. In setting expectations the leader learns to be selectively deaf: you will not hear all the excuses about rising input costs, increasing competition and demanding customers.”I found the book entertaining to read, but I am still uncertain how valuable it is within the context of leadership development. It provides a useful checklist of skills, but the few pages devoted to each skill are insufficient to give a full understanding. As the author says, leaders learn from experience, not from courses. Perhaps the book helps you to recognise a mistake once you have made it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUXHT81AMLVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KJ2ZG62#wasThisHelpful","R3PUXHT81AMLVG","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you are starting out in professional life or have been part of it for some time, you have a boss and a responsibility to manage him of her like the other resources for which you’re responsible, according to William Smullen in this book. The author has had 50 years of experience in managing others, most notably as chief of staff to former US Secretary of State Colin Powell.Managing Up means different things to different people. In most work environments it means working out how to overcome the weaknesses and over-sized egos of people who hold senior positions in the organization in order to get things done. It is usually about trade-offs, politics, persuasion, and ensuring that credit gets appropriately misallocated. However, this book is about a different type of “managing up”. It is about how to be an executive assistant and maximize your contribution to the success of a boss whom you admire and believe in.Indeed, the first chapter is entitled “Believe in Your Boss or Find Another”. The difficulty with this advice is that it really is a rare thing to find a great boss. Moreover, the vast majority of jobs are not chief-of-staff or executive assistant type jobs in which the primary job responsibility is to help the boss. In most jobs the primary responsibility is to serve customers or perform tasks, and keeping the boss happy is only a small part of the job.Nevertheless, the author’s advice will be useful to anyone who has a boss who needs to be kept happy. Key pieces of advice include:• Don’t hesitate to tell the boss he or she is wrong• Anticipate what the boss wants or needs• Never allow your boss to be surprised• Bullying is bad for business• It’s the deed, not the credit","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YTQFBYWDNHST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU8BFAI#wasThisHelpful","R2YTQFBYWDNHST","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living within and loving God’s church requires an experience with God and his amazing grace, but it also requires an intentional decision to forgive and love people who are less than loveable, according to Rob Bentz in this book. It demands faithfulness and commitment to God, but it also demands faithfulness and commitment to his people.Some of the wisdom contained in the book:• The fact that God would call out a special group of people to love, draw to himself, call his own, shower with unspeakable grace, and then entrust with special roles and responsibilities in his kingdom work is quite astonishing.• Without a clear recognition of God’s payment on behalf of his people, you and I will not see each other accurately. I won’t see you as God’s sees you—redeemed by the blood of his Son, Jesus.• The church that Jesus is building is an eclectic, intriguing, quirky, diverse mess of humanity. That’s God’s way.• Love is the one primary thing that God gave us to represent him. That’s why it’s nothing short of a tragedy when we do it so poorly.• Genuine biblical encouragement is among the most frequently undervalued and over-assumed experiences of the Christ followers’ journey.• Service is simply not about me, my happiness, my joy, my status, or my ability to cultivate a heartwarming story that I might one day tell others. At its core, service is about whom I am serving.• Unity is the result of a great deal of heart-wrenching, God-seeking, others-forgiving effort. Jesus calls us to this immense personal and corporate challenge.The church has become increasingly marginalized and seen as an irrelevant and outdated institution, even by followers of Jesus. The author makes a passionate defence of the church not as an idealized abstract idea but as the imperfect, complicated, difficult collection of people that it currently is. The book is reasonably short and interesting, but I am not sure how many readers will be willing to step up to the challenge of difficult unity when disposable relationships are so much easier.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VD7X7E2BBM0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KC4YHAS#wasThisHelpful","R2VD7X7E2BBM0H","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Leadership might not be the first thing you think of when you hear Billy Graham’s name, but his role as a leader of leaders has been central to his ministry. Billy Graham’s lifetime of vigorous leadership invites every leader to engage with the same spirit, to consider his example, and to dig, as he did, into the rich resources of leadership literature that resonate with biblical examples, according to Matt Woodley in this book.So what sorts of leadership lessons can we learn from Billy Graham? The author looks at five different aspects of leadership:• The character of a leader: Early in his ministry, Billy and his team created a written covenant, the Modesto Manifesto, detailing how they were going to deal with temptations.• The mission of an organization: Billy’s clear focus on his calling has led him to reject good opportunities which were not directly aligned with his mission.• The importance of teamwork: By finding the right chemistry, Billy led a team which stayed together for decades.• Common challenges faced by leaders: By offering his critics kindness rather than vengeance, Billy won some powerful allies.• How faith in God has shaped Billy’s life as a leader: Humble openness made Billy a lifelong learner on the Christian journey.There is something awkward about books which lionize individual Christians, and I was also slightly uncomfortable about the way the book speaks of Billy Graham in the past tense rather than the present. Nonetheless, the book is filled with many interesting stories from Billy’s life, and there is a great deal of wisdom to be learnt from his experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BBGWU95922FO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HUEU01S#wasThisHelpful","R1BBGWU95922FO","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For most people the Epicurean view, that God is a long way away and stays out of touch, is reality, according to Tom Wright in this book. The Epicurean worldview, which sees the divine as being entirely separate from the practicalities of everyday life, such that God and the world don’t mix, has been enshrined in the American Constitution with the separation of church and state. Unsurprisingly Christians sound unconvincing when they submit to the presupposition that God does not intervene in everyday life.Even more insidiously, Christians are often firm believers in the American dream that if you get up and go you will succeed, and the fittest will survive the economic jungle. There is a gut-level reaction against any kind of health-care proposal: after all, if these folks were fit to survive, they’d be out there earning a living! The unexamined presupposition behind this is simply social Darwinism. The great irony is that often those who are most opposed to Darwin when it comes to reading Genesis 1 are in fact most deeply in thrall to him, or to the wider application of his theories, when it comes to social and international policy.The book contains a number of interesting and challenging essays, each providing extensive scriptural support for a position that many will find controversial. People who are of a more conservative bent are unlikely to appreciate the book, and many readers will find some of the arguments a bit heavy going. However, people who like to have their preconceptions challenged – or who like to challenge the views of others – will thoroughly enjoy the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36Y3GFUDC36F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ34XZQ#wasThisHelpful","R36Y3GFUDC36F9","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why do you go to work every day, and why travel somewhere at all? Is it necessarily the best place to perform the tasks your organization requires of you? What is the best way to design a workplace? How can flexible and work-from-home arrangements be effective for an organization? These and many similar questions are addressed by Guy Clapperton and Philip Vanhoutte in this book.The authors discuss in some detail the differing needs for work space zones for focused individual work, group discussions and presentations, contemplation, and face-to-face communication. Acoustic design is a very important although frequently neglected consideration. There are many work space types to choose from, including quiet rooms, quiet areas, collaboration areas, social hubs, inspiring spaces, neutral ground, transition spaces, and home or hotel rooms.Although some organizations have adopted a virtual model of working, some form of physical workspace is, in the opinion of the authors, crucial for most businesses. Home-working has been made increasingly possible by broadband networks and technology, but technology alone is not sufficient to enable an effective virtual organization; some complex human re-engineering is also required.Most managers would prefer to leave issues of workplace design to architects, and get on with running their businesses. However, management is about managing people, and workplace design, particularly in the context of telecommuting and flexible work arrangements, is increasingly a key people issue. In my view this book, although it is not as neatly structured as I would have liked, is a very useful resource.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33MBZHQ8XNFXK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1908693177#wasThisHelpful","R33MBZHQ8XNFXK","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It turns out that becoming a leader and doing something amazing with your life hinge on what makes you different, not what makes you the same as everyone else, according to Sylvia Hewlett in this book. Executive presence is a measure of image rather than performance; it is the manner in which you signal to others that you “have what it takes” to be star material.So, what is it that coworkers and bosses look for when they evaluate an employee’s executive presence? The author and her research team at the Center for Talent Innovation used a survey and focus groups to discover the answer, and they found that executive presence rests on three pillars:• How you act (gravitas)• How you speak (communication)• How you look (appearance)Of these three ingredients, gravitas is said by senior leaders to be by far the most important, followed by communication and then by appearance. However, appearance and communication tend to be significant factors in assessing a person’s gravitas. Projecting confidence, displaying “grace under fire”, tone of voice, body language and eye contact are all important ingredients of gravitas.A tall, well-built, white male has an unfair advantage in establishing gravitas when compared with women, people who are overweight, people of other ethnicities, and members of other minority groups. Much of the book is taken up in discussing how these cultural prejudices can be overcome. The author is of the view that the best results are achieved by accentuating the strengths that make you different from the white alpha male, rather than by trying to pretend to be a white alpha male.This book is useful for anyone who feels that they would like to enhance their executive presence, but it is also useful for managers and leaders who need to have their preconceptions challenged so that their workplaces can experience the benefits of greater diversity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11A93HEI3HJ3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062246895#wasThisHelpful","R11A93HEI3HJ3V","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The idea that the more power one individual leader wields, the more we should be impressed by that leader is an illusion. Where corners are cut because one leader is sure he knows best, problems follow, and they can be on a disastrous scale, according to Archie Brown in this book. The book examines the leadership styles of a large range of political leaders including dictators and democratic leaders.The author’s essential thesis is that it is unhelpful to rate political leaders on a single strong-weak scale given that there are so many different dimensions to effective leadership, and indeed leaders who are unconstrained by others in making their decisions tend to make significantly poorer decisions. Mao Zedong was a better leader in the early days of the Chinese Communist Party than when he acquired a position of absolute power. Tony Blair made his poorest decisions when he made them without adequate discussion with others.The book tells interesting stories about a very large number of political leaders from the past century. The author has a great deal of personal knowledge of many of those leaders, and the book is an excellent history book. However, it is hard to read the book without observing that the best leaders are rarely the ones who float to the top of the political process, whether in democracies or in dictatorships. The author has provided extensive material to demonstrate the dangers of the “strong” political leader, but the stories do not coalesce into a neat description of the characteristics of a “good” political leader.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQVBTDGTN8I5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GL9TP1Y#wasThisHelpful","R2TQVBTDGTN8I5","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even well-thought-out incentives lose effectiveness over time, and traditional practices of rewards programs often feel mechanical, manipulative and bureaucratic, according to George Langelett in this book. Employees are influenced by emotions as well as logic in their decision-making, so managers need to develop their empathy skills to help employees make sound decisions and to influence long-term motivation.So how do you go about developing your empathy skills? According to the author, you need to practise intersubjective experiences, which are occasions on which two people share the same emotional response to an event. The five steps to a manager sharing an intersubjective experience with an employee are:• Comprehend the employee’s experience• Respond with empathy, understanding and acceptance• Investigate the causes of the event• Respond again with empathy, understanding and acceptance• Co-create new meaning to the incident and find resolutionThis process enables the manager to assist the employee into a well-considered response to a crisis event, and it enables a manager to confront inappropriate attitudes or actions in an emotionally safe manner. The author provides numerous empathetic responses which managers can make in response to various different employee emotions. After learning and practising these responses, managers can be ready for any situation with an appropriate response.This is a short and very interesting book, well worth the read for anyone who has managerial or supervisory responsibilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEDX9QQSJVS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938416732#wasThisHelpful","RDEDX9QQSJVS6","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have the wrong brain and the wrong education to get people decisions right, according to Claudio Fernández-Aráoz in this book. We distrust people who are not similar to us, but to succeed in a globally minded environment we need to surround ourselves with people who have diverse backgrounds and complementary skills. And the vast majority of managers have not received proper training on assessing others and helping them reach their highest potential.To complicate matters, we tend to assume that the difference in productivity between employees is normally distributed, so that the difference between an above-average performer and a below-average performer is not that much. However, in skilled occupations such as software development the productivity difference between a standout programmer and an average programmer can be as much as 1,200 percent. It really is important to try to recruit the star performers.So, what are some of the key things you need to do when interviewing a job candidate?• Carefully check for self-awareness and humility• Reduce the social pressure for overly positive self-assessments• Give the candidate a realistic idea of the required skills and behaviours and the expected challenges• Tell the candidate to discuss the potential role and his or her readiness for it with close friends and colleagues• Conduct smart reference checksThe book is filled with wisdom on topics associated with personnel recruitment including how many candidates you should interview, the benefits and pitfalls of using consultants, how to ensure that new hires fit into your organisation, how to support their integration, how to deal with compensation, and how to create teams that thrive.This is an outstanding book, entertaining and informative in equal parts. I highly recommend it to anyone who is responsible for personnel decisions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MCP84DHK5IM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IHGQVWA#wasThisHelpful","R3MCP84DHK5IM8","A13Q1R1HIBPG6D","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13Q1R1HIBPG6D?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because I was given a discount on these in exchange for an honest review...I wasn't expecting much from these as I had never heard of the brand before and the price is very low.  But, compared to other headphones I have tested in this price range I now realize these are much better than the others I have tested.They have a nice carrying case that zips shut.  Nothing about the case or the headphones feels cheap.  Everything feels really well made and solid.  Sometimes the cheap ones feel so flimsy you worry that if you even look at them wrong they will break.  Not, these.  They feel extremely sturdy.  They fit tight on my ears and don't let sound out or in.  The cord is a nice braided type which should be less likely to tangle.  Basically the whole overall build quality is just incredibly impressive to me for the price (as of the time of this review).Now let's get to the sound.  I expected cheap sound with no low frequencies at all.  So, I'm not into rap, but to test this I listened to a rap song.  Now I don't have any expensive $200 headphones to compare these to, as I only use ear buds normally... but wow... they actually boomed the bass out! I was floored, I didn't expect to hear any low frequencies on these.  The overall sound quality for this price range is amazing.  This is no high end $200 headphone, but wow... much better than I expected!The Microphone is handy for accepting calls and the sound quality seems good with the limited testing I did.  There is a button you can use to mute the call, or hold it down to hang up.  I tested it and the button worked great.Really the only thing I would like added to this is a volume button so I can control the volume from the headphone unit that dangles from the cord.  That isn't a deal breaker though as I can adjust the volume on my phone or computer. It would just be nice.I'm actually so happy with this I'm going to give them as a gift and I wouldn't do that if they weren't good.  I wish I could keep them for myself but xmas is coming.  You can't go wrong with these as long as they stay in the low price range.  They are really nice for a budget headphone!PS.  I decided not to take a pic of these as so many people have already done so, I don't feel like my pics would add anything to what is already out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GQEYF5S19PBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014LMQKWE#wasThisHelpful","R3GQEYF5S19PBE","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As of the time of this review, the price is very reasonable for what you get.  Not only do you get the hammock itself, but you also get a matching bag for carrying it around.  This is a soft and comfortable material which I like.  This is not a real heavy duty fabric type that you would want to keep up in your yard year around.  But, the material is plenty strong for the price range and more than strong enough to hold me.  I find this hammock most useful for taking to the park and hooking up between trees for an outing.  It is very portable with the included bag.  I also have a bag of portable hammock straps, so I can easily and quickly hook this up to a tree in a park without damaging the tree or dealing with ropes and knots.

"I feel 'inflamed' pretty much all the time and have terrible brain fog.  I've been tested for allergies and try to reduce those things but still have problems.  So, I knew something else must be going on.  I was researching brain fog and stumbled across information regarding histamine intolerance.  These DAO pills seem to help me, but they are spendy if you take them with every meal.So, I decided to try something else.  I found for me I can mask the symptoms by using the right antihistamine.  Most make me drowsy and don't work for me as a result.  But I have had good luck with generic over the counter Fexofenadine.  I have decided instead of using DAO... to save money, I'll just use Fexofenadine.  That antihistamine doesn't make me drowsy and solves my brain fog problem.  I take them in the morning as they can amp me up a bit. I get 120 tablets (1 a day) for around $35. So, this is a very cheap work around compared to DAO.  This work around may not work for all of you, but it does work for me so I thought I'd share it with you in case it helps at least a few of you.So, in my opinion is that this DAO is a good product and will help many of you with histamine intolerance as it did me. But, if you don't feel that you can afford these pills long term, you could try playing around with Fexofenadine to see if that helps you as well.  Good luck with your journey to good health and feeling better!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPDJ2IDJAEB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006FV62YG#wasThisHelpful","RHPDJ2IDJAEB9","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is way nicer than I expected.  It feels really heavy and substantial.  I like that the knob on the back is metal.  I have had some in the past that were plastic and they invariably break off with time if they are only made from plastic.  The grip is comfortable and not slippery.  It also has a clip like most do so you can force the handle to always stay on.The spray pattern gives a wide variety of settings from a powerful stream, all the way to a nice mist for watering starts.  My wife picked this up and said ""Oh, my this is really nice and well made"", with no prompting from me which was a nice surprise.

"The things I like about these are that they are foldable and have a braided type cord which should make the cord last longer and be less likely to tangle. I also like that it has a mute button and mic. They also seem to made fairly well for a budget pair of headphones.In terms of sound quality the volume goes plenty high.  And I don't hear any hissing which is good.  The high sounds and mid sounds sound ok, but the lows are a bit disappointing.  Don't get these if you like your bass to boom.I also wish they fit tighter together so they would cup my ears tighter.  I feel like the seal isn't good and a lot of environmental sound can still get through.But, if you are looking for a budget pair of headphones that won't break the bank and are of reasonable quality for the price range these ones are definitely worth considering.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROX5J00O264O8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DEGAIM#wasThisHelpful","ROX5J00O264O8","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me point out that all of my testing was done on an Android phone, and I only used bluetooth.  Perhaps things might work differently is you set yours up differently or are using a different type of phone.  But, for me I want it to work exclusively on bluetooth and I need to have it work on my Android phone.If you just want to use this for listening to music it is great.  I first tested this by pairing it and then making sure the fm station on my car was the same as the one I had set on the device.  The music from my phone sounded good with the bluetooth paired and I didn't have any issues.  You just have to adjust the volume on your stereo and on your phone/or on this device.  The sounds was rich and I could crank it up loud enough so I could hear the music great.I also tested the charging ports and they seemed to be able to charge my phone without a problem.But, the main thing I want to use this for is hands free bluetooth calls and it didn't work right for me.  To test this I called my work voicemail several times.  My welcome message on my voicemail played great through the speakers of my car, just like the music did.  I then recorded my voicemail that was several sentences long just as a test.  And I hung up.  I thought everything worked great, but then I went in and listened to the voicemail that was recorded and it cut in and out so much that I couldn't hear the voicemail at all.  I could only hear a fraction of a word or two out of the several sentences that I recorded.  I figured that must be a fluke, so I tried rebooting my phone and unplugging the device and trying it again.  Second time same result, it was impossible to properly hear the audio that was generated from this device.I give this two stars because if all you want to do is listen to music via bluetooth in an old car that doesn't have bluetooth.  Or if you want to charge your phone it works great.  But the main thing I wanted to use it for was bluetooth hands free calling in my car that has no bluetooth capabilities.  That however was a big bummer as it didn't work without cutting out terribly.  Perhaps I got a bad device with a bad microphone, so maybe you will get lucky.  All I know is my unit didn't work properly, at least not with my phone.Luckily I got this unit free in exchange for a fair and honest review.  So, I didn't spend any money on this.  But, if you are thinking about buying this I'd recommend waiting until more reviews come in to see if other people are experiencing the same problem I did.  I'm bummed out, I really wanted this one to work.  If only the microphone worked properly it would have been the perfect device.EDIT: 11/6/15 The company sent me a replacement unit, but it does the same thing.  I did finally realize though that I could get the microphone to pickup my voice if I moved my head about 2 inches from the unit.  Then it would pick up my voice just fine on the phone call.  But as soon as I move back to sit in my car seat normally it can't pickup my voice.  Of course I can't drive with my head two inches from this unit as I couldn't see the road.  So, this unit simply doesn't work properly for hands free calls, but does play music great!  I'm not sure why other people claimed it worked unless they didn't test all of the features, and perhaps didn't actually try to talk to someone with the device hands free through bluetooth.  Two units definitely have microphone problems, it just doesn't pick up sound properly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11N7N1YAOGE32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012N3C6OY#wasThisHelpful","R11N7N1YAOGE32","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice brush.  The thing I like the most about it, would be how it has a curved head.  Makes sense, I don't know why they don't make all brushes that way.  But, anyhow I gave it to my daughter and she loves it.  The bristles are set pretty far apart so it works great for people with alot of hair.  The quality seems fine to me, it feels plenty sturdy and I'd expect her to get many years of use out of it.  I didn't take any pics of it because many reviewers already uploaded pics of it, and really... how many pics of a hair brush does one need?:)  I was given this brush in exchange for a fair and honest reviews, but that did not affect my review.

"I had not heard of this brand of watch before so I wasn't too sure how well I would like it.  But, once it came I was quite impressed with the quality.  It comes with a nice gift box and gift bag.  The watch band is genuine leather and seems to be slightly padded which makes it more comfortable.  The watch also claims to be water resistant but I did not test that claim.In terms of looks, it looks very nice and well made.  It isn't too flashy, but isn't too plain either.  It also displays the day of the week and the date which is a nice bonus.The only thing I wish was that it had some numbers on the dial, but that is only my personal preference.  Some people don't want numbers, as a watch usually looks more dressy without the numbers.I have only had it a day, but so far it seems to keep time well.  I'll come back and edit this post if I have problems with it keeping time.  If you don't see a new edit on here then that means it is still keeping time satisfactorily.At the current posted 'sale price' at the time of this review...

"These are different than the standard white or black kitchen bags I normally purchase in the store.  They aren't that stretchy type of plastic.  This type of plastic has less stretch to it, but that is just fine for my use.  They actually remind me of the types of liners that I used to be given by my bosses back in the day when I used to do janitorial work.  They appear very thin, yet are surprisingly strong.  I really like these so far and they fit my kitchen trash can great.  Really the only thing I don't like is that they don't have a drawstring, but that is because these are more of a liner and less of a traditional kitchen drawstring bag.  I can tie the top, so not having a drawstring isn't a deal breaker for me.I was given a discount on these bags in exchange for a fair and honest review.  But, that did not affect my review in any way.  Since I was given a discount my review is only of the bags themselves not regarding the price.  You will want to look at the cost per bag yourself to determine if you think these are a good deal for you or not.

"We walk the dogs or run often in the early mornings when it is pitch dark.  We have various reflective jackets etc, but the problem is we don't have reflective gear for every weather condition.  For example we each have a nice bright yellow, reflective jacket.  But, it isn't really rain proof, and it isn't warm enough when winter comes.  The thing I like about having a belt is that you can put it over any jacket, coat, shirt etc.  So, this ends up being much cheaper than buying reflective gear for any weather situation.In terms of the quality I couldn't be happier.  This is really wide, and the buckle is incredibly large and heavy duty.  The material is nice an stretchy, and it is easy to adjust how tight you want it.

"This is my first insulated mug and so far I am quite happy!  I'm not a fan of the saying on the side but that is just a personal preference and that doesn't detract from it's usefulness.  It's not too shiny of a black paint, so it isn't too slippery which is nice.  It also fits great in my standard size car cup holders.  Some people may prefer one with a handle, but I prefer to not have a handle... but that's just my personal preference.The lid screws on tight and doesn't leak which is of course very important.  It also has a white filter so that ice doesn't hit your teeth, but I also like to use that when drinking coffee out of it as I think that makes it less likely I will spill on myself.  It is nice because hot or cold liquids don't hurt your hand since it is insulated.I definitely like that this isn't a plastic thermos, it is stainless steel on the inside.

"Being a college IT instructor I have to keep my flash drive with me at all times at work.  So, I keep my flash drive on a lanyard.  These lanyards are better than my old lanyard for a couple of reasons.  First I like that you can attach both a flash drive and an ID badge to it since it has a clip for each.  The small black loop is for looping into the flash drive and the metal clip is for attaching keys or badges.  Second I like that you can use the black plastic buckle to remove the flash drive to use without having to take the entire lanyard off of your neck if you don't want to.I have not tested this with heavy keys because I only need a flash drive and an ID badge on my lanyard.  Some people complained these weren't strong enough, but they are as strong or stronger than my old lanyard, so I am happy so far for my needs.Really my only complaint so far is that these lanyards are longer than my old lanyard so they hit down at my belt buckle which is a bit low for my preference.

"This is a well made flash light.  It has the CREE LED bulb which I have read is one of the best manufacturer's of LED bulbs.  So, that is a big bonus.  It may not be the latest model of CREE bulbs but it is still plenty bright for the money.  I have no way to know if the stated brightness of 900 lumens is correct or not.  But, I can say from comparing this with other flashlights that I own makes me believe that this likely does produce around 900 lumens.  I included a pic in the bathroom with all other lights off, it was pitch black in there and you can see how well the flashlight illuminates that room.I have another Outlite flash light, it is really good too and has a slightly bigger head for dispersing the light.  But, this one still manages to disperse the light well.  It does not however have a user adjustable beam from what I could tell.  The advantage to this model is that it comes with a second rechargeable battery.  So, you can leave one on the charger and one in the flashlight and always be prepared.  To, me that is a big advantage.It also claims to be water resistant which is important if it's raining.  But, I don't believe it is designed to be submerged.  This also has different modes, for high, low, strobe, and SOS.I have had some LED flashlights in the past that were made pretty lightweight and felt shoddy.  With time they would short out and the light would come off and on from the vibrations as you walked.  I haven't had this very long yet, but this one feels solid, with tight connections and no hint yet of future problems.  I'll come back and edit my post if it starts to act up, but if you don't see any edits then it is still working well for me.I did receive a discount on this light in exchange for a fair and honest review.

"I uploaded not only product pics, but a pic in our bathroom with it completely pitch black and only the flashlight on.  You can see this does a great job of lighting the bathroom.  I have no way of knowing if it meets the 900 Lumen claim, but I feel like the brightness seems about right compared to my other flashlights.  This does have a CREE LED bulb which I understand is one of the best manufacturer's out there for the bulbs.One of the things I really like about this is that it has a wide head.  So, not only do you get a very bright center beam, but the light reflects out nicely.Please note however that the beam can not be focused yourself, but I feel like this is set at a pretty good focus so that isn't a huge down side in my book.  It would be nice though if it had that feature.  However, at the current time of this review the sale price is so good on this it is still an excellent deal even if it doesn't have a user beam focus feature.This has multiple settings for strobe, etc which is a nice touch.This comes with a rechargeable Lithium Ion user removable battery.  You can use the included charger to charge the battery.  If the battery fails with age you can easily purchase a new one.I was given a discount on this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.  But, that did not affect my review or opinion.

"This thing feels very sturdy to me.  It has a nice rubber coating that should help protect it if dropped.  And of course being IPX6 certified it should also be dust proof and water resistant.  I didn't actually want to test that feature by pouring dust/water all over it, so I'll just take their word for it!One thing that I like about this is that if you are familiar with how to pair a bluetooth device with your phone or tablet this is incredibly easy to pair.  I didn't even crack the owners manual on this, it is very intuitive to control and to pair.In terms of the sound quality it is pretty good for the size of speaker it is.  The highs and mids sound good, of course you will not get any booming bass in this price range/size, but it still sounds good overall.  The volume goes up plenty high,  and I can hear it throughout my 1200sqft house without issue.  I thought I heard a mild hiss at first, but then I decided it was just the song that I was streaming, the next song sounded fine.The bluetooth is very reliable, it doesn't cut in or out and gives a solid music stream without interruption.

"This is constructed very well.  I was surprised by how heavy and dense this thing is!  It is clearly constructed to last, the stitching seemed solid as well.  I really like the feel of the fabric that is used, it feels soft, yet appears strong enough to last for quite some time as well.  I noticed on the label that the inside fill material is recycled material which is nice from an environmental stand point.  I assumed the large would work for our labs, but its a little tight for them.  Our labs are between 87-89 pounds.  So like the product description states, make sure to measure how your dog is currently sleeping.  Also notice that they state the inside and outside dimensions, with the inside ones being the most important for the size of your dog.This also makes a nice cat bed, it's a bit too tight for our labs... however our cat is happy to have it!Edit: I thought this cover couldn't be removed but I finally found the zippers.

"I like how this rolls up nicely and snaps together when it is not in use. It fits my lab pretty good, (I got the XL).  I wish it had a little more size adjustment built in to it but it works as you can do some adjustment with the velcro.  His problem is his hips, so I can put this towards his backend and help him out when he needs it.  I use it mainly to help him get into the car, he can get his front body in himself but not his back part.  So, this really helps to assist him in getting into the car.  Really the main con that I see, is it has a small velcro handle that you can use to wrap the two handles together.  But, it isn't sewn into one of the handles.  It is just left totally loose.

"This is nice and long which I prefer for walking our dogs.  Being made out of leather it feels more solid and strong than nylon type leashes.  The clasp seems plenty strong.  I also like that they use a rivet at the handle and clasp side.  Also the stitching seems plenty strong.  The only thing is that I'm spoiled by having a padded handle.  This one does not have a padded handle, but that isn't really a big deal for most people.  What is more important to me is that the leash is strong, will not break and that it is long enough.

"This case is not bad for an inexpensive waterproof case, but you do have to be a little careful. I tested it in a bowl of water with a papertowl in it so I could check for moisture. The first time I didn't quite have it clicked together perfectly so it leaked a bit. I then dried it off and tried again, this time resealing it better. And, I submerged in the bowl for about 10 minutes and things appeared dry inside afterwards. So, just be very, very careful that you have it properly clicked together and all of the ports closed properly. It would be easy to think you have everything snapped together properly only to find out your phone got wet. So, take plenty of time putting it on the phone.It's not very bulky for a waterproof case which is really nice. Using the buttons can be a little difficult, but that is the case with many water proof cases.My main complaint was it was really hard to take it apart after the test. Once I finally pried it open, if I had a phone in there instead of a paper towel it would have gone flying across the room. So, I knocked off a star for that. Be very careful getting the case off.It does do the job if you are careful getting your phone in and out of it. I was given a discount on this case in exchange for a fair and honest review. However, that did not influence my review. I have also attached a few photos for you as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DKPZ3UEW836E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014ZJMZY0#wasThisHelpful","R3DKPZ3UEW836E","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm pleasantly surprised with this charger.  It gives you 2.4amps per port.  I have been burned in the past with chargers that claim to be 2.4a but clearly aren't because they are painfully slow.  But, I can say that this one is as advertised.  On my phone if it is a true 2.4a charger I can gain battery when charging at the rate of about 1% per minute.  I tested this charger and I was getting that speed, so it appears to be as it claims.  I also tested my tablet and it charged quickly as well.  And, I individually tested each port and they all worked well.  One thing that I did not get a chance to test was actually trying to charge 3 high amp devices at once.  But, according to the literature it sounds like that shouldn't be a problem or slow it down.We all know some chargers can be very hollow and cheap feeling, but not this one.  This one feels very substantial and well made.  A nice touch is that the outside has a type of rubbery finish on it which makes it less likely to slip out of your hand when you are unplugging it.  The inside of the USB ports lights up as well, to tell you it has power and to make it easy to find the port in the dark, which is another very nice feature.  I did receive a discount on this product in exchange for a fair and honest review but that did not affect my review in any way.  I like this so much I'm going to give it to my mom for her bday, she is pretty picky.  So, if I feel like I can give it to her that means I'm really happy with it and can recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OPV1GO56UDEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WJDNA80#wasThisHelpful","R2OPV1GO56UDEI","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was skeptical that this would be made very well because the packaging on the box was kind of plain, and it isn't a big brand name.  But, once I took it out of the box I was pleasantly surprised.  I was able to easily figure out how to assemble it without having to read any directions, that is a huge plus in my book.  The other thing I noticed is that after you take apart the wingnut for placing it on the handlebars there are three notched settings so you can adjust it for really small or really large handle bars. I used the middle setting for my mountain bike.The clasp and rubber mesh makes it so that your phone does not vibrate excessively so if you are using the gps this will work well.

"This unit does function, so I gave it a few stars for that.  However, the sound is really low even though I turned up the sound all of the way on my radio and on my phone.  And, because I have to crank my stereo sound so high you get a lot of humming type noises.  Sometimes the blue tooth cuts in and out, so at times so the music occasionally cuts in and out.  To be honest, I think I'll just stick with using an audio aux cable instead of messing with bluetooth, the sound it much better that way if you have a good cord.I did receive a discount on this product in exchange for a fair and honest review, but that did not affect my review in any way.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4U43DLOYL31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013W42DQY#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4U43DLOYL31","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The thing I like about this cell phone vent holder is that it fits small round vents like the one in my pt cruiser without an issue.  The one for my wife's car, only works on long rectangular vents, where this one should really fit just about any vent type.  IT clamps on to the phone quite well and should fit most types of phones ok.Unfortunately, the reason it fits in any vent even a small round one is because it only attaches to one vent blade and doesn't have a lower supporting arm like my wife's holder does.  So, this means it is incredibly easy to clip on to most any type of vent, but it has less support.  So, when you hit bumps it will vibrate pretty bad.But, it may not be perfect however it does fit my small vents so I plan to continue to use it even though it vibrates a bit.  It is still way better than trying to use the gps with my phone sliding around in the seat next to me.  So, it isn't perfect but since it works with my type of vents I'm still happy enough with it to continue using it.  I was given a discount on this product in exchange for my fair and honest review, but that did not affect my review at all.  I have also included a few pictures so you can see how nicely it attaches to my cars vents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MAFV7GNCNZLV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0140KVZK4#wasThisHelpful","R3MAFV7GNCNZLV","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tested this on my Android based phone and it worked great.  I tested all three ports and all of the ports charged without issue on my phone.  It charged my phone pretty fast, I have a really nice wall charger that does rapid charge a bit faster than this one.  But, for the price I feel like this charges plenty fast.  It has an LED light to let you know it is receiving power from the cigarette lighter port in your car.  It does not feel cheap or flimsy.  One thing I did not test was how well it does with three separate items plugged into it at once.  It may or may not slow down the charge to accomplish that but I'm not sure as I don't have three devices to plug in and test it with.  I can say however that my one Android phone charged great with this.  I did receive a discount on this product in exchange for a fair and honest review, but that did not affect my review in any way.

"This case is of course a little larger than a standard case because it is waterproof.  But, that is to be expected I would say.  So, I would probably only recommend using this if you are hiking, or kayaking etc.  Then I would use a non waterproof case the rest of the time.  The case is easy to get the phone in and out of with the latching clips for the clam shell type design.  So, the main thing you are probably concerned with... will this keep my phone dry.  As you can see from the picture I took in a bowl of water, I actually tested in in water.  I left it in the bowl for 20 minutes.  Then I took it out and thoroughly dried the outside of it.  I opened it up expecting to find some dampness inside but I could find none. It was completely dry.  Since it passed my test, I give it 5 stars!

"This cable is built really nice.  I like how the braided cables don't tangle as bad and don't wear out as fast.  This braided one still manages to feel soft and pliable even though it is a braided one.  The aluminium connectors feel really solid if not premium.  I tested in on my good charger and it actually charged my phone a tad a faster compared to one cable I have that is rated for 2amp charges and is thicker.  So, this isn't a cheap cable that will slow down your charges, it actually sped mine up a tad.  The only minor complaint I have is it doesn't feel like the Micro usb port clicks in very good to my phone compared to my other premium cable.  However, I don't think I can fault this cable as all of my cables except one doesn't seem to fit very good in my phone.  So, I think there is something wrong with my phone's port.

"I needed a fast charger and this fits the bill.  First let me say that I payed full price for this item and did not get a discount on this in exchange for a review.  That wouldn't affect my review one way or another but some people question discounted reviews and sometimes I do those.  Anyhow, back to the product, the build quality on this is amazing.  It feels very well made, it has some heft to it and doesn't feel too light like some of the cheap ones.  My old generic USB charger was a piece of junk and slowed my charge time down considerably even though it claimed to be 2.4amp but there is no way it was.  This charger literally sped my charge time up so it was 2-3 times faster than the junky one I was using before.  Finally I didn't need 6 hours to charge my phone from 5% to 100%.  With this charger I can charge it at the rate of about 1% per minute give or take.  So, it takes approximately 95-120 minutes to fully charge my phone, that is so much more reasonable!  I also got a really nice 20w dual port charger in exchange for a review, and that one is very fast too, but it was only 20w and this is 24w, so this is about 13 minutes faster than that one for a full charge.I like how the LED light changes to let you know if it's doing a full charge or scaled back down to a trickle charge.  And I like how it has two ports that can charge simultaneously at full speed for both.  It is also pretty neat how it uses intelligence to tailor the charge to the kind of device and cable you have.There isn't much more I can say about this except just get it!  I'm going to get an additional one and give it to my daughter for xmas.  I made the mistake of giving her the same cheap generic one I had so she has the same slow charge problem I had until now.  This is a really fast and solid product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BJ3GGP3J8K1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012WMWPJW#wasThisHelpful","R7BJ3GGP3J8K1","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got the 500ml unit and am extremely happy with it so far. There are a lot of pros for this unit and not any major cons. I love that it holds more volume than many of the other ones do. I also really like the LED light and how it changes to different colors, it is relaxing and fun. But, of course if you don't want the light on you can turn it off. The other really cool feature is that it has a timer, so it can either be completely on or timed for one, three or six hours.The only minor issue I see is that the button on the right is for toggling between low mist or a higher mist. But, from what I could tell there was no light or indication as to whether you had it set to low or high. As I toggled through it I tried to look for a difference in the amount of mist coming out but it was hard to discern. I believe though that it first defaults to a low setting so if you press it just once it should take you to the high setting. But, an indication light would be a nice touch. That is not a major issue at all though, just a minor area that could be improved upon.I was given a discount on this unit in exchange for a fair and honest review, but that did not affect my review in any way.

"The dogs love them!  In fact I included a pic of one of my dogs guarding it from the other dog, even though the other dog had her own.  They are twisted nicely together and are nice and thick, which is great for our larger dogs.  I knocked off one star simply because they stink a bit.

"I wasn't sure how well I would like this until I got it.  Once I opened the box, I realized it was made well and didn't look cheap.  To me, when it comes to electronics... part of what draws me to a device is whether I can figure it out without reading the instructions.  This was simple to figure out, I plugged it into a usb port for awhile to charge it.  I noticed there was an option to set the time for time stamps of your recording files, but I don't care about that so I did not bother with setting the time on the device.  There is a physical switch that you simply slide to start recording, when you are done slide it back and it stops.  It doesn't get any easier than that.  Then the .wav file shows up on the flash drive under a folder.In terms of the audio quality I was impressed.  I walked 20 feet away in a room and it could still pick up my voice fine in normal conversation tones.  Of course it was even louder when I was closer but it works well in a room.  I'm a college instructor and wish my students would use a device like this to record my class discussions.  It is so simple to use and the sound quality is plenty good for covering a room.I couldn't find what speed of USB drive it was, so I assume it is USB 2 not USB 3.  But, it is compatible with USB 3 ports as well, you just won't get the USB 3 speed.  The speed was plenty fast either way though, the sound didn't stutter at all when I played it back.It currently doesn't list Windows 10 as a compatible OS.  However since it is just a Flash drive with recording capabilities it worked fine on my Windows 10 machine.  You will be able to see the recorded files just fine.  However, in Windows 10 my default music player was set as the Groove Music Player, so when I browsed to the file I recorded and double clicked it, that app said it wasn't compatible with the file type.  So, I used the Windows 10 search box and searched for the old Media Player program, and opened that.  Then I drag and dropped the file into the windows Media Player software and it started playing fine.  So, hopefully that helps a few of you if you have Windows 10.I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review of the product, but that did not influence my rating.

"As soon as these were delivered the dogs knew this box must be for them.  There was a lot of anticipation on their part as they could smell them!  I tried to take some photos, they may be a bit blurry as the dogs were quite frantic and moving pretty fast.  The manufacturer says these are very wholesome snacks and I would say they are right.  They appeared well made, and clearly the dogs loved them.  One of our dogs is very picky, there are many treats she will turn her nose to and walk away from without touching them.

"This is a nice case for the money.  What I really like about it is how it protects so much of the phone.  It feels like your phone is very protected with this case on your phone. It includes all of the pieces you need to put this together with the screen protector so you really are protected.  The only negative is that your home button is buried in there a bit, but that is an issue with most of these type of cases.  One major benefit to this case is that it is quite thin compared to some other cases.

"This my first bluetooth speaker, and so far I am very impressed.  I didn't know if it would be hard to pair, but it was incredibly easy in fact I didn't even need to read the included instructions.  I simply charged it up for several hours to be safe.  Then I turned it on and the bluetooth light was blinking.  I figured that meant it was in pairing mode.  I simply went into my Android phone settings for the bluetooth and scanned for new devices.  It showed up almost immediately, I clicked the button in my phone settings to connect, and the speaker played audio that said ""Connected"".  Couldn't have been any easier!It also comes with an audio cord so you can plug devices in manually, but I didn't test that as I only plan to use this as an bluetooth speaker not as a wired one.The sound is really good for such a small speaker.  It of course does not have booming bass, but the sound is much better than I expected and is quite rich sounding. It also can crank pretty loud for its size.  Currently I have it playing in a different room from which I am writing this review, and I can hear it great even though I do not have the volume turned up all of the way.  I can use this and hear it throughout our single story 1400 foot house without issue.In terms of the bluetooth signal strength this is really good.  I put the speaker in the center of the house and took my phone to the far corners of the house and it still kept playing the music.The case is made very well and doesn't feel cheap at all to me. All in all I am quite pleased with this speaker!This product was given to me in exchange for a fair and honest review.  I have included some extra pics for you to check out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18COXSOBIBDWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012S8QQ4K#wasThisHelpful","R18COXSOBIBDWL","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am really happy with the quality of this.  It fit in our 2010 Chevy Cobalt just fine since it has wide vents.  But, at first I couldn't get it to work because there are back left and right adjustable vents as well as the front up and down ones.  I had to adjust the back left and right ones to be centered so I could pop it in.  After I figured that out it fit great.  If you have round, or really small vents you might have issues.I'm impressed with how it is made.  It didn't feel cheap at all and held the wife's iphone 5s without issue.  But, it would also fit much bigger phones as there was much more play in the adjustment left.This unit is well made and if it fits your type of vent I highly recommend it.

"I was skeptical that this long cable would work properly and it did.  I measured the cable and it may have been a few inches short of 10ft but it was hard to tell because I couldn't pull it completely tight and measure it at the same time.  Either way it is at least very close to 10 ft, if not 10 ft.  And, the good news is that it actually works.  I tested it on the wife's Iphone 5s and it not only charged the phone properly without errors, but it also worked great for transferring her photos off of the phone.  There isn't much else to say except it is a nice long cable that actually works at a fraction of a cost compared to the name brand cable.I was given this product in exchange for a fair and partial review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC3NHK5FME1WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0149RWH2S#wasThisHelpful","RC3NHK5FME1WM","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having only used the smooth loop type wrenches I really like this type of tool instead.  It is easier to get a better grip I think on the filter.  Of course you do have to be careful to not press too much on the handles as you could dent, or tear the metal as you remove the old filter.  Normally that isn't a problem as it is the old one, but if you tear the metal too much it may be hard to remove.  If you use this with the correct amount of force it works great.  I like that it is adjustable with three different adjustments.  I have the 12 inch one which works great on my cobalt and cruiser.  If you have a large truck you may need the larger size.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z33HD3FWQO83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NPR33O#wasThisHelpful","R2Z33HD3FWQO83","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really wanted to like this because of it's extremely small size.  First off keep in mind if you get the 2500mAh like I have it will add some juice to your phone battery but likely won't be able to charge it completely to 100%.This system does work on my android phone and the wife's iphone(using the adapter).  My unit came with no directions and it isn't super obvious how it works out of the box.  The cable for charging the unit is pretty obvious at least.  I simply pressed the tabs on each side and pulled on the loop which pulled out the two cable ends to charge the unit.What I found more confusing was how to charge a phone without any instructions in the box.  I finally figured out to pull the blue cable out which at first I thought was just for decorations.  But, then I didn't know that the white part inside the unit was the adapter for lightning iphones.  It looked like it was part of the unit since it wouldn't move and was flush.  I had to read other reviews here on amazon to determine that adapter needed to come out.  But, mine was completely stuck inside of the unit.  I couldn't get it out.  Finally I had to use a small screw driver and pop the casing loose so the adapter would slide out.  I popped the case back together and tried putting the adapter back in/out and it got stuck again.So, the unit does work, but the case/adapter holder portion of it needs some work.  I have had to keep the adapter out of the unit so it doesn't get stuck in there again, but that probably means it will get lost.I was given this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WMNULK7PCH8S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQ0VHH8#wasThisHelpful","R1WMNULK7PCH8S","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are great cable management sleeves. I had only used velcro ties in the past which still showed a lot of unsightly cable.  This however is great, as it hides the cables much more thoroughly.  There is enough room inside of the sleeve to bundle up a very reasonable amount of cables.  Plus the Neoprene stretches a bit so you can really fill it up.

"It is so handy to have a longer cable.  But I often don't trust the longer ones as I have had some bad experiences in the past with longer ones.  So, I immediately tested this and not only did it charge the phone, but it also was able to transfer data without any issues.  So, I'm quite happy with this.

The included Carabiners are heavy duty and sturdy.  I also love that it comes with a bag and drawstring.  Everything fits nicely in the bag which will be really nice for camping.  In the past when camping it was rare that I could find trees that were the right distance apart for our hammock.

"I'm pretty happy with this lense kit so far. I've never had one before so this is my first and I can't compare it to other kits out there. I'll include some pics, but keep in mind I'm using a phone model which is notorious for having a terrible camera. So, don't judge the kit to harshly because of my phone camera.I had a little trouble figuring out how to remove the wide ange/macro lenses which is a two unit setup. I thought they were supposed to pull apart, but that didn't work. Then I realized they screw on, so I simply did ""lefty loosy"" then they came apart no problem. I removed my case and the various lenses clip on quite nicely.The pictures of my back yard without the bench are the fisheye vs non fisheye. I didn't have the lense centered quite right so there are some dark corners in the top. Also, my phone didn't autofocus well so it was a bit out of focus for that shot. Not a problem with the lense though, as my autofocus is terrible.The pictures of the yard with the bench are wide angle vs no wide angle.But, the one that really stood out to me was the Macro lense! I didn't hold out any hope with my bad phone camera. But, check out the flower, these are very small flowers but you wouldn't know it from the pic! You can see the drops of dew on it and everything. This would not have been possible at all without the macro lense. My camera is terrible about taking close up shots of things, this lense will be a life saver for that!Anyhow, here are the pics for you to check out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20NB8KV5412ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CXK9FQ#wasThisHelpful","R20NB8KV5412ZF","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The leash is well made.  The clasp is strong, the material feels strong as well.  The main handle is padded and very comfortable.  The second handle is not padded but that is good so it isn't too bulky/heavy down there when the lower handle is not in use.  Let me get to the nitty gritty as to why this is way better than my other two handle leash.  We have another two handle leash, but the lower second handle comes out much further from the leash on our other leash.  Which means that when you aren't using that second handle the dog often trips on it since we use a front harness.  However, with this leash it is sewed up much tighter to the main leash, so when you aren't using it the handle pretty much just becomes part of the leash with no danger of the dog tripping.One problem with all of these two handle leashes though is that if you use it with a front harness, the handle will be pretty low and more difficult to grab.  It would be cool is someone would make one someday specifically designed for front harnesses that is further up the leash.  But, that is not an issue for most people as most people use collars or standard harnesses.  We only use front harnesses because our local humane society has a very strong opinion that the front harnesses are by far the best for controlling the dog without causing them discomfort.Anyhow, even if you have a standard harness this is the best two handle leash because you don't want the second lower handle flopping around.  I'm quite happy with this leash.I have included some pics as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17KRSB4NYTMXV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XI1ZN9G#wasThisHelpful","R17KRSB4NYTMXV","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm quite happy with this.  It gets around 5 hours of run time when your power is interrupted.  The instructions didn't seem to explain the switch very well though.  If you don't have the switch set right it won't work as an emergency light.  So, make sure to check the switch!!Here is what I learned by playing around with the switch which has three settings.  If it is in the middle setting and you interrupt power it will not come on, that seems to be charge only option and will produce no light.  My unit came in the box set to the middle setting, this is probably necessary so the unit won't run in the box and wear down the battery.  The switch has to be set to the top or bottom setting to function as an emergency light.  One is a low light feature even when it has power, the other is no light when it has power, but both will turn on when you interrupt power.I have mine set in a darker room to always illuminate a small amount of light, then if the power is interrupted it will automatically turn on full brightness.  It works great!To test yours you do not need to flip a breaker switch, simply unplug it from the outlet to interrupt the power.I have included some pics for you to check it out further.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VA8NGQXJN0AX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z90U8Q2#wasThisHelpful","R3VA8NGQXJN0AX","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this to oil the foam filter for my new Yamaha generator.  But, keep in mind it will work with any foam filter that needs oiling not just Yamaha's.  I was impressed with the oil, it was a thin enough consistency that it was quite easy to oil the filter.  I removed the filter from the generator first then I just dribbled some on the filter.  It is then thin enough to penetrate immediately down into the filter.  Then I simply patted out the excess oil with a clean paper towel.  The Yamaha manual warns not wring the filter as it may tear.  It has a bluish/purplish color which makes it easier to see where you have put it depending on the color of your filter.  But, it was also nice when patting with a white paper towel because I could easily see how much I was getting out.  I poked a small hole in the foil cover opening so I didn't have to worry about accidentally pouring more than I meant.For some reason the bottle I was sent did not have a lid and it was no where in the box.  But, I think that was a fluke and a problem with the shipper not the product itself.  Luckily the foil safety cover kept it from leaking.

"After doing some research I definitely wanted a dual sensor smoke alarm which this is.  My understanding is that it is more likely to catch different types of fires like open flame vs slow smoldering.  We bought an older house that only had one alarm.  I decided that wasn't good enough in case that one ever failed we would be in trouble if we ever had a fire.  So, I got three of these to add to the house.  Installation and battery insertion is very easy.  The other question is... do they work?  Yes, they do... we were cooking in the oven and food bubbled out onto the oven elements causing smoke.

"This tablet does not come with a charger, but does include a USB cable for charging from the USB port on your computer or you can of course plug it into any USB charger for other devices.  I used my phone USB charger without any issues.Form Factor: It is similar in shape to my Nexus 7  tablet with the main difference being thickness and weight.  This being a budget tablet is a bit thicker and heavier than the more expensive tablets.  But it isn’t overly thick, so for the price I don’t think the thickness is an issue for most people.Internal Storage: I have the 16Gb Tablet, and out of the box with no new apps installed yet I have 12.32 GB of space available to use.  I will post this review for both the 8gb and the 16gb tablet as the internals are identical except for the amount of storage.  I assume the 8 gb tablet would have around 4.32gb f space available to use.  For the minor difference in price I would recommend the 16gb tablet instead of the 8gb one.External Storage: It has a Micro SD card slot, I put my Lexar 32GB card in the slot and was able to access all of my files without any problems.Sound  The External speaker is one single small speaker in the back.  Sound is very hard to make out if listening to music or videos through the external speaker.  It is better to use headphones or earbuds.Sound: With my Earbuds connected the sound was pretty good and was quite usable.  It has a standard 3.5mm headphone port.Display: Small text was definitely grainy, and at times it looked a bit washed out.  But surprisingly watching youtube videos on it actually looked pretty good.  It’s not comparable to a high end flagship tablet of course, but it is very reasonable for the price.  You do have to look at it pretty straight on, it can be hard to see the screen from an angle.Touchscreen:  The touch screen can be a bit erratic.  In fact I thought there was a problem with the wifi card when I setup the tablet because it wouldn’t connect to my wifi.  But, then I checked “show password” and I saw that strange characters were being added when I would type in the password.  It took many attempts before I could get the password right.  Interestingly enough after the setup was done, it seems that the touchscreen is less finicky and is working a bit better.  But, I still don’t think it is perfect at always registering touches properly.  It is however usable(just slow down when typing), and of course you can always attach the external keyboard as well.Processor/Speed: I watched several youtube videos without any stuttering.  It was very fluid with no problems.  If I started doing lots of multitasking it would slow down, like if I was downloading apps then tried to do something else at the same time.  But, even my Nexus 7 slows down a little with multitasking so that is to be expected.  I tested a few basic games and here is what I found: I installed Brickies a simple arcade game for knocking out bricks (Kind of like Breakout back in the day).  It was a little slow to load but once the game loaded it ran pretty well.  I also tested Angry Birds 1,  It played well without stuttering or excessive heat.WIFI: I couldn’t access my 5ghz wireless network, but could access my 2.4ghz network without any issues. In terms of speed, I just ran a test from speedtest.net and got 39.78mbps download and 12.93 upload with this tablet.  I then ran the same test on my Nexus 7 Android tablet and got 81.30mbps download and 12.67mbps upload.  But, it isn’t a fair fight since this tablet can’t see a faster 5ghz wifi access point like my Nexus tablet can.  So, all in all the wifi performance of this tablet is pretty good considering it doesn’t support 5ghz networks.Battery:  The battery was better than I expected for a budget tablet.  I was watching youtube and playing games.  It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to go from 100% battery down to 75%.  So, I would expect to get up to 5 hours of usage out of the battery.  You may get even more out of it if you aren’t using it as heavily as I was.Camera: There is a front and back camera which is nice.  The quality of the pictures is pretty grainy, but for a budget tablet that is to be expected.  The camera did however work.  The camera does not have flash.External keyboard: It is small and cramped, but it has to be to fit with a 7 inch tablet.  So, I couldn’t type with much speed.  But, the keys felt good.  It is a plug in keyboard, so unfortunately you can’t charge it and use the keyboard at the same time since they both use the same port.Case:  The case that it comes with is very well made, the materials and workmanship are very nice.Overall impression:  To be honest I didn’t have much hope for such an inexpensive budget tablet.  But, if you have a tight budget and can’t afford a high end tablet this one will definitely do the job if you have realistic expectations.  I’m actually quite amazed that for the money you get a tablet that works as well as it does, plus includes an external keyboard and a case.  It is a great option for those in the market for a budget tablet.From ""About Tablet” in SettingsProcessor type: Quadcore-A33Android Version: 4.4.2Firmware Version: 2.0Kernel Version 3.4.39I checked for updates it said none were available on 9/8/15PS.

But, then I checked “show password” and I saw that strange characters were being added when I would type in the password.  It took many attempts before I could get the password right.  Interestingly enough after the setup was done, it seems that the touchscreen is less finicky and is working a bit better.  But, I still don’t think it is perfect at always registering touches properly.  It is however usable(just slow down when typing), and of course you can always attach the external keyboard as well.Processor/Speed: I watched several youtube videos without any stuttering.  It was very fluid with no problems.  If I started doing lots of multitasking it would slow down, like if I was downloading apps then tried to do something else at the same time.  But, even my Nexus 7 slows down a little with multitasking so that is to be expected.  I tested a few basic games and here is what I found: I installed Brickies a simple arcade game for knocking out bricks (Kind of like Breakout back in the day).  It was a little slow to load but once the game loaded it ran pretty well.  I also tested Angry Birds 1,  It played well without stuttering or excessive heat.WIFI: I couldn’t access my 5ghz wireless network, but could access my 2.4ghz network without any issues. In terms of speed, I just ran a test from the “speedtest” app and got 39.78mbps download and 12.93 upload with this tablet.  I then ran the same test on my Nexus 7 Android tablet and got 81.30mbps download and 12.67mbps upload.  But, it isn’t a fair fight since this tablet can’t see a faster 5ghz wifi access point like my Nexus tablet can.  So, all in all the wifi performance of this tablet is pretty good considering it doesn’t support 5ghz networks.Battery:  The battery was better than I expected for a budget tablet.  I was watching youtube and playing games.  It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to go from 100% battery down to 75%.  So, I would expect to get up to 5 hours of usage out of the battery.  You may get even more out of it if you aren’t using it as heavily as I was.Camera: There is a front and back camera which is nice.  The quality of the pictures is pretty grainy, but for a budget tablet that is to be expected.  The camera did however work.  The camera does not have flash.External keyboard: It is small and cramped, but it has to be to fit with a 7 inch tablet.  So, I couldn’t type with much speed.  But, the keys felt good.  It is a plug in keyboard, so unfortunately you can’t charge it and use the keyboard at the same time since they both use the same port.Case:  The case that it comes with is very well made, the materials and workmanship are very nice.Overall impression:  To be honest I didn’t have much hope for such an inexpensive budget tablet.  But, if you have a tight budget and can’t afford a high end tablet this one will definitely do the job if you have realistic expectations.  I’m actually quite amazed that for the money you get a tablet that works as well as it does, plus includes an external keyboard and a case.  It is a great option for those in the market for a budget tablet.PS.  I will also upload some pictures of the device as well.From ""About Tablet” in SettingsProcessor type: Quadcore-A33Android Version: 4.4.2Firmware Version: 2.0Kernel Version 3.4.39I checked for updates it said none were available on 9/8/15","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R7B2C49JPKJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014SPOS46#wasThisHelpful","R2R7B2C49JPKJ9","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This worked well with my wife's iphone 5s without having to make any changes to the phone settings.  The directions are a bit unclear, we weren't sure at first how to clamp the phone on.  But, you simply pull back on the end, there is a spring loaded part.  Then it snuggly held the phone in place.  I plugged in the cable to the headphone jack.  But, we couldn't get it to snap the pictures.  Then I realized it wasn't quite plugged in tight.  So, if you have the same problem make sure the cable is actually in the port all the way.I did not test this stick with an Android device, but the instructions say it will work on most android phones.  But, you have to change the settings so that the volume button can be used as a camera button for the stick to work.  So, before buying this for your android device I would recommend that you make sure your phone has that capability.  But, it sounds like it should work if your android phone has that ability.I like that it is not bluetooth, so there is no need to pair the stick with your phone or keep batteries in the stick.  It also folds down really small which is nice for carrying around.Now, keep in mind this is a budget selfie stick.  It isn't super high quality, and the telescoping seems a little flimsy, and I wish there was more angle options in the phone hinge area.  But, because it is such a reasonable price, I'm giving this 5 stars since it does function as advertised, and works at an extremely reasonable price.  So, if you are looking for a budget selfie stick, this would be a good choice.I'll also include a few pictures for you as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JE6358UYPMXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01446OJAC#wasThisHelpful","R3JE6358UYPMXA","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We have two black labs that get hot on their walks. So, we have a sling that goes over our shoulders and carries a water bottle and has a pouch with a small fold-able fabric bowl. That works ok, except the fabric bowl can collapse in, plus it is too small so it is hard for them to drink from.So, instead we now use these larger non fabric collapsible bowls.  While these would work great for food or water, we plan to use them mainly for water and walks or for travel. These are the perfect size. We clip one to the leash loop with the supplied clip and it works much better for the dogs to drink from on their walks than the fabric kind. It isn't too large and bulky but large enough that a Lab can drink easily from it.They collapse easily and pop back up great as well. The material claims to be FDA and doesn't have any weird smells so I suspect that the material is high quality. We are very happy with them so far as are the dogs.

"I was given a free copy of the Kindle book in exchange for a fair an honest review.  I can tell Debra is a wonderful person and cherishes pets as I do.  So, I give this two stars for her love of pets and kind heart!I wouldn't be able to recommend paying for this book unfortunately and am knocking off stars for my findings below.  It was incredibly short, I'd say it took me about 3 minutes to read the captions and look at the pictures for the entire book.  Maybe it has something to do with the kindle version vs the paper version, but some of the pictures were very grainy and low quality in the kindle version.  Most of the pictures appeared to be taken with an amateur home camera or Iphone.I so wanted to give a 5 star review like most of the other people that were given a free copy, but can't in good conscious recommend that people pay any money for this.

"I used old crimpers and cable cutter tools back in the day that were a pain to use.  I hadn't crimped coax for a few decades since then.  I bought this because I needed to rewire my newly purchased old house, but was dreading having to crimp since I used to hate doing that.  Man, things have gotten better over the years, this tool and the supplied ends were so easy to crimp.  And the tool for stripping the wire was adjusted perfectly and just worked right the first time.  I did have to buy extra ends though as this didn't come with enough.  The tester also worked great and said all of my lines were correct.  Sure enough when comcast came and hooked up my service all of the outlets in the house started working immediately without issue, so the tester was spot on.

"This was a great price, and the cable is really good.  I bought a house that needed the cable completely re-ran and I used this to do that.  I bought a tool for crimping on the ends and ran it under the house and up the walls to new outlets.  When comcast came out to hook up the service to my house they said this cable was perfect for HD TV and Internet.  My Internet speeds are blazing fast(I have 100mbps service and get over my advertised speed), so this works good for cable tv and for cable internet.  I considered paying extra for quad shielding but this did the job just fine so I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money on quad cable plus I read somewhere that the quad is really thick and harder to run up the walls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BTN54VWAJOSA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069F4H2C#wasThisHelpful","R2BTN54VWAJOSA","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this low profile flash drive.  It is much faster than I thought. I figured it must be pretty slow to fit it in such a small profile.  But, while I haven't bench marked it, it seems comparable in speed to my other larger USB 3 flash drives.  I also really like that even though it is so tiny it does come with a hole in it so you can attach a lanyard to put it around your neck if you want.  I liked this so much I got three when they were on sale.  I am using two in my chromebook for additional low profile storage.  And, I use the third on a lanyard around my neck at work.  I need to have my files with me and used to have a huge flash drive hanging from my neck.  But, this is barely noticeable and much lighter.I am extremely happy with this.  The only reason I knocked off one star is because it gets really hot.  If you have it in your computer for a few minutes and pull it out, it will almost burn your hand.  That said it seems reliable so far, and has not degraded from the heat, but I'm a bit worried about the long term reliability because it always runs so hot.  I still highly recommend this though as none of my three have failed yet.

"My wife has an iPhone 5. The remote worked perfectly to initiate calls or other commands through Siri and to end calls. The call quality was comparable to the Apple original manufacturer provided earbuds and they are way more comfortable than the Apple ones. The noise cancelling properties are very good and the sound quality is great for listening to music, podcasts, videos, or calls. She is short and the microphone hangs very low on her, but this does not seem to interfere with its ability to pick up her voice. The only thing lacking in these earbuds is the ability to adjust volume via the inline remote. This is not a deal breaker, as it is not too inconvenient to handle adjustments using the device. The cord is good quality and seems resistant to tangling and does not produce any audible noise interference when it rubs against clothing, as can be the case with some earbuds.When she calls me with them I can hear her just as well if not better than when she used to use the stock apple headset.  I couldn't hear excessive background noise, or wind.  The sound is much better than a Sony aftermarket headset she tried.  I could rarely hear her with that set.  But, with this set I have no problems hearing her when she is calling me with them.All in all we are both very happy with them, with the only downside being the lack of volume control... but to us that is not a deal breaker since it has such good sound and microphone capabilities plus it is very comfortable in our ears.It also came in nice packaging.

"I like that I can fold this out of the way when I don't need it.  This lamp is very bright and is perfect for using at my desk.  It is also very adjustable so you can get the light where you need it.  It also has a great range of brightness/dimmable options, and you can select whiter/blue colors or more relaxing yellowish colors.  The usb port works great for charging devices.The lumens seems quite bright on this lamp which is great, some of the cheaper ones sound good on paper but I read reviews that said they weren't bright enough.  But, this one is plenty bright for my needs.I don't use it for a bed lamp, but if you are interested in it for that, it does have a light on the power button so you can find it at night, and it has a sleep timer which is great.This light also has 'memory' so it remembers the last brightness and color temperature you picked which is very nice.  Some of the other models do not have this feature.I am quite happy with this lamp and can recommend it with only one possible hesitation.  The top hinge seems kind of flimsy to me, so I'm not sure how long that will last.  But, I didn't knock of a star because it does function just fine and only time will tell how well it holds up.  But, so far I can't fault it.I do really enjoy how bright this light is and it has really helped my productivity as a result.  I have attached a few pictures so you can see it in action.

"Works great with my Garmin Vivofit 2.  It was easy to setup and seems accurate.  I don't like the strap quite as well as my polar soft strap, this one is a little harder to adjust the size.  But, once you have it adjusted it is comfortable.  I'm happy I got this to use with my Vivofit 2.  If you have a Vivofit 2, I'd recommend this.The main thing if you have a Vivofit 2 is to make sure you go into the software, or app and check the box to add the 'heart' function to your menu items otherwise you won't see it.  At first I missed the second check box to add it to your 'activity' menu though.  I could see my heart rate just fine, until I would start my activity then it would go away.  So, I hunted around and realized I hadn't clicked both check boxes.I did read other reviews that said they had stuck screws and couldn't change the battery.

"I was very impressed with this lamp.  I was looking for a night stand light, this works well for that purpose.  It has blue LED light that is always on so at night you can find the power button.  I definitely wanted a light with multiple color temperatures and this does that.  At night I prefer the less harsh yellow light temperature.  Then I use a 'whiter' one if I want to read or something.  I also like to turn it's brightness down at night.This lamp also has memory so that it remembers your latest brightness and color temperature choice.  This was important to me as well since at night I don't want it forgetting its setting if I have to turn it on in the middle of the night.  Some of the other models I looked at would default back to a bright setting so a memory feature was very important to me for use as a bed lamp.I tested the 'timer' mode and that worked great, so the light properly shut off once the timer was up.  All you have to do is hold the power button for a few seconds to turn the timer on, the blue LED will blink to let you know the timer is on which I appreciate.The goose neck is very flexible and doesn't feel too loose.  The base is weighted so it won't fall over, and I love the rubber coating this lamp has.Really the only possible negative I see is that the plastic coating on top of the buttons seems to have a few bubbles in it, but I haven't investigated it closely yet.  It may be a protective plastic sheet for shipping that needs to be removed but like I said I haven't investigated that closely yet as it is barely noticeable.The usb port charges my phone well.  I do wish they made this with a 2a USB port for those that want to plug in a higher amperage tablet.The light quality is great and the brightness is just right for a night stand lamp as well as reading if you are close to it.  I wouldn't expect this to light the entire room well, but it will light your desk or night stand well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5ZJ00X8B97HW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YP4A1U6#wasThisHelpful","R5ZJ00X8B97HW","A80JWH5US7F6T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A80JWH5US7F6T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Seems good so far, I knocked off a star because the instructions aren't very complete and are confusing.  I needed an always on outlet, and needed the switch to also control a 'load' line, but it needed to be GFCI protected too.  The instructional diagram in the printed instructions warn you that if you follow their directions the switch will not be GFCI protected(only the outlet), but that there are many other ways to wire it.  However, they don't actually give you the ""many other ways"" to wire it instructions.  I spent hours trying to figure out how to do it properly and was close but couldn't quite figure it out.  There were no good youtube videos for this device, so I did a standard web search and found a link to Leviton forum, with a very good diagram.  It is for a slightly different version, but the concept is still the same as long as you keep in mind which is your 'line"" and which is your 'load'.  Then it is very easy to hook it up with this diagram.  Once I had this diagram it only took me about 15 minutes to complete it and everything worked.  One warning though, I hooked everything up and flipped the breaker but things didn't work.  So, I thought I wired it wrong, then a light bulb came on in my mind, duh.... I had to press the 'reset' switch, then everything started working properly.  The outlet was always on and the line I wired to the switch was GFCI protected and turned on and off when flipping the switch.  Phew!Here is a link to the forum I found with the diagram.  http://communities.leviton.com/thread/2950In case they ever move things on their website I will also upload the diagram directly here on Amazon.

"Most people dissatisfied and tortured by lives gone wrong, hopes unrealized and a dull emptiness throbbing in some inexplicable place will probably turn to some form of coping mechanism. Some may find escape in such innocuous pleasures as surfing the internet for people to look down on. Others may start coin collections and lose themselves forever in the endless minutiae of minting errors or die variations. Or why not dress up and channel your favorite super hero? Some people may even look awesome since most superheroes just happen to dress in alluringly scanty, skin tight clothing. Hopefully, none will go to the extremes shown in the now legendary novel ""Fight Club."" In it, the hero, or more likely anti-hero, fed up with his seemingly pointless life of paralyzing consumerism drifts into an insomnia induced schizophrenia and literally plays out his revenge fantasies. These intensify gradually until the inevitable occurs. After all, one typically comes cheek to cheek with one's own unchecked demons, or at least swollen cheek to gun barrel.""Fight Club"" reads like a supersonic roller coaster. An all out assault on the brain's syntactic pleasure centers generates so much tension that peeking ahead a few paragraphs or pages in helpless suspense becomes pathological. The sentence variety ranges appropriately from run-on to fragment, with plenty of well placed contrast for tension, novelty and intrigue. The well-crafted dialogue showcases the blessings and curses of many post television and movie novels that understandably share the ambition of appearing on film. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it has shaped the modern novel arguably more than any other factor. ""Fight Club"" definitely qualifies as a ""film-able"" novel, and so it was. A dream realized. Nonetheless, it still manages to remain a great novel with great tight writing throughout. No need to get into puerile arguments about ""the movie is better than the book"" or ""the book is better than the movie"" because that's turtles all the way down. In any case, the book would stand well on its own without a movie incarnation, though it may have missed out on a felicitous sales boost.Similar to many thrillers, the story uses the well-known and highly effective technique of opening on the climax, then rewinding time and gradually resolving the story back to that same climax. As such, Tyler Durden appears immediately, shoving a gun into the mouth of the nameless anti-hero. They stand atop the Parker-Morris building which will apparently explode any minute. A few floors down, anonymous obsequious henchman throw furniture onto the crowd below. This curious situation demands explanation, so rewind to scene one. The first person narrative catapults back to the first coping mechanism: support groups for the dying. Here, for the narrator, life reveals itself in its own resolution of death. He feigns illness and engages in hugs, sobbing and consoling asphyxiating physical smothering. A woman, Marla, appears one day and he immediately takes her for a fraud. She ruins his own fake experience for him, so he tries to convince her to stop coming. It doesn't work. Things soon turn up a notch and Tyler Durden makes his entrance. Fight Club begins with a narrator-Tyler sock-em fest. People gather. Rules form. Associated mantras also form, the best known remains ""The first rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club."" Tyler and Marla begin a fling. The narrator's apartment, full of prized consumer goodies, suddenly explodes. Chemical burns in the shape of kisses appear on hands. Soap gets made, possibly out of the fat of Marla's mother. Subliminal glimpses of genitalia appear unknowingly in family movies. Gourmet food gets peed in. Notes about urine in expensive fragrance cause a breakdown. A defiant boss finds fight club notes on the company's printer. He backs off in horror after his confrontation with the narrator ends in a psychotic rant. All of this happens, pretty coincidentally, wherever the narrator and Tyler show their now disfigured beaten swollen blood caked faces. Fight club catches on and sweeps bar basements across the nation. Ferocious beatings occur weekly almost everywhere.Then the volume ratchets up. Project Mayhem, a sort of a spin-off from fight club, initiates a new dangerous level of mass chaos. Led again by Tyler and the narrator they apparently want to ""fix civilization."" They go about it by recruiting a small army of self-deprecating recruits complete with required hand burns. The narrator reflects that, before his life changed, he was going to name his future dog ""Entourage"" and concludes ""This is how bad your life can get."" Now a team of devotees scours distant medical waste dumps for liposuction fat to use in products sold by the very profitable Paper Street Soap Company. Sometimes they also drive like Mr. Toad. Terrifying ""human sacrifices"" occur that, though they may change lives, they do it through hideous psychological terror. What a way to enter veterinary school. An office explodes. The narrator's office. Did someone inject gasoline in a computer's CRT? Suddenly, the narrator can't find Tyler. But when he asks others, also battle scarred by fight club, they tell him they haven't seen Tyler, wink at him and treat him with embarrassing and militaristic deference. People even call him ""sir."" Tyler suddenly appears in dreams, in visions and the narrator has a hideous Jekyll and Hyde revelation. He has to stop everything, but the tsunami momentum may prove too much. He becomes a wanted man, loves Marla and finds himself once again atop the Parker-Morris building teething a gun barrel with the clock ticking. He ends up in ""heaven"" with a premonition that everything has ended - and another haunting premonition that it hasn't. Can one ever really escape one's demons?""Fight Club"" manages to remain shocking and edgy almost two decades after its release. Its dramatic progression of dissatisfaction building up to violence that ends in regret may even hold a lesson for our increasingly volatile times. Though often disturbing and jarring it also manages a good amount of laugh out loud humor. It also contains some outright stunning passages, such as ""we are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't. And we're just learning this fact."" This chilling quote occurs while a gang from Project Mayhem prepares to castrate a police commissioner. One of their many ""homework"" assignments. Ultimately, the book sends a warning about reacting violently or vengefully to one's internal malcontent. Consumerism may leave many people feeling empty and purposeless, but that doesn't mean a worse monster needs to get created. ""Fight Club"" thus ends up providing a critique both of modern life and of a typical knee-jerk reaction one may have to it, namely, a fervent desire to ""fix"" it through some kind of armed revolution. Obviously, interpretations of fiction will differ wildly, but ""Fight Club"" seems to tell the middle class disaffected, or at least people without problems who think they have problems, to ""cool it."" So should they?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HCMTQ4S1YTCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393327345#wasThisHelpful","R2HCMTQ4S1YTCV","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Those of modest means, or most people, who find themselves pursued and bitten by a fervent numismatic bug may find the hobby's emphasis on pricey rarities a barrier larger than a carbonized steel wall extending past the thermosphere. The few and inaccessibly expensive precious planchets that grace the numismatic press seem accessible only to those possessing pedigrees extending back to Charlemagne. But fret not. Alternatives exist. Apart from numerous modestly priced coins dispersed across bourse floors throughout the globe, one can borrow inspiration from Marcel Duchamp, that old champion of autographed urinals, and accumulate and appreciate found objects. Coins abound in the real world, often hidden in plain sight. Just gaze into streets, gutters, flaps of siding, between tire treads, in the digestive tracts of animals, beneath snowplows and in countless other surprising niches and crevices. Not beautiful or valuable specimens that will have Sotheby's ramming down your door Viking style, of course, but pieces full of curious historical fascination all their own. Not everything exciting or interesting is expensive.""Keep the Change,"" a modestly sized and extremely enjoyable book priced well below a Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle, passionately embraces the finding and collecting of mutilated money. Burgeoning with interesting monetary tidbits, bursting with plenty of full color photos of coins and bills damaged beyond hope and infused with a slightly necessary Quixotic spirit of adventure, the book highlights very underrated aspects of the life of physical cash. It's rough out there, even for metal. With a fresh albeit askew perspective the book turns the numismatic field, if not on its head, then at least on its rib cage. It exchanges perfect MS-70 museum pieces with cents and quarters splattered with inexplicable goo, dollar bills saturated with coffee, dye or noxious chemicals, deeply counter marked copper, loudly rubber stamped cotton and coins tortured beyond recognition by heavy industrial equipment or disemboweled by household tools. And it sees it all as beautiful. And, arguably, it is.Along the way, some may even learn what ""fungible"" means. Points for educational value.Those who don't appreciate quarters flipped over like tacos should at least enjoy exploding some money busting, or money defacing, myths. Many children, during those long lazy days of aimless youth, become possessed with the uncontrollable urge to rip something apart from the inside out. Some of us may have direct experience with this, but finger pointing is never productive. How many children saw a cent in half, subject a quarter to intense heat or simply deface currency in the name of boredom resolution only to have friends with shrill voices begin brandishing endless excoriations for destroying government property? The book deals with this timeless topic by citing 18 U.S.C. 333. This clearly states the utter illegality of defacing currency, but many of our childish selves would mercifully be spared the hoosegow by the loophole of difficult to prove intent. The book points out that even a Treasury Secretary once personally signed a banknote, which technically qualifies as defacement. So unless one's acts of currency mutilation appear excessively gratuitous or indignantly rebellious, most of us probably have little to create ulcers over concerning this topic. Though to be clear, the book by no means supports or recommends the intentional defacing of currency, only the finding, collecting and appreciation of already mutilated currency. Hey, back off, he didn't do it!Some of the book's most amusing material involves the alteration of money for artistic or political purposes. Some conceptual artists have stamped circulating bills with messages such as ""Free Money,"" ""I am voting"" or anti-consumer aphorisms such as ""What if you only had what you needed?"" One of the more impressive projects involved a Turkish artist taking ten years of creating a ""new"" twenty dollar bill out of strips of already circulating currency, aptly titled ""How to Make a Buck."" A piece entitled ""Wrong"" showcases poorly conceived counterfeiting schemes. Money as art. Art as money. Other chapters discuss the endlessly fascinating security features on currency, including the fluorescent variations of embedded ultraviolet strips that vary by denomination and magnetic ink. Voluminous other topics spill over the sides of this tiny book, including perfectly legal money-gami, a lucky windfall of error notes, a bank manger who literally throws away $1,000 a year, lovely verdigris, star notes, Issac Newton's numismatic contributions, coin clipping, a slew of nicknames for money, a public money burning on Wall Street, the ups and downs of submitting damaged money to the Treasury, the mystery of red quarters, and a final taxonomic dictionary categorizing the many ways money gets morphed and mangled - everything from advertising to irradiation to ""Vegas Coins."" Readers will glean more about mutilation than they ever thought possible.""Keep the Change"" expands the concepts of numismatics in directions accessible to anyone. It also excites an admiration for the unimaginable stress that money endures in circulation. Perhaps tumbled worn seemingly valueless money has more to communicate historically than valuable pristine and untouched money? Smooth featureless and even damaged coins have definitely done their job out in the great big world. Perhaps they deserve more credit than rotting at the bottom of dusty discount bins? ""Keep the Change"" helps redress this imbalance and fosters gratitude for the beaten culls and the ugly slugs that have driven everyday commerce since the appearance of our now ubiquitous money. Now go find a maimed coin and give it the attention it deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN8XDI7TTOELH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616892560#wasThisHelpful","RN8XDI7TTOELH","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a late filmed interview, author Paul Bowles said that he had never worked unless he really wanted to. Not only that, others who knew him claimed he was the ""most free"" person that they had ever known. Perhaps this accounts for his relatively uneven literary output, scattered as it was across multiple decades. Perhaps he didn't need to write to make a living, but remained lucky enough to write only when inspiration or urges bubbled up beyond breaking point. Following the 1970s, a decade in which he released very little material, the 1980s saw a resurgence of interest in the reclusive expatriate who wrote mainly about the murky and disturbing side of human nature. A few small new works appeared, including a tiny experimental work encompassing a periodic multiple perspective history of Morocco called ""Points in Time,"" a new collection of short stories, a format he mastered, called ""Midnight Mass"" and an equally diminutive collection called ""Unwelcome Words."" The final collection appeared in 1988 and remains among the last original work he released before his death in 1999. It shows that his powers and experimentation had not diminished even in his final years.""Unwelcome Words"" contains seven very short stories, all of which deal with familiar Bowles themes. Three of them stand out by using a stream of consciousness or ""language of thought"" approach that eschews all punctuation and reads like a continuous and interminably anxious inhale. This may disarm some readers at first, but its pleasantly unpleasant effect works given these stories' mostly sinister subject matter. The remaining stories have a journalistic feel except for the final epistolary story in which Bowles himself appears.""Julien Vreden,"" the first story, deals with the sudden deaths of two parents and their bitterly vengeful son. ""New York 1965"" introduces the experimental style through a relentless barrage of thoughts of a woman who harshly judges a friend whose life and values veer drastically from her own and who can't tolerate ""people who refuse to abide by the rules of the game."" The story leaves lasting thoughts about who remains the most repulsive, the judge or the judged? Or perhaps neither? Maybe some moralizing ends merely in an unresolvable stalemate? ""Hugh Harper"" tells the sordid tale of a man who acquires a taste for human blood and finds himself exiled from one culture after another. The reasons why each culture exiles him provide intriguing contrasts. ""Massachusetts 1932"" once again provides an onslaught of chained sentences lacking punctuation. This time the deluge appears in second person, told by the owner of a secluded cabin in which two women, both his estranged wives, committed suicide in a suspiciously similar manner. The shotguns on the book's cover may take on a deeper meaning. ""Dinner at Sir Nigel's"" relates a bizarre tale of an eccentric aristocrat who invites a group of journalists to his house. They witness a macabre performance featuring beautiful young women. Soon everyone knew why he keeps only a very small house staff well out of proportion to his fortune. ""Tangier 1975"" features yet another uneasy circumstance in which a young poor couple take up residence on a rich woman's estate. Following a large party in which the couple are asked to monitor guests, the sounds of nearby peacocks screeching come to sound more and more like screams of tortured humans. Or do they? This story leaves a lingering dread.The book's longest, and final, story, ""Unwelcome Words,"" finds Paul Bowles himself communicating with a seemingly bitter man confined to his room and a wheelchair after experiencing a stroke. Only Bowles' letters appear so readers must deduce the debilitated man's words. Little by little Bowles becomes increasingly impatient with the hopelessness expressed by the unseen other side of the correspondence. Bowles relates ghastly stories of plotting to kill noisy dogs in his neighborhood, the murder of an old woman, the attack on two old Americans who lived on a mountain, a practical joke in which someone reveals that Bowles has died, theories on the sources of the suffering man's stroke, mainly his insufferable ex-wife, strange song lyrics, the highly chemicalized ingredients of ""Home Fashioned"" American chocolate and ""Huckleberry Finn"" as a ""ruined masterpiece."" When Bowles begins to address the gradual unread accusations of his grieving pen-pal, he essentially gives up and hopes his friend will remember his kindness in his final moments. A one-sided dissolution of a lifelong friendship unfolds. The reasons why Bowles personalized this story to such an extent will probably remain a subject for speculation. One could also argue that he doesn't depict himself as the most sympathetic of human beings here, but this piece also appears in a collection of fiction. Theories could abound. In any case, the story will likely haunt readers well beyond closing the book.This small collection demonstrates Bowles lasting literary power. Its bold experimentation works and its themes drill deep into human psychology without drawing any facile conclusions or wallowing in needless moralizing. They seem to depict life in all of its polymorphous indeterminacy, as does all of Bowles' best work. Situations unfold, humans provide counter arguments and justifications while violence or its premonitions lurks mysteriously beneath the surface. Bowles' work brings humanity face to face with itself and some may find the experience relentless, but never boring, trite or gratuitous. It never shuns the depths of human experience and attempts to embrace and expose an aspect of existence that many would probably rather sweep under a carpet of platitudes. Though Bowles never found great fame as a writer, his work will nonetheless continue to impact those lucky enough to stumble across it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4D2V3ZF57NY2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0939180448#wasThisHelpful","R4D2V3ZF57NY2","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Published continuously since 1947, the famous ""Red Book"" retains its status as the preeminent reference book for United States coins. Its legendary status has even  promoted the red book itself to a collectible. Original early editions can capture hefty premiums, as the book itself unabashedly admits. This 69th edition continues the tradition of delineating all US coin types, including colonials, commemoratives, patterns, territorial releases and even some samplings of tokens. It even includes annual silver, gold and platinum bullion releases, such as the Eagles, Buffaloes and First Spouse series. Just about any nanoparticle of metal that the US has ever deemed official currency shows up in these pages. Better yet, they appear in color and in actual size.Beginning with the intriguing and rare Sommer Islands' issues aptly named ""Hogge Money"" from 1616 an accessible and manageable monetary history of the US unfolds. Even items unobtainable to those lacking aristocratic incomes appear, such as Brasher Doubloons, Continental Currency and the 1792 ""Dismes"" and ""Half Dismes,"" all of which easily fetch 6 or 7 figures at auction. The included lovely but inevitably inadequate paper reproductions remain the closest many will come to experiencing such deified rarities. Special sections also exist for the 1804 dollar and Gobrecht Dollars, but the equally celebrated 1913 Liberty Nickel receives only a cursory mention. Following an almost dizzying but fascinating parade of colonial and post-colonial issues, the book lists coins by denomination starting with the now enigmatic and very obsolete copper half cent. Alongside very familiar issues, such as the Lincoln Cent, Roosevelt dime and the Washington Quarter, other long lost denominations crop up like lion fish amongst tuna, many of which were probably good ideas at the time. Thankfully, short historical footnotes accompany most sections and help illuminate these now seemingly puzzling coins. The two-cent and three cent piece both had practical 19th century applications. Half dimes were basically nickels clothed in silver and the very strange and extremely short lived twenty cent piece probably remains one of the US mint's most beguiling blunders. Its size proximity to the quarter dollar created confusion similar to the ill-fated Susan B. Anthony dollar released over a century later. The lesson: don't release new coins that are nearly identical to coins already in circulation, especially if they differ in purchasing power. Additional lesser known coins also receive attention, such as confederate, Hawaiian, Puerto Rican, and the early 20th century standard and commemorative releases of the Philippines. Many of these also command exorbitant prices.Though the book often revels in rarities, it doesn't neglect recent clad issues and their special variations, such as the well-known and well circulated Statehood and America the Beautiful quarters, the ""Westward Journey"" nickels, the Presidential and Native American dollars and the 2009 bicentennial Lincoln cents. Photos of all appear (though this edition appeared too early to include photos of the most recent First Spouse issues, including the much anticipated Jacqueline Kennedy piece). Opinions also vary on the US mint's commemorative program, but the curious, or morbidly curious, will find every commemorative ever issued within these solid red covers. Many of the ""classic"" commemoratives feature breathtakingly beautiful designs, such as the Oregon Trail Memorial. This era ended with the controversial 1951 - 1954 Carver/Washington issue. The book provides a curious quote claiming that proceeds from the sales of these coins, among the first in the US to picture African-Americans, went ""to oppose the spread of communism among Negroes in the interest of national defense."" Very interesting, indeed. This apparently dealt such a blow to the program that commemoratives didn't appear again until 1982. Some argue that we're now in an era of commemorative and variety glut that may strangle the hobby. A profusion of limited edition ""reverse proofs,"" special mint marks and limited mint sets fuels a secondary market that can temporarily inflate values and cause collector frustration. And this Red Book edition doesn't yet include the controversial Truman and Kennedy ""Coin and Chronicles"" sets that sold out almost immediately. Many blame the horrifying decline in stamp collecting, and stamp values, on a similar flooding of the market with endless releases that led to irreversible collector frustration. But not everyone agrees with this ominous warning or decrees the same fate for coin collecting.Many will also notice that the Red Book calls itself a ""guide book"" and not a ""price guide,"" though it does contain a litany of prices and values. The book itself contains a warning about following the listed prices too closely, as the market fluctuates wildly and unpredictably over the span of a year. That said, few will probably recommend using the Red Book as a guide to pricing. The instantly updatable internet has even started to question the very existence of print price guides and many dealers now use online subscription services to determine values. That said, the Red Book and the accompanying Blue Book can give a rough order of magnitude pricing range for newcomers, not to mention valuable mintage data and crucial historical background information. Not only that, some of the best information in the Red Book has nothing to do with pricing. The introduction provides a fascinating and detailed outline of the history of US coins and famous hoards plus advice on the coin market, detecting counterfeits and the ever elusive topic of grading. A small discussion of errors, values of collectible Red and Blue books, historical bullion prices and the top 250 auction prices and a bibliography close the book. Though most who purchase this book will likely want to own coins of their own, it's completely feasible that someone who never wants to purchase a single physical coin could still derive much useful information from these pages. As such, the Red Book is probably best thought of as a reference book, not as a price guide, and one with a history all its own. It will turn 70 next year and only time will tell if its printed pages will eventually succumb to the digital bits of the internet. Until then, assuming that does happen, it will remain an indelible institution in and of itself for the field of numismatics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HTUVWZ1N5H2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ELR94C#wasThisHelpful","R2HTUVWZ1N5H2H","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone following Captain Beefheart's career in 1974 probably screeched with delight upon hearing of his upcoming collaboration with longtime associate Frank Zappa. Though far more a Zappa album than a Beefheart one, ""Bongo Fury"" represents Beefheart's drastic turn away from the brash commercialism of his two uncharacteristic 1974 albums. Here he sounds completely back in his element, gritty sandblasting voice, poetically surreal lyrics and a committed affirmation of everything elliptical and angular. Perhaps Zappa, who had both discovered and provided Beefheart with his often misheard moniker, had saved Don Van Vliet's career from the ""Tragic Band"" chasm? In any case, the duo sound so great throughout ""Bongo Fury"" that one wishes they had shared stages more often (""Willie the Pimp"" from ""Hot Rats"" provides another heavenly example of their brilliant collaborations). Sadly, as most people know, this mid 70s album, tour, legal hassles following the ""Bat Chain Puller"" project and whatever else pretty much drained any desire that these two immense talents had to inhabit the same room. Thankfully, they decided to record their 1975 tour (mostly live) and left ""Bongo Fury"" behind as testament of their once fruitful relationship.Beefheart growls the album to life on the Zappa-penned ""Debra Kadabra."" Either Beefheart completely made it his own or Zappa had The Captain in mind when writing this track. Even the lyrics sound right out of Beefheart: ""June, a rancho granny, shook her wrinkled fanny"" and ""Oh debra algebra amnesia kadabra, witch goddess, witch goddess of lankersham boulevard. Cover my entire bodice, with an avon cologna"" and ""watch the rubber tongue when it comes out from the puffed and flabulent Mexican rubbergoose mask."" This opening song leaves a definite impression. It hearkens Beefheart's triumphant return from the abyss and christens the remainder of the amazing set that awaits.Things just get better with the catchy and driving ""Carolina Hard-Core Ecstasy"" that features Zappa in full form. Supposedly a collage of some of Zappa's own interesting and often humorous experiences, the song tells the tale of a woman who likes a good stomping. Not exactly a topical stretch for Zappa. Those familiar with the era will likely laugh out loud at the ""Roger Daltrey cape"" reference. It's possibly one of Zappa's best songs and worth the entire album alone.Beefheart's first of two original numbers, ""Sam With the Showing Scalp Flat Top,"" with the unforgettable lines ""the music was thud like"" and ""particular about the point it made,"" showcases the Captain's always evocative lyrics. The song ends with a variation on ""Louie Louie"" with Beefheart ominously chanting ""Bongo fury."" Zappa then announces that the coming USA bicentennial year will feature many products that ""maybe you shouldn't ought to buy,"" which queues the ""cowboy"" song ""Poofter's Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead"" sung once again by Beefheart. ""200 Years Old"" emerges with its slick blues suddenly from the sudden ending of ""Poofter's Froth."" ""Cucamonga"" feels like a smooth reminiscence of Zappa and Beefheart's late childhood spent in the yawning California desert. It features an insane vocal transition and plummeting piano fills. Fans of Zappa's legendary guitar solos will melt along with the extended ""Advance Romance."" Screeching harmonica also joins in, along with some trademark whoops, hollers and gargles from Beefheart's heavily sandblasted throat. Beefheart's second number, ""Man With The Woman Head"" only encompasses a minute and a half of the album, but it makes the most of that geologic eye blink. Identical to ""Scalp Flat top,"" Beefheart mostly speaks the lyrics over a thick layer of flailing and ethereal musical accompaniment.The album closes on a truly momentous note. It provides an exemplar and culmination of the concept of ""concert closer."" ""Muffin Man"" not only showcases Zappa's guitar acrobatics but also makes a passionate plea for the supremacy of muffins over cupcakes. More great lines grace the amazing music: ""Girl you thought he was a man but he was a muffin, he hung around till you found that he didn't know nothin'."" Beefheart's vocals add very special emphasis. The thundering refrain continues and eventually ends with Zappa's classic pronouncement ""Goodnight Austin, Texas, wherever you are!""Zappa and Beefheart went their separate ways following ""Bongo Fury."" Zappa continued one of the most prolific careers of the twentieth century until his tragic death in 1993. His enormous body of work still stands as an insurmountable achievement in its richness, musical sophistication and evolution. ""Bongo Fury"" provides a mere nibble of the impressively eclectic and vast Zappa library. Beefheart, perhaps energized by his old friend, experienced a musical renaissance and happily returned to his more dissonant and cacophonous roots. The abortive ""Bat Chain Puller"" morphed into ""Shiny Beast(Bat Chain Puller)"" which extended to two more additionally brilliant albums before his retirement into painting in 1982. Van Vliet passed away in 2010. Apparently, he and Zappa resumed communication prior to Zappa's death. ""Bongo Fury"" shows just what these two 20th century musical giants could accomplish in unison. Sadly, they didn't come together more often.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15A3Z4UF6XOTJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAAK2EO#wasThisHelpful","R15A3Z4UF6XOTJ","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jazz pianist Thelonious Monk, who some earlier used to dismiss as ""bizarre"" or ""eccentric,"" finally found popular success in the 1960s. A string of albums for Columbia, an extensive touring schedule and even an appearance on the cover of Time Magazine in 1964 kept Monk solidly in the limelight as one of jazz's leading figures. In retrospect, this vertiginous ascent also presaged the end of his groundbreaking career. Rumors of failing mental health began to spread and some accused his late recordings of uninventive cyclical rehashing. Though Monk's Columbia recordings definitely contain fewer original compositions than previously recorded songs, they nonetheless have a character all of their own. Given what we now know about Monk's later years, the amount of original material he did manage to create during this phase now seems impressive and inspiring. Regardless of the truth behind some of the criticisms, Monk even managed to make his rehashes seem fresh and revitalized.""Straight, No Chaser,"" released in 1967 following a two year gap in recording, contained almost no new material, but this doesn't really seem to matter almost fifty years after its release. Perhaps those who had followed Monk in his day experienced the repetition more directly as each new album appeared in sequence, but today this album's energy really stands up. Listening to it in a 21st century retrospective context probably makes the stigmas and ethos present in the late 1960s jazz scene seem less relevant. In any case, the album sounds strong all on its own and contains enough of Monk's angularly playful musicality to withstand repeated listenings. It does come very late in his recording career and only a few albums remained before Monk's final studio sessions and retirement from recording.""Locomotive"" opens the album with an addictive mechanic churn featuring a rhythm that sticks long after the final notes have faded away. As usual, Charlie Rouse channels Monk's musical thoughts and provides a streaming moving sax solo that perfectly accompanies the song's aura. ""I Didn't Know About You,"" composed by Duke Ellington, begins with Monk solo on piano. Rouse's smooth sax eventually emerges, almost surprisingly, over the lilting piano making for another great sonic combination. This album's version of one of Monk's most famous songs, ""Straight, No Chaser,"" runs over 11 minutes and includes a slew of incredible solos by the entire ensemble. The extremely extended ""Japanese Folk Song (Kojo no Tsuki),"" running at almost 17 minutes, never becomes worn and tired thanks to its intriguing melodic structures. Monk also begins this number solo and the rest of the band gradually joins in. This track doesn't seem to have appeared on any previous Monk his albums. The well-known and heavily covered jazz standard, ""Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea,"" appears here in a lovely solo piano rendition. ""We See"" highlights Monk's catchy lyricism and provides further evidence that his music represents one of the happiest and most hopeful sounds in all of music.Later CD reissues restored many of the originally reduced LP tracks to their full length. Not only that, three additional tracks continue the show beyond where the 1967 album left off. ""This is My Story, This is my Song,"" shows Monk in a melancholy mood with just enough of his idiosyncrasies infused to keep the song from taking itself too seriously. An earlier take of ""I Didn't Know About You"" rolls into the boppy ""Green Chimneys,"" a song that would appear on Monk's next album, ""Underground"". This take, though very listenable, doesn't quite have the drive of that subsequent album's version. In this context it provides a hint of the creative explosion that would soon unfold. ""Underground,"" released the following year, included more original compositions than many previous albums. This makes ""Straight, No Chaser"" seem less innovative in comparison, but the seeds of ""Underground"" may have begun to emerge on its predecessor. Monk had not recorded in a few years before ""Straight, No Chaser,"" so perhaps this served as a warm up to one of his last, and arguably one of his best, late albums. But ""Straight, No Chaser"" still stands up fine today even in comparison to ""Underground."" It represents Monk, one of the undisputed geniuses of modern music, in full form even in his later years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXUVNYX1QHUPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002AD6#wasThisHelpful","RXUVNYX1QHUPH","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every Talking Heads album feels equally like an ending and a beginning. With the possible exception of their first and last few albums, none of their releases seem surmountable. How could they top ""More Songs About Buildings and Food?"" With ""Fear of Music."" And how could they possibly top that album? With ""Remain in Light."" They kept re-inventing themselves to such a fervent extreme that no one could possibly predict the next progression. ""Remain in Light"" seemed like the culmination of aggregating afro-rock and western pop with enlightened stream of consciousness. How would they top that? Some may argue that the follow up to ""Remain in Light,"" arguably their most critcally acclaimed album, doesn't completely measure up. ""Speaking in Tongues,"" released three years later, fully embraced synth pop and the same electrified african rhythms that graced its predecessor. But it contains a different and more subdued kind of energy, not quite as explosive as ""Born Under Punches"" or ""Once in a Lifetime,"" but a more accessible and subversively quirky aura that feels murkily spontaneous despite its very precise electronic rhythms and sound. It somehow managed to make the Talking Heads a household name while simultaneously solidifying both their artistic and commercial aspirations. Even today it still sounds equally popular and subversive with lines such as ""and I don't know what you expect staring into the TV set"" and ""our president's crazy, did you hear what he said?"" ""Burning Down the House,"" a massive hit in its day, now defines the band for the mass of people who tilt their cochleas towards popular music sources. One can still hear the song vibrating air molucules out in the great big world over thirty years later. The elliptical but addictive music video found voluminous play on the then only two years old MTV (which, surprising as it probably seems today, once stood for ""Music Television""). At the time, this album felt like the culmination of the band's four previous albums while sounding like yet another re-invention. Its subsequent commercial success seemed well deserved. But cracks began to fracture in the foundations even before this album appeared. Following the equally successful ""Stop Making Sense,"" which filmed the tour that supported this album and the band's final tour, not everyone appreciated what came afterwards or the sometimes puerile and openly public back stabbing between band members that ensued over the next few years.""Speaking in Tongues"" arose out of improvisation. The band sat in the studio and played together and tightened the lyrics and the music and released an album. It probably sounds far easier than the reality. This also accounts for the change in song writing credits for this album and ""Remain in Light."" All songs now get credited to every band member rather than just David Byrne. Byrne sang the vocals extemporaneously during the sessions and some of his original ramblings remained on the final mix. The album's title then provides an apt analogy for at least the lyrical methodology. Though the new approach and credits suggest more collaboration, the individual members had gone their separate ways during the three year gap between albums. Byrne had recorded two solo records, Frantz and Weymouth formed ""The Tom Tom Club"" and scored a hit of their own, and Harrison had even recorded a solo album. They finally came together again to create a fetchingly danceable album.""Making Flippy Floppy"" contains an ethereal violin solo by Shankar that reaches in and grabs something primordial. Razor slices and gurglings punctuate the incomprehensibly comprehensible lyrics of ""Girlfriend is Better."" The lines ""we're being taken for a ride again"" and ""nothing was lost, everything's free, I don't care how impossible it seems"" still resonate today. They may even prophetically define our current times. ""Slippery People,"" we've all known some, includes an infectious groove and more profoundly dadaist lyrics. The skippy ""This Must be the Place (Naive Melody)"" seems to provide a rare bittersweet moment of consolation in the Talking Head's catalog, but something sinister bubbles beneath the surface, again revealed by the lyrics, ""the less we say about it the better, make it up as we go along"" and ""It's okay, I know nothing's wrong, nothing."" Though some genuinely touching moments peek through, such as ""Out of all those kinds of people, you got a face with a view"" and ""and you love me till my heart stops, love me till I'm dead."" A great mellow album closer.Many of these songs received new, sometimes more frenetic, treatments for the concert film ""Stop Making Sense,"" which may make the original albums versions feel slightly more lax for those who experience the concert before the album. The movie also featured a sampling of songs from the album, leaving some truly great tracks slightly obscured. ""I Get Wild/Wild Gravity"" contains a hearty mix of juicy groove. ""Moon Rocks"" opens with the classic line ""Flying saucers, levitation, yo, I could do that"" and doesn't let up through ""talkin' transubstantiation, any version will do"" and ""Moon in the rock, rock in the moon, there's a moon in my throat."" Its angular funky beat evokes the rage of ""Remain in Light."" One wonders just how awesome ""Pull Up the Roots"" would have sounded in the ""Stop Making Sense"" set list. The fiery chorus provides one of the most powerful moments on the entire album. Of course immensely evocative stream of consciousness lines permeate the entire number: ""Well I have a good time when I go out of my mind,"" ""towns that disappeared completely, pull up the roots, pull up the roots,"" ""I don't mind some slight disorder"" and ""and I hear beautiful sounds coming outta the ground, gonna take us a while but we'll go hundreds of times.""""Stop Making Sense,"" the film and the soundtrack, re-invented the band yet again, but this time also visually. Sadly, things fell apart and the band never toured again. ""Speaking in Tongues,"" though not the end by any means, does seem like the end of the heightened creative progression and innovation that evolved during their first five albums. The next two albums put Byrne back in the writer's seat exclusively and furthered the band's commercial exposure, though some critics and long time fans found the new ""for the people"" direction regressive, despite many admittedly strong songs. Regardless of diverse personal opinions, the Talking Heads were never the same after ""Speaking in Tongues."" The ""bad blood"" Byrne later spoke of seemed to start during ""Stop Making Sense"" and then climaxed a few years later as the band members openly defied and betrayed each other. One can feel some of this tension on a 1983 David Letterman appearance (now easily accessible via the new museum of television called ""YouTube""). After finishing a rousing live version of ""Burning Down the House"" only Byrne runs forward to Letterman's desk for an interview. The remaining band members, who share equal writing credits with Byrne, fade into blackness in the background. Then Byrne appeared by himself on the cover of Time Magazine. The other band members appeared almost parenthetically on the inner pages. Then, as if to even the score, a scathing Rolling Stone article featured other band members excoriating Byrne. It was sad. Wounds that apparently won't heal continue to the present day. It happens. Regardless of depressing personal politics, no one can deny the freshness and vitality that the Talking Heads brought to popular music during their insanely provocative run on the pop music scene. Their voluminous contributions still feel unprecedented and unsurpassed today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15IN4EDOUWMDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002KZ6#wasThisHelpful","R15IN4EDOUWMDM","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Simple stories provide a great way for beginners to a new language to stockpile vocabulary. Though such stories, with their inevitable limitations, don't always provide stunning examples of narrative drama, the Blaine Ray series manages to provide engaging tales despite the small number of words utilized. ""Patricia va a California"" builds on its predecessors, ""Berto y sus buenas ideas"" and ""Pobre Ana."" Though the preterite tense appears only later in the story, the narrative includes compelling themes such as multiculturalism, travel and reconciliation. Though not a literary classic by any means (how could it be?) it provides a far more enticing platform for learning than memorizing vocabulary lists (which, admittedly, doesn't hurt either). Basic grammatical structures give words adequate contextual meaning to help meanings stick. The book even allows for reading without a vast knowledge of verb conjugation since the word list includes translations of the verbs in their conjugated form. This shouldn't encourage anyone to dismiss learning verb conjugations by rote, since extremely few books treat verbs in this simple manner and relying on conjugated word lists will only entrap learners in the beginner level.The story features Patricia, who lives in Panajachel in Lake Atitlan in Guatemala. Similar to Ana in the previous story, her family subsists on limited means. One day an opportunity to live in the United States falls at her feet and her family makes a large sacrifice to allow her to make the journey. She lives with a family in Ventura, California and soon meets the (presumably Caucasian) high school cheerleader Debbie Martin who mistakes Patricia for a Mexican and then loudly expresses her fervent dislike for Mexicans. Patricia's extremely friendly host family tells her to ignore Debbie's racist fulminations, but she can't shake them. One day Patricia sees Debbie cornered in her car by a man with a handgun. Patricia leaps into action and everything changes. This is pretty intense material for a beginner's book.Along the way the book discusses some aspects of Guatemalan culture and lifestyle, such as colorful huipils and some differences between indigenous Guatemalans and ladinos. Morality also plays a large role, including suggestions of anti-racism, anti-materialism and reconciliation. Those who made it through ""Pobre Ana"" will have little difficulty finishing this equally short book, though, as already said, the preterite appears a little over half way through, as do constructions with verbs and prepositions such as ""para comer."" So, true to the purpose of the entire series, expect slightly more advanced grammar from ""Pobre Ana."" The series continues with ""Casi se Muere"" which still remains at level 1, though also builds on material presented here. Overall, the Blaine Ray series presents great supplemental reading for learning Spanish. It can't take the place of more traditional learning, but it will enhance and enliven the experience of learning another language - and it may make those monotonous but necessary verb drills more meaningful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28C3VAB2PC3JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=092972450X#wasThisHelpful","R28C3VAB2PC3JL","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hammered coins contain a certain ineffable something. Perhaps the fact that an actual human hand held a mallet that struck a design into a thin blank planchet provides a direct personal link to an actual historical person? After all, we know at least one person had to have held a hammered coin. Or maybe just their sheer age, which obviously extends far beyond machine stuck coins, conjures up lost eras? Whatever the attraction, hammered coins definitely possess their own distinct and potentially addictive aura. Those coming to these fascinating artifacts from more modern machine made coins will find a dizzying array of types, countries, historic figures and often undecipherable legends. What does ""EDW R ANGL DNS HYB"" mean anyway? One has to start somewhere, after all, and when it comes to exploring hammered coins for the first time a good strategy remains starting with a limited scope and working slowly outwards. ""England's Striking History"" provides an excellent starting point for those seeking knowledge of this almost incomprehensible field. Keeping the beginner in mine, it limits itself to silver hammered coins of England. Presumably, those just starting out, especially those with limited budgets, won't begin by bidding on extravagantly expensive gold nobles or crowns. This book simply removes those distracting and pricey relics by showing the reader just what great things exist in more moderately priced English silver struck between 959 and 1663. The coins included in this book alone could keep a hammered coin addict occupied for years, if not for a lifetime. But, as the text itself admits, this book remains a good starting point, not a good ending point.One characteristic that may attract or repel certain readers is that the book presents only illustrations of the coins discussed. Each one contains great detail and many even depict the inevitable flaws that hammered coins possess. Still, the only photo of a coin in the entire volume, apart from a few advertisements, appears on the front cover - a penny of Edward the Confessor. A brief introduction argues that photos often don't help people experience a coin up close, so historical illustrations were instead procured from various sources. Opinions will likely differ on this approach, but many of the illustrations contain an undeniable beauty all their own. Also, most increase the size of the coins by a magnitude or so. A few places do show actual sizes and relative sizes between denominations, but the vast majority display as magnified. In most cases this helps with reading the often unfamiliar letters found on such coins. A early page called ""Confusing letters On Hammered Coins"" provides some guidance. Along the way, every legend gets spelled out in modern notation at least once along with translations. Soon everyone will know that ""EDW R ANGL DNS HYB"" means, in very abbreviated medieval Latin, ""Edward King of England Lord of Ireland."" Though some potentially confusing non-modern pronunciations do slide by. In Anglo-Saxon Old English, characters that look similar to a modern ""p"" (a ""wynn"") were pronounced more like a modern ""w."" The text does not point out that ""EADPEARD"" should be pronounced as ""EADWEARD."" Though a small point - this isn't a book about speech - it may nevertheless confuse those with no exposure to Old English.As an added bonus, a brief history of England accompanies the numismatic discussions. Each section gives a short historical background on the respective monarch or era and then goes into further details on the coins, mint marks and sometimes multitudinous variations of that age. The section on Henry I outlines 10 out of 15 groupings associated with his coinage. A page and a half of illustrations show the seemingly endless varieties of William I's coins (also spelled ""Pillelm""). Even Charles I's voluminous types receive adequate attention and features the book's largest coin, his silver Pound. Most of the sections list coins in chronological order from higher to lower denominations. The section on Elizabeth I reverses this ordering and begins with the halfpenny and ends with the Crown. Cromwell's Commonwealth receives only a single page and shows all denominations displayed side by side. No base metal coins appear and the section on Charles I even calls out that his farthings remain outside of the book's scope. The main historical section ends with Charles II's adoption of milled coinage. A short discussion on obtaining hammered coins, either in coin shows or by metal detector, ends the book, along with some frightening warnings on using electrolysis to clean hammered coins found in the ground. Other less risky cleaning techniques, such as using tinfoil and spit, also receive coverage.A single book cannot cover every topic, particularly one so vast, but some notable, yet understandable, omissions exist. For example, almost nowhere does it talk of value or pricing. After all, only wealthy beginners will have a prayer of laying their hands on many Anglo-Saxon coins, large denominations, Edward I groats or especially on anything featuring Richard III. The book could have included direction on more accessible coins, such as the often easier to find and relatively more affordable pennies of Henry III and Edward I. Not to mention the vastly different grading standards for hammereds. An XF may represent the absolute peak grade for many types. Apart from that, a few dispersed typos, a couple of illustrations that seem out of place and a note in the section on Henry VIII that ends abruptly don't distract much from the book as a whole. Though not perfect, its pros far outweigh its cons.""England's Striking History,"" complete with punning title, provides a great introduction to the nearly fathomless topic of silver English hammered coins. It won't overwhelm newcomers with quibbling numismatic minutiae. That can come later. The stalwart and enthusiastic may even finish it in a single sitting. Ultimately, everyone will finish this book with their knowledge greatly increased and their brains ready to tackle heftier volumes. Not only that, this small book prepares one for an appreciation of the numerous coins that our ancestors used throughout their daily lives and the messages and images that their leaders wanted to communicate through this once mass dispersed medium. A lifetime of fascination awaits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I1HUPNKKB534/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVZ8XLW#wasThisHelpful","R3I1HUPNKKB534","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the Magna Carta turns 800 a resurgence of interest in its origins has arisen. At the epicenter of this tale sits a highly derided king, King John, who many have proclaimed, typically without a hint of reservation, as ""the worst king in English history."" King John's sordid reputation apparently stems from his own actions and reactions to events occurring in his own 12th and 13th century lifetime. These eventually led to outright rebellion and civil war. This antipathy persists to the present day. A commentator on a recent BBC radio show called John ""an absolute rotter through and through"" and claimed that a subsequent 14th century claimant to the throne, John of Gaunt, was not considered at least partially because he possessed the name ""John."" King John's inaccurate and ahistorical inclusion in the Robin Hood tales certainly hasn't bolstered his historical standing either, at least in a popular sense. Other pejorative terms commonly thrust upon him include opportunist, womanizer, murderer, narcissist, usurper, inept, among others in a seemingly endless litany of bile. He remains the king that everyone wants to hate. Not only that, his faults often symbolize the weakening of the monarchy and the first glimpses of a more shared and democratic rule in the West. After all, the Magna Carta negotiations began during his reign and John's allowing the situation to degrade so putridly usually emerges as the root cause of this monumental political change. As often happens in history, a great evil somehow gives rise to what many consider a great good. King John's story thus remains a vital piece of the present day.Given that arguably true delineation, some claim that the Magna Carta story doesn't reduce to a simple moral tale of ""good versus evil"" and its accompanying and inevitable and perhaps preordained outcome. For example, Stephen Church's ""King John and the Road to Magna Carta"" attempts to retell the events leading up to the now legendary and almost mythical events of June, 1215 in a narrative that does not take the ending for granted. While never denying that the reign of King John remains an abject failure, the book depicts the historical events as an unfolding stream of possibilities. As improbable as it now seems given the patina of time, John's rule could have succeeded at many points. This experiment definitely shows just how encrusted John's reputation remains. Since readers now presumably know the ending, some may have a hard time not shaking their heads in disbelief as the text relates each of John's foibles. They may also show surprise or shock at the moments when John seemed very secure and trusted, even glorified. There were unquestionable successes too. In other words, the book's method may further demonstrate just how difficult it is to abstract away the individual events of a historical figure's life from the perceived outcome of the whole life.A story appears in the book's preface that suggests John did have success in mind from the outset. When warned by St. Hugh in 1199 of the dangers of damnation brought on by personal excess, John pointed out that he should instead focus on emulating the exalted kings who were glorified by the heavens. Once again some may find, contrary to the book's intent, difficulty in suppressing caustic comments such as ""well, that certainly didn't work out the way he planned."" Nonetheless, the point holds: John thought of himself as an entirely appropriate person to represent God in England. He planned to triumph.The introduction discusses the opening of John's tomb in 1797, some of the history of John's historical desecration and the absolute power obtained by the Angevin kings. Recording of court correspondence also increased during John's time so these artifacts arguably show more of John's intentions and thought than any previous king. The narrative then unfolds in chronological order beginning with his birth to King Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine. John first appears in the historical record in 1177, the same year his father gave him Ireland to rule. He had the standard royal education in Latin and French, though Gerald of Wales found him unknightly and ""least suitable for martial affairs."" An 1185 excursion into Ireland largely failed presumably due to his ignoring experienced advice. Four years later, Henry II died and Richard I, John's older brother, took the throne. John seemed intent on undermining Richard especially when Richard fell into enemy hands while crusading. King Philip of France (later ""Philip Augustus"") also loomed on the continent waiting for opportunities to strike England. Eleanor of Aquitaine protected John a few times and John miraculously found himself forgiven by his enthroned brother. 1197 saw John somehow chosen as the heirless Richard's successor. John succeeded to the throne following Richard's death from gangrene in 1199. At this point England still ruled large portions of the continent. In 1200 things look good for the young king, though some thought he ceded too much to Philip after he demanded the land of the Vexin. John annulled his first marriage and married Isabella. Her dowry included cities on the continent. By 1201 English barons were growing tired of foreign wars and unrest began to stir. A victory at Mirebeau quelled the unrest and troops captured Arthur of Brittany (though John sapped morale by taking all of the credit). Much brewed around Normandy, Poitou and Anjou as Philip rested his sights on expanding his territory. John's execution of Arthur sullied him in his contemporaries' eyes. Things started to go badly.John only saw the continent a few more times again after his trip there in 1203. Upon his return to England, he started an assault of taxation that greatly undermined the power of the nobility but greatly expanded his own already bulging coffers. The justification was war against the French as crucial parts of Normandy and Anjou and Poitou had fallen to Philip. New perilous drama arose when Pope Innocent III suggested that John appoint Stephen Langton as the new Archbishop of Canterbury. John thought others more appropriate for the title and resisted. The issue dragged on as John hoarded coin to recessionary levels and lived in open luxury. The 1208 William de Briouze affair, in which John jailed his wife and son who later died in prison further boosted John's tyrannical reputation. Trust in him began to falter. He also increased the royal forest, annoying more nobles and the Pope threatened to excommunicate John over Langton. Regardless, by 1210 John controlled England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. The book marks 1212 as the turning point. Predictions of John's death circulated. Those responsible were hung and any rumors of John's death were dealt with severely. By 1213 Philip prepared to invade England with the Pope's support. The crown would go to his son, Louis. But once again a miraculous defeat of the French fleet at Ghent saved John. Everything now weighed on John reconquering lost territories on the continent. Would all of the misery he inflicted on his own people presumably for this project pay off? Tensions heightened.Everything came crashing down at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214. Philip won decisively and any thoughts John had of conquering the continent ended. John wasn't even present at the battle, allegedly he was dealing with Poitou, which the author sums up as ""the most significant moment of his life and he was not there."" He found his kingdom in full rebellion. The barons begin talk of imposing a charter similar to that of the 1100 charter agreed to by Henry I. When they demand that he hold to its decrees John stalls and agrees to go on crusade, which sends Innocent III into fits of glee. Innocent, who once supported John's overthrow by Philip, now turns on the barons. By 1215 they find the Henry I charter insufficient and begin drafting a new charter which evolved from ""the Unknown Charter"" to the ""Articles of the Barons"" and finally to the first 1215 draft now known as Magna Carta. Proxies likely took the oath on June 15 at Runnymede and the actual parties met and banqueted there on June 18th. The mess seemed fixed, but clause 61, which decreed an unprecedented check on the king and instilled the right for the barons to wage war were the king not to live up the terms supposedly proved too much for Innocent III and he nullified the agreement as illegal in August. Outright rebellion followed. The barons sought John's abdication and replacement by Philip's son Louis. Louis arrived in England in 1216. The Pope excommunicated the rebellious barons and imposed an interdict on their lands. John had some favorable military outcomes but fell ill after a feast at Lynn. His doctors tried bleeding. Innocent III then died and was replaced by Honorius III. John also soon died while trying to make peace with the church that he had thoroughly ransacked. Whatever retribution he made with God, his kingdom lay in absolute disarray. In addition to losing the vast majority of his continental holdings, some of which he had given to his second wife as dowry, he had even lost control of the city of London. It's hard not to see this as an utterly disastrous failure.John's son, Henry III, then 9 years old, was rushed to the throne to keep any French claims at bay. A 70-year guardian was appointed and he amended Magna Carta to the 1216 version, which sealed a new agreement between the boy king and the barons. This version became the Magna Carta known to history. Louis' forces were defeated in 1217 and the civil war started under John's reign officially ended. The book ends with the reflection that John's own son, the same Henry III,  approved the effigy on his father's tomb at Worcester in 1232. This depiction of the then previous king, with drawn sword slightly bent by a lion, suggests unrest and rebellion. John's own son did not try to gloss over the issues of his father's rule, which probably helped solidify the already unfavorable reputation of this last Angevin king for generations to come.""King John"" does not include a detailed analysis of Magna Carta as the subtitle may suggest. It focuses on the life of King John and the events that led up to at least the first version of that influential document. The events of John's life shaped the future of both England, France and the Holy Roman Empire (Otto IV was overthrown following Bouvines) and eventually saturated the entire political thought of the West. This book, and the interesting narrative experiment it attempts, shows just how tightly his legacy remains indelibly intertwined with that of the document he fought so hard against. Though Magna Carta didn't come to full fruition until the reign of Henry III, the seeds were sown under the king considered by many as the most nefarious ever to hold the English throne. King John and Magna Carta. Magna Carta and King John. 800 years later the association still sticks. It will probably stick as long as humans roam this planet (after all, his name is on the document). ""King John and the Road to Magna Carta"" presents this important tale in an easily readable and highly enjoyable narrative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q3YBBYSCMLR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465092993#wasThisHelpful","R1Q3YBBYSCMLR8","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Dogs urinate on landmarks and the acrid scent helps them find their way back from where they came. If rain falls during one of these canine adventures and washes away all of those helpful odors, a dog may find itself lost and wander aimlessly through a world devoid of olfactory guides. Tom Waits considers these lost ""rain dogs"" an apt analogy for the underclass of human society who similarly find themselves lost, misguided or abandoned in a strange and muddled world. A sort of red light district Woody Guthrie, the portraits Waits paints on his 1985 album ""Rain Dogs"" resonate with broken dreams, miserable love, seedy greed and incessant transience. As many unforgettable characters and stories permeate this album as musical styles.This album arose out of the shadows of the ineffable and almost miraculous transformation Waits undertook following 1980's ""Heartattack and Vine."" Everything culminated with ""Swordfishtrombones"" and this brilliant foundation produced the arguably more brilliant ""Rain Dogs."" No more a slurpy, haze infested, wise cracking diner denizen, this amazing development represented, to some critics, an artistic leap he didn't previously seem capable of. Waits still hasn't deviated from this mesmerizing direction rife with creepy dissonance, arrhythmic heartbeat skipping percussion, throat ripping half moaned, half hacked vocals and tales right out of dark steamy alleys, foamy clubs and dimly lit bar stools. His songs never moralize, at least not directly, they just paint pictures and allow listeners to draw their own conclusions or to feel cathartically queasy.""Rain Dogs"" remains one of Waits' best and most accessible collections. Some of his most straightforward rock and pop compositions appear scattered throughout the more angular quirky tracks, creating sonic surprises whenever their relative consonance bursts forth. The first instance occurs after the seventh song. The murky ""Diamonds & Gold,"" which sounds sung through a dilapidated apartment intercom, reflects on greed and futile ambition, then explodes into the opening sonorous chords of ""Hang Down Your Head,"" an almost straight out rock song. One of Waits' most moving ballads, ""Time,"" follows and conjures piles of dead pigeons, anxiety rousing painful procedures, faded calendar girls, cars plummeting into water and bandages covering unknown wounds. Musically, it also feels comparatively straightforward and accessible. It would have made a great hit. Later, ""Blind Love"" goes all out beer splattered country. Fiddles and slide guitars on the verge of squealing express the passionate, but evidently misguided, love the raspy narrator bemoans.Unlike ""Time,"" ""Downtown Train,"" the last outright pop song on the album, did make the charts, but years later from the mouth of, of all people, Rod Stewart. This song definitely deserved more attention at the time of ""Rain Dogs."" An expertly crafted number loaded with unforgettable hooks and permanently unfulfilled and unrequited longing, it remains a largely unappreciated masterpiece. Around this time another of Waits' great songs, ""Jersey Girl,"" fell into the hands of Bruce Springsteen. A live version appeared as the final song of his exhaustively encyclopedic 1986 box set ""Live/1975-85."" With the help of ""Jersey Girl,"" the amazing songs of ""Rain Dogs,"" and various acting roles, Waits gradually emerged into public consciousness in the 1980s.The remainder of ""Rain Dogs"" wades into more typical Waits territory. ""Singapore,"" the jouncy eliptical opener, sees the narrator falling for a ""tawny Moor,"" sailing on a ship captained by a ""one-armed dwarf"" and walking the sewers of Paris. Gentle bells, skeleton marimba and a great guitar solo drive the murky ""Clap Hands."" ""Cemetery Polka"" features ""Uncle Vernon,"" who is ""independent as a hog on ice"" and other stingy deviants who claim ""there ain't no pretty girls in France."" The disturbing refrain ""hey little bird, fly away home, the house is on the fire, your children all alone"" haunts ""Jockey Full of Bourbon."" Even more incredible Tango-esque guitar provides the melodious color counter commentary. Wet lonely accordion opens the title track, which finds Waits declaring ""for I am a rain dog too."" It ends with the ominously poingnant line ""you'll never be going back home."" ""9th & Hennepin"" relates a sordid event Waits witnessed in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where ""all the rooms smell like diesel"" and ""all the donuts had names that sound like prostitutes"" and a crumbling beauty with a tattooed tear has ""nothing wrong with her a hundred dollars can't fix."" The final number, ""Anywhere I Lay My Head,"" closes the show a twisted but defiantly inspiring note. For the bellowing narrator, home can appear anywhere. He doesn't need anyone, has grown accustomed to solitude and will seemingly continue to follow his meandering path, declaring his home as his current location. This rain dog lives everywhere and so will never find himself lost. The closing horns echo a New Orleans Dixieland funeral.""Rain Dogs"" contains an almost overwhelming diversity of styles that magically weave into a cohesive whole. The seeds sown on ""Swordfishtrombones"" flourish here in astounding ways. The show doesn't end here, of course, as Waits continues to develop his renaissance to the present day. ""Frank's Wild Years,"" released in 1987, completed a trilogy of albums that helped establish Waits as one of the most singular, exciting and inventive composers of his era. And doubtless more is yet to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R6OZ3JY6ZRRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001FFJ#wasThisHelpful","R1R6OZ3JY6ZRRO","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many great responsive frameworks now exist and some developers may never need, or want, to know what actually goes on beneath the surface of these easy to use platforms. But some will want to go further for customization, fine tuning or merely for curiosity's sake. Anyone wanting to delve into the nitty gritty of how these responsive frameworks perform their magic will want to check out ""Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5."" ""MVC 5"" probably appears in the title for marketing reasons only, as the book's main concepts could probably apply to almost any web platform. A few chapters involve opening Visual Studio and creating MVC projects (sometimes MVC 4, sometimes MVC 5), but the emphasis remains largely on responsive techniques and client side code. Even the word ""mobile"" doesn't completely capture the book's main premise. ""Responsive"" probably works better. Perhaps ""Responsive ASP.NET MVC"" would serve as a better title? In any case, the book contains a lot of great information about making responsive sites that all definitely applies to developing for mobile devices.Though the word ""Pro"" doesn't appear in the title, note that the word ""beginner"" doesn't appear either. As such, the book assumes a decent familiarity with ASP.NET, MVC, Visual Studio (either 2012 or 2013 work fine), JavaScript and a little HTML5 and CSS. It espouses the now fairly familiar, and very helpful, philosophy that developers have absolutely no control over what devices their sites will appear on, so they should therefore develop sites that can adjust to different screen shapes and sizes. If you can't adjust the screen, adjust the site.A quick introductory chapter covers the main concepts at a brisk pace, but everything receives more detailed coverage later. The book first presents a non-responsive site to show off the many obvious disadvantages of this now aging approach. Then it turns this site into a responsive site using a flexible layout with flexible content, CSS media queries and the now ubiquitous ""Viewport"" meta tag. Code examples appear everywhere. A deep dive into CSS layout (called ""a bootcamp"") follows with CSS resets, floats, block and inline display, the box model, columns, menus and more. These early chapters set the stage for the rest of the book. Subsequent chapters cover voluminous topics, such as flexible layouts, flexible navigation, flexible content (with flexible text and flexible tables, images and video), MVC display modes, custom view engines, device and feature detection (both the hard way and the relatively easy way using WURFL), tips on optimization and performance, other tools for mobile development, touch development and finally frameworks.One of the best chapters discusses performance and contains very helpful tips that any developer should know to keep their sites from bogging down in the muck. Using Chrome Developer Tools and Fiddler as guides, it points out often overlooked flaws such as making too many HTTP requests, not using compression or not minifying. These concepts apply doubly to mobile development where bandwidth and storage often remain relatively tight.Some of the chapters just survey their subjects. One such later chapter called ""Native APIs, HTML5, and CSS3 on Mobile Today"" just provides very high level information on some newer technologies and techniques such as geolocation, web sockets, offline apps, transitions, canvas, etc. Most receive less than a page and very simple code examples. Two of the most challenging chapters involve programming for touch. These may cause some to flee in terror and let some of the popular frameworks do the heavy work. But anyone needing to make slight customized adjustments to a swipe gesture may suddenly find themselves deep in this material. Make sure to read up on JavaScript events before tackling these hefty chapters.Finally, the book discusses frameworks such as Bootstrap, Zurb, FitText, jQuery Mobile and others. Although it only presents a short list with simple examples, the book's website has live demos and allows framework shoppers to get a decent idea of just what each one may offer. Of all the frameworks presented, the author says that he had the hardest time setting up Sencha Touch (and no live demo appears on the website due to ""complications""). Though he also admits that it uses a unique approach. After making it through this fairly short technical book, one will have a new appreciation for just how much development time these frameworks can save.""Mobile ASP.NET MVC 5"" reveals some of the guts of the latest responsive frameworks. It takes readers beyond the frameworks into deep, and sometimes challenging, territory. Absolute beginners should probably familiarize themselves with a framework or two to fully appreciate this book. But anyone desiring a dive into what makes responsive sites tick should read and study this book cover to cover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1369U3LTY31P4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1430250569#wasThisHelpful","R1369U3LTY31P4","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of all the musical transformations that occurred in twentieth century pop music, Talking Heads' ""Remain In Light"" probably stands as one of the most shocking. Following three albums of highly adventurous and experimental rock the band reinvented themselves almost beyond recognition with sounds and rhythms heavily influenced by African music (Fela Kuti in particular) and mad stream of consciousness ravings. This landmark fourth album had few, if any, precedents in western popular music. Maybe the band's own ""I Zimbra,"" from their previous album, ""Fear Of Music,"" represents the closest, or only,  predecessor. Their fourth album's thick churning stratified rhythms propel the music in very different ways to their relatively more standard previous arrangements. On top of that, lead singer David Byrne, with a host of backing vocalists, shouts and moans lines sounding right out of a passionate pulpit or an angry poetical psychoanalysis session. Feelings of joy, dread, angst, revelation and foot-stomping epiphany permeate the songs. The result sent pop music careening in entirely new directions while simultaneously shooting a bloody rift right through the band that didn't seem to heal. In terms of sheer musical inventiveness and lyrical expressiveness, ""Remain in Light"" arguably displays the Talking Heads' at the peak of their powers.A few drum thumps and a defiant shout launch a powerful rhythmic machine that manically rolls on for five songs. The album's first lyrics also set the mood. ""Take a look at these hands!"" Byrne pleads to the drums, the skies and the limbic system. As the layered guitars, effects and the occasional video game-esque sounds glacier their way through the senses, the beautiful refrain ""all I want is to breathe"" wafts up from the miasma and offers a gasp of relief. ""Crosseyed and Painless"" remains one of the band's masterpieces with references to shape changing, feeling like an accident, and a rather impressive epistemological rap about the ineffable and murky foundations of facts. Absolutely anyone can relate to the song's fist pounding mantra ""I'm still waiting."" ""The Great Curve"" celebrates our ultimate feminine origins. We all came from the curvy hips of women. Adrian Belew's searing guitar adds an otherworldly aura to the song's fading conclusion. These first three songs follow the same format: an almost hypnotic unchanging rhythmic structure lays down a solid foundation and the musicians and vocalists perform various themes over it in a sort of frenetic rhythmic polyphony.""Once In A Lifetime"" breaks the structure of the first three songs and adds more unforgettable sounds and words. It exhorts people into waking up and acknowledging the incomprehensible patterns and events that led to their respective present moments. Many have doubtlessly shouted ""My god! What have I done?!"" when faced with such hideous revelations. Many simply don't pay attention and let the days pass. In some ways, this song builds on themes first presented two years earlier in ""The Big Country."" Yet another masterpiece. ""Houses in Motion"" features a dreary, and often hilarious, narrator decrying his previous uncouth habit of ""wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather."" The chorus explodes over Byrne's nearly monotone ramblings. A synthesized blowing wind solo drifts between two choruses and continues to haunt the song's instrumental second half. ""Seen and Not Seen,"" arguably the album's most forgettable song, appears to exist as a framework for the spoken word vocals describing people's attempts to change their facial structures by pure and concentrated thought. Not surprisingly, some people ""get half way there"" and ""change their minds."" ""Listening Wind"" probably ranks as the saddest of all Talking Heads' songs. An incredibly gorgeous and moving piece, it talks of the loss felt by an indigenous man following the European conquest of the Americas. Suggestions of violent and angry retribution weave through the lyrics, but ultimately the wind in Mojique's heart will ""drive them away."" ""The Overload"" ends the show with dire disjointed reflections: ""A gentle collapsing,"" ""I'm touched by your pleas,"" ""the center is missing."" A reverberating bass tone wavers ominously beneath these same observations as they meander just beyond logic. It feels comprehensible and incomprehensible all at once, making for a disturbingly meditative ending.Following ""Remain In Light, which apparently had disappointing early sales, the Talking Heads toured, released their first, and lesser-known, live album and essentially went on an extended hiatus. They returned with another great album, but one with a direction notably directed more towards pop music than the bold experimentation of ""Remain In Light."" During this three year gap, David Byrne released two solo albums, the Tom Tom Club formed and dominated the dance charts with ""Genius Of Love,"" Jerry Harrison released ""The Red and the Black"" and the band parted ways with producer Brian Eno (who  received a writer's credit for ""Remain In Light""; his voice also appears on several tracks). Apparently, the band had philosophical and musical disagreements that seemed to terminate the general path of their first four albums. They would subsequently regroup and find staggering success in the 1980s, but they wouldn't venture down untraveled paths again until their final album. In a way, ""Remain In Light"" cleaves their work in two. This, their most daring adventure, seemed to split the seams and initiate what Byrne eventually called ""bad blood."" They managed to hold things upright for eleven more years and through many more tumultuous periods, great music and even through wild commercial success. But likely the Talking Heads will mostly endure in musical memory for the creative heights they reached on ""Remain In Light.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCGEMVOKFK51J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002KO3#wasThisHelpful","RCGEMVOKFK51J","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Japanese songwriter Tsuji Ayano said she built her career around the ukulele because of her small hands. Their tiny size apparently didn't allow her to hold and play a guitar properly (did she try smaller sized guitars?). So she downsized all the way to the one of the smallest stringed instruments of all. Her trademark quickly became this dainty instrument melded with her melodious and often cute vocals. In her earlier music videos and concerts she often presented an almost catatonically stoic persona, rarely cracking a smile or displaying any hint of physical emotion as she strummed her poignant songs of heartbreak, longing and loss. This exuded an aura of disaffectedness, as though keeping everything in her presence at a great distance. Or did this help her deal with nervousness? In any case, it provided a stark contrast to her very emotional music.Ayano eventually signed to a major label in Japan, but prior to this she recorded a short and somewhat roughly produced independent album called ""Uraraka."" Containing just six songs, Ayano, her ukulele, a guitarist (supposedly not her due to the previously mentioned hand size issue) and backing vocals (perhaps Ayano overdubbed), it lacks some of the polish of her major label releases, but it still packs plenty of charm. Ayano fans will instantly realize that her writing, performing and lyrical styles all begin with this small album. She still sounds this way overall, but her songwriting has since developed exponentially. On this, her earliest available recording, her voice hasn't quite developed its full strength, some of the playing sounds a little shaky and it doesn't really sound professionally produced. Still, it probably helped her land a recording contract, so it goes way beyond tinny AM radio fidelity and rolls of sea shore tape hiss.Many of the songs appeared on her later major label releases. ""Kuloobaa"" (""Clover""), easily the most recognizable to long time Ayano fans, begins the album with a guitar introduction. Ukulele soon arrives along with Ayano's vocals. The final song, a beautiful ballad (which also sounds accompanied by guitar), appeared, along with ""Clover,"" on her first full-length album two years later. Snippets of tape-recorded ambient sounds fill some of the gaps between songs. Ayano's voice stands out clearly in these interludes. In one, she strums and sings a few bars of a song that surfaced on a later album. Another features a distant prolonged buzz, similar to a subway or train signal and a jumbled mass of voices. These episodes do provide some variety between the sparsely arranged songs. The CD booklet features photos of a very young Ayano without her now trademark glasses. It almost doesn't look like her. The back cover shows skinny lower legs terminating in sandal-covered feet with toes playfully touching.Ayano never found extreme success, even in her native Japan, but she apparently found enough for someone to re-release this 1998 independent album. The CD lists ""Living, Dining and Kitchen Records"" (""LD&K"") as the label, not her current label Speedstar. LD&K's website gives the appearance of a smaller label and Ayano's ""Uraraka"" doesn't seem to appear anywhere. So perhaps it now resides in ""out of print"" status? Ayano continues to record, though her output has slowed considerably in the past few years. Mostly known for her theme song to the Studio Ghibli anime, ""The Cat Returns,"" her Japanese blog shows her giving ukulele workshops, playing music festivals and hanging out with friends (and eating some incredible looking food). ""Uraraka"" offers a fascinating glimpse of Ayano's beginnings and also demonstrates how far she has come since those early glassless days.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNBWHAQK3HY9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005JZ4B#wasThisHelpful","RYNBWHAQK3HY9","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"No one can ignore the climate. We're embedded directly in it day by day with no real escape, whether inside or outside. Arguably, we humans emerged from climate itself and our fate and the climate's fate remain forever intertwined. After all, our ancestors, or even most of earth's life, could not have appeared, developed and survived if our global climate hadn't produced conditions amenable to life. Venus and Mars both seem like utter wastelands to our eyes, though either may have held life in the past or possibly will hold life in the future. It all depends on their climates, neither of which look hospitable to life at the present time. Only earth contains all of the elements and climate, that we know of, to help life flourish. Just how long this planet will remain habitable for creatures such as ourselves presents a rather serious question. In any case, our inextricable relation to our world and its climate make even a basic understanding of its workings essential knowledge for anyone residing on this rocky watery ball. It's our life support system, after all, at least for the foreseeable future.Gaining this valuable knowledge doesn't come easy, as anyone who has attempted to read ""Climate: A Very Short Introduction"" has probably realized. At only some 150 pages, it looks deceptively breezy and light. Begin reading and a density akin to neutron stars billows from its conceptually thick pages. Those with no prior knowledge of this hefty subject may struggle, especially if one's goal involves a detailed understanding. A book of this length can usually only impart knowledge of a higher level, but even considering that this book presents challenges. Still, those up for the challenge will learn so many fascinating and useful things that the effort will pay off in droves. As the information seeps in, it becomes more comprehensible. Prepare to read some chapters two or three times. Take notes. Draw the diagrams out on paper to enhance understanding. Watch supplementary Internet videos on the more difficult topics. Basically, make this book a study project and it will pay off. Even without these extra techniques the book will prove an interesting and informational read, but to really get the most out of it requires a deeper engagement than simply reading the words.The opening chapter, ""What is climate?"" provides a fairly easy beginning to the book. It points out the ways we rely on climate and how climate determines our lifestyles, clothing and even our cultures. Then it quickly moves into more technical areas, such as earth-sun geography, the creation of seasons and the transfer of heat around the globe, which ultimately creates climate. This heat transfer to address energy imbalance takes place in the atmosphere and in the oceans. Very detailed discussions of each of these mechanisms follows. Greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor) create the famous Greenhouse Effect, which, according to most scientists, both nurtures and threatens us. Many physical formations contribute to this effect via their albedo rates. The formation of the Hadley, Ferrell and Polar cells, the jet streams and the earth's desert and rain belts all result from energy transfer in the atmosphere. In the oceans, complicated spiraling motions started by surface winds results in motion modeled by Ekman motion, inertia and geostrophic currents. All of this fuels the circulation of heat through ocean water, which sends the Gulf Stream northwards to warm Europe. Further complications arise from the interaction between ocean water's salinity and water's freezing point. These seemingly simple concepts drive many ocean currents. These first few chapters provide a brain full of information that may take some time to digest fully, but it's worth it.Chapter three addresses one of the major misunderstandings around climate today: the difference between climate and weather. Weather is not climate, weather is localized. Climate determines weather, but climate warming can affect different areas in different ways. Some cool off, some warm up. As usual, it's not completely straight-forward. This leads into chaos theory, El Niño, La Niña and ENSO. Climate modeling, which spurns much current debate, through over twenty independent AOGCMs, and taking into consideration variable greenhouse gas rates, predicts temperature increases from 1.8 to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. This book appeared before the 2013 IPCC report, so it relies on data from the 2007 report.Subsequent chapters cover voluminous topics, such as: hurricanes, tornadoes, winter storms and monsoons; the effects of plate tectonics on climate (supercontinents do not appear friendly to life); icehouse (""Snowball earth"") versus greenhouse earths (and why we don't have either); the general climate of the past 100 million years (derivable from frozen air bubbles in ice cores; the controversial work of Bill Ruddiman; global cooling, which culminated during the Great Ice Ages of the past 2.5 million years; the earth's axis wobble and how it affects climate; Heinrich events; the Holocene and countless other topics that defy summary.Later chapters talk about the strong evidence for human-induced climate change (something that remains heavily debated in the United States media), the misunderstandings of ""Climategate"" (which resulted in no charges), the ominous effects of climate change (more extreme weather, floods, droughts, sea level rise and water and food insecurity), and potential solutions to the climate problem. Scientific groups have suggested three approaches to ""fixing"" climate change: reducing carbon emissions, removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and altering the amount of solar radiation the earth absorbs. The book favors investment in alternative energy to reduce carbon dioxide levels, geoengineering in the form of reforestation and Carbon Storage and Capture (CSC) and a huge emphasis on adaptation to current and future climactic conditions. It doesn't ignore the enormous political, social and technological barriers that obviously exist.A sobering final chapter looks at the current science around the fate of the earth and its ability to support life. Anyone desiring a happy ending should stop reading here. A new ice age could apparently happen anytime between now and the next 1,000 years. A new supercontinent, generally bad for life, could form in 50 to 150 million years. A few billion years from now the earth will heat up to the point where the oceans will evaporate. No multi-cellular lifeforms will survive this era. Eventually, even the most robust microorganisms will die off in the extreme heat. In around five billion years the sun, which doesn't have enough mass to supernova, will morph into a massive Red Giant, essentially frying planet earth. Later a nebula will form as what remains of the sun fades into a white dwarf. And that's it.Such a stark ending will probably result in reflections on humanity and our place in this enormous miasma called the Universe. We don't seem to have feasible alternatives to the planet that we inhabit and rely on. Miraculous technological advances need to occur before the idea of inhabiting the recently discovered, and light years distant, exoplanets even becomes a realistic consideration. We have enough trouble reaching the moon. This book will drive home our utter reliance on a life-friendly climate and just how complicated and fragile that climate is. Though densely challenging throughout, the effort pays off in vital knowledge and perspective about some of the most hotly debated issues today. Hopefully we'll do the right thing, but learning must come before decisions. As such, no one can afford ignorance about the complex but critical information contained in this little book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EOJJBEWB0IWR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199641137#wasThisHelpful","R1EOJJBEWB0IWR","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One could interpret the title of the Beatles' final album, emblazoned in high contrast white on black above iconic images of the defunct band, as an exhortation to ""let it go."" In other words, the band broke up, they're done, no more, they're an ex-band, in past tense, history, just let it go, let it be already. Of course no one could, not even the band itself. By the time ""Let it Be"" filled store shelves in May 1970 the once lovable mop tops had entwined each other in angry and puerile accusations and lawsuits that seemed almost satirical. So much so that Monty Python member Eric Idle spoofed this period in his hilarious parodic Beatles tribute called ""The Rutles."" His mockumentary announces that The Rutles released their final album, called ""Let It Rot,"" as ""a record, a film and a lawsuit."" One could laugh or cry at such painfully accurate satire. Litigation aside, by the time ""Let It Be"" arrived everyone sadly knew The Beatles as The ex-Beatles. Paul McCartney's departure announcement and solo album, which had appeared a mere month before ""Let It Be,"" had already trumpeted the most famous and acrimonious breakup in rock history. And no one could let it be.The album itself, by no means the best album the group had produced, almost disappeared behind all of the controversy. Culled and modified by Phil Spector from hours of tireless, and sometimes viscous, 1969 ""Get Back"" recording sessions, the album manages to still hold together and sound great, though arguably not quite as astounding as the Beatles' actual final recordings that produced the masterpiece ""Abbey Road."" Nonetheless, ""Let It Be"" contains some real stunning compositions, including the gorgeous title track, the equally beautiful ""The Long and Winding Road,"" ""Across The Universe"" and ""Get Back."" Punctuated by studio chatter, some false starts and a few tiny charming throwaway ditties, the album, especially for a Beatles album, sometimes feels a little uneven. But considering the album's source, hours upon hours of unedited takes, retakes and noodling around, the results approach the miraculous. Of course a few disputes arose. Though Spector's ""wall of sound"" enhanced Harrison's passionate lament to selfishness, ""I Me Mine,"" controversy surrounded the same treatment applied to ""The Long and Winding Road."" McCartney openly decried it, though the public didn't seem to care as the single throttled up the charts to number one in 1970. Apart from that, the remainder of the album comprises mostly rock songs, the relatively folk traveling song ""Two of Us"" and the bluesy ""For You Blue,"" notwithstanding. The Beatles seemed intent on returning to downright rock n'roll, the apparent goal of the abandoned ""Get Back"" project. ""Dig A Pony"" has a fabulously wailing chorus drenched with signature rock desire. ""I've Got A Feeling"" features wildly distorted guitar and a steady rock rhythm. ""One After 909"" hails from Lennon and McCartney's early days and almost feels rockabilly. The closing track, ""Get Back,"" recorded live from the Beatles' last public performance on a Savile Row rooftop, brings the Beatles to a rollicking close. What better way to end than Lennon's great ""I hope we passed the audition"" remark? The fading to legend began.That the Beatles never fully reunited probably accounts for their still enduring legacy. They remain the pinnacle of rock success and only the staggering increase in population since the 1960s probably allows others to break their sales records. Like movie stars that retired or died young, they ended at a youthful peak, remembered frozen in time at the moment of their departure. Since they also never returned they also never had an opportunity to fail or to release an embarrassing geriatric dud. As such, the band remains largely untainted, regardless of varying opinions concerning their subsequent, and admittedly sometimes shaky, solo releases. They managed to escalate popular music, once thought only the domain of vacuous bubble gum teenage sentiment, to an art form. The entire culture went with them, at least for a time. As they pushed their boundaries so did popular music itself. Progressive rock, folk rock and even alternative rock followed in their wake. Their influence has arguably begun to wane only within the past decade, and then only slightly. But all things must pass, as Harrison famously titled his first post-Beatles mega-release, maybe as poetic therapy for mourning Beatles fanatics. Individual band members never completely escaped their original quartet personae and the two still surviving members still haven't. How could they? The Beatles were a very big deal that resonated through multiple successive generations. Eventually, a far removed generation, possibly the current one, will no longer comprehend the big bang that the Beatles exploded with onto popular culture. Times change, but many legends endure. The Beatles will likely endure, at the very least as legendary echoes through the eons, as long as humans continue to study twentieth century popular music. When those future historians, now mere wispy indeterminate imaginings, uncover the box of musical wonders left behind by the Fab Four, doubtless they won't be able to let it be either. But who really knows how the distant future will judge or value the current age's artifacts? It's out of our control completely, beyond even our comprehension (as far as we know). So, at the risk of sounding overly repetitive or trite, let's take The Beatles' advice, enjoy what we treasure today, and let it be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WULV5LRO5T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025KVLV0#wasThisHelpful","R7WULV5LRO5T4","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Japanese artist Yoshihiro Tatsumi proves that comics, often associated with puerile adolescent escapism, can explore deep and disturbing elements of human life. He coined the term ""gekiga"" for a very adult-oriented subgenre of manga that encompasses everything from violence, perversion and alienation to even outright desperation. Often shocking in their portrayal of everyday people lost in the mass, they miraculously never come off as gratuitous or sensationalist. They seem largely realistic and true to human nature, which may explain their penetrating emotional power. Though Tatsumi's books have appeared in many comic book stores, often sitting right next to manga for teens and pre-teens, these remain adult comics through and through. They would without doubt receive at least an ""R"" rating today, though at the time of their writing many may have argued for ""X."" Nudity, sex, violence, scenes of death, mutilation and themes situated light years outside of the realm of more youth-targeted escapist manga permeate nearly every story. This work reveals aspects of reality that some would probably rather not consider, but that many know exist regardless of our idealistic wishes for humanity. Tastumi manages to show us pieces of who we really are, an incredible achievement for comic art.Comic publishers Drawn and Quarterly have reissued numerous volumes of Tatsumi's work in English from the 1950s to the present. The third volume, ""Good-Bye"" features short stories from the early 1970s. A chilling story, ""Hell,"" opens the book and features a horrendously misinterpreted shadow burnt into a building by the Hiroshima atomic bomb. A photographer re-energizes his fame by selling a photograph of this image and all of Japan rejoices and celebrates the humanity of what appears as a son dutifully rubbing his mother's back at the time of the bomb's detonation. One of Tatsumi's best and most disturbing stories, it sears into the conscience and deconstructs the human trait of seeing the best in everything. It also contains this volume's most horrifying imagery in depicting post-war Hiroshima. Not for the morally or visually squeamish. ""Woman in the Mirror"" challenges notions of masculinity and the pressures it exerts, not to mention the sometimes crushing social isolation of gender roles and expectations. ""Night Falls Again"" explores social and sexual loneliness in the mass. A young man trapped in a menial job frequents strip clubs and peep shows and finds out that he can't relate to real women. Though he revels in the seediness of Osaka, it also overwhelms him to the point of vomiting. Sex obsesses him to the point of all out entrapment and distraction. Total acquiescence seems his only option, or at least the only one he entertains. ""Just a Man"" finds an old man finally achieving his dream girl, but this astonishing realization keeps some important things from functioning properly. ""Life is so Sad"" deals with fickle loyalty. A woman working as a ""companion"" in a night club awaits the release of her husband following four years of incarceration. The man treats her with contempt when she visits him in prison. She professes deep love though he laughs in her face while accusing her of disloyalty. One night before his release, she breaks down and shatters all expectations. The story's final panel will leave readers pondering the woman's intentions and psychology, though some may disturbingly understand and relate. ""Click Click Click"" looks at the solitude of fetishism and perversion. An independently wealthy man seeks pleasure through women's boots and heels while simultaneously performing acts of charity. He lives for the clicking sound of women's shoes. ""Good-bye,"" the final story, takes place in post-war Japan. An American soldier woos a poor woman and promises to marry her. Her father comes only to beg for money. Following further betrayals, she disowns her own father in an inconceivable way that the vast majority of daughters wouldn't even acknowledge. ""Now he's just another man..."" she tells herself. Guilt, loss and the humiliation of losing the war reverberate in the story's recesses.Not for the faint of heart, this volume further testifies to Tatsumi's artistic and literary skills. He flouts the narrative form to great effect, dashing expectations of happy endings, some sort of ""life lesson"" or conclusive resolution. These stories may hit a little too close to home for some people, causing either cathartic convalescence or rabid disavowals of their categorization as ""entertainment."" Indifferent reactions seem the most unlikely. Thanks to Drawn and Quarterly, Tatsumi has now found an audience in the United States, though the book's introduction states that he remains almost unknown in Japan. In the book's closing interview, Tatsumi claims that none of his work received much response until a French translation appeared in 1983. His work didn't reach a wide audience until the publication of these collections in English began around 2005. He says he remained fairly poor throughout his artistic career. Thankfully, the relative popularity of these books has led to further releases of his work, including brand new material. Some things apparently take time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RG328U1D3WAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770460780#wasThisHelpful","R3RG328U1D3WAI","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The heyday of Baroque guitar has long passed, of course, though a mild resurgence of interest in this almost obsolete and rarely heard instrument seems to have emerged in the past few decades. It reigned as a dominant European chordophone from roughly 1600 to 1750 and eventually morphed into a primordial modern guitar. Much smaller than its modern namesake, with 5 string courses (each course contains two strings to create a doubling effect, like a modern 12-string guitar), it resembles a rococo ukulele and sounds similar enough to a lute for uninitiated listeners to mistake it for one. Many featured breathtakingly elaborate decorations on their soundholes, bridges and fretboards. Looking fully like delicate and precious museum pieces, most now sit ominously silent and out of reach, as though encased in some form of invisible solemn amber, in those austere temples of cultural preservation. Given that, and other obvious reasons, the musically curious must usually resort to reproductions to hear this instrument. Many incredible reproductions exist, including the one played by Jerry Willard on the collection appropriately titled ""The Baroque Guitar.""Containing numerous examples from four of the instrument's most celebrated composers (Sanz, Murcia, Logy and Roncalli), this entire album features solo baroque guitar exquisitely played with historically accurate techniques. From the rollicking rasgueado of ""Canarios"" to the more delicate finger plucking of a Prelude by Roncalli, it covers a vast array of Baroque guitar styles and repertoire. Many will recognize Sanz's gorgeous ""Maricapalos,"" often called one of the most beautiful melodies in all classical music. This and the rousing ""Clarines Y Trompetas"" that opens the album all come from Sanz's guitar method books, in tabulature, in 1674 and 1675. Murcia's ""Folias Gallegas"" demonstrates an interesting plucking technique that produces bell-like tones. ""Gaitas"" would provide an ideal soundtrack for a walk through a lush landscapes with perfect weather. ""Paspied Viejo, Paspied Nuebo"" contains a regal marching rhythm that probably suited the social class that had access to this music. Requisite dances from suites by both Murcia and Logy display the versatility and range of this small instrument. A reflectively lyrical Passacaglia by Roncalli ends the album and the musical time travel.This collection definitely evokes what we think its era would probably sound like. A general glut of recordings from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries obviously injects a dose of speculation into interpretation. Nonetheless, this album sounds genuinely historical and features an instrument that arguably fell into unjustified neglect centuries ago. Sadly, the trudging of history, power structures and the endless human fascination for the new can leave even astounding artistic achievements choked in the dust. This album helps resurrect one of those bygone eras filled with music that still remains appealing today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12LNDUE6LR283/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001KV2MVI#wasThisHelpful","R12LNDUE6LR283","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many consider the Tiffany Transcriptions the finest recordings made by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. They nearly define western swing, which hit its popular peak in the mid twentieth century, and exude an addictive spontaneity that hasn't lost its appeal for over half a century. The group's immense popularity likely derived from its inventive amalgam of country, blues, jazz, swing and even some shades of primordial rock. Churning fiddles, lightly distorted flying guitars, rollicking piano rolls, thumping swing rhythms and Wills' often hilarious vocal intrusions make this music instantly recognizable and timelessly unique. The Tiffany Transcriptions, recorded for a furniture company in 1946 and 1947, feature a fully live ensemble uncut and unaltered. Occasionally notes get missed and, in the days before perfectionist overdubbing, these rare flubs remain intact (recordings of false starts and complete breakdowns also exist). Wills' exhortations manage to crack up the lead vocalist more than a few times. Fun fills the air and everyone joins in. Wills even announces the soloists by name, graciously conceding the floor to some very impressive musicians. Though the initial  collection spans ten albums, many more recordings lurk in vaults awaiting discovery. Some of these lost recordings appeared in a two disc set in April, 2014 called ""Riding Your Way, The Lost Transcriptions for Tiffany Music."" More will probably arrive.Volume Four of the original ten volume set featured a Texas theme in title and song theme. ""You're From Texas"" opens with the Playboy's unforgettable theme song based on the excellent ""Nancy Jane."" The title track starts with a great ad-libbed moment (or at least a very effective scripted moment)  after Wills howls ""Texas, our home state,"" he suddenly says ""what you grinnin' about?"" and a band member answers ""mine too."" Without missing a beat, Wills drawls his trademark ""yeaaaah!"" Wills' commentary on the line ""you got a smile like an acre of sunflowers"" nearly breaks down vocalist Tommy Duncan. ""Beaumont Rag"" provides yet another great example of the band's ability to define swing. ""Lum & Abner Special"" begins with a tribute to fans who wore out 21 copies of Wills' staggeringly popular ""San Antonio Rose."" They then play an incredible version featuring a rather heavy, chunky and almost jarring guitar part where horns usually play in the song's introduction. Other highlights include the early cowboy ""Little Joe the Wrangler,"" the not so incredibly politically correct, but swinging ""Across the Valley From the Alamo,"" the stirring ""Along the Navaho Trail,"" the yearning ballad, ""My Brown Eyed Texas Rose,"" has Wills poignantly crooning with Duncan and the instantly recognizable ""Red River Valley,"" which the band transforms into a raucous foot stomping swing number. A closing version of The Playboy's theme bookends the album and attains adequate parallelism.Though this fourth volume contains numerous high points and amazing tracks, it doesn't quite have the power and pull of the three preceding volumes. Things get off to a frenzied start and then the energy lapses for a few songs, only to pick up briefly and sag a little again before the set ends. No one would probably call anything here outright awful or even missable, just not precisely up to the band's and the Tiffany Transcriptions' usual stellar standards. It still delivers enough western swing oomph to make more than a few listens worthwhile. The effect may even heighten for those actually from Texas. Texan or not, swing away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C8Y1KMHDMAOR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00124JCB6#wasThisHelpful","R1C8Y1KMHDMAOR","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Spastic. That one word may sum up the experience of listening to the almost amazingly hyper Japanese band Polysics. Mix a gallon of potent energy drinks with ripsaw distorted guitar, jackhammer pogo stick rhythms, frenetic half sung half screamed vocals and indescribable electronic treatments, then pour on a layer of mostly Japanese lyrics scattered with English words. Something resembling the Polysics will bubble up from that crackling static electric brew. No one would describe them as relaxing. They affectively simulate a mega caffeine overdose or a near death adrenaline rush. The polymorphic nature of their songs heightens the effect. Some flash from head thrashing rhythms to eerie synthesizer laden interludes, then back again to explosively jarring bursts. Music sounding right out of classic video games often punctuates their beguiling arrangements, almost as if the song had lost a life while gaming only to stand right up and face the world yet again. Until the end of the song, of course. Some may find the effect overwhelming.Their 9th album from 2009, ""Absolute Polysics"" may qualify as their most aggressively energetic. The assault on the senses never ceases. A short pithy instrumental called simply ""P!"" launches the album off video game style. Images of Mario bashing his head into blocks and smooshing mushrooms may waft from consciousness. This erupts Krakato style into ""Shout Aloud!"" a phrase that seems like a laughable understatement when juxtaposed with the wailing music that suddenly flows. Buzzy robotic vocals start it off, followed by triple time hammered aorta bursting drums periodically interrupted by a wall of synth filled with beguiling female vocals. A downright fantastic amalgam of styles and moods. ""Young OH! OH!"" continues the spaz out drenched with flaming guitar and more earth shattering beats. Guitar thudding like a pile driver in a flanger races through ""Hypnotize Go."" The intermittent countdowns create the aura of a war zone, with doomsday missles at the ready. Once again, retro video game tunes sprout from ""Time Out,"" another raucous instrumental. ""E.L.T.C.C.T,"" one of the album's best songs, features female lead vocals, an utterly angular and indescribable arrangement and an absolutely unforgettable chorus. This one almost approaches Captain Beefheart. ""First Aid"" probably qualifies as the album's most abrasive song as its bellowed chorus nearly stretches the envelope to outright speed metal. ""Eye Contact,"" though still a fast driving song, feels like a paranoid 1980s pop song. ""Wasabi"" ends the album with more female lead vocals, which often sound strangely cute, and esoteric melodic experimentation. All out end of the world chaos erupts a few times followed with the heavily accented lines ""just a little bit."" One last Armageddon, burgeoning with terrified screams of immanent destruction fade the song, and the album, and possibly all of existence, to conclusion. It probably accurately reproduces the effect of taking a mouth filling bite off a heaping mound of gleaming chartreuse wasabi. One's world probably would end. Screaming would happen, at the very least.Borrowing and deriving sounds and rhythms from western punk, Polysics seem to provide a logical extension of that era's musical exploration. They sound simultaneously historical and current. Futuristic throwbacks, they often dress in outfits that Devo would approve of while pumping out music that can sound straight off XTC's grittier early releases. They also hold the distinction, rare for a Japanese band, of making a significant splash in the west. They have toured the United States and appeared on UK television. Right around the time of ""Absolute Polysics,"" popular keyboardist Kayo left the band. In 2004 she had also recorded a relatively laid back solo EP. She apparently wanted to try having a ""normal life."" After years in the hyperactive Polysics, her pulse has probably just returned to normal. The band now records and tours as a trio, with no sign of their addictive pep having waned. ""Absolute Polysics"" showcases the band at their best and may even provide a safer alternative to energy drinks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U5PXC0KABLAW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002UOKXYC#wasThisHelpful","R3U5PXC0KABLAW","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Anyone who creates websites, particularly ones requiring security, should know at least the basics of HTTP. This ubiquitous and simple protocol essentially runs the entire Internet using simple text messages transmitted between web servers and other proxies. Beneath all that web application code and ASP.NET session objects, HTTP sends the messages that make the world wide web work. The aptly titled, ""What Every Web Developer Should Know About HTTP"" will give anyone fundamental knowledge on this critically important protocol. Its main audience remains beginners throughout, so experienced developers likely won't learn a great deal. Regardless, those needing a refresher will find an easy to follow review.This small book covers a slew of topics, including URL structure, ""%"" encoding, MIME, HTTP request and response messages (focusing on GET and POST), HTTP status codes, numerous HTTP headers, the POST/redirect/GET pattern, connections with TCP and the communication stack layers, parallel and persistent connections, proxy servers (forward and reverse), caching (public and private), cookies, (session and persistent), authentication protocols (basic, digest, windows, forms, OpenId) and HTTPS. Some sections also delve into the trade-offs and issues with choosing one direction over another (everything is a trade-off in the end). Cookies have definite downsides, for example. They can provide an easy built-in state tracking technique, but not handling them correctly could lead to Cross Side Server Scripting vulnerabilities (XSS). Data stored in cookies, again, if not handled efficiently, may actually sit exposed to malicious eyes. HTTPS, though unavoidable in any secure development situation, does have performance ramifications. The book covers all of these topics and more in at least a high-level fashion. Best of all, most will finish it in one or two readings.Developers should quickly move beyond this material as their careers progress. By itself, it doesn't provide enough information to deeply troubleshoot HTTP issues, though it does point to useful tools such as Fiddler and WireShark. It will make more detailed books and websites more accessible. And after inhaling all of the information here, new developers should jump right into more extensive and intricate technical sources. The more one knows about HTTP the better one can uncover those annoying and difficult to trace problems that inevitably arise with today's more complex web development frameworks and platforms.

"Understandably, few will likely enjoy, appreciate or understand George Harrison's second solo album, ""Electronic Sound."" Listening to it cold, especially without any historical context or knowledge of early synthesizers, may give the impression of a random, possibly drug-induced miasma without direction or purpose. Anyone could easily reduce it to ""weirdness for weirdness' sake"" and drop the whole lot in the nearest rubbish bin. Not only that, even those possessing proper knowledge to comprehend this admittedly unique and bizarre creation may not find much pleasure in it. Parts of it do come across as mere fiddling. Everyone obviously has the right to loathe it. But to simply dismiss it as lunacy or as Harrison's ""Yoko Ono collaboration,"" or as a puerile succession of ""electronic burps and farts,"" as one critic apparently wrote, frames the album unfairly.In 1969 Moog synthesizers had just barely appeared. The previous year Wendy Carlos, then Walter Carlos, released an album of synthesized Bach that sold astonishingly well (Carlos also performed synthesized classics for ""Clockwork Orange""). Interest in this new instrument exploded and the Beatles, possessing endless musical curiosity, wanted to explore. Harrison eventually purchased his own Moog. At about the same time, Apple records then inaugurated their experimental, avant-garde and extremely ephemeral label ""Zapple."" It claimed to embrace ""new sounds"" and the Moog seemed like an appropriate candidate. So, in the spirit of the avant-garde, ""Electronic Music"" hit the store shelves.Listeners today probably find the synthesized sounds unimpressive or similar to early annoying video game noises (but perhaps it could spawn a ""retro sound"" movement). The intention apparently wasn't to write tonal music for the Moog, but maybe to explore the possibilities of the instrument. ""No Time or Space,"" the second track on the album, sounds like a playful Moog showcase. Some sounds on this piece mimic the real world, such as gunshots, fireworks, white noise, wind and bubbling. Others sound nearly otherworldly. It puts the range of the Moog clearly on display, whether one enjoys the show or not. And for 1969 this was probably pretty freaky and edgy stuff. The idea that a keyboard fitted with an intestinal morass of wires plugged into what looked like a miniature phone operator's switch board could produce such a wild array of sounds probably astonished many people (anyone who has played with an actual Moog knows the challenges). Arguably, the Moog at this stage represented the electronic music equivalent of the Atari 2600, apart from the price, of course. The synthesizer, not to mention home video games, have since evolved in shocking ways. ""Electronic Sound"" sits at the cusp of the electronic music revolution and it remains a historical relic of its pre-digital age. Though it definitely sounds dated to 21st century ears, the fun nonetheless comes through in the episodic pieces.Though few would probably consider ""Electronic Sound"" a masterpiece - not to mention the fact that George Harrison's name alone likely keeps the album alive - this new reissue and remaster preserves a moment in time towards the very end of the Beatles' reign when things began to change. Their final album, ""Abbey Road,"" featured Moog, which may remain Harrison's album's most important legacy. The reissue includes a booklet - also included with the download, thankfully - that includes all of Harrison's interesting cover artwork and tells the album's entire story, controversies and all. One of the project's collaborators wanted his name obliterated from the album cover. A blotch of silver paint under Harrison's name resulted. Also included are photographs of Harrison, McCartney and an obscured Ringo in front of a Moog. Looking at McCartney, arms folded in the back of the room, one is tempted to think that he wasn't too impressed - or maybe just exhausted. A final photo shows Harrison's ominous and nearly intimidating Moog IIIP today. One can only imagine what it cost in the late 60s. Concerning the unique cover art, Harrison's son Dhani contributes an intriguing story about how he came to possess the original painting. He also relates when his father interpreted the painting for him. Harrison, Neil Aspinall, Mal Evans and even Eric Clapton were portrayed in the artwork's thick childlike strokes. Dhani has nothing to say about the album itself. Lastly, Tom Rowlands of the Chemical Brothers provides an introduction about how he came across the album in a shop in Japan. He immediately bought it and claims that it still provides him voluminous inspiration. So not everyone has gushed hate on this album. Still, ""Electronic Sound"" will not please everyone and it often gets categorized as a mere historical curiosity. And maybe that's all it is today. Regardless, it showcases George Harrison's vast exploratory scope and, with mind wide open, can even be kind of fun to listen to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UXJTF1H1RMV0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIV83IE#wasThisHelpful","R3UXJTF1H1RMV0","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Moments before everyone thought the world would end, circa 1999, the now almost vanished UK band XTC seemed on the brink of an explosive Renaissance. Having wriggled free from a stranglehold recording contract, ""Apple Venus, Vol.1"" burst forth and coated the brains of happy fans pent up from years of forced abstinence. The band had a new liberating record label, gave numerous interviews suggesting that they now felt unchained from the musical equivalent of Hades and optimism and a new millennium awaited. Onward musical soldiers!But wait. Long time member Dave Gregory then ejected. Apparently it was personal. The new CD only pictured two members and demoted Gregory to the ""additional musicians"" list. The bane of all optimism is reality. Things suddenly seemed to wobble and crack. And, of course, the world was obviously ending since a year terminating in three noughts approached ominously. It was written. Well, it was written in the collective human psyche fascinated and somewhat deluded by the certainty sometimes promised by numbers.Right around this very moment a curious relic appeared called ""A School Guide To XTC."" What? School? Wasn't lead singer and songwriter Andy Partridge the self-proclaimed ""Mayor of Simpleton"" possessing no academic credentials of any kind? It turns out that the school theme did not denote any deconstructionist, phenomenologist, structuralist, existentialist or platypusologistic agenda. No degrees required here. All are welcome. School merely provided an outline for an extended essay on XTC written by Italian critic Massimiano Bucchi for the 21st installment of an Italian series known as ""Sonic Books."" This series had previously featured Don Van Vliet (""Captain Beefheart"") reading poetry, pre-Pink Floyd Syd Barret, Sex Pistols demos and other interesting miscellany untouched by vast distribution. XTC had joined the ranks, complete with a CD containing six tracks recorded by a somewhat primordial XTC under the name ""Star Park"" dating from 1972. Six years would pass before ""White Music"" introduced XTC to the world's aural canals. This CD represents some very deep archeology. Think pre-Neolithic.Star Park, as a listen to the CD reveals, had a ways to go. Perhaps that six year gap makes sense. Though by no means wretched, these recordings don't really represent a soon to emerge XTC on the brink of ""Making Plans For Nigel"" or ""Senses Working Overtime."" Many more adjustments, tweaks and tightenings would happen before fans and record labels took notice. Though many fans will doubtlessly see some glimmerings of the future in these obscure English basement tapes. Not to mention that such historical dives reveal that brilliance usually doesn't appear instantaneously. Though luck definitely plays a part, knowing that the members of XTC had jammed and fiddled for almost a decade prior to their initial public offering should serve as a dose of reality to those seeking quick success schemes. Still, the performances actually contain enough energy and playfulness to make them worthwhile for XTC fanatics and completists. Most noteworthy, an early rough ""Neon Shuffle"" appears, showing just how long some of the ""White Music"" material had incubated in the troposphere. The final song, ""Do You Really,"" with its Who-like power chord intro, includes a hilariously repetitive and desperate plea to a loved one: ""Do you really really really really really really love me?"" Flawed and slightly awkward, but nonetheless enjoyable.Though the CD may only serve as an enjoyable curiosity, the parallel English-Italian booklet contains the real treasures. Apart from a compact and interesting XTC biography (with some typos), it includes a fascinating 1999 interview with Andy Partridge that ends with his personal album-by-album reflections. Looking back on ""White Music,"" Partridge says, ""I now see it as naked baby photographs."" He also muses at length on his breakdown that ended XTC's frenetic touring schedule, to the eternal dismay of fans, managers and other band members. ""Mummer"" was written in the aftermath, with Partridge strumming his guitar in his garden accompanied by sips of beer. The outside world apparently terrified him for some time after. At the nanosecond of the pre-millennial interview, Gregory had left but things still remained chummy with Colin Moulding. ""Apple Venus, Vol. 2"" was in the works and XTC seemed solid as steel reinforced with reinforced steel, assuming the world survived the coming numeral flop-over apocalypse, of course.This little book and CD set captures a moment of brief optimism in XTC's late period as well as revealing some of the band's deep roots. Soon after, ""Wasp Star"" appeared in 2000 and things fell apart quickly. Partridge and Moulding experienced a ""friendship divorce"" and any hopes of an XTC reunion were dashed like baubles on concrete. Some fifteen years later, things haven't changed, though the intervening years have seen Partidge's extensive ""Fuzzy Warbles"" series and APE records (which occupies itself with XTC reissues on CD and vinyl) and a few extended interviews that bobble with tiny potential of new XTC projects. But sadly all evidence points to nil. As John Lennon said on his first solo album, ""the dream is over."" The XTC dream seems in a similar state. But perhaps they quit at the right time? Pushing on for the sake of pushing on rarely results in creative, innovative music. So though aging fans may bemoan the dearth of new material, perhaps XTC called it quits before any signs of real decline. Or, as a drop of deluded optimism shimmers, perhaps they just needed a long break? If we knew the future, we'd be bored stiff. In the case of XTC, we can at least enjoy the past.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28FS2QNM84E8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004GNBF#wasThisHelpful","R28FS2QNM84E8F","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Today's JPOP has roots directly in Pink Lady. The always smiling leggy synchronized dancing duo Mie and Kei dominated Japanese mainstream music from their first appearance in 1976 to their first breakup in 1981. Their hook-drenched, insanely catchy, upbeat, disco electronica inspired music sold in the millions and their concerts often overstuffed sports arenas into gargantuan mosh pits of desperately screaming and clawing fans. The usual ancillary rewards of mainstream success inevitably followed: they appeared in movies and cartoons, hawked numerous products in television commercials and eventually made their way overseas. They set the standard for massive success in Japan. Tiny leg-baring shorts, peek-a-boo navel tops, mirror image Busby Berkeley-esque choreography, striking exaggerated poses right out of super-hero comics and an innocent playful seductiveness remain necessary elements of JPOP to the present day. The unbelievably popular group Morning Musume, with enough members to fill a clown car, and other groups such as W(Double U) and Puffy Ami Yumi owed an obvious debt to Pink Lady. Numerous other examples are easy to find. As such, no one who studies twentieth century Japanese Pop music can ignore Mie and Kei's influence.Many Pink Lady anthologies exist and most of them are probably identical. Amongst these, one unique collection honoring lyricist Yuu Aku stands out. His name, painted in elegant Kanji calligraphy, dominates the cover. Not only did Aku pen the words for numerous Pink Lady hits, he wrote poems, novels, lyrics for voluminous other pop songs and was considered an icon in the Japanese entertainment industry even after his death in 2007. This special compilation appeared in 2008 and includes sixteen Pink Lady songs featuring his lyrics, which happens to include the vast majority of the group's most popular singles. But it does not include all of them, so those looking for a complete Pink Lady retrospective will only find a partial one here.Still, all of the most familiar songs appear, including their peppy debut ""Pepper Keibu,"" the horn and string driven ""S.O.S."" (not the Abba song), featuring the often edited morse code signal at the beginning, ""Nagisa No Sinbad"" with its unforgettable chorus of ""Sexy!"" and staccato aspirated vocals, ""UFO,"" one of their biggest sellers with creepy 50s space horror leitmotifs, electronic effects and an exhilarating chorus. The song order follows the release dates. 1978 marked the group's peak and their last million selling single, ""Monster."" Though they remained popular, Pink Lady overall declined and their chart positions fell dramatically in the late 1970s. Consequently, the songs become slightly less and less familiar as time progresses. The album's sole ballad, ""OH!"" from 1981 marked the group's first breakup. Aku did not write lyrics for Pink Lady following this era, so the disc ends here. But Pink Lady did not.Sadly, many Americans probably know Pink Lady from a disastrous 1980 variety show. Credited with single-handedly destroying the variety show format on television, it featured Mie and Kei with comedian Jeff Altman. It didn't work despite the inclusion of very high profile celebrity guest stars. By this time they had a hit in the US, ""Kiss in the Dark"" and several US disco albums. To get a general idea of how the US marketed them, one of these albums was titled ""We are Sexy."" Meanwhile, back in Japan times had changed and they no longer fit Pink Lady's style. After a farewell tour, a considerable hiatus, at least one comeback, and appearing to have barely aged, Pink Lady re-recorded their old hits with only slightly more electronic arrangements in 2010 and toured again. The recordings and concerts apparently sold well in Japan. Will they return again? The pair, though both are now approaching sixty, definitely have plenty of energy left, as their most recent videos show. Whether they strike another major comeback or not, Mei and Kei's, not to mention their famous lyricist's, place in JPOP history will doubtless remain secure for some time to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PK74NYJ7NHCT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014466WW#wasThisHelpful","R3PK74NYJ7NHCT","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By now, most people know the story. The slightly mysterious man with the yellow hat (""El señor del sombrero amarillo"") brings George (""Jorge"") to his house from the jungle and the little monkey (""monito"") never stops letting his curiosity lead him astray and into trouble. Of course, this trouble never delves into the extremely serious - ""Curious George Joins a Gang"" doesn't exist, for instance - but it does cause endless annoyance for those unlucky enough to stand in his frenetic wake. In this volume, he files a kite. Not in the dismissive ""oh, go fly a kite!!"" manner, but with his usual holistic never do anything half-way approach. Or, perhaps a better title would have been ""A Kite Flies Curious George."" Along the way he meets bunnies, a fisherman, voluminous fish and a very welcome helicopter.This dual language edition includes all of the English and Spanish text together on each page, with the Spanish text in red. Even some of the words in the drawings get translated, such as when a small bird bilingually castigates George from the margins with a scathing ""¡monito malo!"" Those using this as a Spanish learning tool should know that the translations are not literal and that all verb tenses, even the subjunctive, appear throughout. Given its level of vocabulary and grammar, this book probably best suits those at an intermediate stage. But those looking to break out of beginner's malaise and into more rich structures will find this book a particularly rigorous and satisfying challenge. The parallel language text also facilitates learning vocabulary. Overall, ""Jorge el curioso vuela una cometa"" serves as a great tool for learning either Spanish or English and remains enjoyable in either language from start to finish. Now go fly a kite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQGFLCBLJAEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547691629#wasThisHelpful","RWQGFLCBLJAEI","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"(original review from December 05, 2010)Sometimes things just don't work out. As Tsuji Ayano's reputation has risen in Asia, it seems to have dribbled into obscurity in America. In her home country of Japan, TV commercials now feature her music (a sure sign of success there, and becoming more so in the US, for better or worse). The venues that book her have vastly increased in size. She once toured coffee houses, parks, and tiny stages. Now her blog (in Japanese) features photos of performances at music festivals and auditoriums. The various You Tube clips that come and go also suggest that she's appearing more on television (You Tube has slowly become the real litmus test for popularity, apparently). Not only that, an official Tsuji Ayano ukulele has recently appeared on the Japanese market (for 69,300 yen, or about $830.00). The ukulele craze of five years ago has apparently not subsided, and Tsuji keeps riding that wave. If that wasn't enough, Tsuji had another ""hit"" with the theme song for the very popular ""Sgt. Frog"" movie series. After celebrating her 10th anniversary in 2009 with a double CD, she has now returned to form with her latest album ""Niji Iro No Hana Sakihokoru."" All the while, the momentum from the 2006 NPR profile, broadcast nationally in the US and still available on their website, has turned up squat. As such, Tsuji remains obscure across the Pacific.Of course much of Japanese culture never ""makes it"" in the US, popular or not. And vice versa. The language barrier really diminishes true cross-cultural communication. English and Japanese don't even derive from the same linguistic base. Not to mention the prices of CDs. A Japanese CD can easily cost twice as much in the US. In Tsuji's case, most of her work remains available only via import. So expect to pay more. A domestic release would of course solve this issue, but none have surfaced. Add to everything the precarious position of the CD. Its slow death march continues as independent shops close and bands turn to web downloads and touring to make a living. The situation looks just as bleak in Japan. Plus, many downloads don't transfer between nations. What this means for the music industry remains uncertain. For now it suggests a much more difficult exchange of music, at least where download gaps exist. Again, this appears true in Tsuji's case. Hopefully international sites such as Amazon will come to the rescue.Regardless of the music industry's overall condition, Tsuji has once again released a fabulous album, which likely won't quiver any airwaves in the US. The songwriting quality overall retains its usual high standard and most of the songs will hook on a first or second listen. Obvious standout tracks include the lilting ballad ""HanaYoHanaYo"" and the poppy third track ""HanaWo Sakaseru Hito."" Videos for both songs appeared on You Tube (in Japanese) prior to the album's release. Track 4, ""Asakiyumemishi"" features Tsuji at her most dramatic, with burgeoning crescendos. The rest of the album swings along Tsuji-style. Fans of her previous work will also revel in this one. But a few things seem different. The ukulele still serves as Tsuji's signature instrument, but here it seems lost in the mix on many tracks. The liner notes cite a ukulele for most of the songs, but hearing it may prove difficult, especially on the first few tracks.Also, English continues to creep into her lyrics. Three songs have English titles and a few others feature English phrases. So clearly Tsuji's attitude towards has changed since her 2006 NRP profile. There she seemed to disparage too much use of English in Japanese music. Tides change. Regardless of these details, Tsuji still produces some of the most beautiful, melodic, danceable and accessible music in Japan. Sadly, most Americans will probably never hear it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GJFGK7H50BG2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003SUP1BW#wasThisHelpful","R3GJFGK7H50BG2","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Most people living westwards from Europe across that massive Atlantic pond know Queen Isabella as the patron of Christopher Columbus who, from the European view, ""discovered"" the American continent. But many of the vast populations that already inhabited that land saw and continue to see Isabella's most famous protégé as an invader and a brutal conqueror. That now famous (or infamous) western year, 1492, also saw the expulsion of Spain's Jewish population and the final defeat of Granada over the Moors. Isabella played a central role in all three events. Allied with her also famous husband Ferdinand, this royal duo oversaw one of the most influential and controversial reigns in Spanish history. These years also produced incredible music and the Spanish record label Alia Vox has marked this era with the third volume of its ""Musicas Reales"" series. Similar to the previous installments, ""Carlos V"" and ""Alfons V,"" this one follows the life, rule and significant historical events of a single monarch. Each song represents an event in the life of Isabella from her birth in 1451 through the tumultuous year of 1492 to her death in 1504. The experience transcends music and introduces a historical dimension. Of course, as with other Alia Vox collections, the musical quality never veers from stupendous.Those looking for historical accuracy may find more than some liberties taken throughout, as many of the arrangements and tempos do seem enhanced for modern audiences. Nonetheless, no one can doubt the incredible power of the albums's first track ""Exultet Cealum Laudibus"" that begins with an enticing but almost hesitant bell ring. Soon after, the piece explodes into a Cathedral of sound that surrounds the brain in a cloud of ecstatic harmony. This energy never lets up, even when the arrangements become relatively minimal such as on the gorgeously lilting ""Pavana (Pues que jamás olvidarlos)"" that marks the coronation of Isabella in 1474 and ""Bassa & Alta Danza 'Mappa Mundi'"" representing Colombus' voyage. The sadly now late Monserrat Figeuras lends her mystical vocals to many tracks, including the melancholic ""Paseabase el Rey moro"" with its defeated refrain of ""Ay mi Alhama!"" and the even more tragic ""Lavava y suspirava"" in memory of the Jews expelled from Spain in 1492. A lighter moment comes later with ""Franeses, ¿por qué rrazón?"" in which the French army receives a good Spanish taunting for supposed cowardice and drunkenness at the battle of Roussillon. ""Patres Nostri Peccaverunt"" ominously marches in the Inquisition, which was also established during Isabella's reign. The final song, ""Requiem Aeternam,"" serves as an eulogy for Isabella and almost turns mourning into a tangible and immediate experience. One of the album's starkest arrangements allows the arching vocals to soar and float on a riveting sonic stream that nearly feels discorporate. Indescribable moments like these doubtlessly brings many back to Alia Vox's vast catalog yearning for more. Perfectly accurate historically or not, the music and performances justify themselves all throughout this album's almost seventy-eight minutes. Much of it remains unforgettable.""Isabel I Reina De Castilla"" continues Alia Vox's solid tradition of great music wrapped in history. As always, the booklet included with the CD contains detailed information in French, English, Spanish, Catalan, German and Italian (including some lyrics in Latin), and photos of historic documents, including illuminated manuscripts and musical scores. The CD's quality hasn't diminished an iota in the ten years since its release. ""Musicas Reales"" volume four was released in 2009 as a double CD all-instrumental set (with some reruns) entitled ""Royal Minstrels."" Given the amazing music contained in this series so far, one can only hope for more installments and soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP4U6B53I4MUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000QR1AXS#wasThisHelpful","RP4U6B53I4MUZ","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though the deep origins of human music will probably remain forever milkily obscure, no one probably intended it to make civilization seem strange, detached and sometimes alien. Pop music often celebrates or affirms a culture's predominant values and ideals. Rock n' roll embraced its own distracted, alternate ethos, which often resulted more in escapism and hero worship than in any meaningful scrutiny of reality. By stark contrast, The Talking Heads somehow made music that feels and plays like a distorted critical mirror onto their own society. Multi-layered, often highly hip-swinging rhythms, combined with sounds and effects approaching psychedelia provide enough ear candy to deflect the nearly deviant themes of the often twisted lyrics. As such, Talking Heads managed to provide a critical lens onto modern life and popular culture while simultaneously embedding themselves within it. Few have managed to inject so much intellectualism and artistic sensibility into pop music while keeping sales at reasonable levels of self-preservation.The band's second album, ""More Songs About Buildings and Food,"" sounds so refreshing, unique and singular that it seems like another debut. Their first album, ""77,"" sounds musically light years away from the follow-up's thick arrangements and electronically laden atmosphere. Many bands require multiple releases to fully gestate, but Talking Heads miraculously attained it after a single album. Like an infant blue whale, they grew up fast and never sounded the same again. The 1977 version of ""Stay Hungry,"" a bonus track included with the album's 2006 re-release, when juxtaposed with the version included on ""Buildings and Food,"" demonstrates this astonishing transition.Though the music exploded with a new frenetic inventiveness, the lyrics continued their skewed, confused look at human life in an increasingly technological civilization. One obvious standout track in this regard, ""The Big Country,"" fully rejects this growing mass culture with an anthropological literal bird's eye view. From the window of an airplane, the song's narrator looks down on the fields, towns and people, who scurry ant and flea-like between their established institutions and expectations. Though the narrator admits that such a life has some advantages, the song's chorus chimes the harsh conclusion: ""I wouldn't live there if you paid me."" Paradoxically, one does need to get paid, sometimes heavily, to afford the lifestyle in question. Regardless, the song masterfully lays the average American life starkly bare. Though it doesn't present solutions - a song can only do so much - it does present the often automatic suburban lifestyle as a question rather than an inevitable fate.Other songs also question deep societal norms. The jolting ""I'm Not In Love"" outright claims that we don't need love and that ""I believe someday we'll live in a world without love."" Equal to the seemingly deterministic suburban lifestyle, the emotion and value most treasured by that same lifestyle comes under scrutiny as potentially unnecessary. Were such an idea presented in a less musically seductive manner, the devotees of passion may cry heresy. Though one could easily see the song as a simple denial following a failed relationship, the lyrics' scope suggest a wider range of scrutiny.""With Our Love"" remains painfully relevant today. As many know, the combination of work and love doesn't mix well chemically or socially. The song's repeated cries of ""I have to get to work now... set an example for us!"" while elastic guitar riffs oscillate in unison heightens these familiar tensions to fever pitch. Modern angst pours from this song and many others on the album. ""Warning Sign"" needs little explanation following the opening lyric, ""warning sign, warning sign I hear it but I pay no mind."" ""The Girls Want to be with the Girls"" probably includes one of pop music's few lyrical instances of ""abstract analysis."" Is the song a celebration of supposed ""female values"" or an observation on gender tension? The sometimes vague words, like most good lyrics, leave room for multiple interpretations. ""Artists Only,"" with its wonderfully creepy instrumental refrain, probably satirizes the worst sort of art school student. Since the band formed while in art school, they probably had plenty of experience with people taking themselves too seriously (""pretty soon now, I will be bitter""). And of course the album begins with a frenetic horse gallop into an ecstasy of shaping another person to one's own designs and desires. ""Thank You For Sending Me an Angel"" seems to explore the psychological dimension of relationships that involves the desire of one person to ""improve upon"" the other, or at least the trap of seeing one's partner exclusively in light of one's own expectations and needs. The song launches the album off appropriately and the energy never ceases until the first nanosecond of silence following the closing song.""More Songs About Buildings And Food"" stands amongst the Talking Heads' best work and amongst some of the best rock/pop produced in the late 1970s. The influence of producer Brian Eno stands out saliently and he helped propel the band forwards into increasingly innovative territory. The entire album, even the minor hit, an Eno-treated cover version of Al Green's ""Take Me To The River,"" sounds amazingly fresh some thirty-six years later. Perhaps this is partly because the intervening years have seen an increasing commodification of pop music and a considerable de-emphasis on innovation and exploration. The bucks now seem to reign. Though the Talking Heads would eventually climb the popular charts in the 1980s, in 1978 their sales were by no means stellar. This remained true even up until their universally acclaimed album ""Remain in Light."" Would this important band have survived for so long in today's money music environment? Or would they have been relegated to Internet obscurity? Of course no one can say, but we can remain happy that these musically curious art students decided to take a different course in life and that they happened to live in a time that welcomed, or at least allowed, their askew questioning and angular perspectives. And 1978 was only the beginning, or maybe the second beginning?","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI6QZZY1V1RQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012EGDZY#wasThisHelpful","RI6QZZY1V1RQM","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like a rare colorful fish that nobody ever sees because one has to go out of their way to find it, Robyn Hitchcock has always bubbled deep under the surface of pop music. Almost forty years after the first Soft Boys EP, he still releases albums regularly and many now refer to him as ""legendary."" Regardless, he remains obscure and nearly locked away in that prickly subsumation of ""cult figure."" For some this would spell doom: an ephemeral career lit at both ends and in all orifices that more explodes and disappears than fizzles out. But Hitchcock somehow sustains himself on this tenuous but enviable status despite his own observation that his record sales never exceeded a pip's length. But at one time, in the halcyon days of the late 1980s, when what obsessive music categorizers now denote as ""jangle pop"" reigned, things looked quite prosperous for Hitchcock and his band of Egyptians. The  peak occurred in 1988, when the band signed to the A&M label and released the appropriately Hitchcockian titled album ""Globe of Frogs.""Those who know Hitchcock at all probably know this album's ""hit,"" ""Balloon Man."" It barely made a squeak on the mainstream music charts, but reached the heights of the ""alternative"" and ""college"" radio charts, then just beginning their longstanding lurking in that new subterranean dominion. ""Balloon Man,"" in terms of 1988, fit none of the weary molds of mainstream music. In a year when George Micheal's ""Faith,"" INXS' ""Need You Tonight,"" Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" and the former Beatle George Harrison's final hit ""Got My Mind Set On You"" set the standards for hot pop music, a song about a fat man vomiting in someone's hands on the street sat doomed from inception. But if Hitchcock courted mass fame and self-absorbed I me mine adulation, he would have never considered the idea of considering releasing ""Globe of Frogs."" This, along with his addictive musical hooks and often impenetrably surreal lyrics, has likely kept his tiny dominion glued to their seats for decades.As a whole, ""Globe of Frogs"" presents one of Hitchcock's most consistently strong collections. Aside the jangly fun ""Balloon Man,"" sits the brooding and disturbing ""Luminous Rose"" with its imagery of fish slowly eating legions of drowned sailors. Some of the rougher numbers, ""Sleeping With Your Devil Mask"" and ""The Shapes Between Us Turn Into Animals"" showcase Hitchcock's more driving and distorted side. ""Tropical Flesh Mandala"" defines catchiness, regardless of its elliptical and oblique lyrics: ""Lying out there on the beach, was a pleasant growth,"" ""Feeling so good natured I could drool,"" and ""It was covered in pink scales, lots of tiny feathers. Valves that opened up and closed, very tight together."" ""Chinese Bones"" fits right in with the REM-esque sound that began to dominate ""alternative"" radio at the time. Appropriately, Peter Buck of REM (then still with IRS) plays guitar on the track. The album closes with one of the most underrated songs in pop history: ""Flesh Number One (Beatle Dennis)."" Peter Buck appears again and helps provides the jangly sound that should have projectiled this song into the mainstream. Perhaps the rather critical, world weary lyrics kept radio stations from playing it alongside ""Sweet Child O'Mine,"" ""Get Outta My Dreams, Get into My Car"" and ""Pour Some Sugar On Me."" Lines such as ""everyone worries so much about themselves,"" ""there's nothing happening to you that means anything at all,"" ""everyone wishes so much upon themselves"" and ""there's a house burning down on the radio, but we're in love, we don't mind"" stand in stark contrast to many of the self-indulgent short term Epicurean fantasies promised by so many pop songs at the time (and now). So perhaps never appearing on the charts just adds to its appeal.In recent years, Hitchcock has grown up a bit and moved slowly away from his previously maniacally biologically inspired lyrics. Though ""Unsettled"" was apparently an intentional experiment in non-meaning, lines such as ""in a hollow shoe the mincemeat sees for you"" and ""got a heart exact tomato flourish on a spike of greedy prongs"" and ""they are full of leather peas that rattle like a slow disease,"" ""it's all compulsion there's no choice, my mother's second name is Joyce"" from ""Devil Mask"" rarely grace Hitchcock's more recent music. He seems to now favor a more direct approach.The album and CD also included a ""Manifesto"" that seems to capture the album vis-à-vis human culture. ""This album does not deal with the conventional problems of so-called 'real' life,"" for which ""lines of cliché have been devised for and against everything."" Continuing, it states ""Within the framework of 'civilization' we remain as savage as possible,""  and ""beneath our civilized glazing, we are all deviant, all alone, and all peculiar. This flies in the face of mass marketing, but I'm sticking to it. So loosen your spine, bury your television and welcome to a Globe of Frogs..."" This pretty much summarizes things. The mainstream didn't embrace Hitchcock and Hitchcock didn't embrace the mainstream. Feelings were apparently mutual. No divorce was necessary because no wedding occurred. End of story.Sadly, ""Globe of Frogs"" and Hitchcock's other A&M recordings seem suspended in a haze of ""out of print."" Fans of this album, ""Queen Elvis,"" ""Perspex Island"" and ""Respect"" apparently need to rummage in the modern equivalent of the used CD bin: the Internet marketplace. Thankfully, this means all remain readily available, but none of these albums have yet to appear in downloadable format. Some may find this a plus. In any case, ""Globe of Frogs,"" one of Robyn Hitchcock's best albums, will hopefully stay perpetually available to anyone seeking an aesthetic experience of a slightly less consumerist bent. Let's all be trouts next time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPXBFFFJ0889/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002GHU#wasThisHelpful","R1MPXBFFFJ0889","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the 1980s the young country of Somalia found itself stuck between two superpowers and wracked by violence and misery. A few years earlier, Somali General Siad Barre, backed by the Soviet Union, had invaded and claimed lands in neighboring Ethiopia. The Soviet Union then surprisingly switched alliances and supported Ethiopia. Barre called on the United States and Britain for help, but in the end he had to pull out of Ethiopia. Subsequent coup attempts and executions destabilized and divided Somalia into war zones. Famine followed. International food aid couldn't penetrate the region's carnage and corruption and the U.N. sanctioned humanitarian military intervention. An attempt to capture warlord Farrah Aidid, who had attacked Pakistani troops, led to the infamous ""Black Hawk Down"" incident. American troops were killed and President Clinton ordered the U.S. to leave. All other countries followed suit, leaving a smoldering Somalia behind. With few options remaining, people fled. A particular group of refugees went to Kenya and, following more indescribable hardship, some eventually found their way to San Diego. Lacking opportunities in California, a 1992 help wanted ad for a food processing plant inspired some to move to the considerably more frigid climate of Marshall, Minnesota. They found work almost immediately, encouraging others northward. More and more followed. They established communities in Minnesota's welcoming and relatively tolerant atmosphere. Even more followed. Soon, some relocated to Minneapolis and continued building Somali communities. This continued until Minnesota, particularly the city of Minneapolis, could claim the largest population of Somalis in the United States. The small book ""Somalis In Minnesota"" tells this inspiring and often heartbreaking story of perseverance in the words of Somalis themselves.Three Somali words appear prominently in this tiny book: ""Sahan"" (or, roughly, ""pioneer""), ""war"" (meaning ""news,"" not combat) and ""Martisoor"" (or ""hospitality""). Basically, the ""Sahans"" that made their way to Minnesota spread ""war"" (news) to others of the ""Martisoor"" awaiting them in the North Star State. Hospitality in particular remains a central tenet of Somali culture. As the book explains, the word ""Somali"" means ""go milk for yourself,"" referring to the hospitable practice of allowing guests to help themselves to milkable livestock. Though many Somalis did find hospitality in Minnesota, the book also points out that things were by no means perfect. Many faced discrimination in housing, jobs and education. Language barriers in particular left many vulnerable to fraud or intimidation. Most Somalis also practice Islam, so religious tensions rose, especially following 9/11. Some Somali money-wiring companies were closed by the FBI. Not only that, the 2008 suicide bombing incident in northern Somalia exposed a group of young Minneapolis Somalis training with al-Shabaab. Voluminous FBI investigations followed. Further arrests and convictions in 2011, coupled with media coverage of ""Somali Gangs,"" led to much unwanted attention for the Somali community. Nonetheless, the community and Minnesota seem to have weathered this storm relatively unscathed so far. Tensions didn't rise as far as Somalis feared and outright hate incidents remained isolated and few in number. The book even highlights stories where Minnesotans went out of their way to protect Somalis from backlash, such as a Marshall Police officer personally asking a Somali family if they had faced any harassment and Project 504, which helped Somalis deal with unscrupulous landlords. Despite past and present challenges,  Somalis have overcome and built a solid community in Minnesota complete with Somali doctors, police officers, businesses, malls and community services. A Somali culture and artifact museum is also planned. Through all this and more, Somalis have become a genuine part of Minnesota itself.""Somalis In Minnesota"" provides a great high-level introduction to Somali culture in Minnesota, but its brevity can leave an aftertaste of ""not enough."" A breezy reading through its 70 some pages of content feels more like a mere starting point for this voluminous topic. Though some may want more after finishing it, the book was likely intended as an easily accessible general introduction, not as an exhaustive study. At this it excels. As Somalis have now become an intrinsic part of Minnesota, even outside of Minneapolis, everyone should learn something about their story and their culture. ""Somalis In Minnesota"" is a great place to start.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AVRP310MYWOJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0873518675#wasThisHelpful","R2AVRP310MYWOJ","A2WETFLJM0D6R0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2WETFLJM0D6R0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, this is an excellent book. Why 4 stars? It presupposes a fair amount of knowledge of R, Python and the analytic techniques used for the data science approach of marketing analytics. Newbies will struggle with the concepts in this book. It dives right into the code, the techniques, and the statistical measures used in the first example of how Miller made the decision of which mobile company to use after a move based on 16 product profiles using linear models and conjoint analysis. (a brief explanation of the sum contrasts and fitted regression coefficient follows with code for R and Python). In many of the chapters, there are appendices that have additional descriptions of statistical techniques and references.That being said, this is an excellent reference for programmers, statisticians, modelers, marketers and data scientists. Props to Miller for calling out in the intro the definition of data science, ""the new statistics, a blending of modeling techniques, information technology, and business savvy"" while also reminding readers that it doesn't mean abandoning scientific research, surveys, inference, or primary data collection. Not all of the information that we need or want is available.The pros: readers familiar with how to program in R or Python will be able to follow along. All the sample code tested have been correct so far. Python scripts are notoriously problematic in books because of the spacing requirements, but all those tested have worked. Since it's focused on using Python and R (both of which are free and have robust user communities), people who are familiar with the analytic techniques but who want to learn to apply it can do so without having to pay for software.Miller also includes concepts of data visualizations (often done through R, which has a number of great packages he references), data base systems and data preparation, all of which are major components of being able to efficiently answer the question. Data curation is often a huge undertaking that non-database people misunderstand.To get a sense of the comprehensiveness of the appendices, in the marketing data source appendix B, Miller also describes options for sampling (simple random, convenience, probability samples, types of sampling frame, cluster sampling, adaptive sampling, on-line surveys, telephone surveys, random-digit dial, and discusses some of the pros and cons of each (with words, not formulas). He also discusses the concept of a panel sample and the accuracy of the panel in being able to generalize the responses back to the population. The one discussion area that is missed when he asks "" How large a ample is needed to obtain useful information?"" is a power calculation - looking at what is the smallest needed sample to detect a difference in what measure is being used (improvement on an indicator/survey question; differences between specific populations; or to determine how wide a standard error is around the point estimate to see  what a detectable difference would be.Overall, though, it's got a lot of great information. It's dense and takes time to work through the examples and code (especially for someone like me who is just an R and Python tinkerer without a ton of expertise in those languages), but is a good primer that presents the concepts in a neutral way, allowing the data scientist to make up their own mind about how to approach the situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XF7PJ8JT4IL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133886557#wasThisHelpful","R2XF7PJ8JT4IL5","A3VGAP2KLCBNBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VGAP2KLCBNBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellently and conversationally written, Webb combines aspects of behavioral science and how the applications can be actually applied to improve life. There is focus (as is true in most books like this) on priorities and productivity, but the behavioral science tweaks add a lot to the reader's understanding. There are also sections on relationships, resilience (resetting after setbacks), boosting energy, and influence. She includes chapters on ""making it stick"" and things that improve meetings, emails, and jazzing up the routine.Well researched, annotated, and good to read, Webb has given several suggestions that are influencing the way I'm trying to go about my work life.

"Effective? Perhaps. There is some evidence that the effective dose of HCA in garcinia varies per individual body response, from 1500-2500 mg.

"It's unclear to me why this is published as ""Grockit"" (also a homage to Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land - where Grok means to fully grasp something) when it's a Kaplan published book. It's a different format than the Kaplan GRE study guides.This book helps elucidate what you remember, what you need to work on and the concepts you forgot. All the questions I worked through are correct (have had an issue with that for Kaplan books in the past), and explanations are good.There is an on-line component, which is important, as the GRE is administered online and online test taking strategies are different than a paper based version. The feedback from the online component is good - even gives an idea of which ones stumped the user most, with a time spent on questions. Users can see how the difficulty of the questions changes. The downside is that it's just a 6 month free subscription, so be careful in timing the on-line practice with the time you're going to take the test. By comparison, the Kaplan Premiere has 500 fewer questions online than the Grockit version, but has mobile-device study guides, a DVD of resources and a refund if the user doesn't score higher on the GRE. Barron's offers free access, video, and an iPad study app.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KS80X74ACRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506202683#wasThisHelpful","R2KS80X74ACRN","A3VGAP2KLCBNBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VGAP2KLCBNBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Play is exactly like traditional Battleship with new Star Wars ships. Each spaceship has a number of hits it can sustain (from 5 to 2). Players place their ships, then start calling out spaces. If hit, a peg goes in; red pegs are for hits and whites are for misses, until one side's starships are all destroyed. As a twist on the classic rules, there is a ""Battleship Salvo"" that allows multiple strikes on one turn.The ships include new ones from The Force Awakens. The Rebel Fleet consists of Tantive IV (5 hits), Millennium Falcon(4), Resistance X-Wing Fighter (3), and an A-Wing Fighter (2).  The Imperial Fleet consists of a First Order Destroyer (5 hits), Imperial Shuttle(4), Slave I(3), and a First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter(2).Assembly is a bit of a pain, which is where it loses a star. The ships have to come out of the plastic grid and have rough, sharp edges - they aren't super well scored. Then they have to be placed on these pegs, and it was a struggle to get a few of the ships in the right place and everything snapped together. Once assembled, though, it's fun to play and Sith-loving or Jedi-Loving kids of all ages will enjoy the game. The one change I'd make would be to have different colored pegs for the different alliances. (Red for Imperial and Green for Rebel). Overall, though, a big hit for Battleship or Star Wars fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROGQ9DFN9SS13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCL6#wasThisHelpful","ROGQ9DFN9SS13","A3VGAP2KLCBNBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VGAP2KLCBNBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are filling, contain little sugar, and lots of protein for the calorie ratio (200 cal for 3 g sugars and 20g protein).

"This ""Toy Box"" is a cart racing expansion for the Disney Infinity 3.0, and is useable across all platforms. It's a definite improvement over the previous Infinity racing games, and delivers a pretty fun cart racing experience (think Mario Kart/arcade racing) using the entire range of Infinity characters, including the ones in the new 3.0 Infinity release. You don't have to be the best driver - just the smartest! Use weapons strategically and get ahead of the pack.Some of the major racing venues range from Sugar Rush Raceway (Wreck-it Ralph), Tatooine Sand Dunes, Frozen, and Monsters Inc. Cars range from a Teacup (yes, it spins and goes upside down), Luke's landspeeder, boats, motorcycles, Cinderella's carriage (how that is as fast as Lightening McQueen is a mystery), motorcycles, boats...it can be a lot of fun to do things like put Sadness (Inside Out) inside the Teacup or put Yoda inside the Incredicar (Incredibles), or Olaf in a Speederbike...there are lots of amusing combos.Also similar to other arcade-style games, it does offer a split screen for 2 player fun on the same console. There are occasionally a few weird hiccups (usually in the beginning of a race) but overall, the gameplay on the tracks is well-balanced, engaging, and enjoyable. What really earns it five stars is the Monsters Inc track, racing along all the moving doors. Kart racing games all have a lot of similarities. However, the door factory with rail jumping is really superbly done and is very unique and definitely makes it worth the extra expenditure to get this add-on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7WQH90IE5F16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014N5AXWC#wasThisHelpful","R7WQH90IE5F16","A3VGAP2KLCBNBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VGAP2KLCBNBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This party crock is somewhat versatile as it can be used on the stove or oven to cook the food, then kept warm either via the electric base or under a warming stand (with a tealight candle). The heavy cast-iron enamel holds heat well, so the tealight candle actually does keep the food warm if a hot pot is placed on top of the warming core, and it is nice to not need a cord to keep food warm on a buffet. Because it is removable, it's also easy to wash. The biggest downsides are the size (1.5 quarts is pretty small) and the electric base, as the cord isn't very long. In addition, it's not on a timer, and has 3 temperatures: low, medium and high. It comes with a small recipe book with some suggestions. It's great for fondue or warm dips, a bagna cauda, or  a smallish appetizer. It's not a ""must have"" but is a nice addition for opportunities to keep food warm. It will definitely be getting a lot of use this holiday season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GUNL1YM5U7WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011PAJGUS#wasThisHelpful","R1GUNL1YM5U7WS","A3VGAP2KLCBNBB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3VGAP2KLCBNBB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've suffered from asthma and allergy for decades, and love to know how well oxygenated I am, so this handy portable oximeter does a wonderful job of helping confirm that I'm getting enough oxygen to my bloodstream. In addition to taking oxygen readings, this oximeter also shows real time pulse rate information, both in visual wave forms and numerical reading on a small digital screen. These are the primary two numbers that show up on the screen when you've inserted a finger to be scanned, and pushed the small button near the readout screen. In addition to the oxygenation and pulse rate, this oximeter also includes some smaller, more mysterious numbers that I had to look up in the written instruction sheet to figure out what they were--such as the PI reading, or ""Perfusion Index."" The instructions explain that the PI reflects the limb perfusion status, which also provides an indication of the detection precision of the instrument. I noted measurements ranging from just about 3% to up to 11%, and noted the instructions explain, ""The PI of a normal human body is 3% or greater."" Similar guidelines are provided for the oxygen saturation (94%-100%), and pulse rate (50 to 130).This device stays on for just long enough to note the readings, and also to give you time, if you wish, to get measurements for a finger from your other hand.This oximeter is battery-powered, running on two AAA batteries that can be easily inserted behind a removable back plastic panel on the opposite side from the display screen. It's palm sized, with enough bulk to it that I can almost fully conceal it in my hand when not in its travel case.I really love the protective soft cover carrying case for this oximeter, with its black cord, and I appreciate the small size of this device as well. It's easy to carry in purse, gym bag, or pocket, so it travels with you wherever you go.I received a review sample of this oximeter in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP45KULSHS6PY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017C0X3L8#wasThisHelpful","RP45KULSHS6PY","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These slightly-snug-for-big-feet copper socks are surprisingly comfortable to wear, thanks to their stretchy knit weave and padded soles. I wear size Men's 10 or Women's 13, so my feet run toward the larger size. I'm sure these socks feel a fair bit tighter on larger feet, but since these are the only feet I have and this is the only size these socks (currently) come in, there's no way to know for sure.The good news is that if you don't mind your socks feeling a bit snug, they're just fine. Think ""compression socks"" such as are worn to improve circulation for long times being seated, and that's about what these feel like. So if you do have larger feet, you can think of these as bearing both the benefits of copper socks and also compression socks all in one!I love copper socks for their antibacterial nature, preferring them now to other socks--even bamboo socks--that merely wick moisture away. There truly is something marvelous about the feeling of wearing copper socks in terms of having more energy, and feeling generally better overall.I received a complimentary pair of these socks in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KGH691UBSHX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144CYW8K#wasThisHelpful","R2KGH691UBSHX0","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And I am a larger sized person, who had read a previous review by someone also wearing larger garments. I can easily fit three underwear in the side mesh pouches as well as five underwire brassieres, and still have enough extra room in the main compartment for more lingerie, such as two more pair of underwear! Certainly the primary factor has more to do with the compactness of the brassieres in question.

"I love the way this bag has two separate zippered side pockets, since I often like to separate some items from the main compartment. There are two more zippered mesh pockets, providing speedy access to those items you'd like to keep in view, and a spacious center section that includes two more elastic mesh side pockets on the inside.This toiletries bag is small enough to pack neatly into any luggage, and flexible enough to be hung by a metal hanger wherever most convenient. This often comes in handy for those situations where counter space is at a premium. When not in use, the metal hanger zips tucked away inside a top pouch, out of the way and out of sight.I like the carrying handle atop this case, as it makes toting it around easy, and the sturdy, water-repelling green fabric make this bag a marvelous practical addition to any organized traveler's luggage suite.I received a review sample of this product in exchange for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FY9IUD16FJCH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8FRN4E#wasThisHelpful","R2FY9IUD16FJCH","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Peter Russell points out that the proverbial Emperor ""has no clothes"" in gently pointing out how our current materialistic paradigm with all scientific paradigms under its umbrella are based on the assumption that the physical world is the real world, and that space, time, matter, and energy are the fundamental components of reality. Despite the fact that nothing in Western science predicts that any living creature should be conscious, the only thing any of us can really be certain of is that we are conscious. There exists a paradox of consciousness that Russell describes as ""it's existence is undeniable, yet it remains totally inexplicable."" Clearly there is trouble in the material realism camp, since it's unclear how any purely material process can ever give rise to consciousness.From Science to God includes reference to German philosopher Immanuel Kant, who proposed that the mind is an active participant, and we construct reality for ourselves in the form of 'phenomenon--that which appears to be' as forms in the world which give rise to the perception of 'noumanon--thing in itself.' Immanuel Kant is now being proven to be correct, as scientists discover how our brains create representations of reality, and the senses we presume to show us 'how reality truly is' are simply interfacing with reality to share something comprehensible to us. Russell points out that there are two realities--the physical 'out there' reality and the personal reconstruction in our minds. Both of these realities can feel very real, and illusion and confusion can arise when we confuse the reality we experience with the physical reality.Beautifully written, and filled with insightful descriptions of scientific discovery and spiritual wisdom, From Science to God deserves a place of honor on every book shelf.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUAX4C71IUIV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1577314948#wasThisHelpful","R1DUAX4C71IUIV","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"8 LAWS OF CHANGE packs centuries of time-tested wisdom about how to successfully effect long-lasting positive change in the world. Schwartz shares insights from five decades of his personal experiences, starting with the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, and continuing forward to today. Until 8 LAWS OF CHANGE, those of us striving to achieve social goals with small community groups have relied upon good intentions and good luck when bringing together people of different experiences and viewpoints. To say results are not guaranteed is an understatement! I’m grateful to have been involved in a few successful projects involving a small groups of dedicated individuals working in the face of opposition and with limited resources. People working together to improve the world need help holding a consistent vision of long-term goals without individuals pushing their specific beliefs or agendas— and 8 LAWS OF CHANGE serves as the best book I’ve yet seen that provides a guide for accomplishing that. Schwartz’s 8 LAWS OF CHANGE are key success factors responsible for having brought about change in American society in such areas as: civil rights, women’s suffrage, public education, and environmental protection. Schwartz introduces the 8 LAWS OF CHANGE by expressing astonishment that every successful movement for social change he lists began with “a few Quakers joining together in common intention.” Individuals and the group: share a common intention; have goals but not cherished outcomes; accept they may not see change in their lifetime; accept lack of credit or acknowledgement; enjoy fundamental equality; foreswear all violence; make private selves consistent with public postures; and act from the beingness of life-affirming integrity. Choosing my favorite part of this book is challenging, since it’s so well written, and filled with fascinating accounts and people. Some chapters share a successful case history, and others delve into important topics such as: taking the long view, the power of nonviolence, the issue of authority, the power of intentioned awareness, and nonlocal consciousness. I’m especially fond of investigating matters of nonlocal consciousness and intentioned awareness, and was pleased to see that these chapters provided current research findings and useful practical tips.

"Embracing the Wild in Your Dog provides readers with profound insights into some aspects of dog behavior that have become completely disregarded--not just by dog owners and their families, friends, and neighbors but also by many of society's leading 'experts' in dog training and behavior. Embracing the Wild describes how over the past several decades, the relationship between Americans and their dogs has slowly and insidiously been shifting away from a working relationship, in which family dogs had jobs to do, and relished the respect they gained from assisting with household protection and hunting, among other things. Thanks in large part to remarkably successful marketing campaigns by the multi-million dollar pet industry, this relationship has changed. Rather than being seen primarily as wolves-in-dogs-clothing working animals that require obedience training in order to best assist people, dogs are now increasingly viewed as ""little-furry-people"" and treated as surrogate children, complete with all-positive behavioral conditioning.Bailey's point is that people disregard the ""inner wolf"" in their dogs at their own peril. Embracing the Wild truly shines when he illuminates the darker side of playing make-believe and imagining that ""little-furry-people"" can be trained entirely with positive conditioning, in much the same manner that American children are raised today. As a canine behavioral expert, Bailey is often consulted as a trainer of last resort, when all other dog schools and methods have failed, and the worst case scenarios have occurred. Families who can't comprehend how their adorable child-in-a-fur-suit could possibly have mauled another family member when they grew up together typically don't comprehend the basic rules for living that wolves (and dogs) abide by. This is the wisdom that Bailey's wonderful book imparts.I've always loved books about wolves, and I treasure the way each chapter begins with a quote about and picture of wolves, keeping the presence of these fierce wise predators foremost in mind. Bailey was blessed to have received wise counsel and guidance from a wilderness survival expert and mentor, whose teachings are some of my favorite parts of this book. Through experiences with the wild, we gain a sense of both our true inner nature and the genuine nature of dogs--with their wolf nature always present.Bailey writes with passion about a topic he cares deeply about, since he's seen a similar change in the way Americans feel about and work with dogs to what I've also witnessed in these past five decades. It's a wonderful book that casts our own past experiences in a new light, seeing fresh insights and new clues in old events--and Embracing the Wild inspired me to mentally review my numerous past associations with dogs.While I've had few opportunities to learn first-hand about wolves, my experiences with dogs come from having grown up in the 1960s in a California family where dogs were frequently a part of my life, and considered to be outdoor animals who had jobs to do. I do appreciate the dangerous side of dogs, as I have been bitten on two separate occasions by dogs--once as a young child by our next-door-neighbor's German shepherd, and as a college student / teenager while visiting a woman's apartment. I was careful when selecting and bringing a large (75 pound) adopted dog home from our local animal shelter as a pet for my daughter to choose a dog whose eyes I looked into and who met my gaze with mutual trust and acceptance. I knew that finding a dog who communicated the right level of inner knowing when gazing into his eyes was absolutely essential, so I visited numerous shelters over the course of several weeks before finding a dog to show my daughter for her to approve or veto. This large dog was a beloved part of our family for 16 years--far older than most large dogs get to be. In addition to the love we showered him with, we also ensured he always knew he had a job to do, and it was obvious how clearly he thrived on knowing his responsibilities. He kept our garden clear of 'varmints,' and on one occasion caught and killed a rodent we happened to be walking past. While such savagery in a dog can take us aback, these behaviors are clearly part and parcel of living true to the wolf within.I highly recommend this book to anyone seriously interested in genuinely understanding canine behavior.A review copy of this book was provided in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHRE8MKGHNHOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619334712#wasThisHelpful","RHRE8MKGHNHOY","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can't beat this towel for portability when space and speed of drying time matters. This towel and washcloth set comes in a handy mesh carrying bag, which serves as an excellent carrying case to toss into your suitcase or gym bag.The 29"" x 60"" towel has surprisingly big dimensions, considering how small it becomes in the mesh bag when rolled up (4"" diameter x 9"" long). I was also surprised at the softness of the towel's textures (except the stitched edges, which feel rough), and how well it absorbs water. It seems like a towel so thin wouldn't have anywhere to soak up water, but this towel does an excellent job of drying my entire body.The remarkable drying success of these cloths are attributable to their being a product of progress in microfiber materials. They are composed of 85% polyester and 15% polyamide, so they are not safe in the clothes dryer, and must be drip dried whenever wet. I heeded the warning to dry these in the dryer, so I don't know what happens if someone forgets and tosses them accidentally for a tumble with heat--but I can imagine the material might shrink or suffer some kind of heat-related damage. On the positive side, these towels dry remarkably fast, especially considering how absorbent they are.The towel comes with a stitched loop that makes it easy to hang it up at gym class or at home or while traveling on a hook, and of course it can also be hung up on a dowel like any other towel just as well.When I first removed the towel and washcloth from the mesh case, I thought to myself, ""I'll never get these back in the mesh bag again,"" but this turned out to be an unnecessary concern. One can easily get them back into the mesh bag simply by tightly rolling them together as one would roll a backpacking tent before easing it back into its case.This is definitely the best travel towel I've ever tried, thanks to its compact size, excellent drying capabilities, and speed in drying back out again so it can be rolled up, returned to its mesh bag, and taken on it's next adventure.

"I've enjoyed a number of Targus laptop cases, but this one truly is marvelous, since it has both wheels and backpack straps. It handily accommodates my larger size 17"" laptop, carefully protecting it in a compartment large enough to hold items you might wish to bring in a carry-on bag for a flight, an overnight bag, or books and notebooks at school. In short, this backpack is nothing short of wonderful, and is my favorite laptop case by far.If you've not yet had the pleasure of owning a Targus backpack, you might not be familiar with the high level of craftsmanship that goes into these wonders of design, nor how long these backpacks last. Though they are made from the same materials as other backpacks, Targus backpacks for some reason last longer under equal wear, tear, and weight conditions. They're just made to last, and they do that while looking fabulous the whole time.This rolling Targus backpack is especially wonderful for air travelers who wish to carry more than just a purse on the flight, but find they are subject to flight restrictions on carryon baggage.

"This rat trap worked great the very first day! Having said that, I also wish to point out that I live in a liberal community full of animal rights activists, and I fully respect that making a decision to kill rather than reform wild rats is an important decision everyone should carefully consider. Once one has exhausted all other methods for clearing wild rats out of places one doesn't wish to cohabit with them, it's then important to consider long-term results from the extermination method itself. The good thing about the old-fashioned rat trap like this one is that the rat does not experience a prolonged period of suffering as might occur with other methods (sticky traps and poisons), nor does it go on to possibly sicken or kill other creatures who might eat it's poisoned body. So once you've come to the point where a rat trap seems necessary, I can confirm that this one does the job.This trap is made of plastic, which has held up for the first week of use, and looks like it will last for a while, provided it's not exposed to destructive acids or strong UV. It should do just fine placed in dark areas, which are more likely to be where you'd be placing it anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GJUR54LEVGB8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001AH3DNS#wasThisHelpful","R1GJUR54LEVGB8","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I truly adore these CZ earrings, since they're just the right size, cut, brilliance and shape to add elegant sparkle to just about any outfit I wear. These are the classic types of earrings you really can wear from day to dusk, that make the perfect transition from work to a night out on the town. The color of these stones I got are deep sapphire blue, and they complement the color of my eyes quite well.In addition to the 18k White Gold Plated round CZs in blue, I also got these in yellow gold plated with sapphire, and in 18k white gold plated with white diamond color stones. All three of these are completely stunning additions to any outfit, since the simple elegance of their design does not clash or conflict in any way.The velvet boxes these earrings arrive in make outstanding gift cases, should you wish to give them as gifts--but it is worth noting that just as with any cardboard box, the presentation for gift-giving will be best when not snapping the box open and shut several times before giving it as a gift.The truth is that these earrings are so nice you likely won't want to give them as gifts, since they truly are fashion accessories you'll look for again and again. And if you do give them as gifts, be forewarned that you're likely at some future date to wonder, ""What happened to those gorgeous CZ earrings?""I love the length of the earring posts, and the hypoallergenic materials they're made from. The net result is that I can put these earrings on quickly and easily, and wear them for hours without experiencing allergic reactions I usually suffer from with non hypoallergenic earrings from other sources.A complementary sample of these earrings was received in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RH86DC8OQ006/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WIE78SS#wasThisHelpful","R2RH86DC8OQ006","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This gorgeous steampunk style corset helps create a marvelous costume--all you need add is just the right skirt or pants and accessories, and Voila! You've got one of the coolest costumes around! I'm a larger-sized woman, so I made sure to order the very largest version of this corset, which turned out to be a good decision, since even with the adjustable laces let all the way out, I still needed to skip the last two grommets in the back in order to get the lacing just right. And you needn't worry about having someone on hand every time you put this on, since there's a handy side zipper that makes it possible (if not entirely easy) to dress yourself. I'd recommend allowing a little extra time to get your corset adjusted just right in advance of the first time you wear it, since some re-lacing might be required.The pouches, buckles, and snaps really add a lot of pizzazz to this as a costume piece, as does the little mini-jacket with the choker-style snap-on necklace. It's these little details that set this bustier apart as a truly cool fashion find, helping ensure you'll be fairly unique when you show up anywhere in this! The pouches are strong and large enough to hold small things, such as loose change, credit cards, some money, lipstick, and your car keys, which is a nice feature if you don't have other pockets with  you and want to stay in character as your steampunk persona.The side zipper did run into a bit of a problem where it came all the way free between zipper pull and zipper tracks, but it's a standard kind of zipper problem that can happen--so just make sure you have a little extra time to deal with that as well as making sure your laces fit you, and this is one sweet costume piece!All-in-all, this costume is tough enough to wear on more than one occasion, and comfortable enough to wear for hours--or even an entire day. It is a corset, which means it reduces flexibility to the point you likely won't be wearing to to yoga class any time soon--but it's a small price to pay for being a steampunk goddess!I received a discounted item in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SPXOH5941MY5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015CAJZLC#wasThisHelpful","R3SPXOH5941MY5","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This sports bra provides good shock absorption that can work well for large-chested women (D cup and above) engaged in moderate activity, low-impact sports. This Miny bra is indeed comfortable, and it works great for me while walking, light jogging, and doing some martial arts. I like the way the inserted pads can be easily removed through side slits, since I don't need padding in a bra. I love the comfort of the material, and the width of the straps, so the bra doesn't cut into my shoulders. The fit worked beautifully, which was great to discover, since many sports bras I've tried are too small and completely inadequate for even the most moderate exercise--which was not true of the Miny bra.While large-chested women interested in running, jumping, and extremely vigorous sports might prefer something with greater support, I find the Miny comfort cross movement one-piece to be a marvelous addition to my sports bras that is just right for most all my low to moderate workout routines.Highly recommended!I received a complementary sample of this sports bra in return for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IDX3NY66BPP1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZR95QVW#wasThisHelpful","R1IDX3NY66BPP1","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At least three essential basics I wish I'd learned early in life are included in Becoming a Supple Leopard (BASL): how to stand, how to sit, and how to breathe. While some of us were fortunate enough to have parents and teachers advise us to sit up straight, stand up straight, and breathe deeply from the diaphragm, true clarity and specifics are seldom provided to such a degree that decades later, pain and injury is prevented and/or easily remedied through return to optimal body positioning. Instead, all too often I hear from friends and colleagues seeking a return of mobility and a reduction in pain that even when they get surgeries and take time off from movement, they still continue suffering from mobility issues.The three basic principles in BASL are: (1) if something's not in the right place, put it in the right place, (2) if something is not moving, get it moving, and (3) Work upstream and downstream of the problem. I love how more than one third of BASL is dedicated to helping people put these principles to work exactly where we need them most in our own lives with mobilization techniques. If you flip to the very last pages in this book, you'll find joint and body prescriptions for addressing a variety of aches, pains, tweaks and other assorted ""lagging indicators"" that it's time to address position and mobility of a specific area, such as: headache, shoulder pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, foot pain, hip pain, shin splints, or back pain.The idea from the title of this book comes from the notion that leopards stay in a steady state in which they are consistently prepared for movement, thanks to being naturally supple--and humans can attain a state of suppleness from learning correct movement and positioning. Most of us don't notice something is wrong with our bodies until we feel pain--what the authors call ""lagging indicators."" Sometimes by the time we notice something is wrong, it's really gone spectacularly wrong, to the point that we experience a good deal of pain and often serious reduction in flexibility, strength, stamina, and movement. The authors point out that many of our daily habits--including the way we sit, stand up, and stand--can contribute to injury without our knowledge.As a middle-aged athlete, I have discovered how much strain can occur to my body when I move in ways that are less than optimal. I also know lots of people who are experiencing reduction in mobility, pain, and injury. I felt inspired to spend a few hours reading specific treatment plans addressing many of the most common types of problems people tend to encounter, and I felt immediate improvement and reduction of pain by following along with the illustrations and exercises designed to retune my body positions and movements for optimal functionality.I love how this book is written in such a way that it's easy to immediately test the basic principles of maintaining neutral posture and correct torque on hips and shoulders. Not only are the principles clear and easy to understand, but some of the mysterious tips athletes have been hearing finally start to make sense, such as why weight lifters are instructed to ""break the bar,"" and what's really going on when you ""screw your feet into the ground."" The essential idea in the case of ball-and-socket joints like hips and shoulders is that it's important to take up slack that naturally occurs in those designs.BASL truly shines in providing techniques for working with painfully knotted tissues with a ""smash and floss"" method of providing targeted pressure together with movement to restore normal range of motion to short and stiff tissues, benefiting multiple tissue systems.The organization and structure of this book is great for quickly looking something up in the index when dealing with an immediate question or concern, or browsing through the sections that include: midline stabilization and spinal mechanics, moving joints from a braced neutral position, maintaining optimal torque, categories of movement, mobilization techniques and target areas, and mobility prescriptions.This book is an excellent addition to any athlete's shelf, and is especially good for people who'd like to learn how to work with their body with its current issues and shortcomings.

"Laurie shares unexpected heartbreaks and joys on her courageous and exotic journey, making Road to Shine a page-turning, spiritually nourishing delight. She begins her journey as so many westerners do, following the well-intentioned guidance of family and mentors. Somewhere along the way, after graduating from Harvard and working on the front lines of education and with education reform, Laurie discovers that she's consistently happiest, healthiest, and most prosperous when following the beat of her own drum, even when that leads her to far-off places and destinations as yet unknown.It's not often you come across such a down-to-Earth, laugh-out-loud funny spiritual book that helps you feel like you're side-by-side with the author, climbing dangerous mountain passes during lightning storms, diving headfirst down into a deadly white-water whirlpool, bedding down for a good night's sleep high in a jungle tree house, or deciding whether or not to accept a piece of fresh-cooked guinea pig.I love the way Laurie shares high points from many of the soul-searching workshops, classes, and adventures she's enjoyed. Road to Shine is the perfect vicarious spiritual journey through stone chakra clearing, intuitive readings, Outward Bound experiences, and desert vision quests from the safety and comfort of your favorite reading chair, as Laurie shares her path from approval-seeking Harvard graduate to heart-centered spiritual seeker and wise woman.Road to Shine has the bitingly fresh insights and achingly raw emotion of a personal memoir, with lots of healing belly laughs throughout, that reads something like Outward Bound meets Eat, Pray, Love.Road to Shine is a delight for spiritual seekers as well as anyone simply curious about what the fuss about personal growth is all about, and is a joy to read from cover-to-cover.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24CMOVJ84BONM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937612597#wasThisHelpful","R24CMOVJ84BONM","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yampolskiy summarizes the Singularity Paradox (SP) as ""superintelligent machines are feared to be too dumb to possess common sense."" Put in even more simple terms, there is a growing concern about dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) amongst some of the world's best-educated and most well-respected scientific leaders, such as Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates. The hazards of AI containment are discussed in some detail in Artificial Superintelligence, yet in language easily understandable to the layman.In Artificial Superintelligence, Yampolskiy argues for addressing AI potential dangers with a safety engineering approach, rather than with loosely defined ethics, since human values are inconsistent and dynamic. Yampolskiy points out that ""fully autonomous machines cannot ever be assumed to be safe,"" and going so far as adding, ""... and so should not be constructed."" (p 186)Yampolskiy acknowledges the concern of AI escaping confines, and takes the reader on a tour of AI taxonomies with a general overview of the field of Intelligence, showing a Venn type diagram (p 30) in which 'human minds' and 'human designed AI' occupy adjacent real estate on this nonlinear terrain of 'minds in general' in multidimensional super space. 'Self-improving minds' are envisioned which improve upon 'human designed AI,' and at this very juncture arises the potential for 'universal intelligence,' and the Singularity Paradox (SP) problem.Yampolskiy proposes initiation of an AI hazard symbol, which could prove useful for constraining AI to designated containment areas, in J.A.I.L. or 'Just for A.I. Location.' Part of Yampolskiy's proposed solution to the AI Confinement Problem includes asking 'safe questions' (p 137). Yampolskiy includes other solutions proposed by Drexler (confine transhuman machines), Bostrom (utilize AI only for answering questions in Oracle mode), Chalmers (confine AI to 'leakproof' virtual worlds), and argues for creation of committees designated to oversea AI security.Emphasizing the scale and scope of what needs to be accomplished in order to help ensure safety of AI are points such as Yudkowskiy having ""performed AI-box 'experiments' in which he demonstrated that even human-level intelligence is sufficient to escape from an AI-box,"" and even Chalmers ""correctly observes that a truly leakproof system in which NO information is allowed to leak out from the simulated world into our environment is impossible, or at least pointless."" (p 111)Since one of the fundamental tenets in information security is that it is impossible to ever prove any system is 100% secure, it's easy to see why there is such strong and growing concern regarding the safety to mankind of AI. And if there is no way to safely confine AI, then like any parents, humanity will certainly find itself hoping that we'll have done such an excellent job raising AI to maturity, that it will comport itself kindly toward its elders. Yampolskiy points out ""In general, ethics for superintelligent machines is one of the most fruitful areas of research in the field of singularity research, with numerous publications appearing every year."" (p 114)For those hoping that teaching AI to simply follow the rules will be enough, Yampolskiy replies that law-abiding is not enough. AI could still keep humans safe 'for their own good,' increasingly limiting human free choice in a sped-up kind of way, that superintelligent AI will be able to do.For readers intrigued in what safe variety of AI might be possible, the section of Artificial Superintelligence early in the book will be of great interest. Yampolskiy describes five taxonomies of minds (pp 31-34). Returning to re-read this section after having completed the rest of the book can be quite beneficial, as at this point readers can more fully understand how AI that is Quantum and Flexibly Embodied according to Goetzel taxonomy (p 31) with Ethics Self-Monitoring (p 122) might help ensure development of safe AI. If such AI systems include error-checking, with firmware (un-erasable) dedication to preserving others and constantly checking to seek and resonate with highest-order intelligence with quantum levels of sensing through time-reversible logic gates (in accordance with quantum deductive logic), one can begin to breathe a sigh of relief that there might just be a way to ensure safe AI will prevail. While the deepest pockets of government funding are unlikely to ever make plans to develop such a system that would not be controlled by anything less than the greatest intelligence seekable by AI (such as God), it is conceivable that humanitarian philanthropists will step forward to fund such a project in time that all of us will be eternally grateful that its highest-order-seeking AI will prevail.I highly recommend Artificial Superintelligence to all readers, as this subject will absolutely impact everyone's lives.I received a complementary review copy of this book for a fair and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGR2ZW6XYXICA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482234432#wasThisHelpful","RGR2ZW6XYXICA","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right out of the package, this headlamp sets itself apart from other headlamps, as it features a red LED switch in addition to the usual white. The red LEDs provide the option of illumination without losing one's night vision--which is perfect for use outdoors at night, or in locations where bright light would be irritating or hazardous for others.What truly sets this headlamp head and shoulders above the rest (pardon the pun) is that it's ""bright"" setting actually is bright. It's on par with flashlights of much larger size, such as we keep on hand for roadside use in our car. The fact that such a tiny flashlight can literally light up an entire room, with 160 lumens of AAA-powered illuminative ferocity is truly a thing to behold. The bright light setting is full yet focused, and so bright that people nearby can read by it with no problem.Headlamps are clearly superior to flashlights any time illumination is required, yet hands need to be kept free, and the LuxoLite design makes it easy to switch between various levels of white light illumination, red light, and SOS flashing mode with easy-to-access switches up on top.Warnings are provided on the packaging, indicating it's important not to look directly into the LED, and also a warning against children using this headlamp without adult supervision---because it really is that bright!This is truly the brightest, best, most versatile headlamp I've yet encountered anywhere.Highly recommended!I received a complementary headlamp in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD7ZCZ5CC1EFV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TEKW3KC#wasThisHelpful","RD7ZCZ5CC1EFV","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't been taking this supplement regularly enough to know for sure how effective it can be at appetite suppression and weight loss, but it does seem to be a fully natural supplement that helps regulate feelings of appetite in a safe manner.The mechanism by which Forskolin, aka Coleus forskohlii, works is that it stimulates the production of a molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP), and cAMP instructs cells in the body to increase an enzyme called hormone sensitive lipase, that burns fat. In a small-scale study of 30 men, it seems that Forskolin helped prevent people from gaining weight, more than losing weight.I certainly noticed no negative effects during the time I've taken it on-again, off-again. I did notice while taking this supplement that my snack-time cravings were reduced, though I didn't notice much weight (but also wasn't taking it regularly).

"This is an awesome supplement! First of all, it really is true that these supplements are easy to swallow.

"This knee sleeve noticeably reduced pain in my right knee when I put it on immediately prior to doing a 90 minute martial arts class. I'd been experiencing a moderate degree of knee pain before putting the sleeve on, and I felt dramatic improvement in pain-free mobility--with no loss of flexibility--within minutes of wearing it. I am truly impressed!The sizing for this product was as I expected, and fit as snugly as need be for excellent results. As advertised, this sleeve is odor-free after wearing, even after having been worn during a strenuous, sweaty workout.I currently don't require a full brace, so this very thin material that fits snugly is just perfect for giving me the flexibility to do the rapid movements required for my martial arts practice with full flexibility and range of motion. Some knee braces are rather restrictive, making it difficult to do correct crane stances and black belt jump kicks easily, for example--but this knee brace is so sturdy yet thin that all knee movements can be made easily.I'm very impressed with the way even after taking the sleeve off, my knee feels wonderful! Some knee braces feel great when they're on, but as soon as they come off, my knee can return to feeling less-than-terrific, but this Copper Action knee sleeve seems to work its magic during the workout in such a way that lasts and lasts!I am glad to see that this knee sleeve is easy to either hand wash or machine wash in cold water, though it really does seem to have antimicrobial properties (with no smell) after the sweatiest workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRA194AMLK2QS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QG5Y6IK#wasThisHelpful","RRA194AMLK2QS","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a treat to read a book about one of the most gifted remote viewers the world has ever known, from the vantage point of a dear friend of his, Raul daSilva. Seldom do biographies capture the true sense and spirit of the depth and breadth of a person as well as this compassionate short memoir manages to do, and I especially love the ""little things,"" such as descriptions of the walks and talks Ingo and Raul frequently enjoyed over the years in New York.This book is a fast read, so it's not overwhelming or exhausting, but instead can be read and reread many times. It's the kind of book that sinks in over time, in which the reader notices upon subsequent readings juicy tidbits and deeper significance of relevant details.Highly recommended for all spiritual and metaphysical seekers, and everyone interested in the subject of remote viewing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JAK02312V5DC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QLC3PSK#wasThisHelpful","R3JAK02312V5DC","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deepak Chopra writes in ""The Future of God"", ""Faith must be saved for everyone's sake. From faith springs a passion for the eternal, which is even stronger than love. Many of us have lost that passion or have never known it."" Chopra's ""The Future of God"" is a soulful, brilliantly researched, eloquently written response to proponents of material realism and militant atheism.I love the way Deepak explains in pure, simple terms, ""You are whatever your faith is."" Chopra explains that skepticism is a good first step to exploring and finding our faith, as he points out the important differences between bad faith--which we can identify by the way it opposes spiritual growth. Faith can be either a guide to spiritual growth, or an obstacle. It is possible to consider oneself an atheist and have faith, and it can be possible to have good faith--that improves one's experience of life, or bad faith--which can be recognized by the effect it has in the world. Faith exists in us as the core ideas and beliefs we live by, and these inner beliefs direct and inspire our every thought, word, and action. When we come to know that we ARE our faith, as Deepak points out, ""It then becomes vitally important to know good faith from bad.""Every generation faces questions of ""Who are we?"" and ""Where did we come from?"" In modern times, we find 'postmodern' themes questioning our identity in popular culture and movies, which invite us to more deeply question the connection between who we think we are and what we think we know of reality. Many are struggling with what they consider to be an absence of faith, without noticing that atheism can be viewed as a particular kind of faith. Non-spiritual scientists can be as faith-based as religious believers, to the point that they can suppress thinking and research in directions that don't conform to conventional guidelines. When scientists become close-minded in their beliefs, they can often unknowingly become believers in a faith of scientism--the belief that one day the scientific method will solve all problems. Proponents of scientism can be every bit as arrogant, self-righteous, dogmatic and intolerant as religious fundamentalists, which are indicators alerting us to the presence of bad faith.Chopra points out that while proponents of material realism and militant atheism such as Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Christoph Hitchens and Sam Harris profess to be voices of logic and reason, their prejudice in discrediting religions and spirituality is evident in their use of such derogatory terms as: 'superstition,' 'false consolation,' 'mind-fogged manacles of servility, 'pseudo-science,' and 'the God delusion.'What Chopra calls for, in order that God may have a future in modern human society is a new way of living spiritually, thanks to a total rethinking of reality. Chopra invites us to realize that, ""when you challenge God, you challenge reality itself."" ""The Future of God"" is designed to show you ""how to reconnect with God so that he becomes as real as a loaf of bread and as reliable as a sunrise.""The heartfelt message of ""The Future of God"" is that faith can feel like a cry from the heart for each and every one of us. Faith in itself may not deliver God, but it makes God possible for us to feel and know a greater sense of connection, meaning, and purpose in our lives. Ultimately, ""The Future of God"" is a call to finding the path to God--the nondual God without borders--that is beyond description, words and definition. Chopra apples the same standards to God that are typically applied to reality, and then invites us to walk the path to God first through the material world, then through the subtle world, and finally to the transcendent world of source, oneness and unity. This path to God can seem un-mappable, because these three worlds overlap and because we ""walk"" them through our inner awareness, rather than any measurable path or road we can clearly chart.Where ""The Future of God"" truly shines for me is when it describes the wisdom agenda and the proposition that faith--good faith--makes life better. Wisdom in action can be found in the perennial teachings that encourage us to look deeper than the surface of situations, where we can find and know meaning, purpose, and the greatest gifts self-awareness can bring.What I love most about ""The Future of God"" is the way it shows how each of us can make spirituality a rewarding and beneficial way of life, no matter how skeptical or hopeless we may initially feel. I love how Chopra describes how the spiritual path changes you as you feel less isolated, more connected, service-oriented, safe, balanced, peaceful, and guided. And I love to envision a world filled with people who feel less isolated, more connected, service-oriented, safe, balanced, peaceful, and guided.""The Future of God"" includes a seven day process of exercises designed to bring comfort with the inner subtle world, and the presence of the transcendent in daily life. Chopra's description of God in the transcendent world applies to consciousness and how it operates as: pure awareness, pure intelligence, pure creativity, infinite potential, unbounded opportunities, bliss, self-organization, infinite correlation, and all matter and energy in a virtual state. Chopra explains that we find God when any of these aspects of the transcendent world begins to expand--and ""when you fully remember who you are, you become one with God.""Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQNSI6WT0W091/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=030788497X#wasThisHelpful","RQNSI6WT0W091","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These socks are warm, comfortable, and provide just the right amount of padding to keep feet in top form for most any adventure. I was looking for athletic style socks that are sturdy enough to stand the test of time in good condition, and I'm very pleased so far with the quality of these socks, which clearly incorporated endurance in the design criteria right from the start.One of the most important qualities I look for in a sports sock is breathability, which these socks provide superbly.

"My initial fascination with reading David Meltzer's book is his connection with Jerry Maguire, the real-life sports agent featured in the movie by the same name starring Tom Cruise. I loved the scene in the movie in which Jerry Maguire had an epiphany that he shared at his place of work regarding practicing positive ideals in life and daily business dealings. Maguire lost his job and most of his clients for ""growing a conscience,"" yet in real life and in the film, he found a way to succeed while following a higher path.Like Maguire, Meltzer had an epiphany in which he realized it is possible to succeed while helping others and doing good deeds in the world. Success in business does not require that one claw one's way to the top, striving to ""win"" at all costs. Meltzer shares success tips in a series of short, easy-to-read, down-to-Earth tips demonstrating ways that we can develop effective positive habits.Meltzer repeatedly emphasizes the importance of knowing ourselves and what truly satisfies us deeply in lasting ways, in order that we avoid choosing options that stroke our egos without actually addressing our deeper needs. He shares an example of how he manifested a golf course at a time when he felt a need for being recognized as having a property named as one of the best eight golf courses in the county by Golf Digest, rather than focusing on what he actually desired, which was building a truly spiritual place that many could enjoy.Meltzer's enthusiasm as a salesman comes through brilliantly with his example of how, in less than a minute, he can sell you a plastic pen for a million dollars, even though it appears to be the same pen you can buy at Walmart for 39 cents. I won't reveal the genius behind his sales pitch, other than emphasize his point that when people recognize value, they feel motivated to sign on the dotted line and close a deal.Many of the principles found in CONNECTED TO GOODNESS emphasize spiritual principles found in perennial wisdom traditions, which readers are encouraged to try out and practice in everyday life. Such simple things as remembering to feel and express gratitude every day, and remembering to get and stay connected to goodness can build a solid foundation for every aspect of life.I recommend CONNECTED TO GOODNESS to anyone wondering if there is some other way to succeed than ""selling out,"" taking advantage of people, and ending up feeling empty inside. Like Jerry Maguire, Meltzer is living proof that it is possible to bounce back up after having hit rock bottom, and Meltzer shares the tips he's found most effective at experiencing success while strengthening ethical principles that provide our lives with meaning and purpose.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271QXIYES4WWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0990769607#wasThisHelpful","R271QXIYES4WWS","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Higher education is urgently in need of reform, ex-Yale-professor Deresiewicz explains in EXCELLENT SHEEP. America's elite universities, including Yale, Harvard, and Stanford, are no longer the places of inner transformation they once used to be, but instead have become primarily concerned with their school rankings in US News & World Report. Now that universities are as concerned with their ranking as college-bound students have been with SAT scores, rather unfortunate trends toward grade-inflation, and admissions rejection inflation have become the norm.What Deresiewicz points out with clarity and wit is the growing gulf between student needs for genuine growth and discovery and the kind of factory processing that now occurs. A large number of elite university students, graduates, professors and administrative staff mock those who express interest in pursuing something other than the four areas of power majors comprising the majority of elite university courses of: Finance, Consulting, Medicine, and Law. Students at elite universities are so accustomed to running on an academic treadmill prior to university in order to attain the stratospheric GPAs and extra-curriculars required that they continue mindless momentum through college, often missing out on exploring opportunities to richly and deeply explore who they truly are.Deresiewicz suggests that we, collectively as a society, embrace the concept of the Academy as a learning institution dedicated to educate, inspire, and transform, free from the grips of corporatocracy. The specific details are left to readers to decide, as EXCELLENT SHEEP is written as a discussion piece designed to inspire conversations, rather than a cure for one or two specific problems. It seems clear that the problems illustrated in this book have more than one unique cause, such that the surrounding conditions must also be considered when contemplating a cure.I love Deresiewicz's passion and prose in EXCELLENT SHEEP, as well as the way he sounds a clarion call for institutions of true teaching and learning, in which thinking is respected, encouraged, and appreciated in instructors, students, and administrative staff.I recommend EXCELLENT SHEEP for students and parents investigating higher education options, as well as for teachers and academic administrators interested in improving the system of higher education.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14BS3NN742TO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GEEB960#wasThisHelpful","R14BS3NN742TO3","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a brilliantly useful and innovative flashlight this is! I love the DE 2600 Flashlight/Charger that is small enough to go everywhere you go, and sturdy enough to last. Measuring almost one inch by 4.5 inches, this device fits neatly in pockets, purses, handbags, backpacks, and glove compartments alike.Don't be misled the words ""lipstick style"" in the product description; it's black metal case and 5 ounce heft with high-tech styling make it the perfect gift for men as well as women.The two built-in charging ports for USB cable and micro cable are easy to access, and simple to use. Next to those ports is a very small button by which this flashlight can be switched through its various modes (bright, dim, flashing strobe light, and off). The light from this flashlight rivals the best flashlights I've owned, which is remarkable for its small size. The strobe light function is useful for parties (place it in an overhead ""disco"" ball) and roadside emergencies, and the bright light is bright enough to illuminate large areas.I love how well the charger works, and I appreciate having such a useful device whose batteries are rechargeable, and that can share its battery power with USB devices.The only thing I found slightly unusual was the location and size of the on/off switch, as I've not before had a flashlight that operates by manipulation of such a small button recessed all the way in the back of the light (I need to really press on it with a fingernail to get the button to respond), but this is something I can adjust to. The flashlight beam cannot be ""tightened"" to various focus lengths, yet it's preset to a focal range that works for both reading something in hand, as well as illuminating the road ahead.I received this flashlight / charger in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34OT6ZFYXL8IK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV5Q0WM#wasThisHelpful","R34OT6ZFYXL8IK","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We tested this water-resistant lantern outdoors in a rainstorm this winter, and it came through like a champ, projecting light beautifully in all directions. The handle of the AYL StarLight lantern is easy to grasp, and it does double-duty for hanging in an easily accessible closet space, ready to leap into service in the event of power failures.This lantern does not come with the three D size batteries required for its operation, which is worth making note of when giving it as a gift, or when expecting to put it to use immediately.This is an easy lantern to learn to operate, since clicking one button moves it through all modes (low, high, flashing strobe, and off).I love the feeling of durability this lantern exudes. It's made of higher quality materials that feel like something that will last for a while and withstand life's occasional knocks, bumps, and falls.My other favorite feature about this flashlight is that it's billed as being able to last for up to six days if need be on one set of batteries--it's very efficient!I received this lantern in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFETJUB2OEKCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P5YBBKY#wasThisHelpful","RFETJUB2OEKCN","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little gem of a book playfully invites readers to ""Take a look!"" with its luscious cover photographs, and then--what a joyful surprise--there are more gorgeous photos inside! Even more delightful is the way poetry graces the pages accompanying corresponding photographs.This is a book that can be savored by either flipping through randomly, or reading systematically cover to cover. The poetry delves into spiritual territory, gently inviting us to contemplate deeper meaning in every moment. Some poems remind us that we are not alone, and that our family is much bigger than we typically realize.

I also love the interchangeability of these gloves (can be worn on either hand), and their ability to withstand heat up to 662 degrees!There is an important manufacturer's warning that these gloves do not handle hot liquids well, which is due to their woven fabric design.

"These red silicone AYL grill gloves provide moisture and heat-resistance capable of handling most small to medium size jobs. Their ability to protect one's hands from grease splatter is greatly appreciated, as is how easy they are to clean.We got these gloves soon after a family member was burned by hot grease at Thanksgiving, and I am especially pleased to have a set of oven mitts designed to keep hot grease and liquids away. I've found these gloves to be outstanding for most baking and frying jobs.Larger jobs, such as is required for carrying a very hot 24 pound turkey in a roasting pan out of a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven present more of a challenge. These gloves were fine for the few seconds between resting on the oven rack and moving out of the oven door, but weren't quite up to this particular job, so thicker oven mitts were employed in between.The AYL Silicone Grill Gloves take getting used to for putting on and taking off, as they fit a bit tightly in some places, and a little too big in others--but at least they resist spills and splatters, and work wonderfully when used as hot pads.I received these gloves in exchange for an unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IW61414ONO7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PBWAK8Y#wasThisHelpful","R2IW61414ONO7R","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Magisterium provides extraordinary insights into the current state of consciousness research presented by Foundations of Mind conference organizer, Seán Ó Nualláin. One Magisterium is an ambitious and complex book that goes beyond merely reporting on some of the most exciting scientific findings to directing our attention toward the importance of establishing a ""noetic language"" for each dimension of reality that we humans experience. Packed with frequent references to Ó Nualláin's previous writing and the works of many of the world's greatest philosophers and scientists, One Magisterium is a feast of big ideas as they come together in extraordinarily creative new ways at the frontiers of science where physics, philosophy, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics and biology intersect.Ó Nualláin is a visionary and academia survivor who makes the salient point that it is time to rethink the ""magisterium""--the area of teaching authority to address the way scientific and religious truth have been dichotomized. It's all well and good to separate scientific facts from morality--up until the point that we see society and ecosystems unraveling from the damage from such schizophrenic double-think. Humanity needs a story describing the facts of existence that also includes a sense of morality and meaning. When meaning is divorced from knowledge, terrible things can--and do--occur. At this time when many of the world's finest institutions of higher learning are in danger of being detrimentally influenced by corporate and other types of controlling interests, many destructive category errors are being made as science attempts to cover higher achievements of subjective human experience.Rather than allowing the academy of higher education to continue sliding into various forms of disarray, Ó Nualláin suggests we consider a nobler goal of placing higher education in the care of those we entrust to do more than simply inculcate knowledge, but with those who improve our capacity to learn. Ó Nualláin explains, ""Historically, both of these processes have occurred in a religious environment; it is not unfair to say that we have yet to work out how to frame the drive for understanding in a purely secular context."" The framework of such a Magisterium thus provides a framework from whence noetic action, morality, and aesthetics reflect a hierarchy of value emanating from a Divine Source.Ó Nualláin calls for a new paradigm with the foundation of what he calls Bionetics, envisioned as being ""the study of how we as biological organisms can come to know, including coming to know about the cosmos in the most abstract, mathematical sense."" By examining the Mind as manifest in the context of interacting between organism, populations, and species with the environment through space and time, a harmonious creative fusion becomes possible. Who we are and how we connect with and communicate with other aspects of creation is becoming such an important matter that its study deserves better care than to be caught amidst the pointless battles between evolutionists and creationists, for example.There is sheer genius evident in One Magisterium's premise that the time has arrived for us to take heed of all we have learned and recognize the importance of levels of being; humanity's future depends on it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YKS9H4HR60CG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=144386398X#wasThisHelpful","R2YKS9H4HR60CG","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not your fault if you've been religiously following long-established dietary and exercise regimens, only to find yourself gaining weight and body fat each year, no matter what you do. According to diet and fitness coach Mike Sheridan, lots of baby boomers have been unknowingly suffering from trusting the advice they were taught as children. As it turns out, eating according to the food pyramid can lead to increased fat, weight, and inflammation, which in turn can contribute to a number of unnecessary and debilitating diseases.Mike Sheridan's ""Live It, Not Diet!"" plan is designed to reset your habits, while you slowly but surely make progress toward a diet in keeping with its long-term strategy. This plan requires your involvement--because only you know what foods you are and aren't allergic to. I love how Sheridan provides marvelous guidance that can help you avoid making such common mistakes such as over-eating nut grains that your body is not designed to digest, and I respect the way more participation is required by the reader than simply following recipes included in the text.I love Sheridan's inclusion of a ""Feast Day"" that helps make it possible to actually make progress in moving toward a diet devoid of all junk and fast food whatsoever.

"Is it possible that much of the American serious health crisis can be attributed to out-dated advice about diet and exercise? Nutrition and fitness expert Mike Sheridan explains that not only is this possible, but he can show you exactly how and why our commonly accepted views need to change.The cover photo and title of ""Eat Meat and Stop Jogging"" can act as a bellwether to quickly sort out believers from the open-minded, serving to open conversations with people whose beliefs aren't so fixed that they're unable to think about facts they might find disturbing.I love this book with the contentious title that shares results from cutting-edge studies showing such facts as meat-eating women live 32% longer. This kind of fact is not common knowledge in my west coast college town that is famous for the quantity and quality of its vegetarian cuisine--which leaves me wondering why such information is not yet popularly understood.Sheridan debunks dozens of myths that are currently damaging peoples' health, citing numerous scientific studies that explain such things as the dangers of calorie restriction, and the hazards of reliance upon toxic substances such as soy as a dominant protein source.With regard to 'jogging,' Sheridan describes the benefits of building up muscles through shorter, more intense workouts, rather than through aerobic training, which must increase in intensity and duration in order for people to experience continuing benefits.Sheridan notes that ""... the biggest issue with moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise is that it results in an overabundance of free radicals,"" citing research showing how problems arise associated with extremely high long (2 hour), or extremely frequent runs or aerobic exercise sessions.Much of what Sheridan reports is information I've seen corroborated by independent researchers such as Dr. Beverly Rubik, so I can attest to the cutting-edge nature of the content in this book, and give it my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249KNGYG3378I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0993745547#wasThisHelpful","R249KNGYG3378I","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Dying to Know You"" is a beautifully written, easy-to-read guide to the near-death experience that is highly recommended for anyone curious about death and the near-death experience. This book includes numerous noteworthy near-death experiences, presented by three-time near-death experiencer and near-death experience researcher and expert, PMH Atwater. There's a delicious simplicity in this elegant overview of life, death, and the near-death experience fueled by Atwater's quest to discover what we can learn from those who have experienced death for minutes, hours, or days--and come back transformed by their experiences.Atwater explains that there are two equally significant aspects to every near-death experience: the experience, and the aftereffects. The near-death experience might feel like arriving in Heaven, or it might feel deeply unsettling and more like visiting Hell... but regardless of how joyful or upsetting the experience, adult and child experiencers report going to places where they resonate energetically, based on vibratory frequency. The near-death experience after-effects include physical and psychological changes including such things as: light and sound sensitivity, comfort with silence, highly intuitive, vivid dreams, acutely aware of injustice, magnetically attractive to animals and birds, electrical sensitive, sensitive to pharmaceuticals, lowered blood pressure, smarter, sensitive to smells, allergies, affinity with Nature, more loving, wakes up around 3 or 4 am. While the near-death experience is typically over within minutes, hours, or days, the aftereffects can go on for years, decades, or the rest of the experiencer's life.My favorite part of this book is the section summarizing ""Children's Version of the Big Picture,"" which includes such gems as, ""God exists. It doesn't matter what God is called, God is still God. And we are each part of God, always. We only think we can be separated from God. Really, we can't."" The rest of this section is written just as simply and down-to-Earth as this, so any child can understand it--which makes a whole lot of sense, since it was written by a near-death experiencer and researcher who has spoken with thousands of near-death experiencing children. There is another summary section for adults, but the children's version was absolutely my favorite, which might be due to the fact that I am a childhood near-death experiencer myself.I love the brevity, clarity, heart-centeredness and intensity of Dying to Know You. This is a small book that succeeds at packing a lot of light and love into a few pages, brilliantly conveying the quintessential perennial wisdom transforming the lives of millions of near-death experiencers worldwide.

"I love this Carbon Skincare serum! I've been applying this product twice daily for a couple of weeks now, and am truly amazed at what a difference in hydration it makes for my skin. I love how this product is 100% organic and free from the dyes and extra chemical additives that my skin abhores, so all I experience are the wonderfully pleasing results from this very pure 1% Hyaluronic Acid solution.In just a few days of twice daily use, I saw tremendous improvement in my face, which looked beautifully radiant and fresh.This serum is applied with a pump applicator atop the beautiful blue bottle, and I found that one squirt of serum covered by entire face, with two providing enough to cover my face, neck, and upper decolletage. The serum feels a bit thick, reminding me a bit of natural aloe vera plant extract, with a scent so subtle I barely noticed it, and dries leaving little sign it is there.I found it helpful to apply this serum while my skin was still damp from cleansing, since apparently the extra water makes a difference in ensuring full hydration. I also applied a moisturizer afterward at night, and a sunscreen by day, and found the results to be absolutely excellent.I highly recommend this serum to anyone who has chemically-sensitive skin, as I do, since it is 100% natural, in accordance with the quality that Carbon Skincare is known for.This review was written based on a complementary product sample I received in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MR43ZGBVISWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJ4LL6G#wasThisHelpful","R2MR43ZGBVISWM","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is a lovely radiance to my face after using this peel, and the glow lasts for days!I appreciate how this product is gentle enough to use regularly, with no irritation to my skin whatsoever.

"I tried a friend's Barmah hat, and when I discovered it instantly felt like it belonged on my head in a way I've never before experienced with any other hat I've tried or owned, I ordered my own. I took a chance on ordering a slightly different style of Barmah hat than the one I tried, based on the photo, and I'm so glad I chose this one.What a joy this hat is to wear! It's without a doubt the best all-around all-weather hat I've yet owned. I ordered my hat in Autumn, and have now had the pleasure of wearing it in all kinds of weather. I've worn it on sunny days, misty days, windy days, rainy days, and foggy days--and in every kind of weather condition, this hat performs like a champ. Moisture seems to run right off it, without it getting the least bit soggy or losing its beautiful shape.I love to wear this hat when out on a long walk, or when puttering in the garden. The brim is an optimal size for providing protection from the sun and elements, and the fit is perfectly snug so even without a drawstring, this hat stays on my head when gusts of wind take me by surprise.I've never before had a hat that fit my head so well, nor one that did such an outstanding job of fitting snugly without messing up my hair or making an impression on my forehead as this hat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QNPOLVMK2VS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005R4IV46#wasThisHelpful","R2QNPOLVMK2VS3","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy taking Omega-3 vitamin supplements, which I find are helpful for my heart, joint strength and mobility, and cognitive functioning--but this is the first Omega-3 supplement I've yet seen that is sourced from wild-caught fish that have been processed in such a way to remove heavy metals, dioxins, and PCBs.Such care has gone into creating these NutriGold Omega-3 supplements that they not only meet but actually exceed the international fish oil standards for purity, potency and freshness. These capsules are free from GMOs, fillers, binders, artificial ingredients, Stearates, Laurates, Sulfates, Dioxides, egg, gluten, milk, peanut and shellfish.These are definitely the highest quality Omega-3 supplements I've ever tried--and in a powerfully potent 750 mg dose of the essential EPA and DHA fatty acids in every capsule.

"It's been said ""a rising tide lifts all boats,"" and that's the uplifting sense I got while reading Miriam Knight and Julie Clayton's marvelous anthology of inspirational short autobiographical essays. This is the perfect book for anyone experiencing or contemplating experiencing life-changing transformations in their lives, who is feeling somewhat skeptical. Healthy skepticism is a wonderful tool for rational comprehension, and while it's perfectly natural to balk at some of the more extraordinary experiences reported by those interviewed in this book, their established qualifications as scientists, medical doctors, and well-respected professionals bolster their credibility.I loved reading about Dr. Larry Dossey's knowledge of medical events before they unfolded in spontaneously precognitive dreams, and how he struggled to make sense of how he could possibly be accessing information that ""violated common sense and every ounce of my medical training."" Receipt of such non-local information challenged Dossey to make sense of these experiences, and inspired him to study and write about nonlocal mind.I loved physicist Peter Russell's insight that ""the people who were really interested in consciousness were the people who looked at consciousness firsthand."" As a lifelong meditator, Russell recognized the unique insights possible on a personal level that spiritual adepts, yogis, and mystics knew, and that somehow evaded attempts by neurologists with electrodes placed near peoples' brains to know what is really going on. Russell noticed that ""all the problems we were facing--from personal to social to ecological problems--all come back to human consciousness one way or another."" Thanks to his personal meditative practice, Russell know understands that consciousness is always there, is the one thing none of us can doubt, and appears to be the true nature of the universe.Many other authors including: Anita Moorjani, Cyndi Dale, Bernie Siegel, Gregg Braden, Eva Herr, Foster Gamble, Georgina Cannon, Jack Rourke, Julia Assante, Kingsley Dennis, Meg Blackburn Losey, Penney Peirce, Paul Chappell and Paul Von Ward share their personal stories, messages, and insights in this delightful book. Since each chapter is just a few pages long, this book is a quick read, like a Reader's Digest of Conscious Experiences designed for easy reading on the bus or train, at the beach, or in a waiting room.At the dawn of this new Quantum Age when the word ""consciousness"" is increasingly becoming more popular, if not better understood, ""What Wags the World"" is a welcome beacon of light held by dozens of those who encourage us to dip our toes into the water of mindful awareness.

"There's something magical about the healing quality of this rejuvenating serum, that must have something to do with the combination of Vitamins C and E with Jojoba. Coincidentally, at the exact time I was starting my trial of this product, I received two accidental facial abrasions. I decided to go ahead with my product trial anyway, and I'm so glad I did! Rather than endure the typical slow healing cycle of waiting to see facial cuts scabbing and possibly leaving scars, I witnessed a most remarkable high-speed healing of these minor facial lacerations. Mind you, this product is not advertised as a healing serum, so I tried it cautiously at first, waiting to see if any negative reaction would occur--but to my surprise, not only was there no negative reaction, but the fastest healing I've yet seen for any facial injuries.This serum is easily applied with the dropper, which I found to be the perfect applicator. Only a few small drops go a long way, and I enjoyed using the dropper applicator both as a dropper and also as a spreading applicator, using it to smooth the extremely fluid serum quickly in the areas I wish it to be applied before it has a chance to run or drip off the face.I enjoyed good results with this serum both when applied after washing my face with cold water and cleanser and just leaving the serum as is, and also when applying a follow-up moisturizing lotion afterward. It's a credit to the quality of this serum that it doesn't seem to require a moisturizer afterward, and can stand on its own.After several weeks of using this serum, I couldn't be happier with the results! Wrinkles and fine lines are diminished, my skin is visibly brighter, and as mentioned earlier, any incidental cuts and abrasions healed amazingly fast, with no signs they were ever there.Highly recommended!I wrote this review for a complimentary review bottle of this serum I received in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KDV8LSOM3SQ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLEK9DW#wasThisHelpful","R3KDV8LSOM3SQ3","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Super C Serum does a super job repairing sun-damaged and mature skin. I noticed that even during a time when I was increasing my sun exposure as I tried this product out (which I received in exchange for a fair review), wrinkles and blemishes didn't get a chance to get worse. Ideally, I do my best to minimize and avoid sun exposure, but this summer that wasn't an option, so I was very grateful my trial of Super C Serum coincided with added solar exposure, so my face and neck looked progressively smoother, brighter, and clearer week after week.I have sensitive skin and am unable to wear many name brand products, but thanks to the excellent ingredients utilized in this serum, I had no issues whatsoever, even when regularly applying the product twice a day for over a month.This Super C Serum goes on smoothly, but it is surprisingly thick compared to other serums. It has a strong, tangy, lemony scent which is due to the ingredients, and I began to find it pleasant and relaxing as I associated it with my twice daily facial treatments. Because this serum is so thick, I initially applied much more than necessary, which I corrected as I became familiar with just how small an application truly provides excellent results.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318X1HDYVD0YH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFT2Z14#wasThisHelpful","R318X1HDYVD0YH","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew Cusick takes readers on a tour of the world, savoring the ups, downs, and oddities of experiencing his WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) and youth hostel adventures through Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Los Angeles. What makes this young man's journal so riveting for me is the unique way he weaves nitty-gritty personal experiences into and around global issues that can so often feel overwhelming.Cusick's twenty months of traveling the world combined with the keen acuity of perception gifted him thanks to qigong and meditative practices provide him with a writer's voice that is simultaneously unpretentious, yet very wise. Andy was away from his comfortable life in Scotland long enough to make friends, fall in love, and experience very different ways of living in different social and environmental climes... and come to a deeper appreciation of how we can all help to save the world without feeling too guilty, resentful, or judgmental along the way.The first two thirds of ""Take the Red Pill"" feels like reading a friend's travel diary. Written in journal diary format, it's interspersed with short informational sections summarizing interconnected facts about economics, ecology, global warming, aboriginal thinking, spirituality, and philosophy. The factual sections are written in much the same journalistic style of writing as the personal diary entries, and are short and packed with interesting charts and graphics. The last third of the book delves more fully into the author's philosophical point of view, and provides the reader with a kind of Reader's Digest encyclopedia of how and why we can change our way of thinking. Cusick reassures readers that we need not fall into the trap of ecoparalysis, since inaction is not the solution now. Inner awareness is absolutely essential, as is the understanding that we are inextricably interconnected with everything ""out there"" in the world.I especially love the inclusion of the eastern concept of Sunyata, with the notion of reality being comprised of much more than thinking things must either be true or false--since actually, most things really fall into two other categories: not-true-not-false, and true-and-false.This is a book that encourages you to FEEL its intent while you think your way through its concepts, and it does an outstanding job of reminding readers of their heart, spirit, and physicality... and the importance of being authentic, integrated, and real.

"Amy Lansky is a most unusual ex-NASA scientist, in that she sought answers to explain how homeopathy could be such an effective system for treating her family's health concerns. As a concerned mother, Lansky put the well-being of her children ahead of cynical cries of ""Woo-woo!"" and discovered, much to her surprise, some extraordinary healing powers of homeopathy.I love how Lansky cites fascinating studies conducted by homeopathic researchers that associate the ways symptoms of a patient's physical disease often reflects or symbolizes the nature of their psychological issues, or as she puts it, ""Thus it may be no accident when emotional irritation leads to a 'pain in the neck,' or being 'pissed off' leads to kidney problems.""Active Consciousness does an excellent job of illustrating the ways expanded dimensionality of consciousness might be expected to interact with our 3D conceptualization of the world. In short, higher-dimensional levels of consciousness would be able to easily see connections hidden to us, by virtue of our world being as transparent to them as a 2D world is to us. A resident of such a ""Flatland"" would be amazed that we could instantly see everything and everyone in that world, which for us is as easy to view as looking at a map.When we recognize that higher levels of order contain more information than we ordinarily consider accessible, we have the means by which we can use consciousness actively. Lansky provides numerous examples of ways we can do this, whether through something akin to homeopathic treatments, or through meditation and visualization exercises she provides throughout this book. As Lansky explains, once we achieve a state of genuine, authentic, deep communication with others, true connection can occur. We also can thus experience who we really and truly are.I especially love the way Lansky includes lots of fun illustrations alongside some of the key points she's making in her book, so you can gain a better idea of how, for example, you can hold in mind a possible future as long as it is possible, and through the process of active consciousness, help ensure that more enjoyable possible future is attained.Packed with numerous exercises, Active Consciousness makes an excellent guidebook for taking your consciousness to the next level.

"Ervin Laszlo's ""The Self-Actualizing Cosmos"" points out that we humans are part of something much bigger than ourselves. As Laszlo explains, ""Entering altered states of consciousness through unusual events or through prayer, meditation, esthetic experience, or the contemplation of nature has a measurable effect on the brain: it synchronizes the left and right hemispheres."" Such synchronization is in sharp contrast to regular states of consciousness in which right and left hemispheres function independently of one another, and yet this is just the beginning of something truly amazing; when groups of people enter a deeply meditative state together, coherent synchronization occurs for the entire group of meditators!In the Akasha paradigm presented in this book, such connection and coherence are considered as fundamental features of a unified, holistic, interconnected totality. Quantum physics brings with it a new conceptualization of what it means to be human in an intrinsically nonlocal world. In this new paradigm, evidence of a deeper dimension of information presents itself at the cutting edge of quantum field physics. And yet, as new as this idea may seem, the truth of the matter is that such a concept of basic essential roots of reality has been known for thousands of years in classical Indian philosophy as the Akasha--the fundamental element against which everything in the material universe can be observed.Alas, the coherence attainable by groups of meditators is seldom the norm for human societies. While our biosphere and all natural ecosystems demonstrate how they are networks of supercoherent systems, humans frequently dance dangerously close to marginalizing our own and other species. Laszlo sounds the clarion call to feeling the urgency by which humans must either regain coherence with the natural order of our planet and ecosystems, or accept the fate of all species who refuse to make such harmonious connections.While the situation indeed appears dire on the face of it, Laszlo's book is not depressing. I find a great optimism intrinsic to the notion of an intelligence beyond our ability to quantify or dissect. When we consider the idea that natural order already exists, as do ways of living harmoniously with all plants and animals on Earth, we can envision there will be people willing, motivated, and able to join together as one and experience a prosperous, sustainable, interconnected and harmoniously supportive world.So how, exactly, does this Akasha paradigm work? Two scientific hypotheses are presented: Paul A. LaViolette's hypothesis of the Transmuting Ether, and Peter Jakubowski's theory of The Universal Quantum Field. Since these theories are not readily verifiable, some could argue they are theoretical physics and philosophy more than actual scientific theories we can yet test. Nonetheless, the concepts and ideas presented in The Self-Actualizing Cosmos are essential reading for anyone seriously concerned with the well-being of the human race and life as we know it on Earth.Highly recommended and thought-provoking!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R199BBH95Q1G1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620552760#wasThisHelpful","R199BBH95Q1G1D","A3FXT4UPI30K7S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3FXT4UPI30K7S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a wonderful stroller. It's fairly lightweight, easy to carry, and very easy to set up and fold down. It takes up less space in the back of my station wagon than the other stroller I have. It has great maneuverability, easy to push, easy to turn. It would be really nice if it had a tray or some kind of space on top to stash things, but that would probably add more bulk and make it harder to fold and unfold.Do note that the manufacturers specifically say this stroller is not for jogging. Baby Jogger is the brand name rather than a product description.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PLWNVJ98E3RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OC3XB0M#wasThisHelpful","R1PLWNVJ98E3RW","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was just the right thing to have on hand for a dreary weekend when I was feeling lousy and needed distraction. It has excellent pacing and held my interest throughout. The ending was a little too tidy, with a couple of ""Awww, shucks, isn't that sweet?"" moments, but I suppose it does help us feel more connected to Stevens and Windermere when we're allowed to see a part of their lives outside of the crime-fighting milieu.The plot involves a situation that is, sadly, not entirely fiction. It deals with human trafficking, wherein young girls from Eastern Europe are smuggled into the U.S. to be sold as sex slaves. We meet two sisters from Romania, Irina and Catalina, who become separated in the U.S. Both are attempting to escape. Kirk Stevens and Carla Windermere team up once again in a nationwide chase to save the girls and capture the thugs.I have been with this series since the first Stevens and Windermere novel. Owen Laukkanen comes up with some wonderfully imaginative plots. He especially excels at creating deliciously evil criminals we love to hate. With this fourth book, I can happily say that the author's skill as a novelist is steadily improving, especially with regard to pacing. Although this is a series, I think each of the novels stands alone well enough that it's not strictly necessary to have read all the others.The one notable flaw in this story is the use of too many obvious coincidences. Of course, all thriller writers have to use them. That's how we move the plot along and keep things exciting. It's just that Laukkanen has perhaps not yet learned how to hide them as well as do some of the more experienced authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14WTLE8XZJCBG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399165533#wasThisHelpful","R14WTLE8XZJCBG","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having loved Tatjana Soli's first novel, THE LOTUS EATERS, I have gone into her second and third novels with high expectations. Both times I have been disappointed.I was quickly bored at the beginning of this novel when Richard and Ann are introduced and their financial disaster is described. I hung on and became a little more interested when they arrived on the island and the group dynamic among all the characters began to develop. I thought Soli had some interesting things to say about how attached we are to our electronic devices and social media, and how bereft one might feel when suddenly cut off from these connections.Eventually I grew weary of all the anguish over who is, or might be, or wants to be, sleeping with whom, and who might have seen whom naked. Soli is quite skillful at creating detailed back stories for her characters. In this novel, these back stories didn't seem to do enough to further the front story and maintain my interest.As I reflect on the author's ability to get inside the minds and motivations of her characters, I can't help wondering if she is more philosopher than novelist. The portions of the book that border on philosophy were far more interesting to me than was the plot.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19H3Z7WZMJYGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043964#wasThisHelpful","R19H3Z7WZMJYGW","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received both this Sis Toy and the Learning Stages Puppy for review. Aside from the different colors on their bodies, the only real difference between them is their voices. The puppy sounds more like a little boy voice, and the sis toy sounds more like a little girl. They both do basically the same thing, although there may be some variation in the words, phrases, and songs.Sis Toy is adorable, cuddly, and very versatile. You press on the left foot to change stages, and the things she teaches and songs she sings progress from very simple to a little more challenging. Just be aware, as with any toy that makes noise, that the cute voice and music may start to drive you crazy after awhile. On the other hand, there's enough variety here that Sis Toy could keep baby company quite nicely while you get other things accomplished.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OGW32S9JLJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYL9EIW#wasThisHelpful","R18OGW32S9JLJM","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have only been using this oil for about three weeks, so I don't yet have any long-term or miraculous results to report. However, I do enjoy using the oil and have found it to be of very fine quality. When I received the oil I was pleased to see that it is cold pressed, so no chemical extraction processes are used.This oil is quite rich in texture compared to other oils you may be using on your body such as jojoba or sesame. It's less oily than other oils, so it doesn't spread over your skin as easily. The best way to use it is to dampen your skin before use. That way it's easier to rub in and more easily absorbed. It also helps you use less oil, and thus save a little money.So far I've been primarily using the oil on my face, as middle-age dryness calls for rich moisture. What I really like about this oil is that if I use it after a shower in the evening, my face still feels smooth and soft when I wake up in the morning.If you're familiar with other rich, cold-pressed botanical oils such as extra-virgin olive oil, you know they have a distinctive smell. Not unpleasant, just very rich is the only way I can describe it. This oil does not smell like olive oil, but it does have its own smell. It is made from rose hip seeds, so don't expect it to smell like roses.For now I give this oil four stars, to be upgraded in the future if I experience any exceptional results after continued use. A sample bottle was provided to me for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RR9UIEIFJ3S1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6WHTRG#wasThisHelpful","R1RR9UIEIFJ3S1","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A few months ago at a local discount store I purchased over a dozen rolls of some off-brand packing tape for 99 cents per 55 yard roll. In some ways it's similar to this Duck Brand tape. It's 3.0 mil thick, whereas the Duck is 3.1 mil. The cheap stuff is the same width as this tape, and has pretty good stickability for a cheap tape.So far I haven't used the cheap tape for much shipping during the wet season, and I've been concerned about how well it will hold up under rainy and snowy conditions. I use it liberally because it was cheap, and then just to be safe, I reinforce wherever I need to with a higher quality tape. That's where this Duck Brand tape fits in. It has a different texture than the cheap tape, and does not tear as easily. The cheap stuff feels sort of like a thick cellophane, whereas the Duck Brand is acrylic. I did a side-by-side test on a shipping box, and the Duck Brand definitely sticks more easily and is harder to tear off.If you don't mind paying the premium price, this tape might be worth it for you for the peace of mind. Just note that it has less tape per roll than some others. The three rolls together give you 131 yards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ0PU2N82JN31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO2KQ7O#wasThisHelpful","RZ0PU2N82JN31","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a product I should have used on my old Subaru before the interior started cracking and crumbling, but I'm hoping I can prevent further breakdown if I apply it every 3 to 5 weeks as suggested. This is an easy product to use, just be sure to read the very tiny print instructions on the bottle. It doesn't air dry, so be careful not to use too much, or you will spend extra time wiping it away. I thought this was mainly for man-made materials, so I was surprised to see leather and teak mentioned in the list of surfaces it can protect. So far I've only used it on my car, and the interior looks quite a bit nicer after one application.

"I'm just a casual player, so I don't have all the fancy language to describe how guitar strings perform. I had just put different set of Ernie Ball strings on my old Yamaha, and I didn't want to take them off and put these on just for purposes of review. So I put these strings on an old sort of crappy guitar I got in high school. I don't think this guitar even has a name on it, it's that unimpressive.

"These are pretty enough, but they don't really have an ""antique silver"" look, as the name would imply. They're quite a bright metallic silver. I used them with some dark brown linen napkins, and they looked quite nice. Beware of the spikes, though. It's hard to put the napkins in the rings without the cloth catching on the ""branches"" unless you roll the napkins up tight enough. And then you have to worry about someone at the table being careless and yanking their napkin out of the ring, snagging it on the sharp points.These napkin rings are open on the back side, so I think you might be able to open them up wider if you wanted to.

"I've been looking for some quieter ways to entertain little ones while my sister teaches their older siblings. This barn has turned out to be a pretty popular item because they only get to use it when they come once a week. It's really just a big cardboard wall, and would be best with other things to encourage imaginative play. I found myself wishing I had a little cowboy hat for one particular three-year-old boy.Most kids like to feel like they have a secret place where you can't see them, so sometimes it's fun to throw a small blanket over part of the barn so they can hide. It has to be a very light blanket, though, and herein lies my reason for the three stars. This is pretty flimsy cardboard, and I don't anticipate it holding up for all that long.

"This is a nicely put together little set, although I think when I was a kid I would have wanted an eraser on the end of the pencil. The lead in this pencil is thicker than in most mechanical pencils, so it's easier for kids to use it without having the leads break all the time. It comes with about 10 replacement leads, but note that replacement leads are not sold separately, so when these run out you have to buy another whole pencil set.I think a set like this is more a luxury than a necessity, but it does have some features that can make it more fun and easier for kids to master the use of a writing instrument. It has a raised yellow ridge that is meant to help develop the proper habits for finger placement while writing. It works for both lefties and righties, and it's a great add-on item here on Amazon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMV4G53ULTWY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JFOJ7R4#wasThisHelpful","R2MMV4G53ULTWY","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They don't tear or puncture like some cheaper gloves, and they're more comfortable because they don't make my hands feel clammy.

"When I first put this feeder out in the place where my old feeder has been, it seemed like my hummers were not happy with it. They would come by, sniff at it, and fly away. I thought I was going to have to take it down and put the old one back up, because I didn't want my birds to abandon me.I decided to give it one more day, and that's all it took. Apparently it just takes them some time to adjust to change. Today they were finally comfortable with the new feeder, and they seem to like it better than the old one because this one has the places for them to perch while they feed. That was the main reason I wanted to try this feeder, because I'd never had one with the little perches on it. The birds seem so content when they're sitting on those perches. They can rest while they sip, and they're sticking around longer and feeding more than they did with the old feeder.The top fill feature is a definite bonus.

"When I first saw this I thought I'd have no use for it because I don't have babies. But its compact size was so appealing to me that I had to take a closer look. I'm glad I did. This washer isn't just for diapers and baby clothes. It's great for people like me who prefer to do a lot of smaller loads of laundry.If you use the cold or warm water cycles, this washer can be more water and energy efficient than a full-size washer. Probably not so much if you use the sanitize cycles, because it takes a lot of energy and time for the machine to heat the water enough to do the job. If you're going to use the sanitize or super-sanitize cycles, be sure you don't put anything in there that could shrink, because the water gets super hot.Aside from the fact that the unit is quite heavy for a woman like me, set up is not too difficult. Everything you need is included to either hook it up to your sink or connect it with your regular washing machine. Presumably you can also put it in baby's room if you have washer hook-ups in there. The claim is that it's quiet enough for baby to sleep while the washer is running. I've never had babies, so I wouldn't know, but I know I wouldn't be able to sleep through it. It's quieter than our full-size washer, though.So far I love this washer for its great variety of features, both for cleaning and for safety. I adore the compact size, and would love it even more if they could find a way to give it wheels without leading to vibration problems.Samsung is an excellent, reliable brand. If this washer is within your budget, and you have babies, pets, athletic or incontinent family members, or a very small living space, it's definitely worth considering for purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JZ5ETNJK76G1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNNOIQ6#wasThisHelpful","R2JZ5ETNJK76G1","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case is a lot sturdier and less rubbery than some of the silicone cases for adults I've tried recently. I don't know exactly what this case is made of, but it's thick and stiff and made to withstand some rough usage. It does add a bit of bulk, but that bulk also makes it easier for kids to hang on to. The promotional material says it's ""made from a lightweight, durable, kid-safe material,"" but they don't say what that material is. Anyway, it's very nice for kids as well as klutzy moms and aunts.

"I've given four stars to the other Five Star products I've reviewed, because the paper they use nowadays seems flimsier than in Five Star notebooks of a few years ago. However, I have to give this notebook the full five stars because I love its other features so much. After discovering how much I liked the one I received to review, I bought another one.Let me first mention that this notebook weighs a little over 2 pounds, so if you don't want to schlep that much in your backpack, maybe you can buy a 3-subject notebook in this same style. I'm not a student, and this notebook remains at home most of the time, so the weight is not a problem for me.I absolutely love having the fabric covering the spiral metal binding. It keeps the metal from getting bent and snagging on things, and gives the notebook a classier look.I also love the sturdy plastic pockets dividing each subject. A lot of notebooks have the papery/cardboardy things in between subjects, with perhaps a little reinforcement at the tops and edges. The ones in this notebook are good quality plastic that will last a lot longer, and they help with organizing because there are actually three pockets to use on each divider. There's a short pocket and a taller pocket on the front, and a short pocket on the back of the divider.The last thing I love about this notebook is that it has a nice thick, sturdy plastic outer cover on both the front and back. Most notebooks I get have plastic on the front and thick cardboard on the back, and the cardboard starts to wear out before the rest of the notebook. On this notebook the back cover feels slightly stronger to me than the front one, although I'm sure they're made of the same material. With this kind of quality, I anticipate some real durability from this notebook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23R38ZLWYMVWM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005QAV9EA#wasThisHelpful","R23R38ZLWYMVWM","A14EPTYN50XSZV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14EPTYN50XSZV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew this would be big because it's a 5-subject notebook, but I was still surprised by the heft of it when it arrived. It's quite heavy, weighing in at just a fraction over 2 pounds, so be sure you really need this much notebook and won't mind schlepping it around in your backpack.I've liked Five Star products for a few years now because they seem to be of a little better quality than other notebooks. This one is quite sturdy, with thick plastic on the front and a much thicker cardboard backing than I've found in other brands. The pockets between subjects are reinforced along the top edge, so they're less likely to tear at the corners.The only reason I can't give this five stars is because the paper seems thinner and more flimsy than the paper I remember from older Five Star notebooks. Still, the paper is better than in other currently available notebooks, and the perforations are stronger, so pages are not as likely to tear out when you don't want them to.The paper attached to the front says ""Lasts All Year.

"When another murder happens in Verity's Sugarland Tennessee home town, it will be up to Verity and her gangster ghost pal Frankie to find the culprit and in the process uncover the secrets of the town's past.I really enjoyed The Skeleton in the Closet (Southern Ghost Hunter Mysteries Book 2). This series has a lighter feel than the authors Demon slayer series, which is sort of surprising since there is a murder mystery at its center. I thought that the murder mystery made good use of Verity's ghost whispering skills.The leading lady Verity is ernest and appealing. and I have great sympathy for her continued struggle to overcome the dire financial straights she's found herself in due to a cheating ex fiance and his vengeful mother. I liked that the way things work out indirectly present an opportunity for some cosmic payback. I also liked the light double touch of romance in the background-I really liked Ellis and hope that they eventually take their relationship public.So another good episode in the Southern Ghost Hunters Mysteries, I'll be keeping an eye out for more.Complementary copy via NetGalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EJNIWGZTZ4CI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7X35EI#wasThisHelpful","R3EJNIWGZTZ4CI","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"**Warning this review contains spoilers for previous books**The final book in the House Immortal series by Devon Monk, Crucible Zero, was a great action packed wrap up to a really good series. I have really liked the previous two books which had a bit of a paranormal feel in the Thirteen Galavanized who are 'stitched' ( in sort of a Frankenstein-ish way) but can't die. The world of the first two books is a sort-of-not-quite appocalyptic futuristic one in which governments and national boundaries have given way to 'Houses' that control resources/areas of commerce, a world shaped by the fallout of a time experiment that lead to the creation of the Galvanized. I was a bit afraid to start Crucible Zero since the ending to the last book was such a shakeup to everything in the previous books - everything and everyone that Matilda Case knew is gone as a result of the attempt to repair the Wings of Mercury time experiment and we left Matilda as she discovers that the world and the people she's returned to are very different than the ones she's lost.Even though this is not the world that we came to know in the previous books, Monk has created another interesting one and the counterparts of the people - Abraham, Neds, Quentin and others- retain enough of their core that it is easy to reconnect with them. I really liked the twist to Matilda's 'place' in the new world and that the twist makes it so that Matilda can't just drop in seamlessly. But fortunately Matilda is still a Case and a Case will always get the job done. And even in this new world the job is still stopping Slater Orange who also retains his memories of the world before the attempt to repair time, and who is still trying to take over the world in any of its incarnations - if Slater has his way that world will be one where Matilda and all her friends are dead.I was surprised by the ending to Crucible Zero, not realizing that House Immortal was a trilogy, at about 95% I was mentally girding my loins for a cliffhanger setting up for a fourth book - because really the framework for this story could have easily carried forward to one more book if Monk had decided to put her readers through the wringer one more time. I'm both sad and glad that she didn't. Sad that the series is done, and glad because I'm not all that masochistic as to wish to suffer through the consequences that would have set things up for one more book and also glad because I was satisfied with how things end up for Matilda.Complementary copy via NetGalley - release Sept 1, 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TBQAIQI0XBWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451467388#wasThisHelpful","R3TBQAIQI0XBWU","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The last few books of the series have been on the so so side for me but I actually really liked Eighth Grave After Dark. The audio performance of Charlie and Co has finally clicked for me. The cast has really solidified in this and the wedding, the birth, the two mysteries and the 'Reyes Time' were all good. I do still have problems with mentions of Danger and Will Robinson, especially during love scenes -just pulls me out of the moment - but I've built up a tolerance to the rest of Charlie's snark.It will be I interesting to see where the shake up at the end of the story takes us next -Jones has sold three more Charlie books - so I suspect it's going to be quite a ride.My favorite chapter opening quote - probably because I should own this shirt - “ANXIETY GIRL!

"Served is a collection of five erotic shorts set on the same night in an upscale New Orleans restaurant, Facile. These are all literal and figurative quickies at somewhere around 35 pages with just enough setup to get to the sex and I have to say that some of the patrons are getting extra special service...I picked this up when I saw that Molly Harper was writing as Jacey Conrad paired with Gia Corona. I can see why Harper rebranded herself for this collection because it is waaaay more sexy than her other stuff and there was only one laugh out loud moment in the entire collection.This was more on the okay side for me because I like a bit more romance with my sex. Kudos to the authors though for not trying to force HEAs or even HFNs into stories this short - HWTAL (Happy While the Afterglow Lasts) was much more reasonable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EE0XPBPL8740/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKCXVBK#wasThisHelpful","R3EE0XPBPL8740","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new magic player, Dionysus, is in town and has stolen some sex magic potions that he is using to terrorize the town of Babylon which is already ramping up the crazy-scale due to an impending Blue Moon.I enjoyed Cursed Moon in audio for the most part but with two exceptions. First,  one of Dionysus' attacks on Babylon invovles a sorority that has been dosed with a drug that causes sexual aggression forcing  the women to become rapacious and there is an in the moment mass rape scene that is very disturbing. Second, Kate's attitude about potion use and magic in her dealings with her friends and brother irritated me - and the hypocrisy added another level to that irritation. On the plus side, Kate does have an epiphany that allows her to work on mending the damage that attitude has caused. Another plus for the book is that fallout from an encounter for Kate and fellow magical crime task force agent Morales, adds a foundational change to their relationship and it will be interesting to see what builds on that change.So, bottom line is that Cursed Moon left me very interested in seeing what happens next for Kate and Babylon.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE3P8DTTWAL2F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MMPG5QY#wasThisHelpful","RE3P8DTTWAL2F","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alloy of Law was fantasy with a steampunk feel to the magical world. I haven't read the earlier Mistborn trilogy, but the story here stood well enough in it's own - though I do have to admit that I started this in audio and switched to Kindle because the key elements of the world were sort of subtle for a newbie.Still what I loved most about the book were the characters: Wax and Wayne (and it took me about 10 chapters to get that pun). Wax aka Lord Waxillion, was one of my favorite kinds of leading men intelligent, honorable and good in a fight, and Wayne was the perfect side kick, irrepressible, irreverent, and also handy to have around. There is good action to the story, a mystery to solve and a bad guy to take down. The metal based magic idea is sort of odd, but its use is interesting.I liked this a lot and will definitely be reading the next which is out in November, I think.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R335QHKZC7SFV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00540QR7Q#wasThisHelpful","R335QHKZC7SFV8","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At long last Nell and Tom's story, and we get to find out what's kept the pair apart even though they've loved each other since the were youngsters. Tom made quite a mess of things, but fate is going to give him a second chance even though Nell's determined not too.I really liked this story. So often in a series there's a pair I've been dying to see get their HEA and when their book finally comes out it doesn't live up to the expectations I've built book after book for the pair - but here I wasn't disappointed at all. Turns out Ether & Elephants not  only makes Tom work to get the HEA his youthful mistake cost him, but it also wraps up the series with a more solid feeling story than the rest of its enjoyable but more lightweight feeling predecessors.I am going to miss these Gaslight Chronicles with their mix of mystery, adventure, magic steam punk and romance - though there's still a slight hope for Pier's story in the future.Complementary copy via NetGalley - release date 7/20","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FE9A3D7LDSXP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCW5HQA#wasThisHelpful","R3FE9A3D7LDSXP","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past books Linc has been one of the most tortured of the cursed Wing Slayers, fighting against the fallout of bis early life as much as the Witch Hunter bloodlust that is a part of his legacy. Finally, as he feels like he is on the brink of succumbing, he finds the one women who is his only hope of redemption, the women who is the other half of his soul, a woman who is just as broken and unable to trust as he is - but trust is the only thing that will save them both.It's been years since Lyons published a book in this series (I think the publisher dropped it and this was self published), so I've had Caged Magic wishlisted since the day I learned she was picking the series back up.  And even viewing the earlier books through the rosy filter of time, I still think that Caged Magic was actually better than the earlier books. It is still a pretty smexy paranormal romance - since sex is a component of the pair's magic- but the smexy parts had a purpose instead of being filler.Linc is a well done tortured hero, there are good backstories for pair which keep the soul mate aspect from being a slam dunk - even though neither wil survive the events of the story without it.  Plus there's a good background story that also allows for a nice setup for two more pairs - who have insurmountable obstacles to their HEAS - who will get books.I am so happy that Lyon listened to her fans and gave us chance to return to her Wing Slayer world and I am looking forward to more.Complementary copy via NetGalley .","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LBQVUH1B1EYU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988792346#wasThisHelpful","R2LBQVUH1B1EYU","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was an entertaining short little freebie prequel. Sara Wilde is a magical artifact hunter for hire and the story picks up with our heroine naked trying wend her way through an orgy to reach her target in order to relieve her of a magical necklace.I thought that One Wilde Night was pretty fun. Sara's adventure was set in Rio around Carnival time, so the naked chase to the sambadrome was kind of in the 'wild' (pun intended) spirit of the book. The story is a nice little action packed carve out that doesn't do much more than scratch the surface of the mythos of the series. The events do, however, introduce Sara's ability to use Tarot to guide her way and the mysterious 'Magician' who wants to retain Sara's service for his secret organization - he has my interest peaked (and piqued too:)I'm definitely reading the next one, [book:Getting Wilde|26045106].","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IBHS08SL2PTC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012V6BFYU#wasThisHelpful","R2IBHS08SL2PTC","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I liked the Gargolye former Army Ranger leading man Nick, he is protective without being domineering, and I liked the Fae jewelry artisan Willa, whose first instinct is to flee when trouble heads her way but who grows a backbone before all is said and done. I liked their relationship because both are lonely and they connect through conversations and actually seem to like each other, outside of their physics attraction. And since there are no open door love scenes there feels like there is a bit more story while they work to overcome the obstacles to their HEA, than similar sexier stories in this genre.So this was cute and light and I liked it even more than the first Nocturne Falls book, but then again Gargoyles Rule and Vampires Drool:)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QEJ1DE0H0ZIH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012PWY2AO#wasThisHelpful","R1QEJ1DE0H0ZIH","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Leopard Enchantment starts off with a nice amount of intensity to the attraction between Sentinel Ian Scott and Ana Daiku who is a newbie spy for the enemy. I like enemies to lovers stories, but that trope is fairly subtle here since Ian doesn't know that Ana is the enemy and Ana is very sweet and isn't so wrapped up in the propaganda of her 'people' that she can't belp but liking Ian and the other Sentinels that she interacts with - so the 'betrayal' when Ana is outed - and the consequences of that- is the big conflict for the pair.I have been reading the Sentinels since their 'Nocturne' days and I am still hooked on the series. I really liked this pairing. I loved Ian in all of his borderline geekiness and Ana was very likable and I thought it was great that she quickly finds her own strength when she finds out how she's been manipulated by her handler. It was also fun to get some brief cameos of past stars.

"I liked Smoke on the Water, which wraps up the Sisters of the Craft trilogy.Willow had had the hardest time of all the 'abandoned' sisters in the series who were thrown forward in time by their parents' final act of magic. As a child, Willow's power of seeing visions in watery reflections kept her bouncing around foster homes because no one wanted a child who screamed every time they bathed her or gave her a glass of water. And, as an adult, acting to prevent a vision which showed her gruesome death at the hands of a witch Hunter landed her in an institution and tagged as criminally insane. It is there that she meets the man she's 'seen' herself with - the man who will save her. Unfortunately, Sebastian is the new director/psychiatrist at the institute and the attraction he feels for Willow is both forbidden and illegal.I did like both Willow and Sebastian, but their time 'together' is very limited . The romance  gets the short straw this time around, because there's so much to do to introduce the Willow as the final sister, reunite her with her siblings and significant others, and battle the big bad witch Hunter cult that had caused her family so much harm. While the connection that Willow feels for Sebastian from a lifetime of her visions of them together did help, since Sebastion as a good guy had to fight his inappropriate feelings for a patient, theirs was the thinnest romance-wise of the trilogy. But still he is important and I did really like the twist in how Sebastian saves the sisters. Willow's story does run parallel to the first two books but fortunately it mostly just fills in and doesn't overlap much.So overall,  really enjoyed the series (with the second book being my favorite since it wasn't burdened by the setup/wrap-up of the other books.) And as a fan of Handeland's old Nightcreatures series it was fun to see the mini cameos of characters from that series.Complementary copy courtesy of St Martin's via NetGalley received in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REM4C67CS1KVA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T34962W#wasThisHelpful","REM4C67CS1KVA","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Spinning off from the Knitting in the City series, we return to Ashley's hometown of Greenville Tennessee for the first of her six bearded brothers' HEAs. The first chapter is equal parts quirky and steamy as we meet Jess and watch her rethink her life long antagonistic relationship with Duane Winston  - and Duane has a 'plan' to finally make Jess his, because while she was crushing on his twin, he's been secretly in love with Jess since they were kids.I finished this with a smile on my face.I loved so much about about Truth or Beard, Reed does such an awesome job with her characters and relationships - and not just the romantic ones, there are great friendships and fabulous family ties too.  I really liked that Reid gave us POVs for both Duane and  Jessica, and knowing what they were thinking and feeling heightened the emotional level and the steam level too.I would never have imagined from our first introduction to the Winston brothers in Beauty and the Mustache that any of them would make a great leading man, but I truly loved Duane - and  I am prepared to fall for his brothers as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IODEO8I313BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIHMD2K#wasThisHelpful","R3IODEO8I313BQ","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed Give up the Ghost. I loved the friends to lovers romance amidst the Ghost Hunters paranormal trappings. I am a sucker for friends to lovers as a trope despite the fact that I am often disappointed, but this story succeeds where others don't because the friendship is firmly established before the lovin' and smexy times begin.This worked fine without having read the first book, off to do that now:)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSAKZFPGI54H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3HITLY#wasThisHelpful","RSAKZFPGI54H3","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This short falls after the first three Scarlet Bernard books and after the first Boundary Witch book-and, as the author warns, has spoilers for all of the above.Malediction does a great job of bringing the two series together when Lex hunts down Jessie and Scarlet to find out the truth about Sam's death. It is sad,  because we get a glimpse of Sam 'before' and her death was quite gruesome, but it was also interesting to see the fallout and to have everyone interacting - the story is told in alternating POVs by Jessie and Lex. It made me look forward to Lex's next book, I think she's shaping to be a great character.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRPYKPQ6YCX0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZE24M9Y#wasThisHelpful","RRPYKPQ6YCX0R","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To honor his father's dying wish, devil may care Jovian must team up with his much more serious brother Rhys to find Sebastian, their missing older brother and heir to their father's position on the League (mage)council. But in order to find Sebastian who went missing without a trace five years ago they must employ the aid of the council's best tracker,Skylar, the woman who Jovan loved - the woman who wants nothing more to do with him.  But with others coveting Jovan's father's position and power, throwing stumbling blocks in the way of their search, Jovan will have to make amends for mistakes in his past and repair his relationship with Skylar and Rhys if they hope to succeed.I liked this first book in what I suspect is a trilogy with a book for Jovan and his brothers, but the story is very thin, and all of the conflicts thrown in rakish-rarely-serious Jovan's path are quickly and easily resolved. Additionally, the family's nemesis, Darin, is a bit hard to take seriously after an earlier encounter with his own father - who does not think highly of our bad guy - I spent the whole story thinking of Darin as an incompetent dufus. Since I got this as a kindle ARC I don't have a good idea of the actually length but The League of Illusion: Legacy felt like a short story, though it may have weighed in at novella length.Still it was a fun short read, with a bit of magic, a touch of steam and a smidgeon of steampunky goodness in the background.Complementary copy  via Netgalley - release date 12/31/12","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R365XJW2UF4XMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BZPIH7C#wasThisHelpful","R365XJW2UF4XMA","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this first Dark Legacy book, it follows the formula of Krentz/Castle's Arcane Society/Harmony books with a Psy-powered leading pair whose 'auras' click connecting them in a forever kind of way while they solve a mystery aided by a special pet-this time a dog. The framework doesn't detract from my enjoy of Castle' s contemporaries,because her leading men may be dangerous but they are always excellent partners to their leading ladies -  not growly alpha males- and her leading ladies are always intelligent.This is my first time trying one of these in audio and it worked exceedingly well in that format, so much so that I'm off to spend another one of my carefully hoarded credits on the next book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209DFKS57PHOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VPAXCI#wasThisHelpful","R209DFKS57PHOZ","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There was a really good world building to this erotic romance  - the leads are demons and there is a soul mate connection but the connection is not necessarily romantic- so not one of those 'done deal' kind of things where the leads don't have to work for it at all. The leads Knox and Harper were really great. He's powerful, dark and intense and she's no pushover either - smart, resourceful, forthright, and powerful in her own understated way.  Also really good was the background story and the supporting cast - I really want to see the Hellhound and the Hellcat together. My only issues  were with the erotic part of the story. There were way too many smex scenes. I didn't much care for the ones I didn't skim/skip. Knox is just too control freaky dominant in this context for me - yes, I do suppose that it fits his personality - and Harper turns to submissive sensual mush during their encounters - which I didn't think fit hers. This type of sexy times just isn't my thing for multiple reasons including the fact that it feels more like a battle than anything romantic. But on the plus side they were skip-able without losing too much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11LF1DK2BW3BB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010P3660O#wasThisHelpful","R11LF1DK2BW3BB","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked A Thousand Pieces of You (Firebird Book 1) Sci fi-ish YA,  at the  heart of the story was an  invention that allowed a person to jump into there counterpart in another dimension - sometimes very similar, some times not. Leading lady Margarite's parents are on the verge of making their invention work when one of their graduate assistants sabotages her father's car, steals the prototype and escapes into another dimension. Margarite and another assistant head off after him determined to extract revenge for her father's death, but of course there's more going on than Margarite realizes...I really liked Margarite and the guys -there was sort of a love triangle ( well maybe a few more side than that...) but not too annoying. It was a bit odd that one of the jumps goes to a present that mirrors imperial Russia - but hey it provides inspiration for the cool cover. I liked that the characters do acknowledge the ethical implications of possessing their alternates - because they  do leave some fallout in their wake.I'm not much of a NA reader - the heroine is eighteen (they guys probably a bit older) but she wasn't super immature -except for the impulsiveness that gets the whole thing rolling at the start.

"I love dragon shifters, so I had high hopes for Ivy's Dragons of Eternity series starter... Unfortunately, the setup had me nervous from the start.Our heroine is an Imp who has lived on the run for decades, she finally took chance, settled down,  bought a house and  became a business owner and was finally happy... until he finds her.I really didn't care for the kidnapping/slave/master thing that brings the leads together, there's such an imbalanced of power and he *will* have her, she is *his*. Initially, this skirted the line and I was worried that we might stray into questionable consent territory -nope, his overwhelming sexual mojo makes her forget all her qualms. Still, I wasnt happy that a HEA for them means she has to give up everything she's built. My other issue was that there wasn't much else going on storywise in the background, so at the heart this is just sexy times in a thin story wrapper.So, for me this was just okay.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAAS4PZH1YKC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WC072TI#wasThisHelpful","RAAS4PZH1YKC","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read this as part of the Fire & Frost anthology. Set in the Iron Seas world, Elizabeth, who has been on the run from her father (for a very good reason), and hunter Caius, who was supposed to bring her back but failed before, are sweet together and there is a good enough set up for the past history between them to make that part of the story work.

"Due to his scientist sister's brilliance, EMT Eli and his sister get the opportunity to leave the lawless desserts of Pennsylvania for a new life and new jobs in the canal city of Boston. Eli' s new partner is Cacia Ferry, sister to the Chief and member of the power Ferry family - who carries on her family's sacred duty of leading the recently deceased through the veil to their final destination of either heaven or hell. But when Cacia's father, the head of the family business, is murdered, Cacia suspects that there may be plots afoot.I really liked Marked (Servants of Fate Book 1) it's Urban Fantasy Romance with a good balance of romance, mystery and good world building - dystopian with a myth based foundation. And I really liked both of the leads, especially the hero, Eli, who is a winning mix of fighter and protector, with a touch of 'I am not worthy' - because of the difference in 'station' between him and Cacia and some 'history' - to keep him from being too perfect. The story is told effectively alternating (3rd person pov) chapters which follow Eli and Cacia. And there is good set up for both the larger future story arc and the next starring pair.Marked, was a winner for me and I've already wishlisted the next book, Claimed, which I think is out in March.Complementary copy via NetGalley 1/1/15","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKWKRDEFB7LVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8EM26S#wasThisHelpful","RKWKRDEFB7LVK","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Verity is on the verge of losing her ancestral home when she rinses out the dirt in the bottom of an antique vase - a vase which turns out to have been the final resting place for the ashes of a dead gangster.  Now Verity is seeing Frankie's ghost and now that Frankie's ashes are firmly embedded in Verity's rose garden, Frankie is very motivated to help Verity save their home. And with Frankie's help in seeing the spirit world, suddenly Verity has more than a ghost of a chance at getting the money she needs.I actually read a Verity short in one of those little multi-author collections, so I had a pretty good handle on Verity's ghostbusting partnership. Here her relationship with Frankie isn't quite as developed as I thought it would be, but Verity herself is really great - her innate compassion and respect for the ghosts she dealing with makes her very appealing. I also thought the mystery was well done, and I was surprised at how it turned out - the story was fast paced enough that I really didn't spend much time trying to guess the outcome. There was a love interest for Verity, but that didn't work quite as well for me because he starts out pretty jerk-y and the transition into his change of attitude was pretty abrupt.Still, all in all this was pretty fun and I'll be on the look out for the next book.Complementary copy via Netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSU0IKT2YOGXJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFYXLX6#wasThisHelpful","RSU0IKT2YOGXJ","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lost Chalice, book 3 of the Relic Seekers, was a bit on the slow side and I had a really hard time with the love triangle - especially with alusions to a more famous one steeped in betrayal, heartache and guilt. And this was tough since there isn't a lot of soul searching on Kendall's part on resolving the triangle and as a result didn't leave me with good feelings toward her. Though I still love Nathan, Jake's character is growing on me, he has definitely lost his rough edges and gained a knightlike honor.On the plus side there were lots of revelations in Lost Chalice - almost everyone is actually someone else or multiple someone else's and there's some treasure hunting for an artefact asssociated with Arthurian legend and the crucifixion. As a nit though, everyone is still trying to protect Kendall by leaving her behind - and unguarded - even though it doesn't work out so well (this is something that has bothered me from the first book.)complementary copy Via Netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35WNOPMMXEPIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYBNYX8#wasThisHelpful","R35WNOPMMXEPIL","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I used to be addicted to these Mammoth books, though I think their niche has been overcome by the cheap Kindle 'box sets '. I really bought this for the shorts by a couple favorite authors in particular and theirs were, for the most part, my favorites in this collection. My favorites were the stories by Kellison, McMaster and the new to me Bonilla. There are a fair number of paranormals in the bunch - which was a plus for me.Shiloh Walker - The Haunted - One place that the dead don't haunt is a graveyard, so two kindred spirits who share the same gift of seeing the dead meet when they go there to get a  little quiet time. I liked this, and was happy that the lead Gabriel was going to be able to keep someone else from his fate.Sonya Bateman - The Devil Went Down - A man determined to start fresh is drawn to a house and a woman and feels as if he knows them both even though he's never seen them before. This was a near miss, not bad, but not great even though the set up was really promising. The transition and wrap up was just too quick, this could have easily been half again as long  - and needed to be in order to pull this off.Dianne Sylvan -Sweet the Sting -A terminally ill woman is doing the faith healer rounds until she hears of the mysterious Beekeeper who heals people but leaves them 'changed' - I liked this, it's a bit oddball and not exactly a romance but there is the promised of a ever after.Erin Kellison - Wylde Magic - A family curse and a reunion between two childhood friends who have longed for 'more'- Kellison does a great job of telling stories in a short space (I am a fan of her Revelers series). And all the elements of the story here are good: the characters, the connection, the curse and the emotion. The ending leaves things open for more and I hope that she picks this story back up soon.Jill Archer -Dream, Interrupted - With dysfunctional sleep/dreams as its focus the story had the right feel, it just wasn't a style that engaged me and I started skipping the song bits at the start of the chapters once the love interest showed up because they were chopping things up too much.Laurie Landon - Enticed by Blood - A vamp encounters the human woman he tried to leave behind, but who he couldn't forget - I haven't read anything else from  this series.  The pre-existing connection  between the pair helps, but this is really still too short to do justice to the big reveal of the vampire world to the heroine and it would have been hard enough to fit in some proper groveling by the hero for the way he's broke her heart.Bec McMaster -The Many Lives of Hadley Monroe - This is really the story that I bought the book for and it was a good one, Hadley makes a deal with Death. I don't know why reaper romances work for me but they just do and in this one Death starts out so other and Hadley humanizes him as she shows him what it is like to truly live. This even brought a few tears to my eyes.Angie Fox - Date with a Demon Slayer- A Haunted anniversary date for the demon slayer and her hubby could be their last, if not for her talking Jack Russell terrier. This was ok, it had all the elements of the series, but it wasn't my favorite of the shorts in this series.Elle Jasper - Return to Me - A woman sets off to a remote island to try ovecome her fears.JD Horn - Pretty Enough to Catch Her - A parolee attracts the eye of a former beauty queen- no actual romance here.Tiffany Trent - Love, Sugar - A woman inherits a family homes but there's an even stranger part of her inheritance - the idea is interesting but she accepts the strange terms to her legacy too quickly and her not being 'special' but just one in a long line didn't feel very romancey to me.Shelli Stevens - Savage Rescue -A shifter gets to play hero to a woman from his past.jessa Slade - If Only Tonight - This was a bit odd because it's southern but southern California and with a Goth girl and an Adobe instead of a Belle and and Antebellum. I liked the ending though.Shawntelle Madison - Cursed - The alpha and his OCD mate head off to renew their vows and run afoul of a curse. The way this started out I thought this was going to be just smexy times, but when the pair get caught up in the curse things get a bit more interesting.Amanda Bonilla - Waerd Awakenings - I liked this alot despite the instalove. Some how it worked because of a symbiotic mental connection that add an emotional intensity to the pair's meeting and hook up. There was also enough of the world built that I wouldn't mind more from Bonilla.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R84RXL9A5VQYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O9U6IBW#wasThisHelpful","R84RXL9A5VQYL","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wounded warriors are at the heart of this series, the Lost and Found agency is populated with vets who paid a physical price while serving their country. There isn't much in the way of detecting going on in this episode, which has a quiet scarred hero who suffers from traumatic the after effects of traumatic brain injury and has speech issues as well. But his heroine sees beyond the scars, even as she had to convince him that she sees the strong noble sexy man behind those scars.I really enjoyed this both of the leads were wonderful and the story was sexy and satisfying -even if the time period was really short for the I love yous and HEA. This still worked for me because the characters just felt like they meshed so well and since I read a lot of fantastical Romance, my ability to suspend disbelief is pretty good.One thing that is also interesting about this series is that the author touches upon issues faced by our returning service persons and the information is eye opening.Bottom line is that I enjoyed this quick romance - which works fine as a standalone but definitely will have me pulling the previous book off the pile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E5R7CUYZ2PT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQDB0L6#wasThisHelpful","R1E5R7CUYZ2PT4","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3.5 stars - Socially impaired Annie Catrel is a Wiz at repairing the social media image of the rich and famous and in her secret online life she is the famous blogger Socialmedialite poking fun at the pretentious and fashion challenged using her sparkling wit. Bad boy and suspended Irish rugby star is her most recent blog target and her newest image doctoring project and the sexy pushy Ronan - who somehow sees Annie behind her protective camouflage - is suddenly making it hard for Annie to live her anonymous real life.The characters in this were just great- with author Reid writing the brilliant but damaged Annie and author Coswell the gorgeous foul mouthed Ronan, who has his own issues. And I really liked  everything about the Hooker and the Hermit except for the actual sex scenes. Ronan's kink just didn't work for me - especially seat belts used in bondage? No. Just no. I didn't realize this was dom/sub themed, which is really just not my cup of tea. And in some ways I just couldn't see how that type of  relationship would work for Annie who had such a need for control in her life.But everything else worked for me.  The great use of Annie's blog, the way that Annie and her boss managed Ronan's ex, Annie's creative cussing, Annie's online pal, all the great back and forth between Ronan and Annie, and Ronan himself - on the whole he matures nicely over the course of the story.So bottom line? A bit of a mixed read for me (I didn't know what I was getting into, even so, it dropped this a star for me) but I did think that the collaboration between the co-authors worked well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJ94J69QB5ED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW00WZE#wasThisHelpful","R1CJ94J69QB5ED","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holly Fawkes, whose family has been outed after years of hiding from the Sentinels, is sent to wolf alpha, Lannie, whose talent is turning outsiders into pack. But Holly is furious about being dragged from the life and business she'd built for herself and has no desire to acknowledge her Sentinel otherself.I really liked Alpha Rising. Both of the leads were strong: Holly, railing against the loss of her old life, yet stepping up when she's the only one who can fight the evil invading the area around Lannie's property, and Lannie with his quite strength, who gives so much of himself that he fears there won't be anything left, but still does it because of his innate Alpha need to protect his pack -I really loved Lannie, he's one of the best kinds of heroes.Alpha Rising was one of my favorites in this series which I've been following since 2009. This series has only improved over time, the bad guys aren't as over the top (or as cheesy as they've been on occasion), the 'initiation' piece was handled better, and there are good conflicts on the way to the romantic HEA and in the background plot. Plus, there's a nice cameo for the previous starring pair, Regan and Kai, (which included a reunion between Holly and her brother Kai) and there's a nice little set of supporting characters in Lannie's pack as well.So all in all Alpha Rising was a very satisfying trek back to the world of Durgan's Sentinels -I'll be keeping an eye out for more.ARC via Netgalley -Release date 2/1/15","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15ND3HW5L3H7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O94W2PY#wasThisHelpful","R15ND3HW5L3H7Y","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this series, after four books I've really settled into the universe and Alex has made connections and settled into a much less lonely life. Of course since things are going so smoothly is time for his past to come back and demand payment for his sins.This episode was especially action packed and we finally get to see what really happened to Alex, Shareem and Rachel in their dark apprentice days. All of that was very interesting and the making of Dellio explorer need so much. Plus Alex's struggles to be a better person make me love him more as a charcater and Arachne's advice to him when he questions his choices are a nice wrap up. I finished this and immediatelt went and spent a credit on the next book (this is a big deal because I am a credit boarder and normally wait for the sales.)So Chosen was another great story and Gildart Jackson again does a great job of bringing Alex Verus' world to life","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O04WN5THKOYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IEMOS54#wasThisHelpful","R2O04WN5THKOYD","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The kidnapping of his unacknowledged mate, Shay, just adds to all that Knight McQueen and his people have suffered at the hands of the psycho hybrid sisters, and he will do whatever is necessary to get Shay back. But even as Shay is almost forced to the brink of madness with her wolf time approaching and her captors refusing to allow her to shift, Shay uncovers more of the truth about the Magus' role in the hybrid's creation and struggles to get herself free and back to Knight.I still really like the idea of the white, black and gray wolves and I still really love the McQueen brother's chess inspired names: Rook, Knight and Bishop. I came into this story having read the first book and not the second, by this still worked for me.The final McQueen brother's story was well done and everything in the series - the threat to the packs and Brynn's vision that kicked off the first book - wrapped up satisfactorily, and with a a nice HEA for all the brothers and their mates. Both Knight and Shay had some pretty traumatic things happen to them over the course of the series and the author actually had them work through them instead of glossing things over. The past starting couples get some good screen time as well.There are a couple odd moments in the leadup to the physical part of the relationship because Shay's wolf is the dominant wolf alpha and Knight's is the white wolf empath - it feels gender role reverse-y here when Knight hasn't really felt 'less' in before and his special power makes him important to the pack.Still that was a nit and I enjoyed the two books that I read, and still plan to go back and read Bishop's book at some point.Complementary copy  Via Netgalley","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5OINAYBDW6F1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I8RB100#wasThisHelpful","R5OINAYBDW6F1","A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DW5IH6QCOFQ7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"3 stars- not bad, just ok. I really wanted to like this more than I did, I like the idea of fairytale characters being transported into this world and having an agency that polices them. And maybe I would have liked it more if I hadn't read a few other stories from other series that made better use of of the fairytale foundation - and if I'd have been able to connect just a bit better to the characters. I would have also liked it if the characters' original fairytales had been a bit more integral to the stories or had inspired their personalities - instead every introduction of a new one felt like cutesy name dropping.I might have also been a little bit better off if leading lady Red had worked better for me. I am exceedingly charactercentric and for UF-y stories like this I really need to like the protagonist. Red with her brashness and lack of anger management skills - plus the fact that more than half of the male characters were in love with her -  was just a bit too generic. Add to that the fact that there were a couple times when events in the story should have had lasting emotional fallout for Red that she quickly leaves behind and this results in her feeling a bit flat as a character as well.I did finish this, but I actually set it aside a couple times to read other things in between.

"I was pleasantly surprised by A Hint of Frost which came off the dusty part of my TBR pile as part of one of my 2015 challenges . One reason it's been there for so long it's that I was under the impression that the Aranae were spider people and truthfully that didn't sound all that appealing. They actually do have silk spinnerets on their fingertips and most have a venomous bite both of which play a part in life bonding and courtship, but no multiple eyes of legs -phew.I thought that the world was well done and I liked both the leads, Lourdes and  Rhys, the warrior she must wed to get miltary aid from his mercenary tribe in order to protect her people when her former guards turn treasonous.  The story is sort of a fantasy romance but there is enough going on in the background to hold off the consummation until the end.I did have minor nits with Lourdes, who is the new matrirach to her people, insisting on rushing into danger.

"We're relative newcomers to the world of aromatherapy and are really enjoying the endeavor. We now have a couple of diffusers in order to enjoy the vapors in different parts of our house, and were pleased to add this Apriller ultrasonic device. It looks just like the product photo, and the small pictures on the left show you all the variety of colors the internal light will cycle through -- or which you can select individually if you like. You can also turn the light off if you plan to use this while sleeping, for instance.The diffuser comes with a little plastic jug with which to fill the device -- a nice touch. If you're new to this kind of appliance, one thing to remember is that you shouldn't tip it while you twist the top off to refill with water or add more essential oil drops. You don't want to spill, or get water into the lower electrical compartment. So hold it down by the base with one hand, on your counter-top or wherever you have it, and gently twist the top, then lift. There are small arrows on the top and bottom which you can line up to make it easy. There are two buttons which do a variety of things, but you can think of them as the light button on the left, and the power button on the right. A quick push does one thing, a ""hold down push,"" another. When you push this power button briefly after the machine is on, it will cycle through 4 different time settings: 1 hr, 2 hrs, 4 hrs, and simply ""on."" You'll notice little lights behind the plastic for each interval, although you have to look for them and may not see them at first.A couple of warnings: as with all such diffusers, they tend to splash a little -- both when you're filling, and then, if you turn it on without the top yet attached to the base. Best not to put it on a wooden table that can be water damaged. If you want this on a night table by the bed, and it's wood, you will want to put the diffuser on a plate or tray.We generally open the top and use the little supplied jug to fill the diffuser tank (two jugs full) with filtered water. Then we take a bottle of essential oil (like this one Good Night Essential Oil Blend 10ml (Comparable to Doterra Serenity Calming Blend and Young Living Peace & Calming Blend) 100% Natural Pure and Undiluted Premium Quality for Aromatherapy and Scents) and tap in anywhere from 3 to 6 drops of the essence. Put the diffuser top back on (line up the arrows and give a little twist). Turn the unit on. We like to use the straight ""on"" setting, not the timed intervals. The other button (left) will let you set the internal light to cycle through all the colors of the spectrum -- or you can quick push it to 1) hold whatever light color and intensity are on at the instant, and 2) cycle through each color on bright or dim mode, or 3) turn the light function off.The Apriller product is a useful and versatile essential oil diffuser. We've been running it daily for a month and it does a consistently good job.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H3T9CV6U3R9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ENRQU4#wasThisHelpful","R1H3T9CV6U3R9R","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This comes from the female side of the family. We live in a wilderness area and do a lot of shopping online, so we buy  thousands of products this way and write a lot of reviews. Sometimes we get offered free products, including from Amazon, in exchange for an honest assessment. That said, I'd think carefully before I bought this product, because at nearly $80, it is not inexpensive. For that price, it had better work. My experiences is that it does and I'm happy with it!I've now been using this Beauty & Truth Erase/Repair product for a month and I'm impressed. I'm in my early 60s, so just entering the ""3rd Act"" of life, and somewhat dismayed by the increasing wrinkles and face lines. I'm not overly vain, but I've always had nice moist skin, and I've taken care of it. I often get compliments on how plump my facial skin is and how youthful I look. BUT I haven't felt much like it in the last couple of years.So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Anti-Aging cream. First, I'm a fan of Hyaluronic Acid. This is a component of all healthy bodies, especially your skin and cartilage and other connective tissue. It is also a scavenger of damaging free radicals, a good thing in an anti-aging product. It is known to promote healing of skin and is a component of some treatments for skin infections. It will help slough off any dry or damaged skin. Another reviewer felt a tingling in her skin and didn't like it. However, this is simply Hyaluronic Acid (""HA"") at work. Some sensation in the skin of the face and neck is a normal and even necessary thing.I have found that you can't apply this product and then put a moisturizer over it -- the moisturizer will tend to bead up. I apply about a pea-size amount to my neck and face morning and evening, and the back of my hands which have some sun/age damage as well. That's enough to get an even coat. I wipe it on my neck upwards, and then on my face the same way. When worried about wrinkles, you don't want to give gravity any unnecessary help! I find that my skin is moisturized sufficiently with this cream.After a month, I notice a lessening of wrinkles, lines seem softer, and the skin itself looks healthier. My husband and friends have noticed a more youthful glow and look as well.I would be happier if I knew all the ingredients were organic and non-chemical, but many of them are unknown to me. Digging deeper into the list, I find good things including shea butter, vitamin E and vegetable collagen. From what I can discover, most of the other ingredients are blenders and binders -- things that make the main ingredients form a fine cream, and keep them from separating.Bottom line -- I am enjoying the results I see in the mirror.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HKSFPAWJJSZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016CPB81G#wasThisHelpful","R3HKSFPAWJJSZ7","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me begin by saying that I'm a Burberry Fan. Burberry London cologne is my ""go to"" fragrance. They describe it as ""oriental,"" but I think that's the exotic floral top notes. It's not overpowering, and yet has a distinct fragrance -- high, middle and low notes. It's masculine, and all there, without the nose-knockout of some colognes. In fact, my wife won't let me wear anything else without protest!So I welcomed the opportunity to test this Weekend ""eau de toilette"" -- meaning, a fragrance that is not as strong as cologne. In fact, the literal translation from the French is awful: toilet water. Yeeech! Of course, that's not what it means. It's just an old fashion way to say ""men's light perfume."" And it is French-made, like many great perfumes and colognes.As you'd expect, ""Weekend"" it is a casual, lighter fragrance. There are top citrussy notes, quite sweet, and the man of the family is not a huge fan of many lemon-heavy fragrances. However, after only a few minutes, the fresh lemon, grapefruit and sweet tangerine fade somewhat into the appealing mid-and lower-notes. We can't do better than quote Burberry's own description: ""heart notes of oak moss, ivy leaves and sandalwood. A radiant warmth of honey, amber and musk composes the base notes in this elegant, luminous scent."" Luscious!What we both admire about Burberry (the man who wears it and the woman who must inhale it) is that the perfumiers manage to create floral scents that are always masculine and virile at the same time. A note to my younger friends just switching from drug store scents to real cologne: don't drench yourself in it. Less is more! Use something else for deodorant -- hopefully something that does not compete (even unscented), and certainly for your health, something that does not have pore-clogging aluminum in it. Then, with a well made fine mist sprayer like this, aim one full spray and one only on the chest/base of throat. That's it!One more thing: Burberry also manages the important job of presentation -- the bottle, top and packaging are as attractive and casually elegant as the fragrance itself.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38U5GKIDVRU41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001M5I8P6#wasThisHelpful","R38U5GKIDVRU41","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This one, we couldn't figure out: why do you want to ""hold"" the reading? Chef Rimer explained: you may not want to put your face too close to the heat. So you insert the probe into whatever you're cooking, allow time for it to heat up so you get an accurate reading, and then press the hold button. Extract the probe, bring the unit out where you can see it clearly, and there you go.The range this digital thermometer measures goes far beyond anything you'll ever likely to need. We compared it to a similar one we purchased, and then, to the oven readings on our new range, and it is accurate.We live in a rural area and do most of our shopping online.

"From the male side of the family: these are comfortable, easy to trim the toes to fit, and provide good support. My ankles tend to pronate (or turn) in, so I need good arch support in an orthotic or insole. Most ""come-with"" insoles provided by sneaker and other shoe-makers just don't do the job. In the past, I've had custom-made orthotics at a price of $75 and up per pair. In more recent times, I've found a variety of improved orthotic inserts available at shoe stores and online, for about $30/pair.So these Profoot Dura-Sole inserts at $9/pair, are a good deal. The main issues for me are; 1) arch support. These provide decent arch support, although in my particular case, it could have been a touch more aggressive. 2) cushioning for both the heel and ball of the foot. The dense gel pads (color orange/red) on these do the job.

"This review comes from the male side of the family. This is a big, manly, handsome timepiece. As a collector of Invicta watches, I love it. With a face 50 mm in diameter (about 2 inches), this is the largest one I have (see photos below). However, like other Vine reviewers, I did not get the watch pictured (as you'll see from my photos). Mine did come in the black Invicta Signature (impressive) box, with a lens cleaning cloth. I won't tell you the uses of the various dials on the (also) analog display, as if you order the watch pictured, you will presumably get the gold diver's watch with the black rubber-like band (mine is silver and stainless steel).Another reviewer said their bezel did not turn. This would be silly on a diver's watch, especially one that says it's ""pro."" The purpose of the turning bezel is so you can keep accurate track of your underwater time on a dive. The bezel on the watch I received is stiff and you might not think at first try that it will mobr, but if you twist firmly in an anticlockwise direction, it does turn. While scuba diving (and I have more than 5,000 dives to my credit), just after you put your regulator (tank air) in your mouth and prepare to go under, you turn the bezel so the ""0"" or ""60"" mark lines up with the minute hand on the watch, wherever it happens to be pointing. This way, you don't have to remember ""we went under at 12 minutes after..."". A simple glance at the bezel will show you you've been down for, say, 15 minutes or whatever. As a sports diver, most dives you will ever do will be under an hour, so that's why this is an effective feature.All that said, even if you don't dive (and actually, I use a computer on my dives that tells me a lot more than elapsed time), the bezel can come in handy. For example, if you work out, hike, or ride a bike, this is a handy way to measure elapsed time.So, since you're ordering the model in the product photol and not the one I was sent, let me tell you about the Company and why I collect Invicta watches. ""Invicta"" is Latin for ""Invincible."" The Company was founded more than a century ago, in 1837 in Switzerland. Just about knocked out by the quartz watch revolution, Invicta reinvented itself about 15 years ago by embracing the technology. Since then, it has focused on creating several lines of these iconic oversize timepieces. I didn't realize that many women were wearing these chunky watches until I went to the Company's webside, invictawatches. What you'll find there will open your eyes! Not only do they make an incredible array of watches, but also, jewelry, sunglasses and even upscale pens.I was attracted to my first Invicta several years ago because of its rugged good looks. I own quite a few now and I've never been disappointed. The other thing I like is the pricing: although often listed at $400 to $800 and up, you can usually find them on various sites, marked down to something reasonable -- such as the one you're considering for under $100.I'm a fan.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q99MQJ0DRMOD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487XPV6#wasThisHelpful","R2Q99MQJ0DRMOD","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The holder is on a spring, so your cell phone is held snugly in place. In addition, the phone comes with two stretchy rubber-like nets that go over the back and hook over each corner of the phone.Believe me, we put this through its paces.

"This is a great edible product, derived from the seeds of the much-maligned hemp plant. If you want to read about a real conspiracy, search online about how the US came to ban this crop, which was grown around the world without issue for thousands of years. You'll remember that hemp makes great rope, for example, and would be an excellent replacement crop in the forest industry for fiber -- if only growing it wasn't still banned along with it's drug-potent cousin. However, hemp contains no drug and you could smoke a ton of it and only get a sore throat for your trouble. All of which explains why this hemp must be imported from Canada, which has a much more enlightened view of the crop.All that said, this is 100% organic edible hemp, milled from the seeds. It makes a great addition to your baking flour. We don't really like it on its own, except as a ""dusting"" flour for cooking fish and chicken. We've also used it successfully to thicken recipes, including soup and stews. Best to whisk it well in warm water, then add it to your pot with the other ingredients, stirring as you go.To bake, we usually mix it about 50-50 with either non-gluten flour, or low-gluten varieties such as ""spelt"" (from a particular kind of ancient wheat).

"Wow! I'm not exactly a bike mechanic, but I figured it wouldn't be too hard to replace my old brake pads. I needed an allen wrench for the bolts -- found the right one by trial and error. I watched the configuration of washers and spacers on the old ones as I took them off, then more or less copied that as I replaced those old, hard, squeaking pads, with these new ones.These are asymmetrical, unlike the old ones that came off. There were no instructions that said so, but I figured the shorter end should go towards the back -- that is, towards the metal rim of the tire that would be turning their way during a ride.

"This is a great price for pure DMSO. Sure, they say it's for pets -- but then, DMSO is still somewhat controversial. Since it is 99% pure, we use this for topical application. It helps relieve arthritic pain in the hands, that's for sure. In addition, mixed 50-50 with iodide (and in other cases, iodine), it is an extremely effective antibiotic for cuts and scrapes -- and skin eruptions. It'll kill a pimple pretty much overnight! By the way, when you put it on the skin, it may itch for 5-10 minutes, especially around the neck etc. This is normal. Don't get in in your eyes!

Also normal. If this is so in your case, consider applying it just before you go to bed, and by morning, it will be long gone.DMSO has long be used to ease joint pain in horses.

"I got a great price from Amazon ""open box"" warehouse deals on this heavy duty two-leg bicycle stand. I put it on my heavy Currie electic-assist mountain bike. There was only a single leg kickstand on it before, and it was impossible to do any work on the bike with that. Plus, because it made the bike list over to the side, it took up a lot of extra storage room.I read a lot of other reviews before I bought this. The biggest complaint was that the stand, when ""up"" for riding, is on an angle and still points down at an angle -- too close to the ground for many riders. Another reviewer said he cut the stops that determine where the stand folds to -- so I'm a DIYer and was ready to do this. I determined that the stand was going to ride too low, especially for a mountain bike, where catching on a rock or root might send me head-over-keister. So I put a little cutting wheel on my Dremel and cut slots in the bent metal stops, 1/8 of an inch from the end. Then I took a heavy vice-grip pliers and broke these tabs off. That was all the customization I needed to do.I was able to remove the kickstand and then mounted this two-legger in exactly the same spot -- being careful to check before finally tightening down, that the legs did NOT touch the back wheel!That was it. I now have a heavy duty two-legged stand on my mountain bike, and have been grateful for it several times -- not the least of which was when I had to stop on the trail and adjust the new brake pads I'd installed.This is a generic one-size-fits-all stand, so you may have to do a few adjustments to get it to work on your bike.

Get your old tires off, of course. Put just a little air in the new tube(s) -- and on slime tubes, turn so the stem is at the top, so you don't get any goop leaking out. The air will give the tube some shape. Put some dish-soap in warm water in an old bowl. Dip the tube in, bit by bit, until it's all wet. This will let it slide inside the tire if you need to do any adjusting. Put the tube inside the tire. Now take the slippery soapy water in hand and wet the tire on both outer sides where it will met the metal rim. Now start to lever the tire onto the rim -- starting with the tube stem placed through the hole in the metal. Get the whole inner bead on the far side (away from you) seated inside the wheel. If you need to, push and pull a little to make sure the stem is still lined up -- you don't want it bent in any way. I managed to do the next bit all by hand, but if you need help, you can use a big blunt flathead screwdriver to help you pry. Just don't pinch the tube! Lever the tire onto the wheel rim.

Get your old tires off, of course. Put just a little air in the tube(s) -- and on slime tubes, turn so the stem is at the top, so you don't get any goop leaking out. The air will give the tube some shape. Put some dish-soap in warm water in an old bowl. Dip the tube in, bit by bit, until it's all wet. This will let it slide inside the tire if you need to do any adjusting. Put the tube inside the tire. Now take the slippery soapy water in hand and wet the tire on both outer sides where it will met the metal rim. Now start to lever the tire onto the rim -- starting with the tube stem placed through the hole in the metal. Get the whole inner bead on the far side (away from you) seated inside the wheel. If you need to, push and pull a little to make sure the stem is still lined up -- you don't want it bent in any way. I managed to do the next bit all by hand, but if you need help, you can use a big blunt flathead screwdriver to help you pry. Just don't pinch the tube! Lever the tire onto the wheel rim. Once in place, inflate the tire. Now you're ready to mount it on the bike.Buying this tire (and the other, plus tubes) and doing the work myself, saved me somewhere between $50 and $100.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O5CMDN075K34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028N304A#wasThisHelpful","R3O5CMDN075K34","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good price for a bike headlight and taillight combo. Both take AA batteries, not included. The headlight needs 3, taillight, 2. Both are bright, and will certainly let people know you're coming. I mounted them on my mountain bike (the mounting is simple -- use the supplied rubber strips to cushion the clasps). It probably took me ten minutes, tops. Both give you a variety of patterns of LED lights -- steady, or flashing in a number of sequences. The headlight is small but bright -- but it won't illuminate your path too much. I wouldn't want to be on a difficult trail with it in the middle of the night -- but then, that's not when I ride. I need a headlight mostly for dusk, and in part, so show anyone else around where I am.The taillight, especially on one of the flashing sequences, will let also let anyone behind you know exactly where you are -- on the trail, or a busy street!Good price for the combo, in our opinion.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIJNJM6VXU6E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEIPW5I#wasThisHelpful","R1VIJNJM6VXU6E","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've tried lots of ways to deal with getting compost from the kitchen, to our compost hole about 20 yards from the house, among the trees. (I had an expensive rotating kind of set-up for a time, but have found over a couple of years that a simple hole in the ground, covered over with dirt when it gets full, yields excellent soil in just a few months).But there's still the problem: how do you save up the organic kitchen waste, until there's enough to make the trek to the compost pile? We've had a small step-on-to-open-lid metal canister that matched our larger kitchen can. However, to be frank, that smelled bad and grew fruit flies (and maggots!). Yuck. In addition, the inner plastic bucket gets gunked up. Let's face it, ""making"" soil can be a messy business! But we have an entire organic veggie garden and orchard. We're not about to give up.We looked at the kind of compost bucket that has a filter in the lid, but the reviews were mixed. A lot of folks still had fly problems with those. Also, we don't want to have to buy and change filters. So -- back to making it simple.We decided we'd use a mixing bowl we could cover with a plate to collect the plant scraps. Every couple of days, we carry that to the patio and dump it into this Tierra pail. Sure, it can smell a little when you open it -- but that stops instantly when you close the tight-fitting lid. When this pail gets about half full every few weeks, then I carry it by the large and sturdy handle to the compost pile and dump it out. I use a garden hose with a jet to wash it out, and dump that sometimes murky water on wild plants in the landscape. I rinse with pressure until the pail is clean (enough), and then set it on the patio to begin again.We're more than satisfied with the compost pail, and like the shape and color of it as well.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GK8WICCVYS81/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SRWHR4#wasThisHelpful","R1GK8WICCVYS81","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are two separate things, connected by a theme: hummingbirds. There's the wind spinner, featuring one of the tiny fast birds feeding, and the ""antique"" red hummingbird bottle feeder itself. They are both attractive. We get lots of hummingbirds where we live, and even have some that stay right through the winter now, which is somewhat unusual, as they migrate and follow the heat. So we always have at least two feeders out, and they've come to know they can count on us. By the way, once you start feeding hummingbirds in the winter, you need to be faithful because their little lives come to depend on your constant provision of ""nectar.""The product info says you can actually hook spinner and bottle together, and some other reviewers were disappointed that the linkage wasn't included. However, we aren't so hell-bent on hanging them as one, so we're quite fine to put them in the same tree, but separated by a couple of feet (see photo).These items are both decent quality for the price. Someone else complained that the metal on the feeder was thin and cheap -- but having owned uncounted feeders in our time, we have to say, this is par for the course. You don't actually need thick metal, and unless it splashes, the ""nectar"" doesn't touch the metal -- glugs directly from the glass into the plastic bottom of the bird feeder portion and stops filling below the metal (or it would drip out around the edge).Some of the cheaper plastic feeders have a ring so the birds can land and sit there while they drink. But hummers don't need this. They're expert at hovering just above the ""flowers"" while they delicately dip their nectar-sippers into the fluid and extract again, without any need to put down. Because they're such tiny little jewels themselves, they can perch if they want.In the spring, we get bright yellow orioles on the feeders-- they're sugar-water feeders as well -- and being bigger, they can go through a lot of it. There are specialized oriole feeders you can purchase, but at that time of year, we just put out extra plastic feeders with big bottles, the kind with the rings around the edge so the bigger birds can sit, which they need. Both types of birds go for those, but we also provide this specialized hummingbird feeder, so the smaller birds can always hover and feed.The nectar you buy in the store is expensive, and comes red, courtesy of food coloring. You don't need it -- especially not with this red bottle. (But then, you don't need the color red at all. Even in clear glass feeders, the birds find the clear sugar-water just fine without adding food coloring to their diet).The best stuff for your feeder is plain sugar water which you can easily make at your sink. The ideal ratio, according to the experts, is 4 parts water to 1 part sugar. This particular feeder holds comfortably just under 3 cups (let's call it 2.75). SO to do the math, IF you start with a slightly rounded half-cup of sugar, you're just right. We mix ours in a 4-cup Pyrex pitcher. Start with the sugar. Add about a cup and a half of hot water from your tap. Stir until the sugar is totally dissolved. Now top up your water with cold, to your 2.75 cups total. (You can test with a finger -- body temp is fine, you don't want to hang it hot!). Keep stirring -- otherwise adding the cold water may cause the sugar to crystallize in the feeder. Pour your nectar into the bottle and screw on the base -- snug, but not so tight you warp the plastic. Holding it this side up, carry it outside to hang it. We use strands of wire around branches, bent to make hooks. Only now do we invert the bottle in case so that if and when sugar water splashes out, it lands harmlessly on the ground.Hang it and your ready! Step back and watch the action. Once hummingbirds get used to the spot you've selected, you'll sometimes find them buzzing even while you're hanging the bottle! When there are a lot of them on the feeders, we find the best time to replenish the nectar is after sundown, once the birds have quit feeding. They like to top up just before their long night, so wait until they're done.While some people want to sterilize their bottles, we don't like to use any harsh chemicals on our feeders. We simply rinse and scrub clean, and if there's anything nasty growing in the bottle, we'll use a bottle scrubber and some dish soap. Then we make sure to rinse it fully (several times). Hummingbird feeders do grow stuff. Bacteria can be introduced by the birds themselves. They dip their beaks into many a flower, and it's natural for them to ""contaminate"" your feeder this way. And in the summer, lots of microbes love balmy sugar water.Then there are ants, and wasps, which can swarm your feeders. Not so much you can do about the wasps. We've actually seen them drive away the birds when both species are competing for the nectar. However, they're only really bad in the late summer. The ants are another problem. We've tried many things to deter them, including washing them and the tree off with a hose. However, they're soon back. You can sometimes fool them simply by moving the feeder a few feet to another branch. We have several wire hooks in our favorite feeder tree for this purpose.Hope that helps! This is a nice set, and we think it's better than average quality for commercial hummingbird feeders -- beautiful to look at, and a wonderful focus of entertainment when the hummingbirds are hovering.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15II4WQLH2IZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBOXIXI#wasThisHelpful","R15II4WQLH2IZG","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I grew up with Coleman pressure lanterns as the child of missionaries in the South Pacific 3rd World. For years, Coleman pressure lanterns (and a few hurricane lanterns) lit our nights on the other side of the world.These days, as outdoor lovers -- and prepping for emergency power outages, short or long-term -- we decided to add a couple of these lanterns to our equipment. We love the fact that there's been a breakthrough in fuel supply. These also readily burn regular ""car"" gasoline and that makes them extra useful, and certainly worth a few more bucks. What you save on gasoline by the gallon alone is worth the money (yesterday, the price of a gallon of white gas at my hardware store was $13).In general, with all our equipment, we burn gasoline that is treated with Sea Foam SF-16 Motor Treatment - 16 oz.. This is so much better than the competitors' gasoline treatment-for-storage products, and keeps all your gasoline engines starting and running better. It came to us recommended by a highly experienced small engine mechanic, and our engine headaches largely disappeared after that. We use it regularly in all our equipment, truck and car. Treated gas burns great in this lantern, and I can even leave fuel in the tank, ready to go in an emergency.We bought this with another great ""blast from the past"" -- the Coleman Guide Series® Powerhouse(TM) Dual Fuel(TM) Stove. It's another classic, now improved by being able to burn gasoline as well.This lanterns comes in a strong hard shell, which makes taking it camping extra-easy.

"We recently bought this dual fuel Coleman 2-burner stove for camping, and prepping for any catastrophic event. I grew up in the 3rd World and I was delighted to unpack this well-made, large Coleman stove. To me it was like going home. For many years during the 1950s in the South Pacific, my family did a lot of our everyday cooking on one that was not so different from this. When I was at university in the early 70s, I bought one that was virtually identical to the new one, in design and ease of putting together, except the fuel tank was red and it took only Coleman white gas. I cooked on it on camp trips for many years, until it mysteriously disappeared (I bet someone's still using it). In recent times we've gone with throw-away-tank propane stove-tops. However, one tank of fuel with our new Coleman stove is equivalent to 4.5 small propane bottles, so this makes more sense.Some have said they thought the metal on this newer Coleman was flimsier. I don't think so! We also like the ""orange peel"" textured green paint. The gray tank, that still fits inside the stove while transporting and easily slides into place for use, seems as well designed as ever, and heavy duty.A true breakthrough is that this stove can take regular (unleaded) gasoline, in addition to traditional ""white gas"" fuel. That white fuel has gone up and up in price. Yesterday, a gallon at my local hardware store was $13! You figure that out, compared to a gallon of gas. To be able to fill the stove with regular gasoline makes this so affordable, and easy to use, with gas you can take from a 5-gallon fuel container, or even siphon from yard equipment or your car.Some people say that regular gas, especially with ethanol in it (which is associated with water in the gas), makes gasoline not as dependable a fuel source. It could foul your stove, they say. However, we treat all our gasoline with Sea Foam SF-16 Motor Treatment - 16 oz., which was recommended to me by a highly experienced small engine mechanic. Using it in my gasoline has gotten rid of the ""old gas"" and hard-start problems I used to have with our various infernal combustion engines, from weed-wackers to chainsaws, to ride'em lawnmower, compact backhoe, and our vehicles.I've been putting Seafoam-treated gasoline in my new Coleman stove, and it burns like a charm. No problems! We leave treated gas in the tank, ready to go camping, or for emergency cooking in a blackout.Love having a Coleman 2-burner again, and the dual-fuel option is a real bonus! Given an extended power outage, it could even be a lifesaver. It's certainly worth a few extra bucks to us. By the way, we teamed this up with the Coleman Premium Dual Fuel(TM) Lantern with Hard Carry Case, another gasoline-powered product very like one that lit our home in the South Pacific when I was a kid.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5XBIFTQEZE5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006I56J#wasThisHelpful","R5XBIFTQEZE5V","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We like alternative medicine, and so are fans of homeopathic treatments -- as contrasted to strong sleepin drugs. Therefore, in order to help get a good night's sleep, we use these Moon Drops just before bed. Just sucking one in the mouth is soothing, and helps get you calm before sleeping.That said, homeopathic traditional remedies are mild by nature. However, they are one of the sleep aids we rely on. You could take the whole box without any ill effects, and the product directions on the box (like a large matchbox that slides open) say you can take one every half hour as needed, for adults and children.We use in combination with the company's Historical Remedies, Lozenge Calm Drops, 30 Lozenges.The Moon Drops contain arsenicum, chamomilla, coffea cruda, gelsemium, ignatia, lycopodium, nat mur, nux vom, and that well known herbal sleep-inducer, valeriana.The lozenges are mildly sweet and do contain organic sugar (with vanilla and tapioca).All that said, when you're having a really difficult night getting to, or staying asleep, it's hard to tell if the Moon Drops are working.

"We like the taste of these and use them in conjunction with the same company's Homeopathic Moon Drops, 30 Count to assist with getting a good sleep at night. They come in a largish slide-out box like an old-fashion matchbox. The write-up says they are for temporary relief of anxiety, tension and irritability.

"We have a couple of these, purchased primarily for home protection. This is a decent quality (fighting) machete which could be used in a pinch clearing brush etc. It is shaped, however, as a sword.

"Security can be fun! This is a cool ""toy"" -- a voice-activated safe that responds not only to the child's secret self-chosen password or catch phrase, but to the timbre of their voice and even the inflection. We got this for an 8-yr-old-going-on-18 girl who has a younger brother. You get the drift. She has a hard time keeping anything private. But the Zillionz Safe for our future Zillionaire solves the problem. Now she can secretly program her safe and hide away her diary and ""precious"" items. But let's not get carried away. The safe is plastic, so it could be busted open with a hammer -- or stolen completely. But that's not the point. This can sit in her room, and with a little help from the parents as to the rules about safe-cracking, it can remain there, protecting her valuables and giving her a fun way to get a little privacy.The voice software built into this ""toy"" is pretty amazing. It's also easy to use. Press the blue button to get going (batteries, 3 x AAs) come with, so it's ready (unless they've gone flat on the shelf). It's intuitive, and there are spoken instructions (in a female voice). The new owner will be prompted to speak her secret password or phrase. She'll be asked to say it again to make sure. If it's not said exactly the same way again, it will not be accepted. Once the machine is satisfied with the result, it says so. Next time the child presses the same (blue) button, she'll be asked to provide her secret password. She must say it the same way -- believe me, we tried a slightly different phrasing or inflection and did not get a pass! Try again. But get it wrong twice and you're busted! A red light flashes and a siren goes off. At this point, little brother will be scuttling out of his sister's room! Say it correctly, though, and a green light flashes. There's a rumble and ca-ching, the door opens. Inside is a compartment to store bigger things, a little drawer, and a couple of removable shelves for valuables.Although this should not be announced to the entire family, should someone forget their password -- or presumably, each time batteries must be replaced -- the pass phrase will need to be reset. Probably with the help of an adult, the front door is removed by extracting two phillips screws. This reveals the battery compartment beneath -- and a reset hole which can be pressed to erase the former password and start over.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R886X46DZK70K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00421BD72#wasThisHelpful","R886X46DZK70K","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For $15+ dollars, we thought this was a pretty good deal -- a number of things you'll probably need for your Sandisk Sansa Clip Plus. They only fit this item, by the way -- too bad SanDisk has stopped making it! We got one recently as we wanted a dedicated MP music player to use in the car, and it really fits the bill -- tons of memory, especially if you add a tiny SanDisk 32gig card, as we did.The main thing we wanted was the 12-v car charger. It's good quality, and is doing the job -- although the SanDisk instructions say you can charge your device while driving in your car and playing music. Not so. As soon as we plug in the charger, the player stops playing and goes into charge mode. Oh well. One of the best things is the silicone sleeve for the SanDisk -- made for it. The other useful things are the AC adaptor for when you're on the go -- or want to charge the device indoors. There's a USB cable you can plug into your computer in order to transfer audio files -- and charges the device as well, by the by. There's a stereo mini-jack cable -- useful to run music and audiobooks in and out of the device.I couldn't figure out what the rubber fish keychain was -- no place to attach it to the Sandisk or silicone sleeve -- until we realized it is something you can wrap you earbud wires around when on the go. Clever.All said, you need this for your SanDisk MP player -- and it's not provided by SanDisk itself. I wonder why not?

"We call these the ""Happy Pig"" smoke detectors (because that's what they look like -- see photos below). There are 2 LED lights that flash from time-to-time in the red snouts to let you know the devices are working (they blink constantly when you need to replace the 9-v batteries that power them). Beneath the piggy snouts are the smiling ""mouths"" you see when you look up at the mounted units. These look to us like cute (and potentially life saving) ""Happy Pigs.""Reading the other reviews I must say first -- we did NOT get a free sample! We needed smoke detectors, read the specs, and bought 4 of these. With them we have upgraded smoke and fire detection in our entire house. The price of 4 was no big deal -- for what they are, they are cheap cheap!! Our old ones were installed when the home was built nearly twenty years ago. These were the expensive kind -- maybe $60 each, wired to the house power. However, those old detectors started to malfunction and we wondered if they were even working any more. Recently, we had a plumber fixing pipes in one of the bedrooms, churning up a lot of smoke as he soldered pipes, and the detector didn't work. Not even a peep -- although the green circuit light was on. Hmm. Time to make a change.In addition, while it probably seemed like a good idea at the time to wire those units so high, we have vaulted ceilings and without at least a 25-foot step ladder, there's no way to get to several of them. We decided we would only go with battery-powered units, installed where we can reach them, and forget about hardwiring them in.Why did we choose these ""Happy Pigs?""- They are cutting edge, with a micro-processor that detects the appearance of smoke, as well as a traditional smoke detector.- The smoke alarm is 85 db -- let me tell you, plenty loud!- They run on long-lasting 9v batteries. In fact, each one comes with its own battery. When you figure the price of these as part of the $10 cost of the unit, The Smiling Pig is also a Very Good Deal.- These units flash very briefly from time to time, letting you know they're awake, doing their job. It is such a brief flash, you don't even see it unless you're looking at the detector. That said, it is still a light that flashes a couple of times a minute, so we decided not to put these in the bedrooms. We've gone to a lot of trouble to make sure these rooms are pitch black -- complete with blackout curtains, and no device that emits light. So we mounted a Smiling Pig high up in the hall outside each bedroom door. We've tested them. They'd pretty much wake the dead. This time, in our great rooms, we mounted units up on walls where we can actually get to them on a standard stepladder. Sure, it might be wiser to have them at the roof for early detection of smoke, but better to have them where we can change batteries -- and of course, turn them OFF if they are set off by burning toast etc., without a major panic.It's easy to mount these as well. It wouldn't really matter which way around they were turned, but there's a natural up and down look to the Smiling Pigs. Grab the back plate between fingers of one hand, and the main part in your other, and turn slightly and they come apart. The plate mounts to the wall with 2 screws (and drywall plastic supports) that also come-with. You can hold the backing plate up so the screw holes are in horizontal line and mark the screw holes with a pencil. Instead of a drill, try using a punch or even a phillips-head screwdriver tapped in with a hammer, to make a hole for the plastic inserts. Twist in your screws through the plates. Fit the detector over the plate and give it a twist -- not even a quarter turn. Voila. You're in business.You can test your unit with the handy little knob on the front. A quick push, and the snout lights blink. That's all you need. Really want to test the sound? Hold down that knob!Our Happy Pigs give us peace of mind -- and when we happen to notice 'em, they put a smile on our faces as well.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XYU52Z0N7YYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01326H682#wasThisHelpful","R1XYU52Z0N7YYM","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got one of these and the plug didn't work -- the blue LED light didn't come on and I returned it for a full refund. Got another. Works perfectly. It plugs right in, and provides a USB input as well for another device. The blue light lets you know it's working. It's easy to figure out. You can tune in any FM station in your area of course, but I don't need it for this as I have a good Honda car radio. What I want, because the vehicle is pre-mini-stereo-jack in the radio for smart phone and MP music players to plug in, is to use this iClever tuner to find a free FM station, and use it to run my Sandisk MP music through it. It's easy to figure out -- intuitive -- and I've readily discovered a batch of ""free"" (available) FM stations. You leave this tuner on one of those, and then manually set your car radio for the same station. Just plug the comes-with stereo mini-jack into your phone or other device where your tunes are stored, and away you go.One tip: I thought my tuner wasn't working at first because I had everything hooked up right, and couldn't hear my music. First, set your device (phone or player) to play as loudly as it can without distortion -- tested through your earphones etc. Then plug it into the FM tuner. Then crank up your car radio volume.

"I have a particular interest in this event and an arresting record of world history, as I write about the period and place myself. Therefore, I've read hundreds of books about WWII in general, and the atomic attack by the US on Japan, in particular.This book is a priceless piece of history, as it is an account by those who were actually there, of the events that took place in Nagasaki around and after the bomb went off on August 9, 1945. It's of special interest that the primary witness was a doctor who lived through the devastation, and dedicated his efforts to helping the survivors.I'm bemused by the reviewers who think theymust take a stand for or against the historical fact that the US employed atomic weapons against Japan, in the only war-time use of such weapons of mass destruction in the history of the planet. I presume it will always be controversial, and although I've read a great deal about it, I don't think it's my place as a student of history to have to take such a stand. Certainly, far more destruction and loss of life in WWII -- including all deaths caused by America and Japan -- were caused by more conventional weapons, including ""carpet bombing"" employed by both sides.There's a great deal of misinformation out there about what actually happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki when those man-made ""suns"" lit up over their cities. Books like this one -- now out of print -- tell it through the priceless historical words of those who were there. IF those eyewitnesses happen to be Japanese, perhaps biased towards their own country's viewpoint, this is not a condemnation of the works. It in fact makes them even more valuable -- an insight, largely forgotten now, of the way people thought. More than 70 years later, those of us with an interest in the world-shaking events of WWII -- from Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, can be nothing but grateful for this irreplaceable record.Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HKDY2EIIKJBE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0704333821#wasThisHelpful","R2HKDY2EIIKJBE","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The only time it can't do a good job -- and it's fairly often -- is when there are stones around the root, and then the pincers get jammed up with rocks. But that's not the device's fault -- just goes literally with the turf.This weeder has saved my low back a lot of grief! A couple of quibbles: I could have used another 6"" on the handle (there's a more expensive version with an adjustable one) -- and yes, I'd feel a little more confident stomping on the ""foot"" if it was some sort of metal.That said, it does a great job for me.Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6NXNM9HLKZJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030MIHAU#wasThisHelpful","R6NXNM9HLKZJ1","A23RQRX7LO7NG8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23RQRX7LO7NG8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a confession to make: we use this to ""reclaim"" fancy bottles from the recycling bins for our collection. We must reach into a deep ""garbage"" container and the Nifty Nabber must close firmly, or we'll hear the sound of shattering glass. We've never dropped a bottle. Also recently, I was trimming our large ornamental ""angle wing"" prickly pear cacti, and the only way I could pick up the multiple ""paddles"" was with this device.

"I received a bottle of The Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Joyal Beauty in exchange for an honest review. I really like this product! This serum is reasonably priced and it's very easy to use! After using about 1 pump every night my skin feels much more hydrated, clearer and brighter! I also think this product evened out my skin tone. My acne has gotten a lot better and my face is so hydrated and soft I just love it!This is 100% made of natural ingredients.This product is very light and thin. It doesn't leave a greasy residue either nor will it leave your skin feeling sticky and misty.  I have sensitive skin and had no issues with using this product at all! Joyal Beauty really stands behind their products and this serum really does what it promises to do! I recommend this serum to anyone who wants their face to be softer and bring back a healthy/ younger look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN7I9U3RQCIT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2NCCV4#wasThisHelpful","RN7I9U3RQCIT0","A2PGCJQPNMUBSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PGCJQPNMUBSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great thing about knowing someone who has a baby is getting to buy them stuff for the baby. When I saw this Universal Stroller Organizer - Premium Design I loved it.  I couldn’t wait to get it and give it to my girlfriend's sister! She loved it and couldn't wait to use it for the little one!This Universal Stroller Organizer - Premium Design helps keep all her baby stuff organized and easy to carry rather than a huge diaper bag. The best part is that it sits at the top of the stroller so no bending down needed! Everything is easily accessible. The organizer also holds a lot and is adjustable and works perfectly for strollers, shopping carts, car headrests, and bicycles! I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a little one.I received product free or heavily discounted in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are true and my own.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16937OXO5ACU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PVXCXW#wasThisHelpful","R16937OXO5ACU7","A2PGCJQPNMUBSS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PGCJQPNMUBSS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
