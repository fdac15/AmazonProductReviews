"The bacteria is dead.  I tried to culture it, but it did not work.  This product needs to be stored and shipped cool.  If not, the bacteria will be dead.  I tried to culture this with no results.  Another product I bought at a local store cultured fine.  It seems this is very sensitive to heat.  I bought the yogourmet box and it cultures fine.  I did not order online.http://www.amazon.com/Yogourmet-Freeze-Dried-Yogurt-Starter/dp/B001GVIS4M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415745571&sr=8-1&keywords=yogourmetThis product is very good.  You will see a big white blob with tentacles.  It grows pretty fast.  You will need to shake it up before you put it in the fridge.I also add a tiny amount of sugar once a week to my cultures.  I have several bottles going at once.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R348F8T2UBODAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I6W0XG#wasThisHelpful","R348F8T2UBODAU","A2Z2LI2VL4IHYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2LI2VL4IHYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book tells you everything you need to know about Hormones.  When you hit 45, your hair starts to fall out and the rest of you starts to dry up.  You dry up in places you did not know you could dry up. :(This is the best book I've found that explains hormone balance for women.  There are solutions.  Do not accept drying up and blowing away.  I personally use Solaray Phytoestrogen capsules to stop hot flashes and keep my hair from falling out.  I have found it more effective than bio-identical hormone cream.  The hormone cream is only one type of estrogen.  You make at least 3 main types.  Your body will use Phytoestrogen herbs to make the full complement of hormones.The hormone cream is good for the parts of you that dry out.  This book explains how to use it for that.  You can get your life back.If you have hair loss, you can take phytoestrogens to make it stop falling out.  The herb he shou wu or fo-ti will make you grow new hair on your head.  You can see it within a month at the hairline.

"I am an acupuncturist and have recommended this product for years.  I decided to compare it to Sambucol and other brands and found only 100 mg of elderberry per serving.

"I am an acupuncturist and have tried many brand of Echinacea.  This is the only brand that has been helpful.  You have to get a liquid extract and this one is the best.  Only take for 3 weeks at a time.  It is use for acute onset cold or flu.  Take some every hour if you can.  It needs to drip down the back of your throat to inhibit the virus from going deep into your lungs.That said, Elderberry is stronger and a proven anti-viral at any stage of the disease.  Echinacea is only effect the first few days.  Sambucol makes the best quality and strongest elderberry.  You can take it daily for the whole cold/flu season.  You can also buy elderberry cough drops from Zand.

"Everyone needs a copy of this book.  This book is a reference of how viruses take over your body and make you sick or kill you.The Spanish Flu in 1918 killed 100 million people worldwide.  This virus was virulent and caused bleeding very similar to Ebola.There are many herbal options to prevent and treat viral infections.  If you understand the process of how the virus invades and kills, you are prepared to take the appropriate herbs to survive.  It is simple.  There is no downside to taking herbs to treat viruses.  The herbs do more than kill viruses, there are many benefits to taking them.Do not wait until you have bad symptoms to take your herbs.  You can often knock out a virus in the first 24 hours if you are aggressive and take the right supplements.Viruses mutate.  You might already know that.  However, the author explains that some viruses mutate as they reproduce.  That means that you might have dozens of different strains of the virus inside you.  You can't wait for immunization to save you.  Even if you believe it would, they cannot possibly have an effective vaccine to save you when it is already mutating after it invades you.  There will be another strain coming shortly, which will probably be worse than the first round.My advice is to go through this book and pick the herbal remedies that address the most factors associated with viral replication.  Buy the supplements and have a big stock of them.I'm an herbalist and I'm recommending this book to everyone who will listen.  It offers insight into why viruses are so deadly and what to do about it.  It's a fascinating read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7KHD4QDX6DZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612121608#wasThisHelpful","R7KHD4QDX6DZS","A2Z2LI2VL4IHYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2LI2VL4IHYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most thorough book on Hashimoto's I have found.  The book recommends you take strong probiotics.  If you take a regular probiotic, it only has a billion or so active units.  She says that you have hundreds of trillions of bacteria in your intestines and the small dosages are not enough to make a change.  She recommends using live foods like Kefir.  I started taking Coconut water Kefir and within days noticed a huge difference in how I felt.I am very grateful to this author for providing this information.  I drink Coconut water Kefir daily.  You can buy the cultures and make your own very inexpensively.  Each dosage of a tablespoon has about a trillion active units.  I drink 1/4 cup per day.  You can buy the Kefir culture powder, combine it with coconut water, leave on the counter for 3 days and you have your own inexpensive Kefir.  Each package of Kefir starter costs about a dollar.  Be sure to keep it cool, or the bacteria will die.You can also buy a starter bottle at your local health food store.  When the bottle starts to run out, make sure the white stuff on the bottom is not poured out.  Just add coconut water that has sugar in it, leave it out on the counter for 24 hours and put it back in the fridge.  You have just made your own Kefir, with trillions of active units.She says if there is one thing she wants you to remember from her book, it is that you need to take very high dose probiotics.  You will see your Hashimoto's and leaky gut calm down when you start to do that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H90E6CORW1GO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0615825796#wasThisHelpful","R1H90E6CORW1GO","A2Z2LI2VL4IHYW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z2LI2VL4IHYW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product is a good combination of cayenne, hawthorn, and other heart tonics.  Cayenne stimulates your heart and is useful in congestive heart failure.  I recommend ubiquinol, which is Co Q 10.  200 mg per day minimum will relieve chest pain and energize your heart.This product is the only type of cayenne I have been able to use that does not cause acid reflux.  It is the combination of herbs that balance each other out.If you have heart problems, I recommend making a tea of hawthorn, you can drink it all day.  You can buy the herbal extract under the Chinese name, which is Shan Zha.  The Chinese use this to make candy, like we use cherries.  It has been used for hundreds of years as a heart tonic.  It will take a few months, but if you are consistent, you will notice a difference in your energy level.

"I am an herbalist and use gotu kola for anxiety and stress.  It also improves memory.  This product only has 100 mg of gotu kola extract per capsule.  If you compare it to the raw gotu kola capsule, which has 500 mg per capsule, this product is not a good deal.  Each one of these capsules would be the equivalent active ingredient of one capsule of raw herb, but the price is much higher.I love Solgar as a brand, but they should have put at least 200 mg of extract per capsule.  I recommend using Nature's Way gotu kola.  You take three capsules in the morning and are stress free the rest of the day.I have not bought this product, due to the low dosage.  Solaray makes an extract of gotu kola, they use the latin name, which is centella asiatica.  It has 250 mg per capsule of the EXTRACT.  This is similar to taking 3 capsules of the raw herb.

True Zeppelin collectors have known about these recordings through off-the-air recorded fan tapes, and bootleg LPs and CDs for 40 years. This set is incomplete; Led Zeppelin – The Complete British Broadcasting Corporation Radio Sessions (Empress Valley EVSD-410/411/412/413) or Led Zeppelin – BBC Archives (Scorpio LZ-040171) are two bootleg sets (among others) that have all existing recordings, and the sound on them is for the most part excellent, if not *quite* as good as this, the legitimate release.

"This is an astounding collection of materials concerning the original Bavarian Illuminati, its' complete initiatory rituals, its' knowledge lectures, more bona-fide, bedrock information on the *actual* rites and teachings of those Illuminated Seers than has ever before been published in English. Forget the 200+ years of disinformation and anti-Illuminati propaganda you have been fed, and learn the truth.This book could (and should) be compared with ""The Masonic Magician: The Life and Death of Count Cagliostro and His Egyptian Rite"", ""Duncan's Ritual of Freemasonry,"" ""Ordo ab Chao: The Original and Complete Rituals, 4th-33rd Degrees of the first Supreme Council, 33rd Degree at Charleston, South Carolina,"" ""Secret Rituals of the OTO"" (or ""OTO Rituals and Sex Magick"" if you can find it), ""The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor: Initiatic and Historical Documents of an Order of Practical Occultism"", and ""The Complete Golden Dawn System of Magic"" for a basic overview of the development of Secret Societies and their Initiatory Mysteries for the last 250 years (or so). The similarities between them all are quite as telling as their differences, and quite telling to the student of these Western Initiatory Schools. Highly recommended, especially in conjunction with the works previously mentioned (I have them all). It *is* very dry reading, not something that a casual reader will find engaging, but it is a wealth of material and information for those Initiates who seek the threads of ""The Authentic Tradition"" (as Jonathan Sellers and T.

"This is a Japanese made Laserdisc of the Walt Disney Movie ""Song Of The South"". Like many Laserdiscs of its time it has two sound channels that run different sound tracks, on this disc with the Japanese soundtrack in the right channel, the English soundtrack in the left channel. You may have to disconnect the right channel wire on the back of the player, if your Laserdisc player doesn't have a channel on/off button (later players don't) in order to hear the original soundtrack (in mono) unimpeded. All of the songs are Japanese subtitled. The Japanese subtitles are burned in the video data and not removable through a (cc) button on the Laserdisc Player's remote control. This is the only NTSC format release, the late 80's UK Videotape release is/was PAL format. All DVD releases currently sold are pirated copies of either this Laserdisc or the UK Videotape and are inferior.This Laserdisc WILL NOT work in DVD or Blu Ray Players. You must have a Laserdisc Player to play this disc. Be aware that Laserdiscs can be a perishable format, and some discs may experience degradation of data, or ""laser rot.""

"Jeez! I hardly know where to begin. I appreciate that this is the first Syd Barrett compilation that includes both his solo work and some of his work in the Pink Floyd, but some fresh material would have nice.It's not like there aren't unreleased tracks: This would have been the PERFECT place to put the demo tapes of ""In The Beechwoods"" and (maybe) ""She's A Millionaire"", the Jenner mixes of ""Scream Thy Last Scream"" and ""Vegetable Man"", the Pink Floyd BBC performances from 67-68 with Syd... but NOOOOO! We get Gilmore belatedly laying new bass tracks on a 40-year old track and remixing some other existing tracks. Not to say that some of these tracks couldn't have used some smoothing out prior to their original release, but the warts 'n all nature of ""Opel"" and the Peel BBC sessions are part of their charm...Supposedly, if you buy this CD, you can download an MP3 of Syd's ""Ramadan"" a 'lost track' from the ""Madcap Laughs"" sessions, but I see NO mention of this in the product description-- the *only* really 'previously unreleased' track associated with the whole CD; but previous descriptions of that track by the few who have heard it indicate that it's little more than an extended rhythm/drum composition, not a ""song"" with a tune or lyrics. However, that requires one to have a CD driver/player, more and more computers (like the one I'm writing this from) don't *have* a CD Drive.The cover is credited to Storm Studios, which I can only presume is Storm Thorgerson. It's pretty lame. I don't know who did the booklet paintings, but they aren't done by Syd, which makes one wonder what the Hell they're doing here. Syd was an artist who has many paintings that could have/should have been included here instead these incongruous illustrations that do nothing but take up a few pages of booklet.I really can't think of who this CD was made for-- Syd's dedicated fans already *have* all of this material, and a perfectly good solo compilation, ""Wouldn't You Miss Me?"" was already released a decade or so ago.

It easily slides over the oven. There are two elastic bands that go under the left and right side table. These help hold the cover on, even in a VERY windy environment.

With the subscribe and save discount, we pay about $1 a bag.I really like the chips. It feels like you are eating a healthier snack then regular chips.... though OBVIOUSLY not as healthy as just eating an apple.What I find frustrating, is they assume that this bag has 2.5 servings. Typically I don't look at that while I eat a whole bag myself. I will say that often times my wife and I will mix a bag of granny smith with a bag of caramel apple. The sour and the sweet make a nice balance of flavors.Every now and then you will find an apple stem in the bag.

Ahhh, those were the days.Should you have a phone you want to mount on the wall, this 8 inch cable will let you do that without having much extra wire behind the phone.These type of phone cables are pretty basic, they either work or they don't. When I plugged it in, the phone immediately worked.I purchased this from amazon for under $5. It could be possible to find it in a local store for less. But I didn't feel like going to walmart or radio shack and dealing with it. Instead I clicked the ""buy it now with 1 click"" and it showed up 2 days later.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZMYLGUFZVVJW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EGO9NY#wasThisHelpful","RZMYLGUFZVVJW","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had high hopes for this access point. Xclaim is a division of Ruckus, one of the best WiFi manufacturers that exists. Most people probably have never heard of Ruckus because they are focused on the enterprise.The plan for the xclaim division is to sell a consumer friendly version of their amazing hardware. To help reduce costs, some of the higher end features have been removed.Initially, the only way to configure xclaim hardware was to use an app that ran on either IOS and Android devices. After many complaints, they recently added the ability to configure it via a web browser. Although if you started setting it up on an android device you couldn't also use a web browser.... it was either one or the other.While I am very comfortable setting up wifi and networking devices, i found this product to still be half baked. Fortunately, future software and firmware updates will be able to resolve a lot of these issues. And Xclaim is being very proactive to do just that. While my initial rating is only three stars, I plan on revisiting this device when they have worked out some of the kinks. At that point I will update this review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IUSHXNFHA1D0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q5PG3KA#wasThisHelpful","R3IUSHXNFHA1D0","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me say upfront that typically, Typically, I don't like these types of cases. They take a beautiful thin device like the iPhone and wrap it up with a much thicker box. My preference is a much thinner case. But while that works for me, that might not be best in all situations.For some people, there is a strong need for a case that not only covers the iPhone from small accidents, but also protects from far more severe damaage like dropping it, to even protection from the natural world. If your phone needs full protection, the Lifeproof case should be high on your consideration list.According to their website, the life proof case is designed to protect your device from water (surf, swim or soak), dirt (including dust, sand, grit and mud), snow (snow, ice and sleet) or even shock (built to exceed stringent Military Specifications for drop protection).Of course with this protection does come some concessions. First, while they claim that this case lets you have full use of the touch id, I found that the results were spotty, I would say that less then 50% of the time it worked.Second, the case is designed to use the actual screen of your phone. Let me say that again another way, this case does not protect your screen. So with all the other protection this case offers, Should your iPhone land screen first onto something.... you could have extreme scratches or a shattered display.Finally, the case isn't cheap. $90 MSRP. At that price you have to ask if you really need your device life proofed.Personally, I don't think that I am the target market for this case. But if you need to use this device in extreme enviornments, or are prone to accidental damage, this might be the best case for you","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E1R8QWGDVA1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGKQAJK#wasThisHelpful","R1E1R8QWGDVA1H","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This flash is nearly identical to the Canon speed flash 580II..... except one BIG one.... the price. I have been using it for a while now and it is extremely reliable. But if it breaks, no problem, I'll buy a second. And should I need to do that it will still be over $350 less then just one canon flash.Honestly, my guess is someone for yongnou snuck into canon's  office, and stuck out with the blue prints for their flash, It looks nearly identical right down to the font they used on the front of it. It is like you are getting the Cannon flash for a tenth of the price. I purchased this with the remote trigger by yongnou (YONGNUO YN560-TX for Canon Flash Transmitter). They pared near instantly, and never have a problem communicating. It was under $50, which means you can get both a flash and remote trigger for less then the cost of just a set of triggers. With quality and reliability like this, Yongnou is posed to turn the photography world on its head.Don't think, just buy both of these.

"Can I let you in on a little secret. I am a man, with kids, and tried this tan in a can. I typically wear shorts year round. In the summer, I get a pretty decent amount of color. But when it is cold out, and the color has faded away, sometimes my legs can look a little too pale.There is a little odor to it, and I would highly recommend that you wash you hands well after you are done. That said, it goes on pretty easily and just a small amount tends to do the trick. I would highly recommend starting with a light application the first time. Also make sure that you blend it our all over to give a uniform coat. The color lasts a few days. The trick is to do light applications to build up a little color.... rather then go from pale to copper all at once.My wife laughed at me when I told her about this. Well, since it has been really cold out lately and she noticed that I was a little darker, it wasn't like I could keep it a secret to her. So we had our little chuckle... well.... there was more laughing by her then me to be honest.I am still on the fence about this. I will say this is purely a vanity product. It isn't something you need. And more importantly, it may not be the right product for everyone. Should you want a little color without the ability to spend time in the sun, give this a try, it may help you get get through the last of the winter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BP0DNFL69XIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q23KER8#wasThisHelpful","R1BP0DNFL69XIO","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Even though I am an adult, I find that I do enjoy candy now and then. Having eaten my fair share of both juicy fruit gum and starburst over the years, I decided to give this gum a chance.It tastes just as you can imagine starburst to taste like. Though after chewing for a little while, it became a little too much for me and was spit into the trash. I think I lasted about 15 minutes. Truly, I think I am not the market that juicy fruit is going after.My kids on the other hand loved it. Not a piece offered to them was wasted. In fact they have regrettably asked me to get them more of it. One thing that is a bit nice is it is sugar free... though lets face it, even if it isn't sugar,  they have to be using something to sweeten it up.If you are debating trying this my advice is this: if offered gum would you rather have something like cinnamon or mint; or are you a hubba-bubba type person. If you said choice one, look elsewhere. But if you enjoy the fruity-fruit, hubby-bubba, silly gums, you will probably really enjoy this too.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T9QTX0KDKS74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QT2ACME#wasThisHelpful","R3T9QTX0KDKS74","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is based on the 1996 Tim Burton movie of the same name. What I loved about that movie it unapologetically killed characters left and right. All the while the aliens had that same goofy look on their face. While it isn't going to win any movie awards, it is a funny movie to watch should you be in the right mood. Since then topps has also created trading cards based on the movie.The point of the game is to kill off all of the poor helpless citizen of earth.  You need at least three players for this game. Basically,  game is played by rolling the dice and hoping to destroy cities. There are three different symbols that can come up when you roll: ray guns, martian heads and nukes. After you pick a city card to attack, roll all of the dice. To conquer a city, you need to roll a certain number of ray guns. Should you get a martian head, you may choose to roll only those dice again. Roll enough nukes and your turn is over. Once enough ray guns are rolled, the city is conquered.There are other elements that make the game interesting. For example some city cards have special rules that come into play come into play once the city is defeated. Also, there are monument cards (like grand canyon) that are defeated by rolling enough martian heads instead of ray guns.So how do you win the game? Each city or monument card has a specific number of victory points. The harder to defeat that card, the more points. The person at the end of the game with the most points wins. The game takes about 20 minutes to play.My kids and I like to play this game. Since it is fairly quick paced, we can play a few times in an hour. Also, since most of what you are doing is rolling dice, it isn't too hard to coach my younger kids while playing. The premise is pretty straight forward and it is not only easy to understand but quick to learn. And even though it isn't too hard to learn, it is also enjoyable to play with just adults.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAPFHGUMA08TB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5KD7FI#wasThisHelpful","RAPFHGUMA08TB","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is a huge fan of Melissa and Doug toys. While they do tend to be a little more expensive, they are always really well made and will last a lot longer then the cheap plastic toys that seem to be too common. We have purchased quite a few toys made by M& D and have never  been disappointed. So with that, I decided to give this set of headbands and barrettes to two of my daughters. While they are both pre-pre-teens, they have developed a keen sense of fashion.As the description mentioned, the set comes with 2 headbands, 6 barrettes, 10 decorative pieces, 1 sticker sheet, and 5 glitter sheets. The set is designed that kids can add their own bling to the headbands and barrettes. As a parent, one of my favorite parts is the mess free glitter. It is surprisingly, just that, mess free. And it was not only very easy for them to do themselves, it kept them busy for several hours. Further more, they willl use it for quite some time to come.If you have girls, and they are into hair, fashion etc, this would make a great gift for them. At under $13, it is slightly more expensive then just buying headbands and barrettes. But seriously, for what it is, and the quality and no-mess nature, the Melissa and Doug brand set a high standard for other brands to live up to. I am not only happy to endorse it, but I am thrilled to give it to my girls to play with.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QCK2SO2RU3ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QR38RW2#wasThisHelpful","R2QCK2SO2RU3ZH","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I would eat them again if other options weren't available. Probably the best part of these is they are under 300 calories. Taking this into account, my opinion of them does improve.

"A keyboard, for the iPad?. On the one hand, I carry an iPad to liberate me from the complexity and bulk of a laptop. Yet on the other hand there are times that I really miss using a keyboard if I need to write a lot. If you find your self in this position, you may want to check out this keyboard case.As a little backstory, I have used a fair number of the different keyboards for the iPad. It always seems like you have to make sacrifices when using them. This case is no exception to that. But if you can live with some of those concessions, you may be looking at one of the better iPad keyboard cases.Lets get the cons out of the way. The first is it adds a bit more thickness and weight to the iPad. Not so much to be annoying, but definitely noticeable. Sadly it feels like it almost doubles the weight.Second, some of fit and finish feels a little cheap. Which is ironic, because other parts feel really well made. There is a high quality leathery feel cover but the keyboard side feels like it is more flimsy.Third, should you have large hands, you may struggle with the keyboard. It is quite a bit smaller then you standard computer keyboard. For many if not most people, this may not be a problem. But there are going to be other people who just have a hard time adjusting to the reduced size.Now that we have gotten those out of the way, there are many things that can be appreciated about this case.First it is fairly easy to get the iPad in and out of the case. I found that I take it with me when I travel, but keep it in my bag unless I need it. All other times I use a much slimmer case. For me, I only use the keyboard 25% of the time, so most of the time the added weight and thickness is a non-issue for me.Should the keyboard spacing not be an issue for you, this really is one of the nicest iPad keyboards I have used. It is very responsive and tactically, feels almost as nice as a regular keyboard. I have never found that battery life on it to be a problem. While welkin claims up to 160 hours of battery life, I typically get around 2/3rds that amount of time. Which is pretty good as the iPad only lasts 10 hours.So should you buy this? Well I think it boils down to this: Do you need to type a lot on your iPad? If yes, this is the one to put on your very short list. If you don't type a lot, then I wouldn't recommend it. As good as it is in this category, I could not help but feel that it wasn't the ideal way to use a tablet. For me, the truth is, if I have to type a lot, I prefer using a real keyboard connected to a computer. But since everyone is different, and there situation is unique, for others, this may be the ideal setup.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28AX464ZGXS0I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTDTNLE#wasThisHelpful","R28AX464ZGXS0I","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this to my young nephew. Lately he has developed a real fascination with pirates. So I figured he would enjoy this set.The included pieces are nice. They aren't too small for his young hands. Basically, you have outfits that you can put on either pirate. There are pants, shirts, and headwear to create many dress variations. Also included are some traditional pirate accessories (monkey, parrot, map treasure chest, etc). This should give the basis for many pirate adventures.One of the pirates names is Capt Jack. Depending on your child, and how familiar they may be with the Johnny Depp version, this may be a little confusing. But this is more of a nit-picky type issue, and definitely not a con.The whole set comes in a nice transparent carrying bag.

"At it's most basic form, this is just a towel. But with a little creative magic, one corner has been turned into a hat with cute eyes to make an owl. The sum of the parts turn a simple towel into something fun that young kids enjoy using.We gave this to our youngest child. Sometimes bath time can be a little tricky. First she doesn't want to get into the tub (or shower). Then, when she finally gets in she doesn't want to get out. I am not going to lie and say that this towel has solved all of our problems..... but it does make it a little easier. She does love to use it. And it has made getting her out of the tub easier.... well just a little easier.The towel is a good quality. It isn't the best, but it is really nice. stitching and the accents are also well done. My only complaint about it, is it is nearly $20, which isn't too crazy priced, but seems to be at the top of the price range for this type of towel.Should you have a little one, or need to buy a gift for one, this should definitely be considered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXEL6K7GJS72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N3R9990#wasThisHelpful","RXEL6K7GJS72","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this is anticipation of spring. We have a fair amount of small brush and shrubbery in front of our house and it is always a challenge to keep it all looking clean. Granted the electric trimmer does a lot of the major pruning, but sometimes you need to cut specific pieces. These will do the trick. As advertised, they will cut up to 3/4 of an inch. You may be able to cut slightly thicker, though you run the risk of damaging the pruners.We tested them on a few small bush limbs that were sticking out, and were impressed with how easily they clipped without having to overly expert effort. A simple squeeze was enough force to go through most of the small branches of the bushes. We are definitely looking forward to using them more in the spring as all of the shrubs begin to fill out.Like similar products there is a lock at the top. Once enabled, the blades are locked closed. To disable to lock squeeze the blades and flip the switch.

"As a parent of 4 kids we have been through our fair share of toys and clothes and baby supplies. Something that you always need is a place for the baby to sleep. While we did have a dedicated room for each of our newborns, we found that it wasn't always the ideal place for them to sleep. This bed can help over come that.One of the core features of this bed, is the ""rock'n"" feature. Basically you put a d-battery into it and when you turn it on it gently vibrates the bed. As most people know when you hold you baby and pat or rub him, he will tend to stay asleep. But as then as soon as you put  him down and walk away, like magic, you baby knows you left and will cray for you to return. The vibration helps to simulate to the baby that feeling that you are still there. While it doesn't work 100% of the time, more often then not it is great.We had 3 previous versions of this bed. It was interesting to see the slight evolution that it has taken over there years. Most of it is minor design tweaks. The fabric seems nicer. Also, the batter is now easier to get in.We found that this was used, more often then not, as where our kids slept the first few weeks and even months. Primarily because of the vibration feature, but also because it is much easier to get a newborn in and out of this bed vs a traditional large crib. And lets face it, it is so nice to move this where ever you need it to be and you can even move it while you baby is asleep.The bed is sets up and fold up very easily. It is very lightweight and doesn't take up much floor space so it can be moved where ever you need it to be. Fisher-Price also makes this same sleeper with a few other options. First there are a variety of design patterns. Some are more playful, have stronger color combinations or look more like animals. Also, you can get it with or without the ""rock'n"" feature.This bed may not be for every baby. Should you baby have special needs you may find better solutions. But at least for us, we used these for many years and have loved them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QO7AP7HM1SXB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETGMQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QO7AP7HM1SXB","A1LYMYNURB9EWW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LYMYNURB9EWW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve tried a lot of different products to clean pots, pans & baking dishes but so far these Heavy Duty Scouring Dish Cloths that I received from The Scrubbie People are my favorites!I don’t put any of my pots, pans or bakeware in the dishwasher so I sometimes struggle to get them clean. Since I’ve had these scouring cloths, I’ve cleaned a glass lasagna dish & several aluminum pans & my cast iron skillet. I was surprised that it really didn’t take much elbow grease to get these clean. They are very lightweight but strong enough to clean greasy or baked-on food messes without scratching.This is a set of two cloths that are about 12” square. They are not rough on my hands, they rinse out easily without leaving food behind & they dry quickly. They don’t end up smelling bad like sponges so I will be able to use these for a very long time.

"I am in love with these Decorative Double Glide Shower Curtain Hooks from Amazer! They are so much easier to use than my regular shower curtain hooks.I chose the Oil Rubbed Bronze hooks because that is the color that we use for metal accents in our home. The color is really pretty & the hooks are strong. The top has an open side so I didn’t have to struggle with pulling the hooks apart & then clip them back together again. I just set them down onto my shower curtain rod & I was ready to put my shower curtain & liner onto the hooks. I love not having to put both onto the same hook. They hang much nicer on separate hooks & I can easily replace the liner or the curtain without having to take both off of the hooks. Because the hooks have an open top, I’m no longer worried about scratching my shower curtain rod. And the roller balls glide easily back & forth without having to tug at the shower curtain.I received this product at a deep discount  in exchange for my honest review.

"I’m not a gamer but my son is so I asked him to help me test the Artix Gaming Headset from Sentey.I have several Sentey products that I like so I was not surprised that we like this headset as well. It is connected via USB port which works for me because I use it with my PC & my son uses it on a gaming system. The headset is lightweight even though all of the padding around the earphones makes it look heavier. The sound quality is very good except for a faint static in the right earphone. It’s not noticeable when I’m listening to music but my son said that when he played games it was annoying. The earphones are an odd shape & would probably fit better if they were round. The USB cord is long enough to be able to sit on the bed while playing games. The controls & the mic are on the left side of the headset & the mic folds completely out of the way when it’s not being used. But I think the feature that my sons loves most are the blue LED lights on each side of the headset. They do make the headset look cool!As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"I love the long handle on this Exfoliating Bath Brush from Earth Essence because I can reach my whole back when I’m showering!This bath brush is on an 13” long wooden handle with a cord for hanging. The brush head can be detached from the handle to use it with the strap attached to the back. This is great for easy-to-reach spots, then reattach it to the handle for the harder-to-reach spots. This also comes with a loofah that has a hand strap as well.The bath brush is very invigorating & my skin feels so clean after I use it. The bristles are soft so that they do not irritate my skin or make it red but still exfoliate. After I scrub with the brush, I follow with the loofah. The brush can be used on either wet or dry skin. I’ve tried dry scrubbing but it’s not for me so I use this in the shower.This bath brush set would be a nice addition to a spa gift basket for a holiday gift, for a new mom, Mother’s Day or a birthday.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"I often listen to New Age music, especially when I’m practicing yoga, bu I was not familiar with Laura Sullivan until I received Pianoscapes for the Trails of North America.I received an autographed CD & immediately popped it into our Blu-Ray player to give it a listen. This is one very talented lady! As soon as Magic Mountain started to play, I forgot about whatever I had been working on & just sat to listen to the music. Before the song had ended, I was sitting on the floor with my eyes closed, just breathing & listening. I was happy to hear her adaptation of Pachelbel’s Canon in D but my favorite track is Sunset on Cloud Palace.This is the perfect music to take you to another place & destress. As busy as our lives are, it is important to just sit & do nothing from time to time. This is the perfect background for that & I look forward to listening to it each day. I’m listening to it as I write this review & I’ve stopped several times just to stare out the window at the trees & sky while I enjoy the music.The holidays are almost here & this would make a wonderful gift for anyone who enjoys instrumental music or take it as a hostess gift to a holiday party & you’ll be sure to be invited back again!

"I’ve tried several selfie sticks but had various problems with each of them so they are all in the closet & we don’t use them. But I wasn’t giving up & when I received this Pro Selfie Stick from Aerb, I crossed my fingers & opened the box.This comes with the monopod, the phone clip, a Micro USB charging cable & User Manual. It was already charged when I received it so I turned it on & the little blue light next to the switch came on. Then I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone & it just scanned for a couple of seconds then showed “Selfie” on the list of Available Devices. I tapped it & it paired immediately. Once I had screwed the phone clip onto the monopod, I got ready to take a photo to see if this selfie stick was going to work for me. I pressed the button and….it worked!!I was so excited to finally have a selfie stick that I can actually use & I even called my husband at work to tell him. Of course, he wasn’t as excited as I was but this is the 4th one that I’ve tried & the only one that works. And the stick extends out far enough that I’ll be able to get a whole group of people in my photos so I can’t wait to use it when we have our family together over the holidays.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"I wanted this Smart Shaker Alarm by iLuv for my son because he uses his phone alarm but he is so used to hearing it that he ignores it & doesn’t get up on time.This alarm arrived & we started by looking at the instruction sheet. It seems like it should be easy to understand because it includes a lot of pictures, but we had trouble getting the alarm synced to the phone once we had downloaded the App. It turns out that we were not seeing the instruction that says to hold the snooze button down for 3 seconds but once we did that, the alarm beeped & it was connected. Then my son got busy setting alarms in the app. He doesn’t really use a snooze feature, but sets multiple alarms about 10 - 12 minutes apart. He used a different sound for each alarm & everything was set.A couple of things that we had problems with are keeping this connected to the Bluetooth & the loud beeps that sound every time a function is completed. It could also use an LED light so we can tell when the battery is charging.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"We recently took a vacation & I was lucky enough to have my son housesit for us. But for those times when we go away & our house is empty, this Digitable Programmable Timer from Mudder will allow us to set lamps to turn on & off so it looks like someone is at home.This programmable timer comes with an instruction sheet that is easy to follow. The first thing to do is plug the timer into an electric outlet for a few hours to charge the battery inside the timer. Then you need to set the time & day of the week so the timer will work properly. It was easy to set the timer to have my living room lamps turn on & off both in the mornings & evenings. I plugged a power strip into the timer so it would operate multiple lamps. There is also a special function that will randomly extend the on/off settings from 2 minutes to 32 minutes. This will help give the impression that we’re at home when we are on vacation. And the backup battery in the timer will keep it working even if the power goes out.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"I must admit that I was skeptical that applying lotion would relieve stress, but I was willing to try this theraCALM Stress Relief Cream from Vita Sciences because you just never know what will work.This is a nice moisturizing cream that I apply to my hands & arms before I go to bed. It has a very subtle scent but is not noticeable after it is applied. After a few nights of using this product, I wasn’t sure that it was helping calm me enough to get better sleep. That’s when I started applying it to my neck & shoulders instead of my arms. I carry a lot of stress in that area & this cream has a cooling feeling that helps relax that area which does help me sleep better.

"I have pictures in my mind of a totally organized kitchen with a place for everything & everything in it's place. But that's just in my mind. In my real-life kitchen, I don't have enough room but I'm trying to make the best of what I've got & keeping things organized is a great way to utilize the space that I do have. Lately I've been working on the cabinet where I store herbs, spices & baking supplies. That's where these Premium Chalkboard Labels from Stardom Crafts can help.I've seen these chalkboard labels all over Pinterest & on websites/blogs about organization so I knew that I wanted to use them to start my kitchen organization.I love these chalkboard labels! Using liquid chalk markers, it is so easy to write on them & just as easy to wipe it off with a wet rag in case it doesn't look like I want it to or if I need to change the label when I change the contents of my jars. The labels peel off of the backing very easily & the adhesive sticks to the jars without any air bubbles. And this is a HUGE package of labels! There are 12 sheets with 8 labels on each sheet. The sheets are all the same so you get 12 of each label shape.I decided to start with the jars that I keep on my countertops because they are most visible. I need to buy more jars so I can store a few more things that we use a lot so I keep them out but right now my jars don't match so I'll label more when I buy more jars.I love the way these labels look. My countertops are going to look tidy & organized with matching jars & matching labels so I can't wait until I get it all finished so I can start with my spices & baking supplies.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"I’ve already got a couple of clocks in my kitchen on the microwave & on the oven, but I love having this Cutlery Kitchen Fork & Knife Wall Clock from Ohuhu because it is just so cute!This cutlery clock is perfect for any kitchen. The forks & spoons around the outside of the clock correspond to the numbers on the clock. The minute hand is a knife & the hour hand is a fork. The second hand makes a very quiet ticking which I don’t really hear unless I’m really paying attention to it. The clock as a whole is about a 12” diameter but the face is just over 5”. It is very lightweight & can be hung with just a pushpin. The motor operates on a single AA battery (not included) & is keeping very accurate time.The only thing about this clock that I would change is the thickness of the metal used for the spoons & forks. Several of them were bent when the clock arrived but since the metal is very thin it was easy to straighten them. However, if you bend them too much I think they would probably break off. Stronger metal might make the clock a bit heavier but it would protect the shape. Overall, I like the retro 50s diner style of this clock.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

He’s tried a few different products but didn’t like the way they left a greasy look after applying so I gave him this Organic Beard Oil from Art Naturals. The first thing that he liked was the fact that it is almost fragrance free so it doesn’t cover up the scent of his cologne. He brought the bottle to me so that I could smell the oil & there is a very subtle scent but it is not noticeable after it is applied.He has been using this beard oil several times each week when he gets ready for work. He sometimes has a tendency to break out when using new products on his face so he doesn’t use this product every day but he has not experienced any problems while using this oil. This beard oil contains Jojoba & Argan oils, along with Vitamin E oil, all of which are great for hair & skin. His beard & facial hair feel softer & I’ve noticed that he’s stopped scratching all the time. And he told me that the women in his life have not only noticed the difference but have complimented him on the softness of his beard & facial hair. And that’s what is really important to him!It doesn’t take much of this product each time he applies, so this 2 ounce bottle will last him quite a long time.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24WYSQF7NN3BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128V0260#wasThisHelpful","R24WYSQF7NN3BZ","AE7DHGEG95SD9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AE7DHGEG95SD9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We don’t have any leather furniture or leather interior in our vehicles so I’ve never used a product like this Leather Conditioner from Leather Nova before.I recently tried the Leather Cleaner from this company old black leather bag that I’ve had for a lot of years. After I cleaned the bag, I followed up with this leather conditioner. I put some of the product onto the foam applicator that is provided & used circular motions to completely cover all areas of the bag. Then I waited for it to dry & used a microfiber cloth to go over the bag. It looks just like new again.I also cleaned my husband’s leather jacket & followed with this conditioner. It is older so the leather was starting to feel hard & stiff. But now the leather feels softer & looks great again. It will get a lot more wear now.This leather conditioner has a slight odor but it is not unpleasant & once the cleaner is dry the odor is gone.

"We don’t have any leather furniture or leather interior in our vehicles so I’ve never used a product like this Leather Cleaner from Leather Nova before.I first tried this product on an old black leather bag that I’ve had for a lot of years. Since it is black, I’ve never really cleaned it. I sprayed this leather cleaner all over the bag & used the microfiber cloth that was provided. It didn’t take any elbow grease at all to clean the whole bag & I was so surprised to see how dirty it really was! I followed up with leather conditioner & my bag looks just like new again.I also used this on my husband’s leather jacket. Like my bag, I don’t think it had ever been cleaned. I tried the leather cleaner on a spot inside the jacket first to make sure it didn’t stain the leather.

The jacket looks great & he was so surprised when I showed it to him.This cleaner has a slight odor but it is not unpleasant & once the cleaner is dry the odor is gone.

"I love having all of my windows open to let the fresh air flow through the house but I can’t stand listening to the doors opening & closing with the wind. These Heavy Duty Wedge Door Stoppers from Orange Shopping Deals will keep that from happening.These come in a package of 4 black rubber door stoppers. When I first opened the packaging, there was that rubbery smell that comes with new products but the smell had dissipated by the next day & is no longer noticeable. These door stoppers are just under 5” long & about 1” at the highest point. They fit nicely under all of our bedroom doors & stay where I put them. They don’t slide around or allow the door to move. They are sturdy & strong so I know they will last a long time.

"Every time we get more electronics, I always have good intentions of gathering up all of the cords & keeping them neatly organized. But I don’t. These Cable Management Sleeves from JOTO are helping me with that problem.This is a set of 4 black neoprene sleeves. They are 20” long and 3.5” wide with a diameter of about 1” when they are zipped closed. When I first received the sleeves, they had that rubbery smell but after they had been unwrapped for about a day the smell dissipated & is no longer noticeable.I have used one of the sleeves to gather up all of the cords behind our entertainment center, another to keep TV, printer, lamp, diffuser & charging cords organized in the bedroom, and my son is using one in his room for TV, game system, charging cords, lamp & a couple of other electronic cords.

"When I received these Large Reusable Food Pouches from Little SqueezeMe, it was my first time to try using food pouches. But now I’m a fan!There are things that we love to take in our lunches but don’t because the lids on my containers can leak but I don’t have to worry about that with these food pouches. Now we can buy yogurt in bulk & spoon it into these pouches for our lunches. I’ve also used them for taking smoothies & applesauce. They easily open up wide enough to spoon the food right into the pouch & then reseal the zipper top. There is a clear strip on the back so you can see what is in the pouch & a white strip at the bottom to label the contents.These food pouches are dishwasher & freezer safe. When I take smoothies, I freeze them first & then use the pouch as an ice pack in my lunch bag. By the time I’m ready to eat, the smoothie has thawed while it was keeping my lunch cold.These food pouches are sturdy, won’t leak & are BPA, PVC, phthalate & lead free.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"I love kitchen gadgets so I don’t know why I’ve always sliced boiled eggs with a knife because this Classic Egg Slicer from Tablesto makes the job so much easier!An egg slicer is pretty self explanatory. Just place your boiled egg on the slicer & then pull the top down onto the egg. The stainless steel wires will slice neatly through the egg & all you have to do is remove the egg slices to add them to a salad. The uniform slices look so nice, not like when I slice eggs with a knife & it’s so quick & easy to use! I haven’t used this for anything except eggs but I’m sure you could slice mushroom for a pizza or strawberries for a pretty dessert. The egg slicer is easy to clean with warm soapy water.This also comes with a Bottle Opener. One end is a bottle opener & the other end is a can tapper.

"This Canvas Backpack from Rbenxia is really cute! I love the stripes with the dark denim fabric that the backpack is made from & the little chain with bows hanging down the front is a fun decoration.This backpack will hold a lot of stuff. We don’t use it as a book bag for school but rather as a backpack to take along when we travel or go on a day outing. We usually pack a 10” tablet, snacks, wipes, sunscreen, a beach towel, reusable water bottles & my wallet on the inside. We use the two side pockets for keys, phones, lip balm & any other small items that we will need.The top of the backpack is a drawstring closure & the top flap has a magnetic closure on the front of the bag. Along with the 2 side pockets there is also a smaller zippered pocket on the side of the backpack. The straps are easily adjusted to fit & there is a loop so that the backpack can be hung on a coat rack or hook.The fabric on the inside of this backpack can be easily wiped clean when needed but I don’t like that the bottom of the bag is white because it gets dirty every time we set it on the ground. Black would have been a better choice.Overall I really like this backpack. It is handy to grab whenever we go out for more than a few hours so we’ll have everything we need.As a product review blogger, I often receive products in exchange for my honest review.

"When I received this 18-inch Christmas Stocking Felt Applique Kit from Ohuhu, I was surprised that it is really not a “kit” at all. The stocking comes fully assembled just like the photo so there is nothing to make but it is still a pretty stocking.This Christmas stocking is 17” long & the foot of the stocking is 11” wide. The front of the stocking is made of different fabrics & the back is solid red. There is a ribbon attached to the corner of the stocking so that it can be hung on your fireplace or on a doorknob. My favorite part of this stocking are the cute 3D snowmen! They are each wearing cute little caps & scarves. They even have carrot noses & beads for eyes. There is also a small felt tree & a white snowflake to complete the scene.There was a an odd odor when I first opened the package & it seemed to be coming from the red backing, but after being out of the package for a few hours, the smell dissipated & now there is no odor at all. I do wish the manufacturer had used the same red ribbed fabric from the front of the stocking for the back of the stocking. It would have made it softer & more attractive.This stocking is big enough to hold lots of goodies from Santa! I think any child would be happy to find this on Christmas morning.

"I use essential oils at home just about every day so with these Aromatherapy Essential Oil Vials from Cornucopia Brands, I can take my oils with me when I’m away from home.This set comes with 24 1” 3ml vials (although one of mine was broken right at the neck of the vial so I only got 23), 24 orifice reducers & 24 black screw-on lids. The whole bottle, with the lid screwed on, is about 1.5” tall. These are very easy to fill with the eye droppers that come in most large bottles of essential oils & the orifice reducers make sure that you are only using your oils one drop at a time so nothing is wasted.I like having my essential oil blend that I use to alleviate my allergy symptoms with me when I’m just running errands or when we travel.

"I’ve heard a lot about probiotics but never truly understood what they were all about or the fact that they might help me. I’ve been taking the Advanced Bioactive Probiotics from Viva Labs for almost 3 weeks now & now I know that they really do help me.As I have gotten older, I can no longer eat a lot of my favorite foods due to an increase in my lactose intolerance. I have resorted to taking a dairy digestive supplement every time I want to eat something that contains cheese or milk. But since I’ve been taking the Probiotics, I have found that I can eat some of these foods without suffering the consequences. Now if I’m going to eat cheese enchiladas or drink a milkshake or enjoy a big bowl of ice cream, I don’t want to chance it so I still take a supplement. But it’s so nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal with milk or have a bagel with cream cheese or enjoy a cheeseburger without worry. I’m hoping that the longer I take the Probiotics, the more dairy foods I can enjoy without having to use my supplements.As a product review blogger, I often receive products free or at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review.

"The first thing I want to tell you about this 4-LED Touch Light from OxyLED is DO NOT look at it when you turn it on. It is bright!I know LEDs are supposed to be bright but I really wasn’t expecting so much light from this little stick light. It it very easy to install by pressing the 3M adhesive pads to the surface where you want it to stick. Then all you do is touch the metal pins on the front of the light to turn it on. It operates on 3 AAA batteries (not included).My pantry shelving is really deep & I cannot see what is at the back without using a small flashlight that I keep on one of the shelves. But I installed this LED Touch Light on the bottom of one of the upper shelves & it has made such a wonderful difference. I just touch the light & I can see everything that I have stored on that shelf. Now I need to get more of these lights so I can light up all of my shelves. I’m very happy with this light so far.

"I never though much about magnesium but when I saw this Magnesium Oil Spray from Pure Vitality Minerals, I did a bit of research & decided to give it a try.Magnesium Oil helps with stress, depression, anxiety, better sleep, aches & pain, muscle spasms, restless legs & migraines. It can be taken orally by adding 3 - 5 drops to water or fruit juice. It can also be used by spraying it on your skin & that is how I am using this product. I spray it on the bottoms of my feet each evening when I’m getting ready to go to bed. I have not experienced any tingling, burning or any other side effect. I don’t know whether this is helping me sleep better or if I’m just really tired because I’ve been so busy lately. I don’t suffer from anxiety or depression so I can’t speak to that but I do get migraines so I will definitely try this when my next one hits me.As a product review blogger, I often receive products free or at a deep discount in exchange for my honest review.

"Sandalwood has always been one of my favorite scents so I was very excited to try this Handmade Sandalwood Comb from Rbenxia.When I received the comb, the first thing that I noticed is how beautiful the handcrafted Sandalwood looks & then I caught a whiff of that wonderful sandalwood scent. I knew I was going to love this comb! The teeth are wide set so it makes combing through tangled hair a breeze & the indentions on the handle make it easy & comfortable to hold. This comb glides right through my hair with no static & makes it feel soft. I was hoping that the sandalwood scent would linger but I don’t notice it though I do find myself sniffing my comb whenever I walk by.This beautiful comb looks so nice that I keep it on my dresser rather than in a drawer.

"My husband has been taking Turmeric Curcumin because of its anti-inflammatory properties. Each veggie tablet contains 200mg Turmeric Extract along with Vitamins C & D3, Quercetin, Bromelain, Ginger root, Green Tea leaf, Boswellia Serrata & Cayenne Pepper. The dosage suggestion is kind of vague: “Take one or more tablets daily with food”. The tablets are quite large & a bit difficult to swallow until you get used to them. Also, they taste like turmeric so that also takes some getting used to.Although my husband usually takes turmeric alone, this blend has been working for him.

"I love to bake but when I bake a cake, I usually just spread frosting on it & call it a day. I’ve never tried to decorate my own cakes or cupcakes but now that I have this 52-Piece Stainless Steel Cake Decorating Set from Ohuhu, I’m giving it a try.This is a great set! There are 52 tips of various patterns & sizes plus the plastic connector & a couple of flower nails (which I had to Google to see what they are used for). All of this comes in a plastic hinged-lid storage box to keep everything together.I baked a cake just so I could try out these tips. I don’t have a pastry bag so I just cut a corner off of a regular storage baggie & used that. It worked just fine. I tried squeezing the frosting through every tip in the box. I’m not very good at it but it was a lot of fun & I’ll continue to practice until I’m able to make decent decorations. I also practiced writing with the icing & that is NOT as easy as it looks.

"I love kitchen gadgets but I’ve never owned an Apple Corer before I got this one from Orblue.During this time of the year, I do a LOT of baking & since it is also apple season I use a lot of apples.

"This grip is for those of us who bought the XT-10 because it is so very nearly equal to the XT-1 in so many ways that we couldn't justify the extra $500, but still secretly wanted a nice, big, grippy camera.  With my big hands, I would have actually preferred a slightly larger camera.  But there's no way I'm spending $130 on the Fujifilm grip. I mean...come on.  It's not even a battery grip!  I love my Fujifilm, but that price is just...well I'm at a loss for words. Pure profit.I DID however, take a chance on buying this unreviewed but solid-looking third-party grip.That chance paid off.  Big time.This grip is incredible for the price.  It's solid metal, a cinch to install and uninstall, and is thoughtfully designed with functional and precise cutouts and tripod mount built right in.  The grip makes the XT-10 feel entirely different - like a ""real camera"".  Not to mention, it makes my clients happier to see a big camera too, pour souls.  This is solid, smooth, precise, cold, pure metal straight from the machine shop.If you want to add grip tape to this solid, smooth hunk of metal, it would be a cinch.  Me, I like the cool aluminum against my hands.  It's never been slippery for me anyway.  It's also a flexible accessory that allows the guard/tripod-mount on the left of the camera to be removed easily with an allen wrench. This shrinks the package a little gives  The entire grip can, in fact, be removed with an allen wrench in about 10 seconds, or in a similar amount of time with a penny if you forgot the wrench. It's little details like that that show a thoughtful design that are the hallmark of a good product.My only complaints are minor and inevitable with a product like this. The SD card is just ridiculously hard to get to on the XT-10 in the first place - one of the few negatives with the camera.  This grip makes it slightly harder - but I blame that on Fuji, really, for silly card slot placement. Second, it makes the screen harder to rotate out, though you figure it out soon enough. Not a big deal.In short, if you didn't buy the XT-10 because of size, this is not only an economical way to improve it's handling, but it's also going to improve the longevity and resale value of your body by giving it protection on most sides, and especially on the bottom, where most wear occurs.  I'm very pleased with this accessory and I highly recommend it to any XT-10 shooters with larger hands.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162SO2VV5OK27/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UH24PI#wasThisHelpful","R162SO2VV5OK27","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first Fuji, this is a wonderful camera, capable of taking professional photographs. It has features making it a good fit for advanced shooters and beginners alike. Both will appreciate the beautiful, best-in-class design, the accurate and bright screen and viewfinder, the smartphone integration, and the on-lens aperture adjustments and dedicated setting dials. The camera is truly fun to use and changing settings is a better experience than in any other camera system I've used (along with most of the Fujifilm X-series).For anyone around, this camera is a complete steal compared to similar competitors at $799 for the body alone.For advanced shooters, it has 7 customizable buttons, very clean images at higher ISO (i.e it's good on low light), strong lens selection, and multiple focus peaking and other manual focus assists.But those newer to DSLR style shooting will appreciate the comparatively straightforward dial layout, compact size - and especially the dedicated switch which kicks your camera into automatic mode so you don't miss a good shot while you're still learning how to use the camera in manual or other advanced shooting modes. The latter shows Fuji's true intent for this camera as an accessible professional tool for all levels of shooter. The JPEG quality is generally accepted as the best in any brand, meaning new photographers can still get great images without shooting in the confusing, large file RAW format (though RAW is available for those who like to heavily edit their images).I love this camera and I've made better images on it than on any other crop sensor camera I've used. Even in low light, it suffers relatively little compared to full frame cameras. I personally prefer its images to the crop sensor Canon and Nikon DSLRs I've used. Actually, it's not a contest in most ways.The exception is for those who shoot sports or wildlife, who might find the XT-10's burst mode to be a little slow and cut out soon. It's comparable to a Canon Rebel series camera in burst capabilities. It also isn't weather sealed, which is too bad. And for those with big hands (like me), it might seem a little small - though it's not uncomfortable to use and a grip can be purchased.But for anyone who doesn't need super-speed burst mode or weather sealing, the $500 you save on the XT-10 vs it's bigger brother is much better put toward lenses. It has the exact same sensor, focus abilities and a similar screen and viewfinder. It will give you exactly the same images.BUT THERES A CATCH WITH THIS BUNDLE: It's still a better deal than buying the lenses separately. But it could be significantly cheaper were the redundant, lower quality 16-50mm lens omitted. It's entirely unnecessary with the fantastic included 18-55 lens, which is faster, better built, and produces better images. The only advantage of the 16-50mm is a lower weight. Those few ounces aren't worth the added cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PY75RQ6MFPBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSZYUBI#wasThisHelpful","R2PY75RQ6MFPBS","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros: > Subtle, luxurious smell. There is nothing flowery, fruity or overwhelming about this soap. Scent is difficult to describe in words, but those that come to mind are woodsy"" and even a little ""spicy"" or ""middle eastern"". The best part is that it's subtle.

This just leaves me smelling clean and slightly manly.> Cleans thoroughly.> Rinses cleanly and quickly - no ""sticking"" to skin or in crevices.> Larger bar than usual, but still fits in hand.Cons:> Does leave a very slight filmy feeling on the skin, but it's better than most soaps.

"Like most everyone, I have usually use the clorox or lysol brands of cleaning and disinfecting wipes. I've liked them a lot, overall.  But they smell strongly and don't work on skin, so I was interested in trying these softy wipes out.  I primarily use these in the kitchen and bathroom, as well as for hand cleaning.  Here's what I've found:PROS:1) These smell great, and the scent is far more subtle than other wipes.  It's a scent smell rather than a chemical smell, and it doesn't linger on the skin or on surfaces.2) You can use these on your skin.  In fact, that's one of the primary uses of this product.  It's convenient to keep these in the kitchen to use while handling raw meat (though I prefer to use medical gloves for an even better experience). I'm assuming they sanitize just fine. Obviously, not having a bacterial culture lab in our 1 bedroom apartment, I can't verify this. They clean skin better than sanitizer alone, at least.3) They sanitize without drying out skin like alcohol.  I would have loved these back when I was a paramedic and had super dry hands all day.4) The cloth material is strong.  It's stretchy and hard to rip too.5) They do a decent job of cleaning grease and messes up in addition to sanitizing.  For a quick clean, they do fine.CONS:1) They don't clean messes as well as other brands. They do okay, but stovetop grease and such will take more than just one of these wipes. Lysol brand wipes certainly clean grease/oil-type stains more effectively. I can't go strait to the polish stage of cleaning greasy counters after using these wipes unless I use several of them.2) They leave film on surfaces they clean. So do other brands, but these leave a slightly more noticeable patina. This is not a big deal, especially if you use a little window cleaner afterwards. This is only really noticeable if you want a shiny gloss clean and on dark or metal surfaces. On white porcelain in the bathroom it's not a problem.3) The cloth tends to stick together. The wipes are a little hard to unfold to their full size sometimes. Not a big deal.4) They cost more - but not much more.5) Occasionally, it can be hard to pull just one out of the container. I end up pulling 2-3 out instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UUT6JGF1O3WZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O5AHPKO#wasThisHelpful","R3UUT6JGF1O3WZ","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this pan because 1) I'm clumsy and have broken glass bakeware in the past, 2) It has a raised lid, giving a little more room and flexibility, 3) I've had good experiences with other Nordic Ware products.It has not disappointed.  I'll make Pros & Cons list to keep things simple.PROS:1)  The pan is super lightweight.  Really, really incredibly light. Being a huge ex-football player that doesn't matter much to me, but it's nice anyway.2) Food has cooked evenly and consistently, and without fuss. Dark aluminum pans can require some temperature adjusting.  This doesn't.3) Food doesn't stick. Well, not anymore than with glass bakeware. It's never been a problem for me.4) There's no nonstick coating to wear away.5) The lid of the pan is raised.  This is really convenient, as taller casseroles don't get compressed by the lid as sometimes happens with glass bakeware.  It's good for decorated cakes as well.  But for me, the biggest advantage is that I used these to hold and transport cookies to work, my wife's classes, etc. The raised lid is a surprising but major advantage of this pan.6) It doesn't stain.  I've cooked lasagna and other super-staining meals in this pan, and it's cleaned with no effort at all to the original silver color.7) The pan is a few centimeters taller than many of its competitors, adding even more height and the resulting flexibility.CONS:1) It scratches. But who cares? And at least it doesn't have a coating that scratches away, meaning performance stays the same.2) Using metal serving utensils can make a weird kind of scraping feeling that occasionally gives me the shutters. Like some people get with nails on a chalkboard. My wife thinks I'm crazy - it doesn't bother her. Probably barely worth mentioning but...well, there you go.Overall:  If I buy more bakeware in the future, I will buy this pan over and over again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KRI753WCSV7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006SGQFY#wasThisHelpful","R1KRI753WCSV7C","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You need a clear case for the Moto X.  Obviously. Otherwise how would anyone see how awesome it looks!This case is super-clear and fits like a charm, snapping pleasantly into place. The hard shell is less slippery than many, and it's survived a few short drops onto pavement, protecting the phone without cracking. It's easy to remove and replace if needed.  It's inexpensive and, best of all, sleek, hardly adding any girth to the phone.My only complaint is that it doesn't protect from drops at all angles.  It will handle most drops okay, but the top and bottom corners along the top of the phone leave some minor exposure.

"There is no such thing as ""the"" perfect smartphone since each individual uses them differently and will have different requirements or preferences. So before I get to the details, I'll let you know my own. I've used iPhones for most of my life, but recently got bored with iOS and went on a long, expensive, chronically and unreasonably dissatisfied hunt for more interesting phones in the Android world. I value a well-balanced phone with:1) Clean, quick, uncluttered software with a pleasing user interface2) A camera that can stand-alone as my one-and-only camera (low grain, great exposure, decent color reproduction, decent HD video)3) Premium build quality that can please an Apple-seduced ex-iPhoner (feel-in-hand is especially important to me)4) A bright, colorful, and sharp screen5) Full day battery lifeI also care about durability, prompt software updating, and accessory availability. I use the Sony Xperia Z3 as my go-to phone, and have also recently owned the iPhone 5s, LG G2, Google Nexus 5, HTC One M8, and Sony Xperia Z2. My wife uses the Samsung S5.I bought the Motorola Moto X pure, unlocked version through the Motorola moto-builder site. As a disclaimer got a Bamboo back and Blue trim, so be warned that while I've felt the leather in stores I had a very slightly different experience. I've used the phone for two weeks.Okay, on to the review!1) Software: 100/100.I've never awarded a 100% to any phone for any feature. Until now. Motorola and Google absolutely nailed it. First, you'll get the phone at Android 4.4 KitKat, but 5.0 Lollipop is already out for the Moto X and the phone can (and should) be updated immediately. Stock Android Lollipop is gorgeous, colorful, and adds many small changes that, when they come together, makes the software almost perfect. Props to Motorola for keeping the phone stock.The few features that Motorola has added (all found in one app) are genuinely useful. The Moto X has excellent voice-activated commands with a customizable command phrase that actually works consistently. It also knows where you are and adapts accordingly; whether you're driving, sleeping, in a meeting, or having family time, you can customize how the phone notifies you and interacts with you given your current activity. You get nice and customizable lock-screen notifications as well. This is the smartest smartphone I've ever used, by far. Also, Google Now is omnipresent and is a decently useful (if creepily predictive) feature.If you care about software above all, look no further. The Moto X is the phone for you.2) Camera: 83/100.Like the rest of the phone's software, the camera app is smart, pretty, and quick. You can flick your wrist twice to open the app, an experience that is quick, pleasing, and works consistently if you can remember that it exists. Though not actually Google's camera app, the camera software resembles it in its minimalism and de-cluttered UI, which I really like. Also, shutter speed is one of the fastest I've seen, rivaling the iPhone.So it's not all bad. And while I'd read poor reviews about the camera, I was willing to give it a chance. And note that my standards are very high.Unfortunately, though, the images I got were just not consistently solid. In bright outdoor light you'll get nice, colorful, decently sharp images. In any other light, however, images are often blurred, sort of grainy, and discolored. The phone lacks Optical Image Stabilization, and it shows. Though the camera is 13 MP, the images were much less sharp than on the 4 MP HTC One or 8 MP iPhones. If you compose the photo, you'll get a decent image half the time. If you don't, it's more like 1 in 4. And try as you might, you'll have to fight hard to get a really, really good image that you'll want to print. The flash (which, by the way, is not a ring but is just two LEDs) is bright but doesn't solve the camera's low light issues, producing red-eye and off-tone colors. Video is better, but not amazing.I'm honestly sad about this, but it was a dealbreaker for me personally. If you're no shutterfly and just need the occasional quick snap of pets or kids, the camera will do the job. If you're at all picky about images though, you'll be chronically dissatisfied. Sad, but it's the one-and-only true weak point on the phone.3) Build Quality: 96/100.This is a gorgeous phone. And the range of customization options (Soft leather? Warm wood? Either, please.) is nothing short of brilliant and will turn more heads more than any iPhone. The curved back feels great in the hand. The Gorilla Glass is smoothly rounded around the edges. The metal rim is eye candy and feels awesome, if a tad slick. The aluminum speaker and camera trim is nice, whether stock or colorfully customized on Motorola's site. Look, it's just a stunner of a phone, at least on par with the HTC One and Sony Xperia line with much more personality.4) Screen: 90/100.OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screens are interesting. Instead of a backlight, each pixel produces it's own light, giving the screen a unique, warm, saturated feel. Coming from the ultra-bright Sony Z3's LCD panel, the Moto X was quite a change. Colors are bolder and more saturated, and much warmer. Browns and colors look great. And since OLED screens produce black by simple turning the pixels off, blacks are inky-dark and contrasting colors just pop beautifully. It's a nice screen, and the resolution at 1080p is as sharp as I could ever care about.My only real complaint is that the screen is dim, at about half the brightness of its competitors in nits produced (whatever a ""nit"" is, don't ask me). You get used to it fast and it saves battery, but coming from the brightest phone on the market it was a little underwhelming. I could get used to the rich OLED colors very fast though, and the deep black will certainly be missed.5) Battery life: 85/100.It's fine, but nothing to write home about. Android Lollipop saves battery well, as does the dimmer screen and well-done notifications. I'm a heavy smartphone user (ahem...addict), so I never get more than one day with any phone. This phone will get you through a workday, but if you're like me then you'll need a quick charge in the evening to get you through bedtime.Note: Invest in a Qualcomm Quick-Charge 2.0 charger, supported by the Moto X. Just do it. It blew me away! You get 35% battery added in just 15 minutes. Plug it in during your after-work shower and you'll have juice to make it through Friday night, no problem.Summary:If you're somehow still reading this, here's the final verdict. If you don't care too much about camera performance, or prefer a stand-alone camera, just stop and buy this phone. It's fantastic in every single other way and costs less than rivals. Personally, I'd go through the Moto Maker website for free customization if you can stand to wait a week for delivery. If software and UI matter most to you, you'll be smitten by the scrappy Moto X. And if Motorola can come up with a better camera, I'll buy future versions of this phone in a heartbeat.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA7PEZ1T36XR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N532LMY#wasThisHelpful","RA7PEZ1T36XR5","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no such thing as ""the"" perfect smartphone since each individual uses them differently and will have different requirements or preferences. So before I get to the details, I'll let you know my own. I've used iPhones for most of my life, but recently got bored with iOS and went on a long, expensive, chronically and unreasonably dissatisfied hunt for more interesting phones in the Android world. I value a well-balanced phone with:1) Clean, quick, uncluttered software with a pleasing user interface2) A camera that can stand-alone as my one-and-only camera (low grain, great exposure, decent color reproduction, decent HD video)3) Premium build quality that can please an Apple-seduced ex-iPhoner (feel-in-hand is especially important to me)4) A bright, colorful, and sharp screen5) Full day battery lifeI also care about durability, prompt software updating, and accessory availability. I use the Sony Xperia Z3 as my go-to phone, and have also recently owned the iPhone 5s, LG G2, Google Nexus 5, HTC One M8, and Sony Xperia Z2. My wife uses the Samsung S5.I bought the Motorola Moto X pure, unlocked version through the Motorola moto-builder site. As a disclaimer got a Bamboo back and Blue trim, so be warned that while I've felt the leather in stores I had a very slightly different experience. I've used the phone for two weeks.Okay, on to the review!1) Software: 100/100.I've never awarded a 100% to any phone for any feature. Until now. Motorola and Google absolutely nailed it. First, you'll get the phone at Android 4.4 KitKat, but 5.0 Lollipop is already out for the Moto X and the phone can (and should) be updated immediately. Stock Android Lollipop is gorgeous, colorful, and adds many small changes that, when they come together, makes the software almost perfect. Props to Motorola for keeping the phone stock.The few features that Motorola has added (all found in one app) are genuinely useful. The Moto X has excellent voice-activated commands with a customizable command phrase that actually works consistently. It also knows where you are and adapts accordingly; whether you're driving, sleeping, in a meeting, or having family time, you can customize how the phone notifies you and interacts with you given your current activity. You get nice and customizable lock-screen notifications as well. This is the smartest smartphone I've ever used, by far. Also, Google Now is omnipresent and is a decently useful (if creepily predictive) feature.If you care about software above all, look no further. The Moto X is the phone for you.2) Camera: 83/100.Like the rest of the phone's software, the camera app is smart, pretty, and quick. You can flick your wrist twice to open the app, an experience that is quick, pleasing, and works consistently if you can remember that it exists. Though not actually Google's camera app, the camera software resembles it in its minimalism and de-cluttered UI, which I really like. Also, shutter speed is one of the fastest I've seen, rivaling the iPhone.So it's not all bad. And while I'd read poor reviews about the camera, I was willing to give it a chance. And note that my standards are very high.Unfortunately, though, the images I got were just not consistently solid. In bright outdoor light you'll get nice, colorful, decently sharp images. In any other light, however, images are often blurred, sort of grainy, and discolored. The phone lacks Optical Image Stabilization, and it shows. Though the camera is 13 MP, the images were much less sharp than on the 4 MP HTC One or 8 MP iPhones. If you compose the photo, you'll get a decent image half the time. If you don't, it's more like 1 in 4. And try as you might, you'll have to fight hard to get a really, really good image that you'll want to print. The flash (which, by the way, is not a ring but is just two LEDs) is bright but doesn't solve the camera's low light issues, producing red-eye and off-tone colors. Video is better, but not amazing.I'm honestly sad about this, but it was a dealbreaker for me personally.

"What I like:-Blade extends only about 3/4"", making it very safe-Feels good in your hand-Very, very sharp.  Slices up boxes and packaging like warm butter-Blade lasts forever.  I've used this almost daily for about six months, and its as sharp as ever-Hooked handle very well designed for pockets, keeping the cutter secure but accessible-Blunted blade tip means you're less likely to damage the contents of packages you're opening-No need to regularly change blades.  Not only is that more convenient, but blade changes are usually when people hurt themselves-Blade doesn't collect glue and sticky stuff as much as metalWhat I don't like:-Larger-than-average for a box-cutter.  I get the hooked handle, but it takes up a lot more space-Blunt tip makes it a bit more difficult to piece packagingOverall recommendation:-Buy, if find yourself cutting open boxes and packaging on a regular basis.  It's good to keep a box-cutter separate from your pocket knife or scissors to avoid glue and gunk on your good blade, and this is a very good one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CIDCQ28BXJHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00428M7IO#wasThisHelpful","R2CIDCQ28BXJHW","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I really love about this sound conditioner is that is it uses air movement to create noise rather than speakers.  This gives the product an unmatched natural sound.  Moreover, it is infinitely adjustable.  If you want a cozy, muted feeling, close the vents.  For a more natural, breezy feeling, open them up.  And find an infinity of noises in between.This product draws a very low amount of electricity (I keep it on 24/7 and noticed no real rises in my electricity bills) and is simple to operate.I only have a few real beefs with this product, which I really would never live without again:First, I am addicted.  I can't sleep without this baby, or something like it at the very least.  In hotels, I take the hair dryer out and turn it to low all night.  Maybe not safe, but hey, like I said, I'm an addict.  This really isn't the fault of the product.  In fact, it means it may be TOO good at what it does.The second is related to the first issue.  This product isn't really portable. You could take it with you, for sure, but its not designed for travel.  This is only a minor problem.The final problem is a bit more serious.  One night, I kicked a blanket off myself and it landed on the floor over my sound conditioner.  The result?  A dead, non-functioning product.  I have to think it over-heated without an adequate amount of air movement through the fan.  That's a bit scary, but then again, perhaps it was built to cut power rather than dangerously overheat (or maybe not, I don't know).  Either way, I had to buy a new product.  Keep this on a table to avoid the problem.UPDATE 03/01/13:Any company that cares enough to respond to customer concerns on Amazon is a good one in my book.  I already love this product, but if you look at the comments, you'll see that my few concerns were well addressed.  The blown-fuse that occurred due to my covering of the product with a blanket was confirmed to be a safety mechanism.  And it turns out the company makes a portable version for travel. What can I say?  I love this sound machine!  Changing to 5 stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q20W6G90513U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KUHFGM#wasThisHelpful","R3Q20W6G90513U","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was prepared to fall in love with these shoes.  They are constructed to get anyone through the winters here in Chicago, being fully rubber and possessing excellent all-weather tread, yet being decently stylish.  That's a pretty rare combination.  Opening the box, and looking at the boot, they appeared perfect.But when I put them on, with some difficulty,  I was surprised to find that they fit uncomfortably tightly around the heel, side, and top.  The ""stretchy"" material you see on the side of the shoe is not very stretchy at all, and the shoe needs another half inch around the top to be snug but not constricting.Thinking they might stretch a bit, or conform to my foot, I wore them around the house for a few hours, but my feet genuinely hurt afterwards.  The length was perfect, even a bit long, so ordering a size up will not help.  I may try to find a wide version on another site; even though I don't usually wear a wide, it might help.  Amazon doesn't seem to carry them, but luckily they do have an excellent return service.Maybe my foot is a rare anomaly with these shoes - I hope so, even though I usually fit right in a 12D with no problems at all.  But I would recommend one of Bogs' boots with more history of high ratings.Too bad.  People seem to think the world of Bogs as a company, so I'll give the brand another try.  Three stars for quality construction and Amazon as a store.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31UXI6WD7TKIG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006PAF6E4#wasThisHelpful","R31UXI6WD7TKIG","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am one of those guys who drops his phone a LOT. I tried the thinner snap cases, but they didn't offer enough protection. This case is a good balance between sleekness and protection. It's my favorite vase around.I've been through probably seven different types of iPhone cases over the past four years. But I keep coming back to this one.This case is very, very thin for a full coverage case. You don't notice it after just a few minutes. I consider that a plus.

"For some time, I kept a different, far more expensive mini USB drive on my keychain. I loved the design, but went through 3 of them in a little over a year. They just couldn't stand up to the daily abuse a keychain handles.I've used one of these for a year now with no problems, even though I've dropped it in the snow and a few puddles.This durability, it's low price, and incredibly small size make it an ideal keychain drive.Four stars instead of five because it has no mechanism to make it easily removable.

"You know, I wasn't really a believer in these things until I used them to prevent shock as a paramedic.  They work incredibly well if you wrap yourself in them very tightly.  I've seen them save lives, and I thought I'd stick a couple in my car for emergencies.I set up a little, limited scientific experiment to test their value.  Here it is:DO NOT TRY THIS YOURSELF!First, I took my temperature with a medical-grade thermometer.  98.6 deg F, right on the money.  I walked out on my back porch in Chicago on a 20 degree night, wearing jeans and a tee shirt.  I wrapped myself in one of these blankets, very tightly with my head covered, then sat in a lawn chair for the next two hours.  Don't worry, I wasn't too bored, I had an audiobook.  I walked inside and took my temperature again. 98.3 deg F.  Not too shabby, not at all.I repeated the experiment the next night, at 22 deg F, with almost identical results.  The next night, it was 26 degrees.  I sat out on my porch WITHOUT the blanket, as a control, as long as I could bear it, which was about an hour and a half.  My temperature without the blanket after 1.5 hours was 96.4 deg F.  A very big difference.As a medical profesional, I am very impressed with the lifesaving potential of this product.  I've worked with kids and the elderly who became hypothermic after being exposed for just a half hour in 50 degree weather.Now, I won't say I was wonderfully comfortable with just this product and a tee shirt.  It was not pleasant.  And my temperature did drop some.  If you were exposed with just this blanket, dressed as I was, for more than 5 or 6 hours, you'd probably have a problem.  Especially if the temperatures were below those at which I tested it. As your core temp drops, your body will focus heat in vital organs, away from the skin.  Therefore, there is less heat for this blanket to reflect back, and the rate of temperature decline will accelerate.But if you're stranded in a car with a coat, or inside a dugout shelter, this is pretty valuable.  In a survival situation, I highly recommend putting this INSIDE your warmer clothes against your skin.  It will exponentially increase the effectiveness of the product, in my experience.  In any case, make this an inner, not an outer layer, or your blankets and layering for sleep.I don't consider myself a ""prepper"" really, but I do keep emergency gear in my car in case I need to walk, and a little bug-out-bag at home just in case.  Why not?  It's not expensive, and a little entertaining if nothing else. Plus if things ever do go downhill quickly, you're a little better off having options.Anyhow, the problem with normal mylar survival blankets is they're quite bright if you're trying NOT to be found. They're either orange or mirror silver - made specifically to be visible.  That's why I chose these blankets.  If you don't want people to see you, olive green is pretty much the way to go. Moreover, this material Is VERY tough.  I'm a big, strong dude and I had trouble ripping it.  That's impressive.EDIT 7/26/13:After a helpful comment from another user, I did a little more research and found that these blankets work best with a little space between the skin and the blanket.  They are designed to produce a thin layer of warm air, shielding the body from conductive heat loss.  One site I read said that a quarter inch to a half inch of space is optimal.  If you can pull that off, definitely do so.  Overall, though, still make this an inner layer of heat loss protection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WESIO0EGQ3JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0044S817I#wasThisHelpful","R1WESIO0EGQ3JA","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"SHORT FORM OF THE REVIEW BELOW:-Small enough not to notice in your pocket, TSA compliance confirmed-Strong, convenient pliers, especially for the size-Pliers make this better than the comparably-sized Leatherman CS-Surprisingly use-able screwdriver-Scissors (no knife) that work pretty well, but broke after a few months.  Worth replacing.If you are the kind of person who likes to fix minor problems yourself, and you don't always have easy access to a tool box, you should purchase this tool.  There will certainly be times you will be thankful for it.I don't like bulky key chains.  That said, I've often wished I had a multitool with pliers, screwdriver, and cutting tool no matter where I went, as I spend a lot of time away from home.  The Style PS fit that bill while being very, very small, and also easy to detach from and re-attach to your keys.I cannot over-state the convenience of having pliers on me at all times.  I've fixed office chairs and desks, tightened loose screws, and opened oxygen bottles (as a paramedic) with them with no problem.  Will they replace your nice, big needle nose pliers? No.  But on a daily basis out of the home, they are strong and easy enough to use that they can do 75% of the same jobs with only slightly less ease.  The wire cutters are a decent addition as well. So if you spend long periods out of the house or travel a lot (yes, I've passed through TSA checkpoints with these), you seriously need this tool, for the pliers alone.I've successfully used the screwdriver for both phillips and flathead screws.  Again, not as good as a purpose made screwdriver, but for something that goes on your keychain, pretty darn good.  The file (on the screwdriver) is decent as well - it works for my man nails, at the very least.Finally, the scissors.  They are the reason I gave the product four instead of five stars.  The torsion bar broke on mine after about five months of moderate use, and I had to purchase a new item.  But during that time, they worked well.  I would certainly prefer a knife (in fact I carry one separately), but with TSA's incredibly restrictive rules, I think using these little guys instead was a smart move.  I've used the tool in the airport a few times, and been very thankful for it.My final word?  This is a small, inexpensive, use-able keychain tool from a great company.  You won't notice it on your keychain, and there will be times you are very thankful to have it with you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SN9DBPJGX6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007T9DSSQ#wasThisHelpful","R39SN9DBPJGX6L","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Glasser does an amazing job here of presenting the unified, progressive story of Scripture.  The Church is addicted to verse-by-verse, ""zoomed-in"" interpretation of the Bible.  This work is a must-read if you are sometimes puzzled the seemingly eclectic way the Bible is put together.  If you wonder ""where is God going with this?"", you will find the answer here.Scripture has a message at all levels, but I will dare to say the most important message is found at the meta-level. This book is that message.  And we cannot let it become lost among the thousands of smaller passages and lessons that support it.Four stars only because Glasser doesn't do a wonderful job countering SOME of the inevitable assumptions of American, individualist evangelicalism.

"This is a wonderful commentary, whether your a serious theologian or exegetical newbie.  As a missions guy, I fall somewhere in between, but I gave the gift to my (theologically untrained) mom for a Bible Study she's leading and she found it to be an amazing resource.  She told me that her class considered her an expert, even though she pretty much ripped off exactly what Dr. Walton wrote in the Genesis section.For those of you Scripture hounds who don't trust a commentary with pictures to be academically sound and challenging, I found that the pictures always aided immensely in the interpretive process.  For example, in the opening pages is a diagram that shows the ancient Hebrew concept of the world that completely changed the way I read scripture.  Since I had Dr. Walton in class for Old Testament I had heard this concept spoken of, but it wasn't until I saw the diagram that I really understood the way it affected their thinking and writing.I'll admit I'm biased because I just really like Dr. Walton.  I got to know he and his wife on a Holy Lands studies program in Israel, and he was an absolutely one of a kind, amazing man to take the trip with.  I can assure you, his knowledge of Genesis is surpassed by few scholars in this century in in the past.

"Working in some rougher neighborhoods, I leave this is my car's center console, just in case.  I'm a big, strong guy - no one messes with me - but I'd rather not get in a fistfight with a dog or druggie, and I personally don't want to carry a handgun, which are illegal in Chicago in any case.  I've had other sprays.  This is the easiest to aim and has the best ""cone"" of spray with decent, but not earth shattering distance.  It's pretty big, but not huge, which is both good and bad - easier to access and use, harder to conceal and less likely to find room in a purse or jacket pocket.  I test fired it and felt a lot safer than with other sprays.  In a nasty situation, you don't want to need to aim or think, just point in a general direction and squeeze.I also know that it burns like crazy.  How did I find out, you ask?The (accidental) test:I was pumping gas, leaning on the jeep, and my brother, a tall young man of 23, found this pepper gun in my console.  He didn't see ""MACE"" on the side and for unknown reasons thought it was a novelty lighter and decided to give it a go.  Unfortunately, it was pointing right at his face.  So the first thing I know, my brother jumps out of the car yelling and rolling on the ground.  I ran over and caught a small wiff, and it was like someone had squeezed a habanero pepper in my face.  I backed off, my face streaming with tears.  Eventually, I washed my brother's face with several bottles of water until he could function.  My brother says couldn't see for about 3 minutes, was basically incpacitated for 10, tearing up with a runny nose for 30 minutes, and seriously unhappy for the 2 hours until he could take a long shower.  And being in my car, even after seriously scrubbing the inside, was a bad experience for a couple of weeks.  Thanks bro.What we learned:1) This stuff seriously hurts.  Like, really bad, torture chamber hurts.  Which is good.2) Keep it in a safe place, away from kids or adults who make poor choices3) It takes a long time to clean off a surface4) Just toss the canister after use - it will leak slowly after it's been used once and you're face will always be a little on fire after you touch objects it's been around","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR6XDU20L56JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004YWKF8C#wasThisHelpful","RR6XDU20L56JT","A30HYKFL7ERFE7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A30HYKFL7ERFE7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I wholeheartedly agree with the majority of his conclusions, though not with the chapter permitting the Christian to use violence to protect the abused and downtrodden.

"I received a free sample of these for testing and review.Really pleased! I review a lot of Bluetooth headphones on Amazon, and it's rare that I actually use a pair more than once or twice after reviewing them. I made these my new main headphones. They have a very subtle appearance (not a big bulky look like many headphones) and the metallic color matches well with any outfit. The magnetic aspect works great. If I need to take them out of my ears, I can keep them around my neck without the risk of having them fall off. I've lost headphones that way before :(...The buttons give you all the same features that you find on a standard pair of Apple earbuds. The sound quality is good. I won't say it's exceptional.

"I received a free product for testing and review.This is a quality bluetooth headset. It's amazing how far the price has dropped on bluetooth earbuds. They used to start at like $40/45. Anyway, I've never seen the 'stability clips' before, and I think they're a great touch. If you've ever tried jogging with headphones, you know the unappealing rhythm of the cord bounding around. This product helps to eliminate that issue by stabilize the cord with what is basically a small zipper (they call it a clip) that reduces the length of the free cable when wearing the produce. The audio quality and ease of connection are fine.Some criticisms: would have been better to have the buttons distributed over both earpieces instead of just one. Also, the size of the over-ear loops is a little large for my ears. It would be nice if they were somehow adjustable. It's not a stability thing, they just look a little big on me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HXS5NNM97VSV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014F5VE3M#wasThisHelpful","R1HXS5NNM97VSV","A1K6AA9Q9XF77P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K6AA9Q9XF77P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is also an extensive use of aerospace engineering and materials/manufacturing terminology.

"I really like the field of biomimicry, and it’s a blast to hear about all of the scientific and engineering creativity at play in the biomimicry industry. That said, the book is a little fast paced—the author tends to throw one invention after another at you, which starts to get overwhelming after a while. Focusing entire chapters on one or two related technologies would have allowed these technologies to have a more lasting impact on memory and perspective.Secondly, the author is very self-promoting, as other reviewers have already mentioned. It gets old after a while. We get it: you’re passionate about this and believe that you’re living the ideal life because you’re an outstanding engineer and entrepreneur. You think we should become just like you. Great. Thanks.

I can imagine using the large case one day, but not when I'm on a multi-city trip. I hate checking bags.Three complaints: (1) the color of this 'teal' collection is decidedly ambiguous. Is it green? is it blue? depend on the lighting. (2) I love the look and design with the leather detail, etc., but as a guy I have to say that the shape of the duffel bag and the design of the handles make it look like a large women's purse.

"This is a huge commitment of your time, so it better be worth it, no? I spent about three weeks reading this on and off, because the content is as gripping as history can be, but still rather dry. This is an excellent presentation of Europe's overall development in the late 20th century, including sections on Europe in the 21st century. As you might imagine, there is a strong focus on the Soviet Union and the collapse of communism. That said, we see plenty of information about the Western nations' reestablishment. This is about as good a book as one may find for a complete summary of modern Europe. It would be good to aid the book with basic review of information on Wikipedia, etc. -Ryan Mease","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22K7R2IFA88A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143037757#wasThisHelpful","R22K7R2IFA88A2","A1K6AA9Q9XF77P","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K6AA9Q9XF77P?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had high hopes for this sink. I needed one in this size, and the local big box stores had nothing in stock. My counter tops were being installed, the plumber was coming in as soon as they left, and Amazon had this one that could be delivered on a Sunday at no extra charge. The price didn't please me, but I assumed I was paying for quality.When I open the box, I was impressed. The sink was well packaged and protected, and had all the mounting hardware necessary. In terms of looks, it was GORGEOUS. It sparkled and shined like a polished jewel. And it was HEAVY. Heavy stainless is not cheap, so maybe the $345 price tag was worth it.The sink is a 4 hole model, so I installed the faucet in the middle, a hand soap dispenser to the left, a dish soap dispenser to the right, and a reverse osmosis tap on the far right. Sweet setup.Well, here is my experience. The sink has been installed for 12 days. Simply running water into this sink dulls that beautiful finish, and it requires a good scrubbing with a non-abrasive cleaner to bring back the shine. OK...I can live with that, but it runs counter to every other stainless sink I have ever owned (and I have owned quite a few).But here's the part that really sucks: it scratches like it is soft metal. By day 4 of use, there were very visible scratches on the bottom of this sink, and they absolutely RUIN its appearance. When one is remodeling a kitchen (new appliances, cabinets, counter tops, floor, and plumbing hardware), the expectation is that it will look new for more than 4 days. This sink reminds me of the saying, ""You don't wear tennis shows with a tuxedo."" It looks (already) like everything was replaced EXCEPT the sink.  I am hugely disappointed.Look at the 3 photos. The 2nd one shows the sink sponged down, rinsed, and wiped dry with a clean dish towel. The 3rd shows the sink after I just ran some water in it. No soap, just water. And we have a whole house water filter...this is good, clean, water. Both the 2nd and 3rd picture clearly show the scratches in the finish.American Standard used to produce a fine product. My experience with this one means I will never buy one of their products again.Save yourself the headache. Avoid this p.o.s. like the plague.Look at my other reviews. I rarely give anything a one or two star review.

"This is my second review of this brewer, reflecting my experience with the product and the company.The first brewer made terrific coffee, but when brewing the largest size cup (the travel mug), it did not automatically stop brewing. That had to be done manually. I wasn't sure if that was a malfunction or not, and I had difficulty contacting the company. Fortunately, Ekobrew monitors these reviews, and one of the owners left a comment , asking me to contact him directly. I did, and he was very responsive and most gracious.He told me that the machine was indeed defective. He immediately sent out a replacement. I have received it, and it works perfectly.I have tested it with Starbucks brand K-cups, an inexpensive K-Cup brand from Aldi, the reusable filter that comes with the machine, and the Ekobrew stainless steel reusable filter. It functions well with all of them.95% of the time, I brew coffee using the reusable filter. I drop in a paper filter, measure out some coffee, and in less than a minute, I have a cup of freshly brewed java. I have also not added anything to the waste stream. The spent coffee and paper filter go into the compost bin. No plastic to clog landfills.My wife also uses the Ekobrew to make tea, and it works perfectly for that as well.The machine is so simple to use, a caveman could do it. Really. Fill the reservoir with water, drop in a K-cup, hit the on button, and wait about 40 seconds. When the lights stop flashing, it is ready to brew. Choose your cup size: small, medium, or large, push the button, and your cup or mug is filled. When the machine beeps 3 times,  brewing is complete.If you walk away from the machine for a while, it shuts itself off.I absolutely love this brewer, and was treated very well when I had an issue with the first machine. I highly recommend this brewer and the company. Save yourself some money, and get this instead of a Keurig. You won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRI493CJVFVDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6D3E0E#wasThisHelpful","RRI493CJVFVDA","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a wonderful lens. It is also weather resistant, which adds greatly to its usability.I own a few professional level Nikons ( D4, D800), and an array of lenses that sold to purchase a small house. That said, many of those lenses have plastic barrels (and in a few cases, mounts). This Fuji lens, on the other hand, just reeks of quality. The lens barrel is metal. The minimum focus distance is 3.6' at all focal lengths. That means it will function in closeup situations as a macro. The image stabilization system is better than Nikon's, providing (says Fuji) up to 4.5 f stops of shake-free images. I can say this: I have shot with this lens mounted on an X-T100 hand-held at 1/4 second and achieved images sharp enough to make 16 x 20 enlargements.Flare and chromatic aberration have not been a problem.I can recommend this lens without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R207XUN6QP05NJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FY3YTRS#wasThisHelpful","R207XUN6QP05NJ","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using this brand of yeast for years. I come back to it over and over again.It is a ""Rapid-rise type yeast, which means there is no need to ""proof"" the yeast by dissolving it thoroughly in warm water before use. That said, old habits die hard, and I still do that.You get a LOT of yeast at a good price when you buy this package. Once opened, you can simply store the package with the top closed in the freezer. I used to to that, and the yeast was still perfectly fine after 2 years+. Or save a plastic vitamin type jar, pour the unused yeast in that, and store it in the freezer, (It lasts longer in the freezer than in the fridge, but you will still get at least a year when it is stored unfrozen.)My method is a little different. I store 1/4 of the package in a plastic jar, frozen. I break the remaining 12 oz into three packages of 1/4 lb each, vacuum seal them in my Food Saver, write the date on them, and store them in the freezer. They will last three years or so when stored this way.In any case, the next time you are in the grocery store, check price a 4 oz jar of Fleischmann's Dry Active yeast.  It will cost between $5 and $10. This stuff costs less, you USE less, and works better.

"I mixed this starter according to directions, and 5 days later I made my first loaf of sourdough bread. Good, but the tangy, sour flavor was more subtle than I hoped. Five days later, I made another loaf. OMG, this stuff is WONDERFUL!  Nice sour tang, the bread looks gorgeous, and the aroma that fills the house when this is baking is amazing.There seems to be a problem, though, with ""Loaf shrinkage."" Every time I walk into the kitchen, the loaf looks smaller. I'm not sure why that happens, but I have been noticing some bread crumbs on my wife's shirt.This culture will take on its own characteristics in your particular micro climate, and will likely change a bit each time you use it. All part of the adventure. And it is going to form a layer of water that floats on top of the starter. Don't pour off more than half of this: it is where much of the sour flavor comes from.  Just mix it in before you use the starter.Keep it fed (mine gets a feeding of 1/2 cup flour and 1/'2 cup water every 10 days, whether I use it or not. Over time, it will develop a ""ripe"" smell, but the taste it imparts to the bread will be wonderful. I keep mine covered with 2 layers of paper towels, held firmly in place by an elastic band. It allows the starter to breathe, but keeps bugs out. (Fruit flies live this stuff.) And mine stays at 74 degrees all the time.Buy this and give it a try.

"I bought this diffuser to use under a glass tea kettle atop a gas range. A person reviewing the kettle said the handle of the kettle would melt without one of these.  Well, that wasn't quite true.  This diffuser does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It diffuses the heat.  It also happens to be larger in diameter than the glass kettle, so it directs a good deal of heat up the sides of the kettle and to the handle.  The only time I ever burned my hand on the handle of the kettle was when I used this diffuser with it.That said, this is actually a great, simple device.If you are cooking something on very low heat (like a pot of rice that is simmering to absorb water), this diffuser will keep the rice from burning or sticking to the bottom of the pot. Likewise, when cooking something like spaghetti sauce or chili. Unless stirred constantly, those foods can burn and stick to the bottom of the pot. Well, not if you use this device!  It spreads the heat around nicely.  It is the same thing with a frying pan.  Sometimes you want a larger heat source than your range can provide, or a gentler one. This is all you need to accomplish that.You can use this on an induction, gas, or electric cook top. Hand washing is recommended. It will discolor from the heat of a burner, but that won't affect its usefulness.So...I bought this based on a review for a totally different reason. It didn't work for that purpose. But I discovered a whole lot of things this diffuser makes cooking easier.  I bought it by mistake, and I am really glad I did.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RS4G9CRITG4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000X6ESO#wasThisHelpful","R2RS4G9CRITG4J","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a GREAT whistling kettle.  I like it so much, I bought a second one on the off chance I dropped one and broke it.Here are the highlights:  It holds 12 cups of water. The lid is removable.  The glass is heat resistant, laboratory quality boroscilicate.The handle is heat resistant. The whistle is gentle, not ear piercing. The glass is marked with the minimum amount of water for heating, as well as at the 6 cup level.  The handle stays cool on my gas stove.  You can see when the water begins to steam, form tiny bubbles, and boil. This is handy for brewing green tea, or when heating water for a manual drip or press type coffee maker, where you do not want boiling water, but you do want it very hot.It comes with a little wire ""star"" for use on a conventional electric range. It is unnecessary to use it on a gas range, but with an electric, put the wire ""diffuser"" on the burner coils, and then sit this pot on top of it.I use a gas range, so I sit the kettle right on the grate. I use the smallest burner, and I make certain that the flame is NOT licking up the sides of the kettle. If the flame is too high, it will do that, and chances are good that you will burn your hand when you grab the handle.  You might also MELT the handle...not a good thing. So keep the flame reasonable.One person mentioned the Norpro 144 Heat Diffuser as a solution to keeping the handle cool. Perhaps that is the case with an electric range, but on a gas cook top, it actually spreads the heat over too wide an area, wider than the diameter of the glass kettle. Because of that, heat will rise directly to the handle. I bought the Nopro based on that advice (it was in response to a question posted about this kettle), used it once, and burned my hand when I grabbed the handle of the kettle. So if you use a gas range, do not use the Norpro 144 Heat Diffuser.  It will just take longer for the water to boil, and you will need a pot holder to hold the kettle.Dislikes?  Only two, and the first one is nit-picking.  The top must be removed to pour the water.  Hinging it would be more convenient (but that might make cleaning it in the dishwasher harder).  Second: forget a 96 oz (12 cup) capacity.  This kettle holds just about 64 oz (1/2 gallon).Seriously, if you don't do anything like boiling the pot dry, or dousing it with cold water as soon as it comes off the stove, this tea kettle should last a long time.  Actually, the glass is thermal shock resistant, but why tempt fate?","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CD2FVQWO2ARG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000V5X826#wasThisHelpful","R2CD2FVQWO2ARG","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this CD player along with player costing half as much from a different manufacturer. I had every intention of using this as my primary deck, and the less expensive one as a backup.  It didn't work out that way.Operation of the deck is pretty straightforward.  As other reviewers have noted, the drawer doesn't fully open, but that isn't really an issue when it comes to inserting a disc.  It is a major pain, however, when REMOVING a disc.  Unless the user exercises great care, discs will be scratched.  I managed to drop two discs on the floor when removing them from the deck.  Perhaps it's my big hands, but I believe this is more of a design flaw than Yamaha would lead us to believe.Second: if your listening style is anything like mine, you insert a disc, perhaps program a playing order (eliminating a few tracks, maybe changing the order in which they play, etc), get settled into your listening position, and then hit ""Play"" on the remote.  When you load a disc in this player, the disc loads, is read, and immediately begins playing.  Unless my deck is defective, this is really a dumb feature.Third: ""Pure Direct.""  One word: FUGGETABOUTIT.  Seriously.  I played Telarc DDD discs on this for evaluation purposes.  It was plugged into an Apt Holman preamp/Apt 1 power amp, and output to Klipsch LaScala speakers.  Cabling to the speakers is Vampire Wire (constructed of four 13AWG conductors. Each conductor is made from 277 strands of wire. Each of the four conductors is formed from three bundles of OFHC, and three bundles of silver plated OFHC. The four conductors are joined to make 2 conductors, which are rated at 10AWG. This cable is laid out in a Star Quad configuration, which is a superior method to attenuate EMI (electromagnetic interference).  I also used the same type of RCA cables to connect the Yamaha to the preamp.  Essentially, with this test setup, you will hear ANY flaw introduced by a component.  With or without the display on, the Yamaha is dead silent (a good thing). Switching between the ""Pure Direct"" mode (display off), and normal, display on mode, yields an almost unnoticeable difference: with the ""Pure Direct"" engaged, there was a barely perceptible increase in volume (measured at 0.8db). I could not discern any difference in the quality of the sound.Third: the deal breaker.  The remote for this unit is a joke.  My audio room is dimly lit.  It is sound and light isolated, and the floor, as well as excessively ""Bright"" wall areas, are carpeted.  The ceiling is acoustic tile.What does this have to do with the remote?  Simple.  It's impossible to see the markings on the thing.  I turned up the lighting, and it was still nearly impossible to read the markings.  I resorted to using the LED flashlight app on my phone in order to be able to see the markings on this remote.  Seriously, Yamaha, I expected more from your design group. A LOT more.Finally, the firmware in this unit is quirky.  Other reviewers have talked about the unit needing to go through the process of looking for a disc, reading the disc, or determining that no disc is present, before allowing the drawer to be opened.  One reviewer resorted to powering down the unit with the drawer partly open. This might not seem like a big deal, but when added to the other issues with this unit, the cumulative effect seriously detracts from the overall experience.  Think of it in this way (an example provided by my wife): ""When a woman is badly dressed, you notice the dress.  When a woman is impeccably dressed, you notice the woman.""  When that standard is applied to the Yamaha  CD-S300RK, I don't want to notice the CD deck.  It should be all but invisible.  I want to listen to the music being played on it.  The sonic qualities of this CD player are delightful.  The sound is rich, clear, and resonant.  Sadly, the way Yamaha engineers ""dressed"" it make it impossible to just sit back and enjoy the music.  I find myself noticing the shortcomings of the player, and that detracts from just being able to enjoy the music it produces.  For that reason, I am returning it.  Sorry, Yamaha.  It's like you hit a home run, and then didn't tag all the bases when running them, only to be called ""Out"" on a technicality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TWJ6ITHGERHW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UWWPZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2TWJ6ITHGERHW","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a premium quality dog crate at a bargain basement price.  Well constructed, no assembly required (just unfold it), and more heavy duty than the description would lead you to believe.The door and latch function flawlessly.There is a divider panel included that allows you to make the interior of the crate smaller, which is useful for housebreaking.  (Dogs do not like to make a mess where they sleep, and the divider keeps the dog from having enough room to  use one end of the crate for eliminating waste and the other for sleeping.This is truly a great crate, and should last longer than your dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RANFPBBY7VWC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OXAERM#wasThisHelpful","RANFPBBY7VWC3","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit it.  I was skeptical.  Yes, it carried the Denon name, but $249 for a feature-laden receiver?  They had to cut corners SOMEWHERE, right?  Nope, not really.First, a bit of a disclosure here.  I am what most would consider an audiophile.  My stereo system has consisted of Klipsch K-Horn speakers as my mains, A Belle Klipsch center channel speaker, and a pair of Klipsch Heresys as my rear (surround) speakers.  For electronics, I have used the flagship receiver models of Yamaha, Denon, and Onkyo.  I still own (and use) Apt Holman and Conrad Johnson separates with my pure audio setup. As for home theater, that's a separate listening space.  For that, I use a Sharp 60"" LCD/LED display, original (unmodified) Klipsch La Scala main speakers, A Klipsch Cornwall center channel, and Klipsch Heresy ll rear speakers. I am running an NXG Nx-Bas-50 powered subwoofer for extra extra bass kick.(If you are unfamiliar with these Klipsch Legacy speakers, look them up here on Amazon. They are VERY efficient, providing live concert level (115db) at one meter with one watt of power.  Be prepared for a bit of sticker shock.)What am I using as my home theater receiver?  This Denon AVR-S500BT.  A $249 receiver.My system will show the weaknesses of any component with glaring clarity.  If a receiver is a bit harsh, it is magnified by the speakers.  Same thing for a CD or Blu ray components. I plugged in an inexpensive JVC cd player and popped in a reference digitally recorded performance of the 1812 Overture, and the output hurt my ears. Distortion from the JVC.OK, back to the Denon.  First off, this receiver has a Bluetooth feature that allows you to play the music collection you have stored on your iPhone or Android device, or in the cloud.  This is a very good thing.  If you want the same feature in a low priced Yamaha receiver, you need to purchase a Bluetooth adapter.Now, a word of caution is in order here.  You are going to have to crank the gain way up on the receiver to get acceptable volume levels when using a Bluetooth connection.  For me, that means about 80%.  With less efficient speakers, you may or may not get the volume level high enough to please you.  The first music l played through this receiver came from my phone. I have to say, I was disappointed with the volume level achieved.  Then I thought, ""I'll bet a device wired directly into the receiver will give me better volume output.""  After all, with 56 watts in, I should not have been able to stay in the room with those speakers.Now, here is the caution: do NOT switch from Bluetooth mode to CD or DVD mode without first lowering the volume!  I made that ""One D ten T"" error (1D1OT).  In the split second between the time I hit ""Play"" and when the sound started, I had an ""Oh crap"" moment.  Before I could react, the explosion of sound from my speakers caused a window to shatter and two fluorescent light tubes to explode. I know my wife was yelling at me, but I couldn't hear a thing.  I DO know I was grinning from ear to ear.The lesson here is that streaming music via Bluetooth will not give you nearly the volume levels that you get from a wired connection.  Not even close.  This was my first experience using my phone as wireless music source.  I won't forget it any time soon!The receiver provides 140 Watts/channel peak output.  That should be sufficient to power almost any home theater setups.  And please note that there are 5 discreet amps, with 70W continuous output per channel in this unit,  to power your main speakers, center channel, surrounds (rear speakers), and subwoofer.  This doesn't mean you cannot use a powered subwoofer with this system, because you can (and I do).There is an AV pass-through, so you can just watch your television without turning on the receiver.  And there are 5 HDMI inputs, allowing you to hook up more HDMI devices than you likely own (including game consoles).  There are also dual subwoofer inputs, allowing the use of two subs, and supporting LFE.  There is a single HDMI output for connecting one display.Do you have a 3D display?  This receiver fully supports 3D.  I am beginning to think that the list of what it cannot do is shorter than the list of things it can.  Worrying about obsolescence?  Don't.  Ultra HD 4K 60 Hz video pass-through, along with 4:4:4 Pure Color highest resolution sub-sampling, by way of the HDMI and gaming inputs.Initial setup is a breeze, but again, a caution.  To do the initial receiver evaluation, I hooked up my mains and center channel speaker only.  There is an onscreen setup assistant that makes setup a breeze.  Except when that 1D10T error recurs.  After telling the Denon I had 2 front speakers and a center channel speaker, and no rear channel and no subwoofer, I began listening to the output of this receiver in earnest.  I was pretty certain I was going to turn the receiver on, listen to a few audio tracks and part of a DVD, and then box the unit up and return it.  I mean, seriously, how good could a $249 receiver actually be?Well, VERY good.  I liked what I was listening to, and spent the remainder of the afternoon viewing the Blu Ray version of ""Top Gun"" and ""Black Hawk Down.""  Then I shut the system down.Two days later, I came back to the system, plugged in an NXG NX-BAS-500 subwoofer, and and the Klipsch Heresy ll rear speakers, completing the setup.  I fired up the system, and was totally underwhelmed.  I couldn't get any power to the subwoofer.  I spent an hour checking connections, reading the sub's manual, and talking to the vendor.  No joy.  I swapped out the subwoofer cable, eliminating that as a cause.  I was about to go out and buy a 3.5mm to RCA cord so I could plug my smartphone directly into the subwoofer to see if the sub was dead, when I decided just to sit back and think about the problem.  I put a CD in the player, sat on the sofa, and realized that there was no sound coming from my rear speakers either.  Hmmm.  Was the receiver faulty?It was not.  When I did the initial setup, I told the Denon I had 2 front speakers and a center channel.  No subwoofer.  No rear speakers.I went back into setup (there is a setup button on the remote), told he Denon I had a subwoofer and rear speakers, and everything worked just fine.  The receiver had shut off the amps that were not being used.  So be aware, if you set up the system as, say, a 2.1, you will need to go back into setup if you decide to add additional speakers or a subwoofer.  If you don't, the additional speakers won't work.You can also use an included microphone (it has a long cable) to set the sound levels of each speaker.  The best way to do this is to turn off all florescent lighting, air conditioners, and anything else that might be picked up by the mic.  Put the mic on a tripod at your normal listening position, and let the receiver do its thing while you wait quietly in another room.  Your speakers will be emitting sounds which the mic picks up and delivers to the receiver, which in turn sets appropriate volume levels for each speaker.  This is going to get you pretty close, but you will still need to tweak the levels to suit your tastes.Here's another great feature: if you use different settings for different sources, the receiver will remember those settings, so you don't have to make adjustments every time you change input sources.  This is a big time saver and convenience feature.Sonically, the receiver is very pleasant sounding, and easy to operate.  The tuner section is more sensitive than a Yahama RX-V475 I borrowed from a friend for comparison purposes.  This receiver will tune LOTS of stations (about 3 times as many as the Yamaha against which I measured it).As previously mentioned, the Klipsch speakers will quickly showcase any weak link in your system (including cable quality).  I can detect no IM distortion, no harshness, and indeed, no ""color.""  You hear what was recorded.  Visually, the images on the display  are true, with no added ""noise.""  I have not tried the AVR-S500BT with an Ultra Hi-Def monitor, but I have every reason to believe the results will be stunning.If you have speakers that are highly inefficient, this might not be the best receiver choice.  But barring that, you can spend double the money and not get much more power, or nearly as many features.  Denon has a real winner here.  I am not certain how long they will hold this price point.  Normally the name ""Denon"" is not used in the same sentence with the term ""low cost.""  In this case, you get all the quality, features 95% of buyers will never use, and an affordable package.  That, in my book, is not just a home run, it's a grand slam.Well done, Denon.  Well done indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8XL3UAY7JJMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JR6GJLW#wasThisHelpful","R8XL3UAY7JJMY","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this blender from Woot, which I believe is an Amazon company.  It is, in a word, fantastic.I have used it to grind oats, millet, almonds, and brown rice into flour.  It handles the job effortlessly.I make a morning smoothie with almond milk, berries, banana, raw pumpkin and sunflower seeds (hulled), fresh ginger, and lots of ice.  Everything is completely smooth (not gritty or lumpy) in about 6 seconds.  And I have put water into the jar, added kale, cucumber, beet, chard, and carrots, and blended on high for about 10 seconds.  This makes an amazing ""green"" juice that contains all the fiber of the plants.I have also mixed fresh coconut and water, and had perfectly smooth coconut milk in 8 seconds flat.Every task I have thrown at this blender has been handled with ease.It is surprisingly quiet for having such a powerful motor.  The jar sits loosely atop the base.  That concerned me, so I called Omega, and talked with Robert in Customer Service.  He assured me this was normal.  Just place your hand lightly on top of the jar when blending (or chopping, grating, ice crushing, etc).Speaking of the jar, it has a unique internal shape that greatly facilitates proper blending, and eliminates the need for a push tool (as used by Vitamix).It has a variable speed control, as well as a ""pulse"" switch.  The pulse switch is useful when you are want to coarsely grate something.  I use this function for making gazpacho. Two quick 1/2 second pulses, and carrots, peppers, onions and celery are at the perfect consistency.The only warning I have is this: the blender will not likely fit beneath cabinets on your counter top.  It's pretty tall.Warranty wise, it's the best in the business: 10 years, parts and labor.  Having gone through Oster and Waring blenders at the rate of one/year for a number of years, I suspect this will be the last blender I ever buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVRIDV0NECHVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0088ME0CQ#wasThisHelpful","RVRIDV0NECHVU","A1XTIPZ2GA9C98","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XTIPZ2GA9C98?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product smells wonderful.  That is all well and good, but I didn't bu it as an aromatherapy product, but to sooth my old, arthritic joints.  Used in that capacity, it failed miserably.I had my wife massage a good amount of this into my aching shoulder, and I rubbed it into my hands and ankles.  Nothing.  And when I say nothing, I mean precisely that.  Nothing: no heat, no cooling, no sensation whatsoever.Later in the day I showered, and applied some of her Tiger Balm Red to my hands and ankles.  Instant, soothing heat. (To  be fair, it Tiger Balm doesn't smell as good as the Badger, but it works as advertised.)  Then I had my wife massage some Biofreeze into my shoulder.

"My wife loves this stuff.  She deals with moderate to severe pain since losing a food deal of muscle, bone, and nerves from her lower leg following surgery to remove a tumor.  She says this is the only topical treatment that provides any measure of relief.Tiger Balm has been around since forever, and has stood the test of time.

"Now that I have been using this product for a few days, I have some observations.  First: this gel goes on cool, heats up within a few minutes, peaks in about 15 minutes, and continues to provide deep, intense warmth for 3-4 hours.  The gel is not greasy, doesn't stain clothing or upholstered furniture, and smells great.Compared to Tiger Balm Red, it provides more soothing warmth, has a nicer smell, and the effects last longer.  The difference between this and Badger Sore joint rub is literally the difference between fire and water, Biofreeze being the fire.  And compared to Icy Hot, the effects last longer, it smells better, and is more cost effective when purchased in the quart pump container.60+ years of use and abuse has taken its toll on my body.  College football left me with shoulder and knee issues, and now my ankles and hands are arthritic.  While Biofreeze doesn't ""cure"" anything, it takes the pain away, saving me from needing to resort to narcotic pain relievers.  It works, the effects last, and the cost per application is low.  Add it all up, and this is a winner.And don't waste your money spending $10-$20 for a 4 oz tube.  At $40, the quart is a deal.  Next time I need to purchase this, I will be looking for the gallon size.

"Great bags.  Perfect seals.

"...and that is a mixed blessing.  Character development is much better than season 1, and we can begin to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  This is the season that allows you to decide who you like and who you don't.  The episodes have some great plot lines (arguably better than anything SG1 and Atlantis offered), and Dr. Rush actually shows his wry sense of humor.All of this is a mixed blessing, because the franchise was cancelled at the end of this season.  It happened abruptly.  The last episode of the year set up year 3, but there was no year 3.  It was as though the ship exploded between seasons, taking the cast and crew with it.  While it is more likely the franchise wasn't picked up for a 3rd year, this was a lousy way to end the series.  The unrealized potential of SGU is truly a loss for Stargate fans.

"This series is different than the two Stargate series that came before it.  The first season is very dark- dimly lit sets, an impending sense that the players are all doomed, and very slow character development.

"If like me you have read the prequel Accepting the Moon then you will be well acquainted with new werewolf and all round Alpha Mena. Mena had lived with her cheating , lying husband for twelve years when one night everything came to a head and she realised the relationship was well and truly dead in the water. Leaving Mark was a no brainer for Mena but unknown to her Mark was a werewolf and a very possessive one at that! A chance meeting with Jaxon a vampire sends her in a totally new direction as Mark and his Pack try to hunt her down leaving Mena no choice but to defend herself and then boy is the cat left well and truly amongst the pigeons ! Mena kills Mark which makes her the new Alpha and then of course there's Jaxons king to deal with but it would seem that Phoenix is about to make life even more complicated for the new Alpha!Mena is trying hard to sort out her feelings but one thing is sure not all her Pack are happy to see her! Ok select a new Beta , avoid being arrested for murder and somehow convince the Pack that an alliance with Phoenix and his vampires is a good thing. First problem is twenty seven step up to be her number two which is crazy! Second problem Menas inner wolf wants to climb the very human detective Alex like a tree! Oh and there's no love lost between vampires and wolves and someone is trying very hard to destroy both Mena and Phoenix. Can this woman catch a break? Apparently not as Menas inner wolf has ideas of her own and Mena feels herself slipping away whilst outside forces begin to attack her Pack!This is very unusual story and unlike any other I've read. The relationships are well and truly messed up with Mena insanely attracted to Phoenix but this seven hundred year old vampire is not sure he knows how to love. Her wolf keeps taking over and as she gets stronger it's clear she would kill Phoenix in order to be with Alex. An uneasy compromise is reached but I felt uncomfortable with the solution if honest and my heart ached for those involved. Alex might be innocent and unaware of what's under his nose but Phoenix stepped aside to protect the woman he is increasingly coming to care for. No he isn't perfect far from it and makes all kinds of mistakes but his arrogant armpit tendencies are forgivable as we watch him hurt and yet never give in. I struggle with Mena at times though. Yes it's all new to her but to this reader she switches from weak to loud and in charge and then petulant and I got whiplash from her constant dilly dallying. I like you , I don't like you, I'm going, I'm staying yes you get the idea that this female is not my favourite heroine. What I really liked though were the supporting characters as they really helped flesh this unusual story out and added so much to the plot. We've met wolves and vampire so why not add witches and lions to the mix?

Now she is single and has taken back control of her life but that no good and hugely overly self opinionated waste of space just refuses to take no for an answer ,Foster is a were bear with anger issues and to be honest has probably given up on ever finding that special female who should be his.

Ok track her down is first on his list but finding out he has competition could very well push both man and bear too far!I love these quirky fun stories that seem to be set around a rather unique dating agency. It's hilarious as such diverse species get paired off and a bear and a ferret just add to the madness and mayhem. Very adult language and sexy shananigans abound in these stories but I thought this one a little too quick and have to warn that it's quite a violent instalment .

"Finally we get inside the very private life of Roth the seriously formidable leader of Squad Nine and wow what a rush this story is ! Ms Hackett has come up with a fabulous addition to her Hell Squad series featuring those humans who have banded together in the Blue Mountain military installation . Constantly taking on the aliens who have invaded Earth these brave men and women still have time to play but for Roth there's only one woman who really appeals but is she really friend or foe?Avery was an agent for the Coalition and indeed was in the front line when initial contact with the Gizzida was made. She was found by Roth in an experimental tank but claims to have little to no memory of just how she came to be in the aliens laboratory. The gaps in Averys memory hold clues but accessing her memories is proving almost impossible. Step forward one very determined and obsessed Roth but it soon becomes apparent that safety within the complex might just have been compromised!This is by far my favourite book in this series. I do enjoy sci fi but it's usually the sort that features sexy aliens ( yes I'm a bit shallow!) and these books show just how loving and tough humans can be. Fast paced with great dialogue and white hot scenes that feel believable . The world is in chaos and it feels right to celebrate what life is left and these battle hardened troops sure know how to let their hair down! It's not all romance though as it's a very strong storyline that seems to be expanding with each book. It's almost as if the more the survivors learn about the enemy the more we as readers get drawn in. Gruesome creatures to make the reader squirm but as we learn in this story sometimes humans can be just as callous and maybe more so.

"Ok this is very short so please buyer beware. That being stated it's a quick easy read that has its own unique world building. A young woman has a serious car crash and wakes up in hospital feeling and looking like herself but on the best day possible. When Eliza's released early she notices a turn on the road that wasn't there before but those who live there are definitely not the normal suburban types! Now luckily a sexy guy is around to answer her questions but as the story ends this reader is sadly left with far too many questions unanswered.

"Well this book was a welcome return to the couple that started it all human Caitlin and vampire Kane. They were the first couple the author played around with but their turbulent journey was clearly far from over. As this book starts Caitlin is struggling with her work at the agency as few of her coworkers actually trust her anymore. Indeed most of this story does actually impinge on trust issues as the author well and truly hangs her characters out to dry! This couple have huge issues and although as a reader we are privy to their innermost feelings and inadequcies most of this story revolves around the suffering they put each other through.Now I'd hate anyone to imagine it's just about the tangled relationship and hasten to reassure that the author has one or two more tricks up her sleeve. First there are creatures from the fabled fourth dimension appearing in Blackthorn and then there's the tricky murder investigation that Caitlin is involved in. Kane seems determined to derail her but why? Clearly he is protecting Caleb but what does it all have to do with the much feared prophecy? Then we have the fact that war is pretty much starting to look inevitable as actions by those in power are felt in the world of Blackthorn.If brutally frank I really did not enjoy the constant back and forth between Caitlin and Kane. Yes I know Kane has his reasons for his evasion but it just felt way to much angst for me and at times I just wanted to bang their heads together! Fear not though as characters from previous books appear here which really opens up the bigger picture and answers are forthcoming. The story isn't quite over though but (hopefully) Caitlin and Kane might just walk away with trust between them. One thing that struck me was just how different this story by a fellow Brit read. Words are used that never seem to appear in bog standard paranormal which made a refreshing change as yes I wear knickers and not the dreaded panties! I mean yuk children are taught doggy not dog to make it seem more cuddly and less threatening , so since when did an item of intimate apparel become scary? Ok rant over but the joy of seeing such words as ""mardy"" used cannot be downplayed. A good addition to this series but it will leave you wanting more!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R282SMIXO0OLH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013J5XYJQ#wasThisHelpful","R282SMIXO0OLH3","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well we are back with the Fae in the Cold Iron series and I'm just loving how each book is completely different to the last. Yes this world and the story within of a wall separating the Queen and her court from humans keeps building but each book does kind of work as a standalone . This book does the impossible though and actually takes a villain and turns him into a hero!Finn has constantly made mistakes recently and taking on his old enemy has left both his home and the Fae he protects broken. His son has deserted him but he has a cunning plan involving the Penitent to get him back as without him the Fianna are terribly vulnerable. Now if he could just find time to persuade the human Ann Phillips into his bed then life would be joyous indeed!Ann doesn't trust the head of the local Irish mob but when a student of hers appears to be in trouble and abused she knows just where to look for help. Finn opens Ann's eyes to his world of fair folk but it's a dangerous place. Finn sets in motion a plan to help the child but before he has time to act the boy is kidnapped by a vicious Druid. What happens next plunges them all into danger as long dead secrets are revealed and the most vile and untrustworthy just might turn out to be allies or will they?Another good story with drama, tension and a plot with a tantalising ending. These Fae are not cute or sweet but cruel and dangerous and none more so than Finn and yet the author shows him in a whole new light in this book . He is honourable , brave and struggling to protect those he sees as his . Letting go of anger and revenge to embrace new beginnings is never easy but as the conflicts change focus he steps up. Ann is a huge surprise to all including herself! To say more would ruin the surprise but I can say she's strong, has morals and a genuine desire to save others. If honest I wasn't totally convinced by their almost instant love but could believe that two people who had closed off their hearts could somehow learn to trust each other. It's not an erotic story full of raunchy scenes but there are intimate moments between the couple.This author seems to enjoy redeeming her characters and I'm curious what will happen to the Prince Consort as every good paranormal story needs a bad guy to boo and hiss at. I suspect the Penitent might be up next but whoever it is I know I will be eagerly downloading it. This series showing Fae in the modern world and those who help humanise them is very entertaining . Although this seemed lacking in the romance department it was still a book that had me up late reading it and I guess there's no better recommendation than that!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AV2M5DPDAPAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P42LP62#wasThisHelpful","R1AV2M5DPDAPAZ","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when I first realised a dragon lived above Santuary and just how curious about his place in the Dark hunters world I was. Then nothing really seemed to come of that snippet until recently the author seems to be revisiting her roots . I know a lot of readers will be surprised by the story featuring Maxis and possibly just a teensy bit disappointed because there are several characters waiting in the wings and readers have been clamouring for their stories. What Ms Kenyon has done here though is tie this book up to a much older series featuring the Lords of Avalon and if you thought the strife between the Arcadians and Katagaria was already complicated prepare to have your head spinning around!No one makes their characters suffer more than this author. This couple are a perfect example of the pain and suffering those in this fascinating world face. Most definitely star crossed lovers because they are two opposite sides of a very messy coin. One born human and capable of shifting into dragon form and the other hatched from an egg with the ability to shift into a human body. Ironically it's the dragon born (Katagaria) who seem far more humane in this story but mistakes have been made on both sides . As this story begins it's up to Seraphina to convince the mate she let down ( try nearly got killed!) that he should help her rescue her missing twins. Max is honourable and so very protective of his offspring but hides dark secrets and when the truth comes out it looks like all out war is about to descend!I love this authors ability to surprise and entertain me. Her characters are never one dimensional and I'm addicted to the sharp dialogue. It's such a very complicated world though and I had to take a minute to remind myself just who was who. Oh I'm fine with the regular contingent at Sanctuary and of course our much loved Dark Hunters but just sometimes all the various demons, gallu and pantheons have me pausing to remember when I last read about them. In this book we see the workings of the Amazons in the were hunter world as well to add to the ever expanding story arc . I seem to think that I prefer the older books in this series but just can't stop reading them as I keep hoping for more Nick, Savitar or Jaden but then the author must follow her muse but I really hope it leads her back to those incredibly passionate Dark Hunters soon. I'm really glad my library stocks this series","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YUIF1YO59RS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250029945#wasThisHelpful","R23YUIF1YO59RS","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the second book in the Steampunk Chronicles and definitely works very well as a standalone. The steampunk genre is quite familiar to this reader with it's very different timeline for historical events and crazy use of machinery . This author however has her own unique take with Frankenstructs having recently been declared human. Now these incredible beings are composed of cloned body parts but each can think for themselves and has free will but for far to long have been used as slaves and treated abominably . Unfortunately they are still feared and hated by some but as this story shows these incredible Frankenstructs are more than capable of feeling!Captain Kaysana is on a mission to try and stop the plague that's quickly sweeping the land. A plague that brings sex driven flesh eating zombies and unfortunately not even her own Airship is safe. Escaping with Sten a Frankenstruct she feels she has no choice than to continue but the lust is affecting them and keeping a clear head seems nigh on impossible. Sten treats Kaysana like no man before and try as she might to ignore what he offers Kaysana is far from immune . Sten had been intruiged by the fiesty Captain before but now he has her right where he wants her and it's on her knees , at his mercy but his goal is only her pleasure and complete and total capitulation!I think if new to this genre than this is an easy book to follow as it's not bogged down by too much machinery and inventions. There's been a war brewing but this story fixates on the plague that is rapidly escalating. If truthful I was a bit in the dark about some aspects of it's origin but could easily see that like some modern viruses this was a pandemic that could bring terror to the world. The lust generated by this plague quickly escalates bringing violence and death but as the story progresses our intrepid couple reach the epicentre but their journey is far from mundane. Expect an alpha male to take control and show his woman just how kinky she can really be!Ok first of all characters and Kaysana has an awful lot of backbone but she's driven by past events in her life. Kaysana has no reason to love Frankenstructs and tries so hard to deny her attraction to Sten but frankly that's a lost cause!  Sten is perhaps too controlling for some readers and their initial physical interaction might seem anything but consensual . That being said it's clear Sten has strong feelings towards Kaysana and truly desires to bring her only the sweetest release but boy does he get creative! Some readers might be shocked by just how Sten proceeds but it's a story that unashamedly proclaims it's BDSM elements so just go with the flow. As for supporting characters well Emily stole the show and I'd love to read more about her and it would be remiss of me not go mention a certain wolf Cadrach who you could say helps save the day !Read this book with an open mind and enjoy the passion and romance. This is without a doubt a love story that just happens to be kinky and quite explicit at times. If honest there isn't a huge amount of world building but I suspect that might be addressed in the next book. I finished this and unfortunately I'm a little hazy about the origins and intent behind the plague. There is a pivotal scene but I still feel I'm left with questions but to say more would give spoilers . I would recommend this book to these who don't mind erotic scenes but do want a solid story . This was an adventure with a happy ending and that's my favourite type of book!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E3V111CSVRKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007P0OLSA#wasThisHelpful","R3E3V111CSVRKN","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok so I admit that most of the sci fi romance I read tends to feature hunky aliens but this author has taken two humans as her lead characters and given her readers quite a creditable story with a hero who is both protective and totally badass! In a world that has been invaded by aliens that sort of resemble  prehistoric creatures but are completely lucid and aware of their brutality we meet the survivors fighting to reclaim their land. Hardly any of humanity survived the initial attacks but those who do band together to destroy their enemy and take back their planet. At a secret military base Hell Squad is one of the teams that regularly put themselves in the firing line. Their leader is Marcus, hardened by war, loyal to a fault and totally smitten by former party girl turned communications specialist Elle. Marcus doesn't see how he could ever be worthy of her and tries to hide his feelings but as the war hots up Elle will be integral to defeating the monsters that now roam the Earth.This is the first book in this series but there's enough information to make it flow very well. Yes we have vicious blood thirsty aliens but the author pits them against the best that humanity can offer. Step forward the courageous men and women working at Blue Mountain military base . It was fun reading how the tough Marcus felt about Elle and at times his thoughts and words were almost poetical which made me smile. Yes he definitely has the woman up on a pedestal but there's a lot more to Elle than just her looks. Elle is braver than Marcus realises, far more stubborn too and a genuine caring person who feels as strongly about him as he does her! Luckily a mission throws them together and when sparks ignite boy does that pair start a fire! Yes well written sexy scenes appear but they are sensual and just felt integral to this story. I really enjoyed the believable dialogue and loved the teasing and banter amongst Hell Squad. Romance action and well written what more do you need?Four and a half from me","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z2G3L2S9TPHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFI0N0M#wasThisHelpful","R1Z2G3L2S9TPHJ","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book contains two stories by authors that I have previously read. They are both completely different and view the legend of werewolves in a totally different way. The first by Ms Douglas surprised me as although it's most definitely a ménage tale it felt sweet and romantic . Yes there are numerous sex scenes but the author kept them fresh and different and the characters are the sort that had me cheering for them. No real danger if honest but a little angst that the author quickly disposed of.The second story has much more depth with far more of a mythological background involving the origins of werewolves. I really wanted to like these characters but just couldn't get my head around a supposedly strong alpha female being so wet ( absolutely no pun intended ). It's a far more graphic story but at times felt repetitive, just how often do we need to be told it's close to full moon? If honest I struggled to truly connect with the lead characters but found the supporting Pack to be interesting and quite entertaining with their dichotomy .So two completely different stories but I'm sure each will appeal to some readers. Having read books by both authors before I was shocked to discover my previous thoughts turned on their head. I'd expected the first story to be the most erotic and the second to be far more of a romance but these authors clearly had other ideas. I'm not a huge fan of ménage and seldom seek it out but I did find this book to be entertaining and I'd certainly try more from these authorsI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RZDTJW6ZYUM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDWNK1E#wasThisHelpful","R2RZDTJW6ZYUM7","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well this is a hard review to write because I have no wish to ruin the book for anyone else. This is the final instalment of the Reveler series and it's with a heavy heart that I type. This has been such a unique world to fall into and completely unlike any other urban or paranormal story that I have read. It is a series that delves into our deepest fears, rolls around in them and then does the unthinkable , it destroys all that we believe in. Step out into the dream waters and discover a world of nightmares that are more than capable of consuming you!This series has featured several different couples who all interconnect but as the last book ended Steve Coll sacrificed himself in an effort to remove the Sandman from the waking world. This book takes up exactly where that story left off with those in Maze city under siege and those in the waking world still trying to save both those awake and those trapped in dreams with the carnivorous nightmares. This action packed instalment leaves our heroes so damaged and yet they keep fighting. This is not horror and yet the author takes us on a truly harrowing ride. The outcome is an intense story that allows all these fascinating characters to step up in their own inimitable fashions and I wouldn't have missed it for anything. The romance is integral but downplayed so that it just feels right and not intrusive . If you are looking for a dark world punctuated with hope then this series is a must read. Start at the beginning and wallow in the dream waters but never forget to check out just who is sharing those dreams with you!

"It's been quite a while since I've read one of the In Death books but when I spotted this on a Netgalley I just couldn't resist. It's a great concept to showcase the possible workings of New York police in the future and to centre it around such very strong characters . Eve and Roarke are always front and centre but as this series has progressed it's been admirably fleshed out with a supporting cast with all the enthusiasm of the Scooby gang! Now add in the fact that each book is a crime drama to solve with police procedure driving it but with the twist of the addition of futuristic technology. Happily even though it is set in 2061 it still feels like the world we inhabit today but with faster cars, computers etc and of course the addition of droids!There is very little mystery here as the reader already knows from the start just who the killers are. No I'd describe it more as a process as Eve follows the (admittedly high tech) crumbs to unravel a chain of murders that could see a body count of twenty four or even more. The synopsis says ""star crossed lovers"" so Romeo and Juliet spring to mind but personally I'd liken the killers to the infamous Bonnie and Clyde as they wilfully leave death and devastation in their wake. What brought a fresh prospective to this book was the addition of a Deputy who refuses to just let his case slide and there's even dark cop humour to lighten the mood.As ever Eve is superb and so driven. She's a tough cookie who dislikes the world thinking she has a soft side. Intelligent yes but sometimes left a little bewildered by mundane things. Roarke is her love interest . A self made millionaire who will do anything for the woman he sees as ""his cop"".Sometimes these books are classified as romance but this time it wasn't really the case. I did enjoy the dynamics of the ensemble cast but the slow unravelling of all the clues just kept me glued to my kindle. One things certain if I or a loved one ever needed help I'd certainly like to have Eve on my side!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZXJS6INW9UEA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VRT921Q#wasThisHelpful","RZXJS6INW9UEA","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second instalment in this authors latest vampire series and we again return to the corrupt and violent land known as Five Bridges. This is a place were those altered by the Flame drug all reside but trust is in short supply and trickery and evil doings are unfortunately an everyday occurrence . Vaughn is a Border Patrol Officer but recently all he can think about is the tempting witch Emma. Both are rare in that they seek to protect the weak and fight the corruption and debauchery rife in their lands but they seem to have become entangled in something with far reaching consequences . It's well known that a dark Wizard is heavily involved in sex trafficking but when Emma and Vaughn discover three murdered teenage girls the race is on to stop these atrocities once and for all. Can they take down the slave ring when so many seem involved? Just how can two so different people work together but to succeed they will have to discover just what being a team really means !I really enjoyed this short story and thought that it really started to further open up this world that Ms Roane has created. Vaughn is such a driven passionate guy with a past that haunts him. Emma knows what it's like to lose someone she loves but still fights to hang on to her humanity in spite of everything. As different species they should be enemies but the chemistry and passion between them just cannot be denied. A huge plus for this reader was the ending as it brought hope to what is a pretty nasty world.

"Kelley Armstrong is an author who always seems to deliver top notch urban fantasy and this collection of short stories and snippets is such an interesting mixture. Because of the sheer amount here I won't review each and every one as that might make for an extremely lengthy review and truth be told that might be boring and also I already struggle to reign my enthusiasm in as it is! What I really liked was the simple fact that although we get snippets from her Otherworld and Cainsville universes we are also treated to completely new ( to this reader anyway ) and standalone stories.  Led Astray had me eagerly reaching to read the Otherworld stories as they are my personal favourite. If frank I was a little dissappointed as the couple I adore ( Clay and Elena) are mentioned here but sadly not present and I suspect I'm not the only one missing them. The Pack is present though so watch out for the story V Plates and even vampire Zoe is featured in the stories Learning Curve and The List.  If Cainsville is the series that enchants you then settle down and enjoy learning more about the towns inhabitants and in particular Gabriel in the stories Gabriel's Gargoyle and Devil May Care. I confess I've not yet started that series but this intruiging glimpse has me itching to begin.  As for the other stories here well it was an interesting mixture of just about anything you can imagine. We get a glimpse at a post apocalyptic world in Branded, zombies in both Last Stand and V Plates, there's even a nod to Hell Raiser and Pin head in The Collector! So lots to entertain but also poignant stories because this author reaches out and squeezes her readers hearts in both Dead Flowers by a Roadside and Suffer the children . If a twist in the tale is what grabs yor attention then dive into Rakshasi or Plan B but most of all read this collection and judge for yourselves. I truly was gripped but sadly did miss my favourite characters and had read one or two shorts before but if you are new to this authors work then Im pretty confident that you will be very satisfied and hooked just like the rest of her fans.

"Larissa Ione and Demonica! These words are guaranteed to make my heart beat faster and then you have to add in that it's a M/M story as well! Yes that's right Ms Ione is prepared to take her characters on a truly liberating ride and who knew it could be so enlightening.This book works easily as a standalone but do watch out for cameo appearances from much loved demons. Here we meet Raze a medic and most importantly a Seminus demon. He is an anomaly really as his species can only survive by having sex with females but for Raze its all about those sexy guys out there. Resigned to never experiencing true passion with another male he lives with a Succubus but unknown to Raze she has powerful enemies.Slake is an assassin and pretty good at what he does. This job though puts him through the wringer as not only does his target have a powerful protector in Raze but Slakes own soul is on the line. What should be simple and straightforward is anything but and soon choices have to be made with very surprising outcomes!I am no expert on M/M stories but as a Demonica fan I had to give this story a go and I'm so pleased I did.

"This is without doubt my favourite sci fi series bar none. Ms Kenyon is at the top of her game with an imagination and talent that few can emulate. Whilst this series is futuristic we are never bombarded with lots of technical details but just enough to enrich the world she has created Amazing world building and a storyline of good versus evil that never grows old. Add in her trademark alpha males with romance in spades and yes I'm a very happy reader.This time it's Hauk the colossal Andarian warrior who steps into the spotlight. He has a truly awful backstory and unfortunately it's a past that still impinges on his present. He agrees to take his nephew on a quest but has no idea that his greatest enemies are closing in on him. When a mysterious injured female is discovered he realizes that she is an assassin but Sumi doesn't seem to want his life no her mission is far more nefarious than that!I really enjoyed this story and boy is it a long one. Both Hauk and Sumi have survived things that would break others but they have come through strong and driven. Sumi is seeking her missing child whilst Hauk just wants to fulfil his duties.I loved honourable Hauk and although he has suffered so much he has so much to give. My heart ached for him but thankfully didn't break as sometimes this author pushes a little too far into darkness with her tortured heroes. A lot of Hauks suffering is caused by his own mother and I wasn't happy with how that played out in this book if honest but there is a joyous ending and most things got neatly tied up. The war between the League and the Sentella continues with obviously more to come but for this reader it's Neros story that I really want.Four and a half from me","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9K6RUYTQWP77/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0749954043#wasThisHelpful","R9K6RUYTQWP77","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive been on a sci fi kick recently and had this author recommended to me but I fear I've made a tiny mistake and this is the second in a series. That being said I thought this story started with a bang and never let the pace slow. I admit I've missed a little of the background and world building but nevertheless I found this to be an entertaining read.The Phoenix brothers are treasure hunters and this book focuses on Zayn, whose past haunts him and his new mission is about to truly test his mettle. Ria is an assassin but she desperately wants to leave the Guild but that's impossible or is it? Ria has a cunning plan but she needs the Phoenix boys to help her. Ok so finally her plan is operable but there's a really big fly in the ointment because every time Zayn looks at her it's the face of a dead woman looking back at him, a woman he killed!I really liked the idea of these treasure hunting brothers searching for old earth artefacts. Yes it's an adventure story with a strong romance running through it but the more poignant moments really helped to open it up. There's a huge twist with corruption and secrecy to uncover and although the end seemed almost too pat I didn't really mind. What has me screaming though is the mystery thief Nera Darc and I can't wait to learn more about her. So bottom line I liked it and would read more by this author but my favourite character has to be a certain teenage bomb maker who quite literally blew me away!

"This author constantly entertains her readers with her imagination. Whether it be shifters or even romantic suspense and now I find that she has turned her hand to sci fi romance too. Rest assured though its still the sort of book that will have you eagerly turning the pages of this fast paced sexy story. This is apparently part of a series but I had no trouble reading it as a stand alone.Set on planet Lumineta where males outnumber females we meet human Leilani who travels into the mountains to help work on a project. Problems arise pretty quickly though when it's realised that she is alone and isn't mated. The solution is to keep her one full moon cycle whilst the lonely males try to capture her interest but in their male dominated society it's two males to every one woman!Ok this was quick and I really liked the snarky heroine. Hold her hostage and just see how awkward a woman can really be! I also enjoyed the dialogue when the males tried to understand and learn more about human females.As for the romance if menage a trois not your thing fear not as this author writes about a fierce alpha with no intention of sharing his prize! There's enough of a subplot to engage interest and the ideas whilst futuristic fitted the story very well. Oh and lest you forget Con may appear human but there's a really big difference and its not the one you might think!So this is science fiction but it's not hard core or dry. This is most definitely a romance and best of all a happy endingI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z697SMWQGGLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014U6CXB8#wasThisHelpful","R1Z697SMWQGGLE","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just finished the arc I received and if you love urban fantasy and haven't started this series then please do so now . This book starts exactly where the previous novel left off with our heroine Matilda standing back in her farmhouse kitchen but so much has changed. She came back from the past having saved time but she's now in a completely different timeline and it's one where she previously didn't survive . Those around her see Evelyn but it's Matilda's consciousness that's steering her Galvanised body. To make matters worse the man she loves seems set on killing her as he has no recollection of just what they mean to each other . Poor Matilda has saved the world only to discover that she's not the only one being dragged through different dimensions and hot on her trail is someone who quite simply wants to rule the world whatever the cost!This book has everything I enjoy. Courageous heroine, strong alpha hero and a truly dastardly villain. Add in the magic that powers the Galvanised, the mutated creatures and an action packed adventure and I'm one very happy reader. With it's crazy mixture of almost Frankenstein characters mixed in with mutated humans and lord I must include those insane creatures because giant lizards ( dragons?) and miniature sheep are not something I read about everyday. Yes I guess you can tell I loved it and this series is a huge recommendationI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R0OUXJ200F3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S75OK0Q#wasThisHelpful","R3R0OUXJ200F3U","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"About a year ago I discovered the steampunk genre and it's such a fun idea. Now in her own inimitable style Ms Silverwood takes the idea and just runs with it! Not just a world featuring almost Victorian ideals, mixed with unusual mechanical objects but a romance with BDSM elements and of course a really solid story.Imagine if you will being created from cloned body parts and then treated as if you really do not matter. Not considered human but known as a Frankenstruct and little more than an object . Our heroine Claire is a Frankenstruct and she has been raised as an assasin but inside is a woman aching to express herself and be free.Theo is by nature what many would consider to be a Dom. Through hard work he has risen to power and is highly respected . When an enemy airship crashes near his home amongst the wreckage he finds an enticing young woman but she's not quite what she seems. Now Theo wants nothing more than to discover all of her secrets. Unfortunately Frankenstructs are illegal but Theo sees the woman within the skin and knows in his heart that Claire is human. What he doesn't realise though is it's quite likely that he is Claire's intended target ! As their relationship develops it takes them both to their own nirvana but for Claire keeping her secret is purgatory !I will be honest and say that this is not the usual heavy steampunk type of story. Yes there are unusual devises and what could be described as quite erotic ones as well but this story mainly concentrates on the budding romance between Claire and Theo. No mechanical limbs here or augmentation but instead Frankenstucts biologically engineered with amazing abilities but the way they are treated is vile. As for the sexual content well Theo does enjoy exerting control both within and indeed outside the bedroom but it never felt forced or abusive. Claire is learning to finally live and relishes the lessons from her new lover as she explores her own submissive side. There are a lot of sexy scenes but I felt the BDSM was quite mild although the equipment and locations were highly inventive! I loved the supporting characters and sincerely hope the author revisits this world as there's a certain Dankyo who is very intruigingFour and a half from meI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CV8IL5CQJA1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141TS3DG#wasThisHelpful","R2CV8IL5CQJA1X","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Marta Cox said: "" I've recently discovered that Celia Kyle who writes such fun shifter stories also writes sexy sci fi under the name Erin Tate. What's really funny is I'd read a couple before of them before I realized. So it was with much glee that when asked if I wanted to read this story I most definitely said yes please!Our story begins when a small girl decides to run away from her mum but as there's traffic around its probably not the best idea! Vanessa is distraught with worry for little Tabby but luckily a rather large Ujal warrior steps in and saves the somewhat precocious child. Erun the fierce Ujal believes Vanessa to be an unfit mother and wastes no time in making his opinion known but things are about to get worse when Tabby turns out to be a stolen Ujal child!I'm loving this series about this mermen type race of aliens who have arrived on Earth. It's hilarious how they struggle with our customs and ways. These big tough guys have no idea how to handle women but it sure is fun seeing them try. Our hero Erun has a very dark past and truthfully no reason to trust women so his actions do fit his character. Vanessa whilst a loving mother appears to me to be little too trusting and easily duped but I can say no more as it would reveal a huge plot twist.A well thought out story. Quite funny at times and even though it's a sexy one no instant getting jiggy so it worked very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UR0O5MSTAXSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013RZCJZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2UR0O5MSTAXSY","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well if you enjoy raunchy vampire stories then you are in for a real treat with these books. Such entertaining stories and always with wickedly sinful plots. M.s Roane truly paints a picture with her words and this paranormal world( or should that be realm?) Is a joy to lose yourself in.Looking for strong males? Happily I can tick that box. Feisty heroines youwould happily change places with? Well that's covered too. Ok these characters occasionally might be a stubborn but you just know the incendiary romance will all be worth it. Now just add an evil Fae to the plot who schemes her way through totally uncaring who gets hurt and you just know there's going to be action and obstacles aplenty.

"Oh my yet another story that firmly pushes any and all boundaries. If there is a taboo anywhere in the world then it appears to this reader that Ms Jay is determined to find it and let her characters grind it into dust! This book is not for those seeking sweet romance but if you are prepared to need numerous cold showers whilst rushing back for just one more chapter then this hot instalment is for you!The Guardians of the four realms are facing all manner of problems. They constantly fight the minions of the evil trio born to Apollo and his sister Artemis, it's their duty to protect humanity , one of their own is in a magical coma , Hades son has gone missing and to cap it all Conn has finally scented his Mate! He had hoped of course but never in his wildest dreams did he realise just how hungry for her he would be.Dacia knows she is an Immortal but like her family has tried repeatedly to locate more like herself but to no avail. Now she's determined to be of value and not just as her sisters housekeeper and to that end she's found herself a home and a new mission. What she hadn't expected was for a sexy wolf to just appear and pronounce her his Mate! The attraction is insane but he refuses to touch her. Dacia's body needs him so much but can she trust him? Just who is this Immortal and what exactly isn't he telling her?Love your heroes to be totally alpha , tall, pierced with tattoos and hot? Then allow me to introduce Conn. Except he's not the usual dominating bonehead no he's far more wily than that. He enjoys the chase ( well he is part wolf!) and he has watched his fellow Guardians almost succumb to the madness that the mating frenzy causes. Then of course there's the simple fact that Dacia is pure,innocent and has his inner wolf howling ! No Conn is about to seduce this female and boy is she a lucky lady!Such an amazing series that simply goes from strength to strength. If you love paranormal and are quite partial to some serious hot loving then get these books. In this particular one there are two words that describe it perfectly ""extended foreplay""! Ok you might need a minute to digest that and no doubt rub ice upon your neck or something because Ms Jay has her hands on the thermostat and it's set to maximum! The story arc continues to grow with action and mystery but we still are waiting for more answers . Sleeping Gods aside there's trouble as that thoroughly evil Elizabeth excels herself here and of course the poignant truth about the female Guardians and just why Brianne acted as she did but it's an ongoing situation so I need the next book! On the plus side for me this passionate and possessive couple don't share so finally I get the mating ceremony that I want!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK79MLSHR7KJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NZ8F392#wasThisHelpful","RK79MLSHR7KJD","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A new series from this author who has previously entertained with hot alien romance and even dominant billionaires but as far as I know this is her first foray into a full length cyborg romance and what a doozy it is! From the first pages it's obvious that this futuristic world is a violent one where unspeakable atrocities occur and this author does not shy away from the darker elements . That being said this story is about hope and how no matter what you face anything can be overcome .Ok so yes there's a lot of sexy elements in this book and right from their first scene together Rage and Joan share much more than just a handshake ! Rage has reasons not to trust the humans and even though he starts to see more in Joan than he expected his refusal to trust her absolutely has truly dire consequences . Joan believes in the Cyborgs and wants nothing more than to serve and help protect Rage but the prejudice she suffers is off the charts! Her fellow humans behave in a way that leaves me with no words as I hesitate to ruin this book for others but warning this author goes into the darkest place in humanity but fortunately does not wallow explicitly.Can I believe that Joan loved Rage? Yes absolutely because he doesn't abuse or mistreat her in any way and in point of fact they clearly do bond. As for Rage and his fellow cyborgs I loved their interactions and it allowed the author to add humorous elements to the story. So a winner for me because I do enjoy a sexy cyborg romance but more importantly the first of what could truly be an excellent series and I'm definitely onboard for more!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYKIN18GIKES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOL1DRO#wasThisHelpful","R1QYKIN18GIKES","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happily admit that I devour any book by this author and always want more! Ms Roane writes very sexy vampire stories and this spin off series is a delight to read but these stories are very short so please be aware of that fact. Nevertheless this author gives us strong interesting characters with a darn good plot to follow and of course sensuous scenes to awaken the readers own desires!This story does have an unusual beginning in that human Charlotte and Mastyr vampire Willem are on their first date. Further more not only is it their first date but the opening scene is when they have both gone back to Willems home and are about to take their new relationship to a whole new level! Yes expect to be literally thrust into a lusty scene but it's one with consequences ! This passionate couple bond which is the very last thing Willem wants. Now luckily he's friends with the troll Davido ( a much loved character in this series) but when he arrives to advise it's only to discover that Charlotte is a rare blood rose! How is that possible when she's human? What will Willem do now as his past history prevents him from feeling worthy?I'm really enjoying the latest turn the author has taken and whilst previously the stories focussed on evil Fae and wraith/ Invuctus pairs it's been an eye opener discovering the workings within the nine realms. In this book we learn of the Realm Investigative Unit that seek to bring the worst criminals to justice but there's also a realm university that educates both human and paranormals alike. This really brings this series up to date as initially I thought the books had an almost fifteenth century vibe to them at times as we only seemed to see inns and bakeries .This couple are truly tested and it's an emotional story. Willem is in danger of losing Charlotte forever with the choices he makes. A well written story that pulls the reader in and leaves me wanting to read more. If you are new to her books and love very sexy vampire stories then I heartily recommend her Men in Chains series. Although no matter what she writes it's truly original and hot!I was gifted a copy of this in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6H7E9URA0I6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6HHU8O#wasThisHelpful","R2L6H7E9URA0I6","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first book by this author but definitely not my last! I thought Ms Stark did a great job in this new urban fantasy series and her fresh approach really paid off. If you are tired of vampires and shifters and maybe demons too are beginning to pale than this series that features the Arcane world associated with tarot cards might just appeal .Our heroine is Sara and she has the ability to find and retrieve anything using her tarot deck to help her. It's a dark world she lives in with psychics being kidnapped and their organs harvested for black magic rituals . Sara is determined to help save as many as she can but this job working for Armaeus aka the Magician seems set to pit Sara against the Vatican and that's not a war anyone wants ! Ok so go into the Vatican , find a stolen box and bring it back now that shouldn't be too difficult. Oh maybe there's the slight problem of the devil to contend with but hey all in a days work right?Oh boy where do I start? This was fast paced and a very strong beginning to a series that's going on my wish list. I liked the feisty heroine and she seemed fearless at times. I imagined her as a cross between Indiana Jones and Lara Croft as it didn't matter what was thrown at her she ruggedly stumbled on. The scenes in the catacombs really stood out and I could picture it easily in my mind . There is definitely chemistry between Sara and the Magician but can he be trusted? Those of the Arcane like the Magician are described as demigods and they do seem to have remarkable abilities. To say more here would ruin the book for others but in this world not everything is quite what it seems. Sara is tough but she is also compassionate and she certainly goes on a Wilde ride ( pun intended!) .

"Well the unthinkable has happened and the secret of shifters is well and truly out. Humans now know that werewolves walk amongst them and it's up to the Packs to blend in and try to cause as little upset as possible. Humans often fear that which they don't understand and now the Redwood and the Talon Packs are both firmly in the spotlight.Brynn is an alpha female whose life has been all about protecting those weaker than herself. Her father cruelly abused her but she has survived and now fate seems to be a evil taskmaster as Brynn has met her Mate only to discover that he has no idea her wolf yearns for him.Finn is heir to the Redwood Pack but having been broken and gone through a near death experience struggles to hear his own wolf. Refusing to let that get in his way he will happily put on a brave face and go out trying to help put the humans at ease but the female they partner him with is anything but friendly ! No Brynn is downright hostile even though it's obvious she's not immune to Finns charms. His wolf may be quiet but his senses ( and nose!) work just fine! They might never be friends but would it really hurt to scratch a mutual itch? Things are getting dangerous though as the wolves seem to have targets painted on their backs!Ms Ryan has written what I can only describe as a heart stopping romance. Yes there's a lot of sexual tension between the lead couple but they have both had difficult and troubled pasts which still impact on them in the here and now. What really stands out in these books is the authors ability to let her readers catch up with the extended families. Constant trials await these characters and it's a story arc that continues to keep growing with shady politicians and even witches added to the mix. As for this story it's chock full of passion I admit but there is a truly harrowing scene that shocked this reader. I never know what to expect from this author but one thing I guarantee is an emotional ride that pulls you in and leaves you suffering with the characters.

"My first book by this author and it's a novella so shorter than I prefer but I thought it would be a good way to test her style. Yes I still seem to be on a sci fi kick and indeed this book features a planet of cyborgs but they are at war with some beast like aliens called the Rahl and as the story begins I can't help but think I've missed some back story.Axton is the Prime on Centax and until recently he was held prisoner by the Rahl . Abused and tortured he never gave up but his rescue was nearly too late. The soldier who initially found him is Xenia, second in command of Centax security but she's a woman with a secret. Xenia is not the dead unfeeling cyborg everyone believes no, she has emotions and right now they are all over the place! Axton is desperate to recover an old Earth artifact that the Rahl stole and Xenia is on the case but thrown together and in danger things start to really heat up.Ok so yes I've come to this series a little late and I'm guessing the world building has already been done but I easily followed the storyline here. There are not many characters but that works due to the brevity of this tale . I'm not sure that it felt right to read about the cyborgs sexual education and if honest I thought it truly repugnant but at least Axton is a forward thinking guy. Axton has realised that his brother is a much happier and more fulfilled male now that he shares his life with a female . Cyborgs are not expected to feel emotion but sometimes it's a driving force that we all need. Axton is determined to explore this thing between himself and Xenia but first there's the tricky problem of actually surviving!So forbidden love that luckily finds a way. We have a down to earth hero and a heroine in denial. This was well written with a simple plot but lots going on. Not many authors seem to feature female cyborgs so this was a rare treat for me . I enjoyed reading about Xenias enhancements and thought the author showed great imagination and I would read more by her but perhaps a hopefully longer book next time in order to give me a more satisfying look at this world the author has created.I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PBWKX29JOXJG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RAXNHYQ#wasThisHelpful","R2PBWKX29JOXJG","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oo catching up with the Paladins was lovely but I must point out that this is a novella and not a full length book. That being said I've missed these larger than life characters with their mission to save the world and this romance featured one or two of those delicious warriors who have entertained this reader previously. For those new to the series the Paladins are a breed who for centuries have felt called to guard the barrier that exists between Humans and the Others, an evil race but the Paladins are not exactly the run of the mill humans but something more . I've no wish to spoil the fun but trust me when I say these mighty warriors offer out of this world skills!So where does Emmett fit into this world where there's a secret war going on? Well fifteen years ago he was sent to prison as at the time he could not prove his innocence due to his remarkable healing powers. Fast forward to present day and the true culprit has found God and confessed to his sins which finally sees Emmett being offered his freedom and liberty but not before two mysterious males show up offering him a job. Emmett is not sure of their motives and what they reveal seems preposterous so he thinks thanks but no thanks and happily manages to get work tending bar. A freak accident takes Emmett to the clinic where Jana works and she awakens all his protective instincts but exactly what does an ex con have to offer?Ok so not as long as I usually prefer and if frank it's not really a leap forward in terms of the Paladin story arc . However what this short story does offer is a believable romance that builds up allowing these likeable characters to really shine. Jana may be slightly out of the dating game but she knows what she likes and has no hesitation in letting Emmett know it. Which is handy really as at times he needs to be told a thing or two. Don't misunderstand me Emmett is lovely and not shy exactly but very much aware of how others might perceive him. Of course he is passionate but his aggressive side really worries him and as he comes to care more for Jana he will do anything to protect her no matter what the cost!I adore paranormal stories but this was all about the romance and I loved it. Well written with just enough of a tease to make me want more from these guys.

"My first book by this author but I've seen her books recommended and in particular her Solsti Prophecy series and I now realise that this spins off from those books but I found it very approachable and had no difficulty in quickly immersing myself in this world of demons.As the story begins Ria is in a magically induced coma as she has been seriously injured and it was feared she might not fully recover . Arawn is the leader of this band of Lash demons known as Watchers and he's pretty much stretched if honest yet he constantly finds the time to sit by Ria's bedside in the hope that she will recover and wake up. Drawn to her and yet knowing full well as his subordinate even if Ria did want him Arawn would never take advantage .Ria slowly but surely pulls herself out of the darkness that grips her , Led by the sound of a voice that constantly commands her to wake up. When Ria opens her eyes it's to find her leader Arawn sitting at her bedside and boy is he a sight for sore eyes! Ria has for many years found Arawn fascinating but he lost his true Mate and has never sought to replace her. Yet Ria cannot help but notice Arawn is just as aware of her as she is of him . Sparks fly but Arawn is keeping a dark secret and it's one that would rock the bedrock of the Watchers. Oo this had a lot going on. First there is obviously the sexual tension between the two leading characters but we also have very interesting supporting characters and I cannot wait to see how the next book plays out because , no I cannot say because that would ruin this one. What I can say is Ria has a very protective brother and a really funny sister in law.  There is more going on here than just a romance as there is a mission to find something that has been lost a long time and I loved the authors idea of what going undercover could actually mean! It made for a very interesting plot and was told in a way that held my attention. Do I feel I've missed out by not reading the previous series? Yes if honest but this worked very well as a standalone and now I have a new author to hunt down. Action, romance, humour and a cracking story.

"I saw this cover and instantly was curious about what these two authors could bring to a genre that if honest sometimes seems a little tired. I do enjoy paranormal romance but finding a unique vampire story that pulls me in is getting much harder. This book started in a completely different manner as the heroines husband Dalton is dying but he manages to leave her a message telling her he will always love her. Flash forward about eighteen months and Elsie is a vigilante going out at night to destroy the monsters that killed her husband Dalton. Elsie is grieving and cannot come to terms with the loss of her husband but her life is about to take a huge turn when she comes face to face with what is perhaps the biggest monster out there!Zander is the Vampire king and leads his warriors against the demons ( or skirm as they call them) who prey upon the humans. A chance meeting between Elsie and Zander arouses his suspicions that maybe she is more than just an ordinary human but he is truly shocked when he discovers that not only does she blame vampires for her husbands murder but that Elsie is in fact his Fated Mate! How can Zander convince her that his vampires are not the soulless bloodsuckers she imagines and more to the point when can he claim this woman who completes his soul? Elsie is tormented by her feelings but cannot get past her guilt . Yes Elsie is attracted to Zander but does not want to betray her late husbands memory so where does that leave them? I guess sometimes purgatory is something we create for ourselves !This is a tough one to review for me as I liked Zander and his delicious Scottish brogue but couldn't quite believe how he acted at times. One minute all dominant and passionate but then he would stand by and allow his warriors to get close to Elsie and ok he might growl a bit but that was about it. He just felt so very different to the usual alpha male although admittedly i did like seeing his more gentle side . Elsie hmm well if frank I thought she was a bit of a tease. Yes I know she's hurting but come on she's a grown woman and well aware that yes, no, maybe, no is just not how to treat anyone let alone a guy who clearly needs her! i admired her fighting spirit though but just wasn't impressed by her leading Zander on at times. What I did like were the fun loving warriors and there's quite a lot of interaction with them which clearly sets up for them to have books of their own . Frankly they seemed a little too playful at times and I'm amazed that Zander didn't react more because these touchy feely guys were all over Elsie like a rash! Playful puppies came to mind but as a first book that's setting up a series I can forgive that and just hope to see a little more action next time and slightly less pool time!I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP0I7QS9OZMUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI7PAVG#wasThisHelpful","RP0I7QS9OZMUS","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book in this series that is sci fi capture romance but with an erotic edge. I must start my review by saying although I've seen comments about BDSM this is primarily a love story with tender moments and a surprisingly humourous hero. I feel some may be put off by the idea of master and pet but hasten to reassure fellow readers that nothing could be further from the truth . This is a sci romance series like none other and the author takes chances that are certainly paying offStom is our hero and as the story begins we learn just how heinous the crimes of the Bak-Lal are and it sets the scene for what's to come down on Earth. Stom is a Preyfinder and is in a dark place having lost the family he cared for to the enemy. He's intent on revenge and death but as a reward for his service has the opportunity to claim a human female as a pet. Stom cannot bring himself to replace his dead mate and has vowed to take no other female but is prepared to at least make it look as if he is cooperating knowing he will not follow through.Willow has no idea that she is already infected with a deadly virus although she's well aware that she has seriously riled a local gang member . Stom comes to her rescue one night when she is attacked outside where she works but Willow has no idea that he has slipped her a drug that could alter her and turn her into a very horny woman indeed! Right from the start Stom tells Willow that he is an alien and although she would like nothing more than to let him have his (hopefully) wicked way with her his sanity is an issue and Willow is very confused. Stom knows the danger Willow is in and tries to persuade her to leave but Willow has responsibilities and decides to stay. That decision proves to be a bad one and as Williw and Stom meet again it's clear that something tangible is between them. Now I'd like to say that they all live happily ever after but there is the very real threat from the Bak-Lal and it's getting a lot closer . Stom may not want another female in his life but we Humans can be quite challenging and Willow is well and truly something else!I commented on a lack of world building in the first book but thought the simple idea of showing just what could happen to beings taken over by the Bak-Lal really helped to expand the whole idea. I had trouble previously seeing the Preyfinders as good guys because they seemed perfectly happy to destroy whole planets so to have so much fleshed out here at the beginning of the story was truly enlightening. This is a sexy story but for me the highlight is Stoms growth . He goes through so much angst and pain and yet he really is a sweetie . His comments had me smiling as he fought to get to grips with pop culture and I was truly convinced by the romance that played out. Stom may not want a pet but he's certainly happy to explore ideas and Willow is perfectly onboard with that and more! Willow is never a victim in her dealings with Stom but she is indeed a very happy participant ! I am loathe to say too much more about the plot but will state that if you enjoy sci fi or paranormal romance then I think this series is something you should look for. For this reader the third book is a must read but I'm a little apprehensive as these aliens have Gods and the next story features one loud and proud!As I write the first book is free on kindleI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EOPTTPQTNLLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K4IYUC2#wasThisHelpful","R2EOPTTPQTNLLP","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved these books featuring the princes who reside on a planet far away and are searching for that special woman who will connect with them and their birth crystal. In exchange for access to their planet the Divinity corporation provides willing brides but not is all as it seems. Several of the females are there to escape their tangled lives and do not really expect to get married . These books each feature a different prince and his bride but they all connect and give different points of view enabling the reader to get a much wider picture.

"This is yet another extremely erotic read from this author who clearly has the most vivid imagination! Yes these books should indeed carry a warning because hot and sweaty times abound. This time it's the Immortal Dorian who has found his Mate but his past haunts him and he has absolutely no intention of claiming her because in doing so Dorian would be sharing all his memories and secrets.Rain is a mortal whose family have chosen to live in the Tetartos realm and since first seeing Dorian at her friends wedding  he's all she can think about. Problem is he looks like he hates her and Rain has no idea why . When Rain starts showing signs of the ""Mating Frenzy"" it's feared that she is bound to one of the evil acolytes who recently kidnapped her but no it turns out the source of her misery is much closer to home and it's the one male who keeps trying to avoid her it's Dorian!Dorian has reason not to trust females but he was such an arrogant and rude armpit towards Rain! Accusing her of just wanting to share his immortality. Now the reader knows that if he would let his past go Dorian would make an awesome Mate  because he is just so protective. Luckily Rain is made of stern stuff and no matter how much her body might yearn for Dorian she stays strong. When things come to ahead and they both realise that maybe they should take things further it's still not quite a done deal but Rain is never bitter and her quiet determination really impressed this reader. Although I confess it was Dorians possessive nature that really gave me qualms.I wanted more plot if honest and although there are some action scenes and one in particular that had consequences that will reverberate as this series continues I felt something was lacking. Yes we still get to see the ""bad guys""but I have a sneaky suspicion that the author mght try to redeem at least one of them. Sexy times dominate the second half of the book with dirty talk and interesting scenes involving water. So if explicit reads are not your thing then this book is not for you as believe me you could not just flick through the odd page to avoid them. Having said that I am enjoying this series and wonder just what will happen next. I believe it's Conns book up next and he's a lovely wolf shifter so I'm onboard for his bookI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25P9SF4DMDQYO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDWN1GE#wasThisHelpful","R25P9SF4DMDQYO","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now fans of this author might just recognise this story as it's previously been published under the title Whipped Cream and Handcuffs but clearly Ms Walker wasn't quite satisfied and has revisited her characters to flesh out their story and indeed their motivation. I hadn't read the previous short story so went into this with completely fresh eyes.So seemingly Tessa has it all, challenging job, good looks, home of her own, great friends and the almost too perfect fiancé . I say almost as Tessa is discontent with his controlling ways and feels kind of restless . It doesn't help that her gorgeous best friend Caleb keeps telling her she's making a huge mistake and there's also her mysterious admirer who keeps sending her very naughty messages!To be frank Caleb has loved Tessa since he met her aged four but she only sees him as a friend. Caleb is a former Seal home from war and wounded but he feels it's time to act on hs feelings and stop letting life ( or in this case Tessa) pass him by. What follows is a very sexy story filled with heart that takes these two people to the very edge and then we watch them plunge head first into what could be a beautiful thing. Tessa has needs and boy is Caleb keen to help her feel fulfilled. My only slight quibble is the end as it seemed quite abrupt but guess when the story is told it's probably right to leave something to the readers imagination.I was gifted a copy of this in exchange for an honest review","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH6V7GQT0BYED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011ANG9C8#wasThisHelpful","RH6V7GQT0BYED","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So here we are back in the world of a Swat team composed of werewolves! Sounds completely preposterous and yet this author pulls it off with aplomb. I would expect the intensity of that job to bring out the worst in them and allow their inner beasts to come to the fore but no, these disciplined and highly motivated guys do an amazing job . So why on earth are they put in a position that might compromise all they have worked so hard for? Forced to take on a token female as it looks better for the police department because heaven forbid it should look like they actively discriminate against women Team Commandert Gage sets out to recruit someone he has had his eye on for a few months. A woman who just might fit in with his team becase she too is a werewolf!Khaki has been having a hard time lately . She's ditched her douche of a boyfriend but he's part of the old boys club at the station and nobody has her back anymore. Ok Khaki can deal with that but when a traumatic rescue leaves her injured she starts to experience all kinds of strange things . As for the Swat team leader offering her a job and then dropping the bomb that she's a werewolf, well Khaki is not too sure about that but it's too good an offer to turn down and a chance she has to take.So here's Khaki trying to prove that she is more than capable of holding her own amongst a Pack that are naturally cautious. Luckily most seem friendly and Khaki's hard work and dedcation quickly impresses her new team mates. Now I said most because Xander who is running the team she's with seems remarkably distant and almost downright hostile. Problem is he just smells so good ! There's a part of Khaki that wants to take that man down to the floor and well here's where you use your imagination because Khaki sure is using hers! Yes Xander is mighty fine but Khaki has a job to do and distractions cost lives. The last thing she needs is for everyone to know how turned on by Xander she is but with werewolf noses that might just be out of her hands!This the second book saw the author giving her readers far more background into the life of this Swat team. A lot of the book is centred around the training they do and just what Khaki has to go through in order to become a fully active member of the team. I liked seeing her hold her own but fear not there is action within these pages and Khaki gets to fully utilise her new found abilities. As for the romance, well it's a slow build up but boy do this couple finally get to grips with what's between them. Perhaps not the most suspense driven story by this author if honest but I still enjoyed this book. If you enjoy shifter books then give this series a go because Ms Tyler seems to have found a completely fresh approach fuelled by action and passion that just works . I like her covers but I'm a little undecided by the heroines name here but it's not one I've seen used before so maybe kudos for that.Four and a half from meI was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L3GSSDIJ4QTE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UTWFVBM#wasThisHelpful","R1L3GSSDIJ4QTE","A34B6NBZL1IRNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34B6NBZL1IRNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well this was a very short read but just so funny. I'm not usually a fan of light frothy romances but have to confess the sheer enjoyment I got from the situation in this book totally surprised me. Paige is having a bad day, by that I mean it's just going downhill so fast you can imagine she is jet propelled! First off a job interview goes badly wrong, then she finally meets her fated Mate but is in no condition to cope with all that entails , keeps shifting unexpectedly into her inner ferret and to add insult to injury nearly gets run over!Werecouger Archer has decided to do something positive about finding himself a Mate because hey if his younger brother Holt can find his then it should be a breeze for Archer. First stop the M and M Mating agency and what do you know there she is! Just one scent of the rather cute little ferret and Archer is on the hunt but she doesn't seem that keen! No no no Archer is not giving up and will use every trick in his arsenal to find her and when he does he just isnt letting go no matter what or who gets in the way!Poor Paige has never quite mastered the art of keeping control of her ferret and keeps shifting spontaneously. Sometimes it's just a few whiskers but then there's the other times when her fight or flight mode kicks in and yep small and furry rules the day! Her family are embarrassed by her and she is so tired of blundering awkwardly from one embarrassing situation to another. Now she's being hunted by a very persistent cat and you know what there's just something so sexy about this fiercely protective and patient male. If only Archer didn't keep setting off her ferret and then there's the tiny problem ( oh who am I kidding? Huge problem!) of the most interfering family on the planet! Mates are fated but families come first, don't they? Or do you get to make your own family and if so could werecougers ever accept a ferret or will they eat her?This book was short, funny and had a happy ending . Yes it's sexy but it's not a book that just focuses on the erotic aspect and it was the storyline and the trials of the couple that kept me happily turning the pages .

"Step into the world created by Ms Heaton where the fine lines drawn between Heaven and Hell seem to get more complicated with each book. Having survived a near Apocalypse you would expect things to quieten down for a while but no those original fallen still have one or two tricks up their sleeves and right now it's the Devil himself who they plan to trick!Lucifer is having a really bad day and when that happens it's probably best to stay well out of his way as heads will roll ( or explode or whatever takes his fancy!). Mihail, the only angel who might have enough fire power to kill Lucifer has dumped an unconscious human female right outside Lucifers fortress. Now Lucifer is a wily chap and certainly no pushover but the temptation to discover just why the woman is there is one he cannot resist. Besides what could one weak mortal do to him and if she is a trap then the consequences for her will be severe. Nina, the female in question awakens with no idea where she is or how she got there but the beautiful male who offers her shelter is a conundrum as one moment he is caring and then the next a much darker side seems to appear. He is charming, charismatic and yet somehow a danger to Nina and she's determined not to let her life go to Hell again but is she too late!Lucifer is the ultimate bad boy and yet here we are surprised by his vulnerability. As the original fallen angel he has suffered atrocities and yet somehow found the strength to rise up and claim his place as the much feared King of Hell. He has feelings for his daughter Erin ( who is a fabulous foul mouthed badass heroine) and is in awe of his grandson Dante. Yes it's fair to say that this book showcases his personal growth but he is not weak, no just another tortured hero that Ms Heaton so cruelly loves to play with. Giving him Nina as a heroine allows the reader to see his depths and at times it's quite sad learning just how trapped by his circumstances he really is . Nina for me was just a little too trusting far too soon but I think that's just what Lucifer really needed.Ok now for the bad part, I really didn't connect much with the first half of the book because nothing really seemed to happen . Both main characters spent far too long being introspective and constantly seemed to be working things out in their heads. Yes self analysis is all very well but I just wanted something to happen. Luckily about half way through this story a fight ensues which is closely followed by a passionate scene and from this point in it felt much more like the type of book I normally associate with this author.If you enjoy steamy romance with a hero who is more than a little messed up and want action then this series is a must read. Good versus evil but not always in the way we imagine. These books are imaginative, hot and full of twists and turns with characters you will love.

"If you have read any of the previous books in this series then like myself I feel you will be pretty stoked to see this world starting to expand. We have seen the mastyr vampires find their Blood Roses and for the majority of those tales the author has featured those masters' who have control of one of the Nine Realms . In this book it's not a Guardsman but a Detective who is our hero and what a fine and noble one Yolen makes. He is determined to protect the woman he loves and so just sees her on Fridays but Brianna wants so much more. Her need for Yolen is soul deep and whilst she has no wish to stifle him in her opinion it's beyond time to take their relationship up a level . One fateful Friday night well and truly sets the cat amongst the pigeons when another Vampire pays attention to Brianna and no matter how much she loves Yolen she can't help but feel drawn to the master vampire Keynes! Oh what a mess but why is it happening?I really liked this book and usually I'm not that impressed by shorter stories but this book really added new depths to this series. I loved that Yolen is a Detective and he's hot on the trail of a drugs king pin type person as it brought a more realistic dimension to the plot. Yes there is still a war going on and the blood thirsty Invictus wraith-pairs are still on the offensive but this interesting story allowed Ms Roane to show that even vampires make very human mistakes sometimes! Yolen is misguided but his intentions are good. You know what they say about relationships , communication is key and that delicious male has a lot to learn! Brianna knows her own mind and is prepared to make hard choices and I loved that about her but the final chapter and Yolens actions had me melting .

"This is the first book in a new series and I enjoyed it. I've not read anything by this author before, so I have nothing to compare it with as far as writing style of previous books, but except for a few small typo-type errors, the writing and editing were professional. I felt that the author used this book really to introduce the characters and their conflicts, rather than to have a complete story per book, because the main characters are just starting to have a relationship and do some character development when the book ends in an almost  cliffhanger-type fashion.My biggest issue with the story was that very few issues raised have been resolved, all of the principle players are in a state of unrest and the author moves on to the next book (which is, coincidentally, not free). This is not to say that there isn't plenty of dramatic tension, action and adventure to be found in this volume; everything from blizzards to kitchen surgery to wolf attacks and death in the family.  Fortunately, books 2 & 3 have been published and are available, so readers don't have to wait.There is violence, some mild profanity (along with some creative cursing- ""son of a whorish turtle"" was my favorite), and some kissing and discussion of sex, but no sexual scenes, so it's a pretty clean read. I liked some of the characters after getting to know them a bit (Dr. Becky and Dr. Slate), and was a bit baffled by the changing personalities of several others (feuding siblings Amelia and Ronan), but I'm not sure if I care enough to keep reading the series.Heat factor mild.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R327DFAVM619JJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5HXP9I#wasThisHelpful","R327DFAVM619JJ","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this great story from an author who has not disappointed me thus far. Professionally written and edited, the book is built on strong male and female lead characters {the female quite rightly being a bit smarter and more stable than the male ; ) }, but also peopled with a terrific supporting cast of characters, great dialogue, an interesting plot and a surprising villain complete with nefarious plans. While I enjoyed the storyline of the leads, Jack and Merry, I liked Merry more as a person until near the end, but I always loved their motley crew of protectors and teachers. There are many Shakespearean quotes woven into the story because of Cluny and Clancy, once traveling actors turned nursemaids and beloved parental figures. Jack's friend, Kipp, Viscount Willoughby, proves an interesting and loyal friend as well and the next book in the series is about him- ""Someone to Love"".There are some married sexual scenes in this book, three I believe, but they are not terribly graphic. There is some violence and some mild profanity and a lot of creative uses of Shakespearean descriptions of worthless people ( scullion, rampallion, fustillarion, whey-faced loon). 4 1/2 stars.Heat factor moderate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21O6TQOP7DE56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIKKNGC#wasThisHelpful","R21O6TQOP7DE56","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well written, well edited historical romance. I enjoyed the storyline of a young man, Alistair, who has been in love with a slightly older lady since he met her just before her wedding to another man. Jessica also thought him interesting and attractive, but was happy with her husband until his death from consumption six years later. After her year of mourning, she decides to take a trip to clear her mind, and inspect the sugar plantation that her husband willed to her. The ship she books passage on is owned by Alistair, who jumps at the chance to be able to spend weeks on a ship with Jessica, finally getting to court her, but also help her if she needs it since he owns the neighboring plantation.This author is known for the steaminess of her books and her historicals are no different. While the scenes are well written, I sometimes think that the characters' explorations of their sexuality within their relationships often overshadows any other plot devices. In this story, Jessica, Lady Tarley, is a widow who goes to see the sugar plantation that her husband left her in his will. Much is made of this being an unusual bequest and of her wanting to make independent decisions about the property, such as whether or not to use slaves or to free them and pay them a wage, whether to sell it altogether, etc... but once she arrives on the island, all we read about is her love affair with Alistair, and never again is the plantation or it's decisions mentioned. We are told that they can talk about anything and know all each other's secrets, but readers are privy to far fewer conversations than sexual encounters.The other component of Jessica and Alistair's love story is a common history of poor self esteem and a belief that they are unworthy of love. Jessica grew up in a home, even as the daughter of a Marquess, where she was physically and emotionally abused; Alistair where he was emotionally abused. Their love for each other finally allows them to feel secure for the first time. Even though Jessica was relatively happy with her first husband, she always felt the need to behave in a very ""proper"" way or risk losing his approval. With Alistair, she can be herself and Alistair feels he's finally got someone who loves him despite his past mistakes. Jessica's sister, Hester has a secondary storyline and there are domestic and sexual abuse issues within it as well. (A heads up for those with trigger issues.)Overall, I liked the characters and the story. I don't mind some steaminess in a book, but I prefer character development and plot over a multitude of sex scenes. 3 1/2 stars.Heat factor hot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V1RDT1SOF1FU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J41PCXQ#wasThisHelpful","R2V1RDT1SOF1FU","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the queen of well researched, authentic regencies, this book is a delightful story about a disillusioned rake and the minor gentry distant cousins he decides to assist out of boredom and a need to irritate his sister. The title character, Frederica, is the oldest of the five siblings and has run the family since the death of their mother many years ago. Although the family solicitor kept the estate out of court until the eldest son reached his majority after their father's long illness and death, Frederica has always handled the estate and the younger children and the oldest brother is happily off at Oxford. The middle child, Charis, is extremely beautiful, sweet and kind (if not very bright), and the family has come to London to give her a season and a chance to find a husband. Upon arriving in town, they find that the aunt they were counting on for an introduction to society can't help them because her husband is extremely ill. The only other relative that their father talked about was the rakish Marquis of Alverstoke; their mother was disowned for marrying beneath her so they don't know any of those relations.The plot revolves around the relationships between the characters, not just the Marquis and Frederica, but the way the whole family interacts with each other, and how they interact with the Marquis. Also, there are interesting dynamics within the Marquis' family and friends. There is a lot of characters development throughout the story and the reader really gets to know the characters well. The writing and editing are excellent. There is never any straying from the time period in descriptions of locations, dress nor in dialogue. This is a clean read, there is only a hand kiss and an allusion to an embrace. This is a very nice story, but contains no real antagonist or villains, which lessens the tension and excitement levels of a story IMHO.Heat factor mild.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T8OR6Y36JC9H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00348UN3Y#wasThisHelpful","R3T8OR6Y36JC9H","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this well written and well edited regency romance. The main characters are a divorced couple, which is an unusual plot angle. I liked what was revealed about the Duke and former duchess, but didn't feel as though the author explored them deeply enough for me to become really attached to them. I felt that the best character was the Duke's younger sister.A few things didn't quite ring true to the time period such as: the speedy divorce wherein the two parties involved never once met face-to-face and the third named party to adultery never gave testimony or appeared in court; the Duke printing his private business in the newspaper voluntarily; and the former duchess being turned out with no marriage settlements at all-not even her dowry returned to her-even in the case of divorce (although I suppose it is possible).There are sexual scenes, some violence and some mild language insulting to women. 3 1/2 stars.Heat factor hot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYUUH5XF3GBQH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009979I76#wasThisHelpful","RYUUH5XF3GBQH","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This prequel to a new series is well written and well edited with realistic characters who are struggling with some issues in their relationship. Having started their relationship off with an unplanned pregnancy, they weren't on a firm base of a solid romance and security in their love for each other. The passion and closeness that Ian and Carrie once felt has been stifled over the years under the daily struggles of making a living, caring for their two children, paying the bills and all the every day things that take time away from togetherness.  With things reaching a breaking point, can they save their marriage?This story contains sexual scenes but no violence or profanity. 3 1/2 stars.Heat factor hot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UCKSEU4E8WLB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENW9J9Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UCKSEU4E8WLB","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is the first in a series about a group of former military specialists who now work together as ""good guy"" mercenaries as the Titan Group. The story is well written and well edited into an exciting, chase filled, shoot-em-up plot, with a romance mixed in. The damsel in distress, psychologist Mia Kensington, turns out to be able to hold her own against drug cartel goons and former SEAL / Titan member, Colby Winters.There is a lot of coarse language and violence in the story, along with sexual scenes and some planned sexual violence. There are also some surprisingly deep family ties between the Titan members and some interesting aspects to both Colby and Mia's lives that give the story some depth and perspective. Overall I enjoyed the fast pacing of this story and will seek out other books in the series.Heat factor hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A54CT73X25CJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FCZC2KE#wasThisHelpful","R3A54CT73X25CJ","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book which was well written and well edited. The characters were complex and interesting and had good development and dialogue. The plot had some intriguing twists and turns along with a not-too-evil villain, so there isn't any violence or profanity, but the book still holds the reader's attention until the end.The main characters are the secretly radical Robert Blaisdell, Duke of Clermont and the supposedly quiet country miss, Wilhelmina Purseling, who has her own secrets and scandalous past. The Duke, his cousin and his bastard half brother, lefties all, earned themselves the name ""the brothers sinister"" while at Eaton together and those gents make a good supporting cast in this story ( and the heros in the others of this series).  There are sexual scenes in this book, but only very minor violence and no profanity. I enjoyed this book and look forward to others in the series. There is a prequel to this as well, involving the previous Duke of Clermont and the origin of Robert's half brother.Heat factor hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13B6HWYSTGJKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AKKGX4W#wasThisHelpful","R13B6HWYSTGJKA","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book. The writing was excellent and editing professional. The plot was character based, there were no truly evil villains, but the development of the multiple romances and their complications were what drove the storyline.  The author did a nice job of character development as well, making them believable and understandable people.I loved Miss Jane Fairfield with her horrible dresses and outrageous conversation! She was a very clever, warm hearted person dedicated to protecting her younger sister from charlatan medical practitioners. Oliver Marshall was an excellent hero as well. He was very quick to see beneath Jane's game, but it took him longer to see how she could be his match. I do love a man who can outwit the would be bad guys and admit that he was wrong to a woman!There are several sexual scenes and mild violence described in this story.

"I very much enjoyed these first two books in the Vinlanders' Saga, along with the bonus short story which the author cleverly incorporated as the prologue to Book 3, even though it originally appeared as a short story. The writing is excellent and although there are one or two typos, the editing is professional. The characters are interesting and the plot is well paced, there is a enough of the magical to make it a good fantasy, but nothing that throws the book into the realm of the unbelievable. (You know how that goes... and then a miracle happens, and they all live happily ever after....) No one character is perfect, they all are believable as people and come with good and bad traits. No character ever gains a huge amount of power or changes into a messiah-like figure either. Very nice.Celia Montrose is a 911 call center manager in Tucson who also has a great interest in Native American art, just as her mother did. She's managed to get the location of some petroglyphs through various sources and goes with a guide to photograph them, intending to keep the location secret so they won't be vandalized. When they get close, though, her guide refuses to go any further, insisting that he will wait for her but won't go where ""the spirits walk"". As she goes into the narrow ravine to photograph the fantastic petroglyphs, Cele feels that something is wrong, but before she can leave, the petroglyphs start moving, a rainbow appears, and she wakes up in a desert at night with stars that don't match any constellations she's ever seen before. Dressed only in shorts and a t-shirt for a day hike, with only one water bottle left, Cele almost dies of exposure before she's found by a group of soldiers who are, of all things, Vikings.Cele discovers that this world she has somehow been sent to is called Alfheim by the Vikings who were sent there almost a century ago by their gods Baldur and Freyr and they still hold to the ways they had when they came to this land from what they called Greenland in Midgard. Also living in this land are the Native American looking Tewas, whose art looks like that of the Anasazi, live in cliffside homes and who have been in this land longer than the Vikings, also brought over on a rainbow bridge during a time of great hardship by their gods. The third race of people in the land are the Elves, for whom the Vikings named the land Alfheim. There are many types of the fey, but they rarely interact with humans. The light elves are good and helpful and made a bargain with the gods not to interfere or directly harm the humans. The dark elves hate the humans and do not necessarily keep to this bargain.Book 1 deals primarily with Celia finding her place in this new world and society. All of the Vikings have developed a ""talent"" since coming to this world: finding water, seeing great distances, stoneworking, pathfinding, etc... As Celia develops a relationship with the man who found her, the Jarl's son, Lord Dahleven, she also develops a talent for finding things, a talent someone will want to use for ill.  Book 2  deals with the Jarl's second son, the second in hierarchy to the jarldom and the priesthood of Baldur, Lord Ragnor. There is, of course, much more to the story,  many adventures, lots of Viking and Anasazi lore, along with battles, romance and magic.Both stories were very enjoyable and I went on to read book 3. The author did a great job of world building and character development and I look forward to more stories set in this world. There are sexual scenes and violence, (and also for those with trigger issues, attempted / threatened sexual assault) but no profanity.Heat factor moderate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZDXQJ3TVRHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G96FW84#wasThisHelpful","R3BZDXQJ3TVRHF","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first thing I have to say is that this book needs an editor. Although the dialogue is meant to sound like that of a 15 year old, it is strangely stilted by the odd absence of contractions in conversations. Also, the author has many misspellings and incorrect grammar usages within the story, along with the occasional incomplete sentence.The plot follows mainly Maddie, a 15 year old sophomore who is dating Ben, the 18 year-old senior that she was tutoring. They have a birth control failure and an unplanned pregnancy, but are supported by her mother (herself a single parent) in raising the baby. His parents throw him out for this decision and he moves into her mother's pool house, working and paying some rent while being there for Maddie and going to school. Maddie's cousin, Allison, who is the same age and is like a sister, is also pregnant and dating Ben's best friend Chance.The author gives a realistic account of some of the issues facing teens who are pregnant-social stigma and peer isolation, inability to stay in school due to physical complications, medical complications, increased risk of multiple births and increased risk of cesarean delivery. Although having been an OB-GYN and Labor and Delivery Nurse for many years (and the mother of 3), I felt she may have laid it on a bit thick with the physical misery. The author also throws in some serious emotional trauma during the pregnancy which further complicates things for Maddie, and for Allison as well. There are Christian themes throughout and no sexual scenes. Maddie remains sure that she will reach her goals of completing high school and going to college, despite raising children, so I appreciate that message.Overall, the book could use a good realism and editing overhaul, but I think the author has a well intentioned message. This is a clean read, no sex, profanity or violence.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28S5ZTUZ1K3KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0080ZWR8K#wasThisHelpful","R28S5ZTUZ1K3KU","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is difficult to really establish characters in a short story and I just didn't get a good sense of the depths of the main characters previous relationship nor the reason for the heroine's continued deep resentments and cynicism.

"I'm a big fan of Kieran Kramer's historical romance novels, but this is the first contemporary romance of hers that I have read. I received a free copy of the ebook version as part of a contest by the publisher through Book Reviews and More by Kathy, with no obligation to review this book.I liked this well written, well edited story which had interesting main  and supporting characters, especially the H/h's siblings with varying degrees of Asberger's syndrome, which the author dealt with sympathetically and humorously. The hero and heroine were both complex and well rounded characters. I especially liked the way True found her own voice and confidence as the story went on. The plot was character driven, there were no mysteries, just the story of developing relationships, but there is more than one romance in the book.I enjoyed the story of two people who were friends as children but separated by her parents because the boy was from the wrong side of the trailer park. True Maybank was raised on a beautiful estate to be a Southern belle debutante and had her duty to her family name and history drilled into her as long as she could remember. She was expected to marry the son of the neighbor family and unite the two most important families in town. She dutifully dated Dubose Waring, the golden boy quarterback. Secretly, she cherished her childhood friend, Harrison Gamble, with whom she had spent so many happy hours until her parents forbade it when she was 12. On the night of Senior Prom, Dubose acted like a real jerk and left with another girl.  Harrison crashed the prom and True left with him and they spent the night together. The next morning, Harrison was ready to set off for Nashville to pursue his dreams and he asked True to come with him. When she chose to stay and follow her plans for college, it broke his heart (and hers), but she couldn't disappoint her family or leave her sister.Ten years later, True sees Harrison on the way out of the store where she has just picked up her wedding dress. He's a huge country music star and he's come home to see his brother and look for some musical inspiration. True's parents died and she never finished college. Harrison Gamble is now a household name and a multimillionaire. She has had to turn her beloved gracious family home into a U-pick farm in order to have a business and sell off all the antique furniture just to hold onto the property. She does all the work herself with help from teen labor and her teenage sister, whom she's raised since her parents died. She's finally supposed to marry the man her parents wanted her to marry, even though he dropped her when they died. Dubose's now an attorney and is promising her financial security after they're wed. Harrison is shocked to find out that the tables have been turned and just how far. He realizes that all his songs have been about True and he wants to win her over before she gets married to that stick in the mud Dubose.Can the singer charm the proper lady into becoming the girl she used to be in just a month? And what would it mean for his career if he settled down? Can he really make that kind of commitment, because True is a settle down, put down roots kind of girl?

"I enjoyed this book which was well written and well edited. The author does a nice job creating a feeling of being on a ranch in the west in this 1800's. The characters were interesting and likeable and they had complicated secrets in their pasts that were slowly revealed over the course of the story. A lot of time was devoted to character development and relationship growth between them. I really liked the way the author handled this, no instalust to be found. The plot was fairly character based, following their relationships, until the end when some intrigue and danger are added in to bring the story to an exciting finish.

"I enjoyed this story, the first I've read by this author. The story was well written and only had a few editing errors, mostly spelling issues and punctuation problems, but not enough to detract from the story. The plot was very good, the author kept the suspense going throughout the story and keeping interest right up to the end. The characters were complex and interesting and do a lot of development during the story.The author did a good job establishing a sense of place in describing the small town in Alaska and it's interesting inhabitants. These supporting characters lent an authenticity to the story and were welcome additions to the story. Rene was very brave to concoct a plan to leave her violently abusive and controlling husband and to try to get her young children to a safe place far away from him. Her sister, Maddy and her brother-in-law were very supportive in helping her with plans, new ID, lining up a job and transportation, etc...Maddy even posed as Rene on a plane with her children to be a decoy. As a volunteer at a battered women's shelter, Maddy had these resources available to help her sister. But when her enraged brother-in-law came after her looking for his missing wife, Maddy got a taste of what it was like to be abused. She had to hire a bodyguard, was forced to stay at home after being run off the road, and essentially became his victim as well.Meanwhile, Rene and her son and daughter were learning how to laugh, make friends,.relax and sleep peacefully. They were gaining confidence and learning how to love. Rene felt useful as a teacher and part of a community. She also felt empowered by learning to shoot a gun for self defense. They didn't know what lengths her husband would go to find her and what payback he planned when he did.This book contains a sexual scene, some profanity and violence.Heat factor moderate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z984X8H8Z8I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00758KQ22#wasThisHelpful","R1Z984X8H8Z8I7","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting premise for a book and the first in a series. I enjoyed meeting the characters that form the core of the small group of friends who grew up together and around whom the series is based. The author lovingly describes the scenery of the ranch land of Montana and the life of a rancher/cowboy and one has to assume she has some knowledge of the subject matter. The plot is a bit quirky. Several of the friends are known for playing elaborate practice jokes on each other and it's Rob's turn to pay Ethan back for a really embarrassing one. Their other two best friends just keep tallies. I liked the main characters, they were real and likeable people. Even the bad tempered women mellowed out by the end of the book. I am looking forward to reading more books in this series.One night after his parents died and his fiancee left him when she discovered the extent of his debts, Ethan got a bit drunk at the local bar and began expounding on what kind of woman it would take to ever get him to propose to anyone again. Rob taped this drunken rant on his cell phone, edited it up nice and pretty and posted it on YouTube as a rancher looking for a bride. Because Ethan is a technophobe, he had no idea, but the other 3 musketeers were in on the joke. They got over 200 responses to the e-ad and the three friends picked out a wife and bought her a round trip ticket to Montana, not telling Ethan until they were at the airport. He's stunned by the beauty who gets off the plane, she's not a stuck up, high maintenance city girl, but a natural and nice person and he can't just put her back on the plane.Autumn is the second of 2 daughters of a highly successful single mom who has high expectations for her children to never be dependent on a man. But Autumn is struggling to make it as a writer for a magazine in NYC, and hasn't ever felt like she measured up to her mom's standards. As a last ditch effort to save her job, she answered the ad for a wife on YouTube hoping she could get a story out of it. She and her best friend exaggerated her skills when they made her video (although she really does secretly want to get out of the city, loves to cook and wants to have children) and she was shocked when she got chosen and that her editor accepted her story pitch. Autumn is bowled over by the ruggedly handsome cowboy who meets her at the airport, he's not the rube she expected.For two people starting a supposed relationship under false pretenses, there are some serious sparks flying when they first meet and start to get to know each other. Neither wants to tell the other that it's a joke, so they give it a month to get to know each other. Whose secrets will come out first? Whose past or present problems will be the straw that breaks the camel's back? Can something like this really work in this day and age?This book contains sexual scenes and some profanity.Heat factor hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZT6IYCVUZYD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJJ91VE#wasThisHelpful","R37ZT6IYCVUZYD","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read this book a week ago and found that something bothered me but I couldn't put it into words, so I read it again. I am a big fan of Julia London's and I  really wanted to love this book, but there were some niggling things that maybe shouldn't have bothered me so much, but like something stuck in a tooth, they did. Details, details....I read a lot of historical romance and regency romance in particular and there were a few things that were missing that I just couldn't overlook. Where was Honor's maid? When she was sneaking out of the house and getting up to all kinds of mischief, there is never a mention of any maid. In fact, for the household of an earl, only one maid is ever mentioned and that is their mother's. Honor never rides out with a groom in the park, nor has a maid accompany her shopping. No young woman of a ton household would have been able to get away with this. It just isn't done. Also, her dresses are mentioned in great detail several times and she would require assistance to dress.The next thing that bothered me is that Honor calls, unaccompanied again, on a single gentleman's house in broad daylight on several occasions. She even remarks that his home is surrounded by old women of the ton who would love to gossip about it, but somehow, no one ever mentions any of her visits. None of the neighbors in Mayfair saw a crest marked coach drop off one of the most popular young women of the social set at his door? Really?The other problem I had was just that the book was pretty sexual from the get go. For being an innocent miss, George talks to Honor  in a very bawdy way, using words he would never use to any other innocent young woman. The liberties she allows him, I know are supposed to show their great attraction to each other, but instead I felt it showed George in a bad light for taking such liberties with her, and more than once. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude, but I think it was too much, too fast. And for being a bastard himself, one would think that the man who was rejected by his royal sire would practice some safe sex and not risk any more little unplanned babies. Just a thought.Now there were things that I did like about this book. I really liked the family relationship between the Cabot sisters and their individual personalities. I even liked their older half brother in his own bumbling, clumsy way. I liked how the truth about her mother's motives came creeping up on his fiance Monica and how it changed her perspectives. I loved how the whole family tried to protect the girls' mother in her confusion and descent into dementia. And I liked Honor as a person who did her very best to try and solve her family problems, even if it wasn't a very good plan. I didn't find her to be spoiled or selfish, just a little desperate. I liked George for being a man of principle and trying to stop Honor at first, and then for not wanting to take a wife if he couldn't support her, even if he was unnecessarily cruel in the means he chose to employ.The last chapter of the book shows us Grace in an uneasy situation, so I look forward to reading the next book also. I have great hopes for it, because, as I said, I am a fan of the author and rarely am disappointed with her work.Heat factor hot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q7TSE764T0XX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778457#wasThisHelpful","R1Q7TSE764T0XX","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this story, the first time I've read anything by this author, and found it to be well written and well edited. The main characters were likeable and interesting and the plot complex enough to hold my interest through the entire book. The supporting characters were also endearing and infuriating by turns and rounded out the storyline well. The villain actually was a surprise to me, and that doesn't happen often in romance novels. My only complaint would be that sometimes the dialogue was very formal, as if it came straight out of a Jane Austen novel, and sometimes it would be more modern in tone, but that is a minor style notation that didn't detract from the story itself. I will be looking for other titles by this author. There was only mild sexual content, profanity and violence in this book.Heat factor moderate.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U7X8M5LM33JB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6VG5QM#wasThisHelpful","R2U7X8M5LM33JB","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great read and a new twist on a zombie theme! I'm not a decaying body parts/ brain eating zombie theme fan, but this one looked interesting and I am so glad that I picked it up. The story is well written and well edited with complex and interesting characters and a fast paced plot with enough intrigue to keep readers hooked to the last page. Jesse is an excellent heroine; sarcastic, scared, emotionally vulnerable, brave and loyal. She is a fully realized character, but one who can continue to grow as the series progresses. There are several other main support characters; Ally, Lane, Gloria, Garrison and Brinkley who are also well written, but not as fully fleshed out as Jesse, though they'll be around in the next book for more adventures, I'm sure.I loved this new take on the zombie theme. I'm sorry, please don't call them the ""z"" word, they're necronites, the 2% of the population that spontaneously regenerates itself after death,(unless beheaded, of course). It's this group of people, many of whom never realize their status, who in this version gave rise to the vampire legends and other spontaneous resurrection stories. When the government discovered their existence, they were put into the ""protective custody"" of the military, which meant all sorts of testing and experimentation to see if the perfect soldier could be created and what types of deaths needed how much regeneration time, etc.... When the public outcry over this treatment allowed them to be set free, many hid their status. Now some of them are employed, like our feisty heroine, Jesse, as death replacement agents. Some of the soldiers and others that the military experimented on became A.M.P.'s (please don't call them psychic) who can foretell someone's untimely death from non-disease causes by interpreting the magnetic resonance fields and disturbances in them -essentially visions. If the person has the money and desire, they can employ a necronite to be with them at the time of death and to die in their place. The necronite then regenerates for a few days and goes on with their life, as does the client. Unfortunately, the government has recently changed to a much more conservative party and all the churches in the country united under one gigantic doctrine, promising no more religious infighting. ""The Church"" is very powerful and it hates the necronites who may disprove their Savior's resurrection, and actively campaign to kill them. In the book, the author deals not only with Jess's experiences as a death replacement agent, but also with a bigger political power picture and some complex plots are set up to start emerging.I look forward to reading the next book in the series. The book ends with a wrap up of the action from the story, there are no cliffhangers, but the stage is set for the bad guys to step back into Jess' life and it's a good starting point for the next book. There are some mild sexual situations, some violence and some profanity in this book.Heat factor moderate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29UUX5Q5JBBVN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRIAA84#wasThisHelpful","R29UUX5Q5JBBVN","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this well written story with Cinderella elements mixed with some heavy Pride and Prejudice influences. Although the villains are original, the favored younger stepsister strongly resembles Lydia Bennett and the stepmother, Mrs Bennett. The reserved hero gives a slight nod to Mr Darcy and his younger companion, Mr Bingley. The disapproving close relation (Lady Catherine) role is the hero's sister, and the earnest, pompous, silly suitor-a faux Mr Collins is there as well. The heroine herself bears a good deal of character resemblance to Elizabeth Bennett. In the Cinderella theme, the hero's godmother becomes the heroine's fairy godmother as she and the heroine's grandmother are the best of friends. The three ladies have been corresponding since the death of the heroine's father and her aborted come-out season five years earlier and the older ladies are well aware that the stepmother dotes on her own daughter and doesn't particularly invest any thought in her stepdaughter.Although there are all these ""borrowed"" elements, the author still manages to make some interesting characters and an entertaining plot which was original enough to keep my interest. There are no sexual scenes, although some is alluded to, and there is mild violence.I rated this 3 1/2 stars, but rounded it up.Heat factor mild.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FYTNHVXAQSEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009FCWF8O#wasThisHelpful","R2FYTNHVXAQSEV","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this novel, the first in a series, which was well written and well edited. The author does a good job of establishing a small coastal town that's growing due to it's proximity to NYC, and the feel of the characters who live in small towns and on the water. She also does a nice job incorporating food and a couple of chefs into the story.(I was so hungry while I was reading!) The main characters are interesting people, very different from each other in their personalities and backgrounds, but both wanting the same things in their lives.The supporting characters are also colorful and I have a feeling they will play parts in other books in the series. My only criticism would be that the romance seemed very fast and smooth, hardly any conflicts for the H/h once they got past initial hurdles. I'm not suggesting that an author torment her protagonists unduly, but a bit more tension does make for a more interesting plot. I'm looking forward to reading more books in this series. There are sexual scenes in this book and some very minor violence, but no profanity. 4 1/2 stars.Heat factor hot.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMQNZ2ZX1D4O5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HGWY6LO#wasThisHelpful","RMQNZ2ZX1D4O5","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I haven't read anything else by this author, but this story was well written and well edited. I felt as if I had been dropped into the middle of a series, though, with this story. There were a lot of family members and neighbors introduced into the mix without having any real exploration of their relationships or characters and a lot of family history referred to and alluded to, as if there were other books exploring these themes. It made me feel as if the story could have been much more fleshed out, but wasn't. I would have liked to have learned a little more about the history of the H and h but it is never fully explained, just that they dated some. The details of the h's first marriage also are alluded to as being terrible, but very little information is given.There is considerable time spent on exploring the sexual attraction between the H and h and how this makes the H angry with himself, and some time spent describing sexual encounters that, while steamy, didn't really add all that much to the story line. IMHO, the author would have been better served to explore her characters and their relationships and family history a good deal more which would have made a more substantial book and much more entertaining story with well developed characters and an interesting plot, rather than trying to keep it bare bones and throw in a bunch of sex scenes.Heat factor hot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQQBBAQNK37J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HO5G0Y#wasThisHelpful","R3IQQBBAQNK37J","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second book in this author's ""sister"" series deals with the older sister, Lindsey,  who was raised by her father, the General, to be the perfect daughter. She did not see the abuse her younger sister was subjected to and thought that she was just ""wild"".When she finally realized what was going on, she was instrumental in helping expose what her father had done to his younger daughter and convict him. In striving to achieve the perfection her father demanded of her for his approval and in her grief over her perceived failure to protect her sister, she set herself up as the perfect pawn for her husband to use for political gain.This book deals with very difficult issues of domestic violence and abuse and the terrible toll it takes, not only on the psychological health but the physical and financial health of the victims as well as the strain on all of their relationships. The story is not a comfortable, cozy read and it's not meant to be. Lindsey, however, manages to find a little wiggle room in her husband's iron control over her, and though it costs her greatly, she also manages to find a little bit of herself, and struggles, with lots of help, to finally be her own person and get free of the monsters who had taken everything from her. There is some sexual violence in this story along with other personal violence and profanity.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0QHZ4CCDK0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HY3HN7E#wasThisHelpful","R1E0QHZ4CCDK0H","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this story, but it had some gaping plot holes that I had a hard time overlooking. Stephano Jacob Coulson Notte was told about vampires and the whole nanos and society and turning options, etc when he turned 18 and basically found out that his entire family were vampires. He freaked out and started thinking of them as the monsters from the horror movies he loved to watch, refused to be turned and basically rejected his family. When he was fatally injured years later, his boss and close friend to him and his family turned him to save his life but like an ungrateful brat, he ran away and began using his middle names-Jake Coulson. He went into the bodyguard business in Canada. When his aunt Marguerite Argeneau, called and asked him to guard a friend for 2 weeks until her divorce was final, he couldn't say no.  He couldn't find a way to get out of it even when she told him he was going to have to pretend to be a cook/housekeeper and not mention the bodyguard business, because the young woman didn't believe that her ex was trying to kill her.When Nicole was told her family friend Marguerite had found her a cook/housekeeper, she was relieved. She was behind in her painting and really needed the help. She was shocked when Marguerite arrived with a handsome young man. When suspicious activity continued to take place, Jake was very worried and called in his human partner for  reinforcements. Of course, Nicole and Jake are very attracted to each other and Jake can't read her thoughts, one of the signs of a life mate. When an attempt to kill nearly does in Jake, the family arrives and the person behind the attempted murder had better watch out!My problems with the plot were with Jake's lack of research into the ex's whereabouts or money use, passport activity, etc. If he was such an experienced bodyguard, I would have expected him to do a little basic research. Nicole was certainly busy with her painting to give him enough time. Also his explanation to Nicole on being a life partner and going through the change was really sketchy at best. I did like that the family members were altogether, laughing and giving Jake/Stephano a lot of grief. It was good to see some zingers coming from Dante and Tomasso, they're usually such badasses and the muscle, not the comic uncles.There is sexual content in this book and violence.Heat factor moderate.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P7GXLI0SE7CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEFQB9Y#wasThisHelpful","R1P7GXLI0SE7CB","A7AO0PBCKSW82","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A7AO0PBCKSW82?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I laughed my head off at the antics of Tank the pug with the Napoleon complex and the visual of Grace trying to find him in the ocean...

I sympathized with Josh not wanting to give up his father's dream, but being completely overwhelmed by his life.I enjoy the secondary characters that make Lucky Harbor a town in this series and that pop up in different books.

"This worked well for a few years, so for the price and getting 3 years worth of operation out of it it's not a bad deal. Mine was used inside to light a garage. The reason it did not get 5 stars is because the LED light actually gave out before I even had to change the batteries.

"Updated review: Had to drop this to 3 stars. Because this unit has only a 7 to 7.5 hour water supply, it has a nasty habit of running out of water before I have gotten 8 hours sleep. That alone is not a big issues. However the built in alarm that goes off to warn of the low water level is loud enough to wake me. So now I am left to try to figure out how to make sure the limited water supply does not run out before I get my sleep. Not fun.Original review: This would have received 5 stars except it is advertised as a 10 hour humidifier. In reality it runs 7.5 to 8 hours max at it's lowest setting. On the plus side it has an automatic shut off so running out of water doesn't cause any problems. Haven't had it long enough to talk about slime build up, I'll update on that in the months to come. It does look easy to clean, and does not have any parts like filters that need replacing, another big plus. It is small but I set it on my headboard on low and it makes a huge difference in sleep quality. I find it quiet. I'm a light sleeper and the motor is very quiet. The only real noise is a gurgling sound as it draws more water every 10 minutes or so, but that has not woken me up once, and again I am a very light sleeper. It does have a night light, but that can be shut off through the settings, without that on it is not even as bright as a cable box.The Good: Priced under $30, easy to maintain, will cover a bedroom, automatic shut off, no bright lights unless desired, 3 year warranty.The Bad: Made in China, does not last 10 hours even on low; more like 7.5 to 8 hours.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16X75ZZBACPWJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009COIFAC#wasThisHelpful","R16X75ZZBACPWJ","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Almost had to give this 3 stars, but fortunately I read the description carefully before buying. It does indeed say it has 2 programmable valves and one manual. I wanted 3 programmable, but they don't seem to make them. At least I knew what I was getting so...5 stars. Very easy to program, had the whole thing set up in less than 5 minutes, including the time it took me to toss the unread instructions to the side. It's been hooked up for 3 weeks now and is working without a hitch. I have it place in a covered bin buried in the yard so I does not have direct contact with rain, but is exposed to humidity, insects, and dust(sand). Seems to handle the weather fine. As with any electronics, I would not recommend placing this in a location fully exposed to the elements, you would probably shorten its life expectancy dramatically.It has 3 valves and all work fine with no noticeable drop in pressure from the 3 way split.

"What a bargain! My grill heats up just fine, as long as you let it preheat for 20 minutes. If you do that you get a sear top and bottom. If not, you get lumps of gray cooked meat. It will comfortably hold 3 good sized burgers or 5 burger chain with clown mascot sized ones. I even made cheese burgers with it and the melted cheese stuck to the burger not the grill. How awesome was that?! Anyway, here's what I found:Good: A nice size for a 1 or 2 person meal. Non stick plates are very non stick, and seem good quality, especially for the price.(check the price on one ceramic pan and tell me I'm wrong). Super easy to clean, but based on experience with other ""dishwasher safe"" non stick surfaces I'm not trusting it to my dishwasher. Cooked a good sized burger to med rare in under 3 minutes after it's heated up.Bad: 20 minutes to heat up not 8 as instructions say. Don't trust the stupid lights. As other reviewers have hinted at they may work and may not, and if they do work, they may be reversed. My unit both lights come on when plugged in and the green light goes off when heated up. That's the opposite of the way it should be according to the instruction. Humorous, but not a huge issue. Tends to flatten burgers out. Since the lid is on a floating hinge it cooks more evenly, but that does allow the lid to put more pressure on burgers, so they do flatten out while cooking. Not an issue with steaks or sandwiches.Overall it was just what I expected, and I love it.

"My wife has Seborrheic Keratosis which are brown raised scales here and there. They tend to spread and grow if left uncheck...which is of course what she did. Anyway after searching online I found out what it was and saw that this type of peel works as a potential remedy. Bought the 30% and it seemed to be working, though a bit slowly. So upped it to the 50%. Worked much faster.Now here's the problem. Be careful. When it goes on it will itch. If you scratch, bad things happen. At least they did for my wife. (to be fair she has VERY sensitive skin.) We tested it as directed and there was no problem so I applied it to he problem areas, not paying too much attention to limiting it to the scales, so I did hit the surrounding skin. (Naturally this makes what happened next all my fault). After a week I noticed that everywhere she could have scratched, she had done so, and with quite a bit of zest( still not her fault...all mine). So now she had large brown areas all over the scratched areas. They looked like bruises. And on her back when she couldn't reach there were also brown areas but they were limited to brown dots where I had applied the product. It appears that the product has caused over pigmentation where applied. Especially where the 50% was used. Fortunately I did not do her face.Anyway, it did get rid of the Seborrheic Keratosis patches, and with the help of some whitening mask the spots are fading. Again, not all the products fault, my wife does have VERY sensitive skin. But do try this on a small area for a couple weeks first, you patience may well be rewarded.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26U8NSX3F01GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLENWS0#wasThisHelpful","R26U8NSX3F01GR","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been buying these for 2 years at Walmart, now that I am boycotting Walmart I will try to get them at Walgreens. 2 years ago I was suffering from back pain and tightness whenever I spent more than a half hour on my feet. I went to a foot specialist and she recommended custom orthotics, though she wanted me to go to a specialty shop. I went to the machine at Walmart and the testing sent me to the 440 Dr Scholls. I bought them and almost immediately after use my back pain improved. Now I can walk for several hours with no problems. They last about 6 to 12 months of continuous wear. When the pain starts coming back I know it's time for a new pair. I would recommend anyone with back pain use the machine in most Walmarts and Walgreens to diagnose your feet and buy the product indicated. It's only about $50 and could help solve your problem. It did for me.And now to bash some of the negative reviews:I get so sick of people who use product reviews to review suppliers. If you don't like the price or service of a supplier please review them. Product reviews are supposed to be about the product.And to the reviewer Matt who is negatively reviewing this product in order to promote your own product with a link to your own website. What does it say about your ethics that you have to stoop to a smear campaign to try to generate sales? You pretend to be dissatisfied with Dr Scholls yet you have reviewed 14 of their products pretending to have bought them all...you are dishonest and not that smart. Why not do things like the other competitor Perfect Fit and just price them much cheaper and make the same claims.So anyway sorry for the rant but I couldn't understand why these only had 3 stars until I read some of the 1 star reviews.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35K8K3RQ3F2SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004G7LRJG#wasThisHelpful","R35K8K3RQ3F2SP","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Updated review: Have owned a year and 2 months now and still very pleased with this product. My review and rating remain unchanged. A definite good buy.Initial review:If you're looking for a sprinkler to target specific areas, or aim at certain spots, to avoid wasting water this is perfect. I have 2 trees about 15 to 20 feet apart and this has a setting that shoots 2 streams of water in opposite directions, so I was able to sit it in the middle and adjust the flow rate till it landed right on the trees needing watering without wasting water on the surrounding area, which is mostly sand. Before, I had to set a sprinkler under each tree and let it dribble out, or water about a 500 sqft of sand to get both trees.The sprinkler has a bunch of other settings as well so it's perfect for landscaping arranged in tightly bunched areas, or in odd layouts.My only complaint would be the unit's ultra light weight. It is all plastic and weighs practically nothing, so your hose has to be straight and the the sprinkler flat on the ground or it might tip a bit. Still wasn't worth losing any stars over since there are few sprinklers out there that don't have to be placed with care, and for the price...well this one is great.I wouldn't recommend it for large areas there are other sprinklers much more suited for that, but this one says it's for small to medium areas and specialty applications, and that what it does.So 5 stars and a highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DLFC4VF6O05K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SDW2#wasThisHelpful","R2DLFC4VF6O05K","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Updated review. I have owned the sprinkler for a year and 2 months now and I am still just as pleased with the product as I was when first reviewed it. No changes to rating. Highly recommend.Initial review:Wow this is a GREAT sprinkler. I'm on a well and the water pressure fluctuates a lot. This sprinkle has great range allowing me to reach all 3 or my Orange trees at one time. What a time saver. Great construction, mostly metal. Definitely worth paying a few extra bucks for.I've tried 3 arm sprayers - the pressure had hardly enough energy to turn the arms;I've tried spike mounted pulsating sprinkler heads - they were ok, but this product pumps more water further, and is 10 times more durable;And I've tried the standard oscillating sprinkler - they start off ok, but my hard water starts clogging the holes till it's just a pathetic 2 holed dribble machine.This product seems built to last. Highly recommend especially if you're looking to cover a fairly large area. It has the typical pulsating sprayer settings so adjusting the direction of spray is a snap, and it's heavy so it doesn't move or tip over.

After my initial dismay i went to a Best Buy and tried them in another player and they worked fine. Hmmmm what to do? So I went home and went through my PS3 setting and found out there was an update that had come out. After the update installed VOILA no more issues.

"I purchased this to cover a driveway gate about 280 ft from the window I had the base units sitting in. While the Defender unit started off fine, within a week I was not getting any detection from the sending unit. I had to move it to within 125 feet before it started working. At that distance it worked fine, so I gave it 3 stars because it worked, with a 2 star penalty for the shorter than advertised range.If you need a dependable longer range system i highly recommend the Skylink HA-434RTL Long Range Motion Alert Kit, which works great at the 280 foot range i needed. I have reviewed that product as well, and it is just as affordable.If you need a unit for mounting inside, or on your house, over a garage, or close to your house, this unit is fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X6G0966O7NV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004SBDQGM#wasThisHelpful","R2X6G0966O7NV6","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Updated review. I have now owned this for a year and a half. Still works great, and have not had to replace any batteries. Totally pleased with the range, sensitivity, and the volume of the alarm. I have a 2400 sqft 2 story home and can hear the alarm in every room if I want to. Still would highly recommend this product.Initial review: A few months before I purchased this product I bought the Defender AL101 Wireless Driveway Alert System. This Skylink product is MUCH BETTER. I purchased both to cover a gate about 280 ft from the window I had the base units sitting in. While the Defender unit started off fine, within a week I was not getting any detection from the sending unit. I had to move it to within 125 feet before it started working. This skylink system, on the other hand, has been working fine at the 300 foot range.It has 2 settings, high and low. At the high settings, on very windy days (gusts up to 50 mph) it was picking up tree movement about 20 feet away and sending false alerts. A quick walk outside to the detector unit and I was able to easily set it to low detection. This totally eliminated the false alerts, no matter how strong the wind was, yet it still alerted each and every time a vehicle or animal ( we have a lot of wild rabbits coming and going) went through the gate.It is a motion detector, so if you have a lot of animal traffic they will be detected, so plan accordingly when you set it up. If you don't want animals setting it off,set it to low, mount it higher, and adjust the angle of detection, all of which are outlined in the brief but informative instructions.I give this product my highest positive recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUIZ5843TOC8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CWK4JK#wasThisHelpful","RUIZ5843TOC8M","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This would be a great gift for a child(preferably girl). It looks delicate and cute but it is small. Most low rating reviewers must not have taken a ruler and looked at it before ordering. If they had they would have found the measurements are right, and if that is the case why give it a bad review for an accurate description just because you can't take the time to figure out what you're buying before you buy it? To me it's like ordering a pecan cluster then giving it a bad review because the piece of chocolate has nuts in it.Anyway based on the size I would limit this to kids, giving it to a spouse or girlfriend may lead to some awkward looks from the recipient while they try to determine how you decided to give this tiny pendant as a sign of your love.To clear up the size issue, the pendant, not including the clasp, is about the size of a pinky fingernail, and the stone is about the size of a small Hershey's chocolate chip cut into 3rds. It is small but it has a definitely cute appearance.I give it 4 stars because it is a fair price when you consider the chain is included, it is as described, and the stones appear real. One star off because it tries to pass itself off as a piece of jewelry for adults, and it's not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23OTFDYH0SYD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008FVHL4E#wasThisHelpful","R23OTFDYH0SYD3","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Updated review: My only initial concern when I purchased the razor was that it would not work when it was plugged in, so when the battery goes bad the razor is trash. Well I am happy to report that so far the battery shows no signs of deterioration, and it's been a year and a half since purchase. I would still highly recommend this razor.Initial Review:I love the feel of the grip and the look of this razor. The cut...well it takes a bit of getting used to. The instruction says it takes 21 days for your skin to get used to the razor and your razor to get used to your skin. If it doesn't happen they say they will take it back, I've had mine a week so far and have begun shaving at night so the razor burns have 8 to 10 hours to calm down before I go out in public. Don't get me wrong, it's not too bad and my lower neck has always been prone to redness from shaving. But so far it feels like it will take the whole 21 days or darn close for me to adjust. So if you buy it be prepared for the break in period. UPDATE: The 21 day break in period is over and as advertised the razor is no longer rough on my skin. I do believe however that the break in period is less about skin getting used to the way the new razor cuts, and more about the razor blades becoming broken in and less abrasive. Either way the result is the same, the razor is working great!On the plus side: It feels like it cuts really nice and close, and you can feel the blades conforming to your face, so it is as advertised. It's very quiet. It also seems to be a lot more gentle on your face if you shave everyday. I'm a bit lazy so sometimes I'm cutting 2 to 3 days worth of hair and that probably won't work with this little piece of equipment.On the negative side: It seems like you have to rinse it to clean it and I am used to just being able to shake the razor clean daily and a thorough brush clean weekly. Not this one. The hair seems to want to cling to the inside. I don't know but running my hard Florida water over the blades a few times a week seems like a recipe for disaster, what with the blades being $30 to $40. Another thing I don't like it is won't run when plugged in. I didn't know they made them like that. My last shaver ran cordless and plugged in so when the batteries gave out, as they always do, I used it for a couple more years as a plugin. Won't be possible with this, when the battery dies, it's useless.Overall so far the razor seems to perform as it claims, gives a nice close cut, cuts the hair instead of ripping it out, and is nice and quiet. So I give it 4 stars. On star off for not being easy to clean, and the 21 day break in period.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20Q3VUYPCW1JR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006GQYSC8#wasThisHelpful","R20Q3VUYPCW1JR","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Got this a few days ago when I ordered it from a black Friday deal(yeah so that offering was not a scam, some people did get one). It was a Christmas gift so I wasn't planning on opening it. After reading the 4 reviews for the product on 11/29 I decided I better open it and check it out...cause if it can go wrong, it will...that's my luck.Anyway, I opened the box with a fair amount of trepidation, and it was in there, so far so good. Next I unpacked it and plugged it in waiting for the blue screen of death, smoke, hard drive clicking, a total lack of activity, or anyone of the myriad of other signs indicating issues with the product.Well after holding my breath for a few seconds the machine started right up, went through its initial use procedure, got online through my network and is now being updated. PERFECT, works great! No ISSUES. Was just what I ordered and arrived as described. Now I can't guarantee it will still be working in a few months, but right now I am a very satisfied buyer.To address issues in other reviews:1) I bought it with windows 7, it came with windows 7, I didn't buy it for any windows 8 upgrade special so no points off there.2) Not repacked came new in a sealed box, no points off there. I must point out that one reviewer complained that no one checked his laptop to make sure it was configured correctly prior to shipping and another complained that his had been opened, so it comes down to how do you please everyone? Me, I want mine unopened please.3) A reviewer said his did not work, mine did so no points off there. Who knows maybe he forgot to hit the start button. This one doesn't automatically turn on when opened unless it's already been turned on...hey I've seen weirder things than that, like the guy who emailed brighthouse from his home computer to complain he couldn't get online from his home computer.Bottom line I have a working Dell I3 with 750GB hard drive, internet access, and it is a 15.6 in laptop running windows 7.

"This is not why I gave it 3 stars- that's below- I probably should have done more research before ordering. I was in a bit of a rush though after seeing them use cardamom on Top Chef so I just ordered the best deal I could find. Turns out these Green Cardamom are used in drinks, like teas. If you want to use as a spice get the Black Cardamom which is much more pricey.Still, had I known what I was doing, I would still only give 3 stars. As described it does take over a month to get these, they are shipped from India they say, however even by boat a month seems long. If you think you'll get them sooner than what they say...don't count on it.The main reason for the 3 stars though, is because inside the green pods(hence the name) are supposed to be a clumop of little black seeds. Well over 60% of the pods I got had clumps of little tan seeds. Not sure if they weren't ripe or just weren't cardamom. I do know that there are a lot of fake products out there, and with such a high percentage of the wrong color seeds, it made me doubt the entire delivery.With that doubt I can't justify a better rating. My advice for prople looking for Green Cardamom: Do some research, know what you want, and test different suppliers by ordering small batches until you find one that gives you all green pods that are all filled with black seeds.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B2UDIUSJTTNR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001VNP0Y6#wasThisHelpful","R3B2UDIUSJTTNR","A2FNBD43DEZPM3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2FNBD43DEZPM3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you've read the other reviews on this figure you've probably figured out the amazon has combined the reviews from an older release with this one. I don't know if this would be such a big deal, but apparently that older release came with a cape and this one most certainly does not.It does, however, have a tiny peg in his back along the fin that can be removed, and it looks like something will clip inside there -- I suppose that might be for an optional cape.I'll start by saying this a figure for collectors, not kids. That isn't to say this figure isn't well made, it is, but it seems somewhat delicate - particularly in the hip and shoulder joints. A bit of rough play would trash this figire. The plastic is fairly light weight - if I had one complaint, that would be it.Another reviewers says he hoped the figure would be larger, but doesn't say how big the figure is. For the record he's about 6.5"" inches, making Ultraman a bit taller than other Bandai Tamashii figures like Daft Punk.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F8B91JRRPLPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QR8X7M#wasThisHelpful","R3F8B91JRRPLPM","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initially, I hadn't planned on buying this Kei Yuki figure -- but I was so impressed with the Play Arts Harlock figure I ultimately decided it made sense to complete the pair.There doesn't seem to be as many pictures or videos of this figure as there are for Harlock. This makes sense I suppose, after all -- Harlock is the star. Anyway, this was a small cause for concern as I like to research these pricier figures before taking a leap of faith.My biggest beef with this figure (at first) was the ridiculous busom. Most of the women (and men, honestly) are lacking any real curves in the original anime, but I reckon modern tastes demand a D-cup. All things considered, the updated body type is still represented fairly well -- and at least she isn't bursting out of her uniform. I guess that's the greater concern in this -- that the uniform is still true to it's original inspiration. To any other Harlock purists or female figure collectors -- we've seen worse examples of 'enhanced' female icons in animation and comics.Unlike Kei's counterpart Harlock, her paint job consists of more than just gold trim and highlights. A concerted effort was made to give her uniform a 'sheen' that would resemble a shiny leather or polymer fabric. There are numerous tints and tones and apparently, this is where many of the complaints come from. I have read about globs of paint and even partial fingerprints marring the paint job. My figure is free of any of these types of flaws, so clearly I am one of the lucky ones. If I had to describe the overall look of the paint job, I would say it almost looks like automotive paint. It's a very cool effect.The joints are pretty good and fairly tight. The left wrist doesn't want to budge and I don't want to force it. It's undoubtedly the thinnest joint on the figure.She comes with two guns, two identical guns. This is worth mentioning because you'll notice that both guns have a peg on one side, the same side. However, only one gun can be holstered -- and holstering that gun can be a bit of a challenge. On her right side there's a tiny strip of gold trim that can be removed -- it's so well-hidden I don't know if I ever would have found it on my own. This is such an amazing detail and it's almost shocking the sculptors went to such lengths to disguise the hole -- it makes you wonder then why they provided duplicate guns. I can understand the practicality of using the same mold, but why not clip the peg on the one gun before applying paint details, if for no reason but to bolster the illusion this is a quality, highly-detailed figure..? Particularly since this figure originally retailed for around $100? Again, not a big deal but a little strange.Finally, my one solid complaint - her elbow pads. This is easily the most oddball design decision regarding this figure. For whatever reason -- perhaps to make her elbows appear more rounded while bent -- the figure features these sort of free-floating elbow pads. It's almost guaranteed that one or both will be rattling around loose in your box when it arrives. The figure has u-shaped hinges on either elbow, and the pad has a horizontal shaft on the underside. It clips into place fairly easily, however it also comes off easily. Too easily. I debated leaving them unattached & storing them in the box, but ultimately decided to glue them on. I'm detracting one star for this -- it's really just such a bizarre design choice, and rather than appreciate it -- I'd sooner detract from the figure's value and permanently attach these pieces.In my review for the Harlock figure I explain how my expectations were lower than low, and how I was pleasantly surprised. Play Arts Kai can really drop the ball sometimes, but in the case of these Captain Harlock figures -- I have to say they really did a good job. I think the quality is exceptionally high on both figures, despite some peculiar if not nonsensical design choices. Kei Yuki is slightly less impressive than her male counterpart, but is still a fine representation of the character.I have no remorse from buying either figure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLGHMR19FDWH5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO4MCHC#wasThisHelpful","RLGHMR19FDWH5","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought Guy and Thomas at the same time, although I used a marketplace seller for Guy. The box was apparently damaged, but since I was opening both figures I didn't care & the Monet I saved was nice.I was also on the fence about buying these. I suppose I had some lingering remorse about not buying the Medicom versions. Anyway, I read all the reviews about how people were saying they managed to break their figure minutes after first opening the package and was concerned. So, I checked out some up boxing videos to satisfy my curiosity.The first video was a sausage-fingered adult male manhandling these figures like they were made out of titanium. I figured if that doofus could be so harsh with these figures they can't possibly be *that* delicate.Now that I have both figures -- I can say that guy was LUCKY. These figures do not exactly instill a collector with much confidence. They don't feel cheap, but they don't exactly feel durable. They are fairly light in weight, and moving some of the joints feels risky. Pretty much any collector knows the feeling of trying to move a limb, it not budging, and then thinking 'better not chance it'.Durability issues aside, these do look cool. I think they're priced a little high, though.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W44E21A1VV6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWXG7LO#wasThisHelpful","R3W44E21A1VV6Q","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quintron isn't for everybody, but if you're familiar -- this track should suit you just fine.I started to notice a trend at his shows after Swamp Tech came out. ""Swamp Buggy Badass"" must have either gotten airplay on college radio, or maybe it was word of mouth -- but crowds at Q's shows started get larger and more boisterous, and all they wanted to hear was the driving beat of Swamp Buggy Badass.

"Lately I've been tracking down Savages' earlier singles and ep's -- the clear vinyl, the white vinyl and so on. I bought this primarily because I expect it's availability to disappear. This is a great band still relatively early in their career -- I want to support them, so if I can binge purchase their records I will. As for this vinyl, the 'embossing' listed in the description refers to the album cover. It's a nice design choice, but I confess I didn't even notice at first.

"I jumped the Cocteau Twins ship when they released Heaven Or Las Vegas, but have kept their older recordings alive in my heart these many years..And now there is this, which sounds very very Cocteau Twins, with an only slightly modern twist. It's very palatable, and  so if you're hoping this will hint more towards days long gone - you might be pleasantly surprised. Nothing stays the same after all, nothing lasts forever -- but this is a tiny gift of something long-faded from your memory.  You may find that nostalgia goes a long way.Anyway, I wanted to comment more on the vinyl release because the listed info is incorrect. It's two discs, Moon and Luna. Moon is on beautiful white vinyl and Luna is black. As you may have guesses, Luna is all the remixes you see on the mp3 version of the album.You also get CD versions of both discs, which is super nice. The packaging, in general, is very nice.

"I'll start by saying that I've been aware of this figure for months, and despite it being Harlock, it wasn't *my* Harlock, hero of my childhood. I know this figure corresponds with the movie released in Japan last year - and I can say this is a very faithful reproduction of that look, but at first glance I dismissed this as some new emo-style Harlock. Whatever.When I found the figure on amazon - and saw that it was selling for less than half of what I was used to seeing online - I went for it. If nothing else, I reasoned, at least I can say - as a completionist-psycho-collector - that I *have* it. Like, 'yeah it sucks but I have it' or 'whatevs, I got it on sale, I have it' - my point in driving this point home is that my expectations were beyond low.So when it came I was surprised to see, for one, that the box was so big. I have other Kai figures and was expecting the typical 9"" figure. Harlock is bigger, more like 10.25"".The crown jewel in my Harlock collection is of course the Medicom RAH figure. This Kai figure is quite nearly the same height. So, if you missed the  Medicom figure - this May not be a bad substitute for you.The amount of detail is stellar. Play Arts Kai make really nice figures, but even so - I'm willing to say they upped the ante for Harlock. The sculpt is over the top. It's truly, truly superb. That said, there are a couple design choices - I won't call them flaws - that detract from this figure being genuinely, mind-blowingly awesome.The first is the plastic cape. I can imagine why they went with plastic - it's cheaper, I'm sure, and also by going with plastic the manufacturers are able to ensure the dramatic appearance of this figure. However, the plastic is heavy, it throws the balance of the figure off. It's also fairly inflexible, so it restricts the full movement of the arms. Obviously, it would have been nice if they'd gone with a cloth cape, so that you could take advantage of the ultra-posability of this figure. It would be nice, for example, if you could pose Harlock in his melancholy sitting pose on top of a pile of books, or what have you, mimicking his slouched-down in his seat position at the helm of the Arcadia.The other odd design choice was to not include Mr.Bird as a separate figure, but as an accessory permanently adhered to Harlock's alternate collar. Yes, that's right, you have to swap out collars to include Mr.Bird. You pop off Harlock's head and switch out the separate piece of plastic from his cowl. On one hand, this is an interesting solution to a minor problem -- even Medicom went the obvious route and their Mr.Bird's feet just clip on to wherever you can make him fit. You would think Play Arts Kai would have sooner considered just doing foot-pegs - which I admit readily invite the problem of breakage - but to go *this* route and have Mr.Bird permanently attached to a spare collar just seems bizarre. Granted, when in use both the collar and Mr.Bird are secure, so...there's that.Despite these complaints I'm pretty much in love with this figure - and I totally did not expect to be. Hence, I am not deducting any stars because of the few design choices I don't agree with. This figure is definitely bad-ass. I would think that most fans of Harlock would agree this is a respectful interpretation of our beloved space pirate, despite its flaws. You may or may not find some minor complaints with it - but overall this a great sculpt and a quality piece. Those qualities, in my opinion, are inarguable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKF889KV4Q0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EO4M970#wasThisHelpful","R2JKF889KV4Q0Z","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first started seeing the cheesy commercials for this thing around Thanksgiving 2013. You know how crappy products start making tv appearances before xmas? I assumed this was another piece of plastic trash destined for landfill. Yet -- something tugged at my pile-infested heartstrings....could this be the product I've been secretly dreaming of??It's true that in the deepest, darkest, echoing caverns of my pessimistic heart a tiny voice does indeed cry out for a device that can clean fuzz-globs from my favorite socks and sweaters. Somewhere, a part of myself I lost touch with long ago -- yearns for crisp, clean clothes that look like new.Oh, I've tried the shavers. Those things are bloody torture. We should lock [insert bad person here] in cages with sweater shavers and an endless supply of fleece.Anyway, we're talking about the Gleener here so I'll get on with it. Is the price high? It seems high, doesn't it? The price kept me away from several months. But here's the thing to consider: Imagine the sweater or whatever article of clothing you have in mind for the Gleener. How much did that cost you? If you could have that article of clothing again -- free and clear of those nasty hair-globs clinging menacingly to it -- what would you pay for that??Because the Gleener does remove piles. Depending on the type of fabric it removes them pretty easily. It breezes across fleece. Wool is trickier, depending on the knit.I had three sweaters that I would no longer wear outside of the house because the piles were too bad. I also had two pairs of snowboarding socks that cost me like $25 each -- those were trashed! But the Gleener cleaned everything up, no problem. The sweater took ten minutes, I'd say, and I'm thorough.So yeah,  this is practically a miracle device. Gone are days of wasting tape trying to pull hairballs off my clothes.Lastly, and some may consider this a negative but it's worth pointing out -- this isn't really a *shaver* -- it doesn't have blades. The roughest 'blade' is like a mesh that grabs the piles -- like velcro almost. So if your issue is extra fuzz, like loose yarn or hairs -- I'm not sure the Gleener will help. I have a wool sweater from Ireland that practically looks like a Pekingese at this point -- the Gleener removed some fuzz, but not enough so that you could discern the individual strands of yarn.in closing -- it's pretty well built, sturdy construction and it does what it says.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K59J2PDJ6G0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I11ELK0#wasThisHelpful","R3K59J2PDJ6G0B","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a few medicom 1/6 figures: Rocketeer, Captain Harlock, original costume Wolverine -- I recently just picked up Manji from Blade of the Immortal. It was after buying Manji I thought it was odd that my modest collection was lacking my favorite super-hero of all-time, Spider-Man. So, I sought to rectify this.Of course, I've been aware of this as well as the previous medicom Spider-Man offerings. I was never too enthused about them. The comic-book version of Spider-Man always looked too cheezy for my tastes, and personally I never cared for the silver-webbing on the Spider-Man 2 costume. I suppose I could have gone for the black suit -- but I really wanted the traditional colors. I guess I'm a purist.Now that Hot Toys has entered the 1/6 ring -- I found I had quite a few options to choose from. I wasn't married to Medicom, I just wanted the best possible figure at the most reasonable price. So I did what any fan or collector on a budget would do -- I hit the web and watched a ton of unboxing & comparison videos.Even though I said I was a purist, I found that I was willing to consider the Amazing Spider-Man figure. The design is pretty cool and I thought the movie was a decent modern re-telling of the Spider-Man story. Also, a lot of the pictures look amazing.That said, the price for either the Medicom or the Hot Toys version was fairly steep. I found the cheapest price was for the Hot Toys version, which I was able to locate for $150 free shipping. Medicom was at least $180 and no free shipping. That was more than I wanted to spend.So I was leaning heavily towards Hot Toys but I have no personal knowledge of their quality. I know that some of their facial sculpts are stunning, but that's all I know. I've never held one in my hands. This is where youtube came in handy. Bless they guys who take the time to do reviews. They saved me from a $150 mistake.The main complaint with the Hot Toys Amazing Spider-Man figure has to do with an apparent design flaw. Supposedly, the shoulder joints break fairly easily. One guy says the instructions included with the figure say not to raise the figures arms beyond 80 degrees. Seriously?? Spider-Man not raise his arms above 80 degrees??  Of course this is information gleaned from the internet and thus is not completely and utterly reliable. I'm sure there are plenty of people who have the figure and love it and the shoulders are very much intact. I'm just saying for me, personally, it was a bit of a risk.Finally I watched a comparison video between both versions. The Hot Toys figure is smaller, and the body is more child-like. Granted, the actor has a very boyish frame. But compared to the size of other 1/6 scale figures -- the Hot Toys version looked impish. Also, the body of the figure did not look good. I'm an illustrator, so the proportions just looked off to me. This was the deal-breaker on purchasing the Hot Toys Amazing Spider-Man.And thus concluded my considering purchasing the Amazing Spider-Man figure in general. I just wasn't willing to shell out $200 on the medicom one.All of this brought me back to Medicom's Spider-Man 3 figure. I had 4 primary concerns:1) The suit2) The boots3) The head size/shape4) The utter lack of accessories.Regarding the suit -- I wasn't too sure how I felt about a non-removable rubber suit. I do like the way it bunches and gathers around bent limbs - I feel it adds a hint of realism. I suppose I was worried that the hexagonal-pattern to the movie version of the suit would be too pronounced -- and I'm relieved to say it's not. Medicom also did something really smart in extending the sleeve length so that you can extend the arm fully & never see the plastic body underneath.I know it makes sense that the figure be wearing boots rather than, say, socks or booties -- but from pictures it was hard to tell if they clashed with the overall look. They don't. The red of the boots, head and hands matches the suit perfectly.The head. Yeah. The head sculpt is my only real beef with this figure. The neck looks too long, making the head appear too small. I've been tempted to remove the head and alter the neck-length. This would satisfy me.But is it really *that* bad? No, it's not. There are plenty of poses that make the neck length appear less grotesque.Finally, this figure comes with a set of hands and a clear stand and that's it. The extra hands are okay. One is a webslinging pose and the other features spread-out fingers in an ""action"" pose. They should have includes fists, if not for fighting poses - then at least to attach string to use as webbing.On a final note -- this figure -- and I assume all of these vinyl-suit figures -- is a little hard to pose. The suit material feels like padded vinyl, like a car seat or something, only thinner. It fights back a little bit. So poses of Spider_man with his knees level with his face are not going to happen.I paid $82 free shipping for this figure, new. I feel it's worth that as a Medicom figure -- I'm glad I got it. It's not without it's flaws -- but it is a decently made, quality figure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DRMAN8AOOBQC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MQ3P04#wasThisHelpful","R2DRMAN8AOOBQC","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was useful to me for awhile -- if for no other reason than I was tired of wasting tinfoil. Also, the concept of a windcover was appealing... There are a variety of windcovers out there -- they can get a little pricey too. It makes this item seem economical.However, I was still having issues with airflow and harsh smoke with this. I still had to pop the lid and push the coals around occasionally to keep the shisha from burning. This constant maintenance can really put a damper on your smoking experience.Eventually I bought the Kaloud Lotus and I love it. It's more money, a lot more money, but it solved all my issues with heat management. No, I don't work for them. I'm pretty new to hookah smoking, and undoubtedly there's a lot to be learned about the process.

"Are you in the habit of spending $400 on boots? If so, this review may not pertain to you. I feel there's a certain disconnect between quality and expense these days, regardless of brand or designer, and if I'm going to spend $400 on boots then I expect to be buried in those *^^%%^#& boots.My quest began with a search for Engineer-style boots. I've had a pair of Frye riding boots for a good long while and their construction is top-notch -- and that's what brought me back to Frye.I researched the bejeebus out of this purchase. I price-checked. I read reviews. I compared this to it's Slouch and Short cousins. As far as pricing goes -- there's no break on price with this style, though the slouch and short seem to go on sale now and then. The latter two styles are also readily available on a certain online bidding site if you're okay with second-hand or cosmetically less-than-perfect boots.I ordered size 8.5 in Cognac Antique.If you order one of the more unusual colors - my first piece of advice would be to check and make sure you get the right color. Amazon sent my Cognac instead of Cognac Antique. When I first opened the box I was disappointed that the color did not match the amazon picture, but didn't check the sticker on the box for a day or two. Luckily, I emailed amazon and they made things right by me.Aside from that, I can confirm what most other women are saying. The toe box is pretty tight on these. I'm strictly an 8.5, with my right foot incrementally larger. The right toe box was super-tight. Even after several days of wearing them the toe box was still unpleasant and I had to resort to a shoe-stretcher to open it up. Now that they're thoroughly broken in I could wear these 24/7, and that is 98% of my four stars.The shaft of these boots is thinner leather than what I expected. The quality of the leather is nice, but if you're thinking this is thick, sturdy leather you are mistaken. Since this purchase I've checked out the Veronica Slouch in person, and in my opinion the leather is not as nice. Especially the chocolate and bronze colors. Not impressed with those at all. Maybe it's how they treat the leather to get those particular colors but they might as well be vinyl or pleather.The zipper is good quality. The snaps are nice too, but like other reviews say, they do come loose on occasion. It may not happen often, but it really just has to happen once to be annoying.The soles are good, you won't slip or skid on a smooth surface.All things considered, the boots look great. Stunning, actually. You will get noticed in these. But will your grandkids bury you in these boots after you've lived an adventurous, full life? Probably not. These boots will quit before you do.In short, these are not five-star quality boots. Or should I say, these are not five-star quality Frye boots. If you own an old pair of Frye's you'll know exactly what I mean. However, they are pretty -- and probably one of the more stylish versions of an engineer boot out there. If you're content getting a few good years out of a pair of boots you'll be cool with these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22RB9UQGEG3B9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0073SDSOC#wasThisHelpful","R22RB9UQGEG3B9","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start this review by saying canvas slip-ons have been my look of choice since high school. Back then they were cheap -- the Payless flagship cheapskate shoe. My parents were too stingy to spring for Converse, and when I got my first job my money had other places to go besides overpriced gym shoes. Maybe other kids would have teased me for my inexpensive choice - but i'm an artist, and drew my designs all over the white canvas slip-ons. Bam, I was cooler than the cool kids.Maybe it's for this very reason canvas slip-ons have gotten so crazy expensive. $40? Seriously? And $40 is a conservative price on some styles. I'm not a tight-wad by any means but the cost-to-value ratio is way out of whack.In my adulthood my go-to brand for awhile was Rocket Dog. But -- their styles seem to have worn thin lately, and I've wanted something a bit more subdued.Anyway, my search turned to Amazon after exhaustive retail store searches. I was about to give in and get one of the cheaper pairs of Van's -- but saw Sanuk cross-referenced on my page. I looked and found that yes, some of the prices are high just like Van's -- but some colors are fairly inexpensive. Less expensive than Airwalks. Okay then. Ordered a pair of Donna's and a pair of Rio's -- the difference between the two is ...heck I can't tell.I followed the advice of other reviewers and went down a half-size. I am strictly an 8.5 without fail. But -- the 8 fit right out of the box, a little snug but not uncomfortable. And of course - after an hour the shoe fit like it was custom made for my foot.In short -- I LOVE these and couldn't be happier.Even so, I debated giving this shoe 4 and not 5 stars. My reason is that these shoes are light -- seriously light in weight. Practically non-existent. This isn't a problem necessarily -- but it does give me some concern when it comes to duration. The construction quality is tight; seams are even, there's no sloppy gluing to be seen -- but I seriously wonder how long these shoes will hold up. It could be they'll surprise me -- I don't know. But for what I paid I am very satisfied with the style, fit and construction of the shoe.How often have you bought something and just felt really, really good about it? This is one of those purchases for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14LBCCY7EPHKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089ZRG1O#wasThisHelpful","R14LBCCY7EPHKH","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Serious question that needs to be asked -- apparently there's another band called The Unicorns so confusion over the artis'ts name is one excuse.Flossie and the Unicorns are a puppet band from the puppet universe of Miss Pussycat. This isn't just weird music for the sake of being weird, it is the soundtrack for a puppet show. If you've seen the puppet shows you know that they are brilliantly creative and funny!So, as far as the negative reviews go -- they are listening to music completely out of context. Granted, they might not approve of miss Pussycat or her husband Mr. Quintron's music anyway -- it's not for everyone.

"Not trying to be snide with the review title -- it's an honest question in regards to this receiver. You almost certainly will be befuddled at some point during installation, and rather than tossing the receiver back in its box and shipping it angrily back to amazon you'll need to hit the interwebs. We all live in the hope that someday someone will engineer electronics that will simply work the way we imagine they should, you plug everything in and bam! it all just works. That day is not here and this receiver is not that miracle machine.A lot of these negative reviews are older, or so it seems. My receiver was up-to-date out of the box.Because I was impatient, I did the quick audio set-up first. Listening to music afterwards I wasn't sure what to think, the sound was broad but flat in my opinion. After I did the full audio set up the sound improved drastically -- plus all the listening options, oh, it's hard to be unhappy here.I should mention this receiver is replacing a Yamaha661, which I loved dearly.The video is also improved over my Yamaha, and the issues with 3D that I'd been having are gone.One thing I will say about video upscaling -- the resolution of the device needs to be 480i. My largest hurdle in setting up the receiver was getting my wii to work; I had audio but no video. Some googling finally brought me to a forum that covered this exact issue; set the wii to output at 480i and that was the end of that issue. It looks good and clean now, even for the wii.I have an xbox360, ps3, wii, dvr and turntable hooked up to this receiver. The game systems look great, better than with my old Yamaha. As for the turntable, this receiver does not have a preamp. So, if your turntable doesn't have a built-in preamp you'll need a separate one. I use the ART DJ Pre II.Another thing to keep in mind is that with some of the inputs -- you need to tell the receiver what sort of signal it is looking for. I suppose that just means that they're unassigned within the receiver; I mean, you'd think if you plug an hdmi device into an hdmi input the receiver is just going to see it because, well, hdmi. That's not always the case here - you may have to go into the input settings and tell the receiver that yeah, look for hdmi. I was having this issue with AppleTV.My only roadblock right now is that the Network doesn't work with iTunes, it works with Media Player. I haven't yet figured out if there's a workaround for this because it's not a priority for me. I have a TB drive plugged in via usb and the receiver is able to pull my music off of there -- fairly quickly, too.All said and done this is a heckuva receiver for the lightening-deal price. I'm really happy I went for it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23SISK9TCTRH6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077V88W2#wasThisHelpful","R23SISK9TCTRH6","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been shopping for a vice I could enjoy in the privacy of my own home - something ritualistic and relaxing. My friend, a smoking caterpillar, suggested I get a narghile. ""Hmmm,"" I thought. Interesting.After much googling and researching I thought an occasional bit of tobacco might be nice. My searches revealed a few obvious points, a few less obvious. Some cheaper hookahs rust. Others don't have a good seal.My research pointed me in the direction of Mya. Are there better, more expensive brands? I'm sure there are. My friend the caterpillar mentioned something about using a two liter bottle and half an orange if I felt like being cheap. That's okay, buddy, I can budget this.The base is heavy, clear glass - although it looks pale yellow/green in amazon's photo. It's a good size, molded - lest we take 'crystal' too literally, and thick. No complaints here.The metal stem is nice too, has a good heft to it & is well insulated. All seals are good and proper. Metal seems like quality, not coated. The silicon gasket seal for the base is thorough. It can slip up a little bit - though if moistened it fits into the base easily.The hose seems like good quality also. Lacquered woods tips at both ends. Looks very nice.The included bowl is a basic one. This set also includes a gasket or grommet as they are often called. Hard to believe a manufacturer would *not* include a grommet but apparently this happens. Rest assured here.Of course everything comes apart and cleans very easily.So, all said and done, this is a quality item and I'm content with what I paid for it. It's nice to have something at the end of the day to prepare for & enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IOOBYX50770R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009D3S1TM#wasThisHelpful","R2IOOBYX50770R","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My iPad was given to me as a gift.  I hadn't asked for it and I didn't expect it -- so when I got it I was more than slightly baffled as to what I would do with it.I'm an artist by trade. I already have a few Wacom tablets.  So when it was suggested i give drawing on the iPad a try -- I scoffed.  The iPad doesn't have sensitivity like the Wacom tablets do, so I couldn't conceive that it would be good for anything beyond hangman or tic-tac-toe.  Of course I was wrong. Crazy wrong.The lack of sensitivity is an issue, but another stylus manufacturer has developed an algorithm that mimics sensitivity -- hopefully Apple will embrace this tech and implement it later on.In the meantime, i learned to love drawing on my iPad; i loved being able to do quick little doodles and email them off to friends or clients... and while it takes some getting used to, you are capable of some remarkable detail.Which is where using a stylus comes in.Since I was initially clueless as to what to do with my iPad -- it also hadn't occurred to me to use a stylus for drawing.  Here I was honing my finger-painting skills and then I watched as my friend casually whipped out her iPad and Pogo stylus and started doodling away.  My jaw nearly dropped; what a revelation!I ordered the exact same stylus she was using, the Pogo Sketch.  When it arrived and I started drawing with it I was less than pleased; the tip is sort of this prickled velcro-y like fabric that is stuffed with foam rubber.  It's pliant, and I didn't feel very in control with it -- by that I mean I couldn't be completely precise in where it would make contact with the screen.  I felt it was just too mushy.Then I ordered Boxwave's stylus.  This was a vast improvement.  The tip feels like a hollow rubber ball.  It's definitely much more precise, and in my opinion -- superior for drawing.  It's also a quality item, it's nicely made, the finish is nice, and it has a lanyard attached that plugs into the iPad's headphone jack.Drawing on iPad is not like drawing on paper.  There's a learning curve to it -- and different people will use different tools in their own way.  In other words, a perfect stylus probably does not exist yet....but for me -- this one is pretty close.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3INXDNH9SQGWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000ETWCSK#wasThisHelpful","R3INXDNH9SQGWS","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Consider this a review of the special edition itself.  In no way is this a review of the actual game.  I'm going to assume that if you're considering the special edition you already are pretty well-informed about this game and what it entails.The Special Edition was a free, automatic upgrade from Gamestop if you reserved the game with them.  The Special Edition includes a cardboard sleeve proclaiming it to be the Special Edition, as well as a code for the Assassin Outfit and Soundtrack download.  The soundtrack is NOT on an enclosed disc.  What's worse is that ANY Red Dead code will work for the soundtrack -- whether it's the warhorse or golden guns code -- that same code will allow you to download the soundtrack.  So, honestly, the ONLY thing this edition has over a regular release is a paper cover.That's it.  You can decide for yourself if the vultures charging an additional $50 are justified, or merely bloodsucking opportunists.Some Collector's Editions I can understand the mark-up.

"I'll start by saying I didn't realise right away that it was vinyl.  It seemed like real leather.  This is a nice, simple strap that's soft to the touch and has some very light cushioning to it.  It's not padded, but it's soft against your back and shoulder.  The design is nice too.  I bought mine at a guitar shop so I got to compare the different colors in the flesh.

"Okay, you may not need this particular set -- but if you own suede or sheepskin boots -- you at least need to own the brush that comes in this set.  It is by far the most valuable tool out there when it comes to keeping your boots clean.This is the set I bought and used, so it's what I'm reviewing. I'm sure there are better kits available and possibly at a better value. I'm sure you are at least in part paying for the Ugg name.At first I wasn't too impressed with this set -- largely because it didn't magically do what I expected it do to.  Of course -- I've since come to learn that I didn't know how to use this set.  Perhaps that is the single criticism this set deserves -- it does not come with in-depth instructions -- just the instructions on the bottles of solution -- so not the best source of information.In January I bought a sand colored pair of Emu sheepskin boots.  One night when it was raining I stepped out of my car and into a puddle in the gutter.  One boot got soaked  but I figured it would dry okay.  I was wrong.  The rainwater must have been greasy because it left dark brown stains all along the sole of my boot.I tried everything to clean it and nothing worked.  If anything I succeeded only in spreading the grease stains around.  Soon, the one boot looked drastically different from the other and I couldn't imagine wearing them in public anymore.  That's when I ordered this cleaning kit -- but when I tried the cleaning solution -- it didn't seem to do anything.Just as I was about to throw the boots away I started scouring the web for solutions.  Eventually I found a site that detailed use of a nubuck brush -- like the one included in this set.The brush has bristles on one side, white chalk on the other.  Along the sides of the brush are rubber teeth -- like a comb.  Brushing the suede or sheepskin after it's been washed will restore the texture.  But by far -- the white chalk is the best possible solution for grease stains.  Rubbing the stains with the white chalk and then brushing it out works like a miracle.  It took several applications to some stains -- but this brush saved my boots.  I can't emphasize this enough -- my boots were so bad I was ready to throw them away -- but now they look new again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJNZ8XUEXR9Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001UZALR6#wasThisHelpful","R1FJNZ8XUEXR9Y","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I can't consider myself a huge fan of either Guitar Hero or Rock Band.  I bought the first Guitar Hero when it came out and enjoyed it immensely -- but immediately became dismayed by the onslaught of new game and controller releases.  Compatibility also became an issue after awhile.That said, I'll explain that I'm a game collector -- however -- I prefer to own the best of peripherals rather than a huge swatch of them.  I don't need 4 guitars and drums and all of that. One really nice guitar that is built well and will last is what would best suit my needs.  This Logitech seems to fit the bill nicely.When I originally did my research -- I was disappointed that this guitar wasn't full-size.  This almost kept me from buying it.  After some consideration I decided I didn't really need something that large taking up so much space.As for the guitar itself -- my only complaint is a cosmetic one.  The fret buttons are an eyesore.  When you think about the lengths that Logitech went to in order to make a nice ""mini"" guitar -- you can't help but think that it would have been nice if it looked a tad more realistic.  The brown plastic on the neck used for both the buttons and the slider bar cheapens the overall look.  This isn't a major complaint -- like I said it's purely cosmetic -- but it makes this guitar more toy-like, which is too bad.When it came to gameplay -- I scored significantly better with this controller.  There were songs on Guitar Hero Metallica I could never get through before -- but this controller feels a lot more comfortable to me.  The wood neck fits nicely in my palm -- making those fret buttons easy to get to.  And the strum bar is so silent that sometimes I thought I was missing notes!  Gone are the days of having to shake the controller to invoke Star Power, too.  I liked having all of the hardware right where I could get to it.All in all -- this is a great controller.  If pricepoint is your concern -- wait for a sale -- but this is definitely worth picking up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFXYRE1SPGM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NTBWK4#wasThisHelpful","R2YFXYRE1SPGM6","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never owned a pair of Uggs, so I can't make any comparisons.  I've enjoyed this style of boot -- regardless of brand -- but have been put off by the price.  $200 for such a simply made boot?  Come on.These Emu's came up on a one-day-only sale -- so I finally bit the bullet.  I read the glowing reviews here on amazon, bought a size down -- and have been enjoying them ever since.Here's the skinny:These boots are well made. The stitching is tight, the soles are nice.  The insides are warm without making your feet sweaty. The sheepskin is supple.  Everything about these boots is quality... I can see these lasting for quite some time -- and when it is time to get a new pair -- I won't hesitate to pay retail.  Buy with confidence.UPDATE (4/3/10)Weeks of constant wear was bound to result in disaster.One rainy evening I exited my car curbside, stepping into a gutter filled with rain.  One boot was saturated about an inch into the sheepskin.  I wasn't worried at the time -- I figured it would dry and be fine.  Oh, but I was wrong.  Apparently the gutter water was greasy, and the sand-colored sheepskin stained a dark brown.Attempts to clean the sheepskin only resulted in making it worse.  Wiping the stains with a damp sponge succeeded only in smearing the stains around.  Before too long -- one boot looked drastically different from the other. I purchased a sheepskin cleaning kit made by Ugg -- but it didn't help at all.Eventually, I was driven to more extreme measures -- I set my clothes washer to hand-wash, cold water, said a prayer and tossed the boots in(LET IT BE SAID I do not recommend anyone repeat this.  I have read that other people have done this with success, but you can totally avoid this!).  Suffice it to say I had reached the point where -- at best -- I had hoped to damage both boots at least similarly.  It was that, or throw them away. It was a last, desperate attempt to save the boots I loved. I'd already broken down and bought a cheaper suede pair of Emu's.With my sheepskin boots somewhat cleaner but dried out -- I began a web search to find out if there was any sort of additive that could restore softness to the sheepskin.  This is when I discovered an article that more or less explained that the most valuable sheepskin cleaning tool is a sheepskin/nubuck brush.  Luckily, I had one in the Ugg kit I'd bought.I include this update to tell all of you that the most valuable tool you can buy to preserve your boots is this brush.  My boots now look like new, despite all of my attempts to destroy them.  They are once again supple and smooth.The brush you need has bristles on one side, white chalk on the other.  Around the sides are soft teeth -- like a rubber comb.  Using these simple elements you keep your boots looking like new.  The white chalk will remove the nastiest of grease stains.I brushed the boots thoroughly while they were still slightly damp, raising the texture of the sheepskin suede, using the rubber comb first and then the fine brush.  I then used the chalk on the grease -- some stains I had to go over a few times -- but soon they all vanished.  It took about an hour or two of brushing -- but both boots are clean and free of stains -- and look new again.So please -- heed the advice of other posters -- particularly if you are getting these boots on sale -- spend the money you save on a cleaning kit.  Prep the boots with a stain repellent before you wear them, and use the nubuck brush to remove stains.  Do this -- and these boots will last and last....","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J1MIVMCGF019/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00149K5K6#wasThisHelpful","R2J1MIVMCGF019","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My fiance and I have had in mind for awhile to buy a slow cooker.  We received a $100 gift certificate for a retailer - known more for their smarminess than their affordable pricing -- and thought this would be the perfect thing to spend it on.  This retailer in particular only had two models of slow cookers to choose from, this one and a 5 quart DeLonghi.  I like the DeLonghi brand well enough -- but we thought the cooker was kind of ugly looking.  So is the Cuisinart, truth be told.There were only a handful of features that helped guide our choice.  First was the extra quart-and-a-half capacity.  The programmable heating settings also seemed like they could be useful.  This slow cooker also comes with a cooking rack for when you're doing a roast. Ultimately what convinced us to go with this model was the fact that it's big enough TO do a roast -- you have room enough to do a whole chicken.When we got home we immediately checked amazon to see how badly we'd been ripped off.  Oddly enough -- it was the same price.  However -- the reviews shocked us.  How can a slow cooker get such horrible reviews when all it has to do is get hot and stay hot?  We freaked out a bit and almost ran back to return it.Like most people who bother to read reviews on amazon -- you're probably aware that typically some of the bad reviews are people just mouthing off, or rating the product based some other bad experience they've had, or they haven't read the user manual for their device and are in the process of breaking it themselves.  There might be a bad review or two like this here, for the Cuisinart.  But otherwise -- people are saying some frightening things -- namely, that the Cuisinart doesn't cook the food.As for this slow cooker being badly engineered or made cheaply -- I'm not sure where that comes from.  Look at it this way; this cooker holds a huge, thick, 6.5 quart ceramic bowl.  The bowl itself can not be confused for cheap.  The brushed stainless steel unit that it fits into likewise has to be huge.  So, you have this huge steel unit and it's only function is to get hot.  Do heating coils take up a lot of room?  No, they don't.  Are they heavy? No, they're not.  If if the opinion of cheap is coming from the fact that the base is big and feels hollow -- then in my opinion they are not being very fair.The only complaint I can make is that the programmable buttons are keypad type buttons.  I would have preferred actual push-in surface buttons, but when you think about it -- the keypad style is much easier to clean up AND prevents moisture from any spilled liquids from getting inside.Regarding the ""permanent"" fingerprints -- I'm not sure how that phenomenon can actually take place. I just wiped the unit down and it looks completely new again.  Just because it's brushed stainless steel doesn't mean it won't get fingerprints.Anyway, we decided to keep the cooker and we're glad we did.  I threw together some chicken soup last night and we each had a delicious bowl of it this morning.  Everything was cooked perfectly -- the carrots were soft and flavorful and the chicken melted away from the bone.  I have no complaints or regrets. I would have given it five stars if it were just a tad prettier..","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6R78UP9VK45G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VA48PM#wasThisHelpful","R6R78UP9VK45G","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A couple of years ago I fell for the alleged ease-of-use of a ION USB Turntable.  The price was reasonable, and honestly -- I just wanted to convert some of my old vinyl without much hassle.  I guess in that sense USB Turntables are okay.  But ya know -- a cheap turntable is made cheaply.  Even after I replaced the ION cartridge with one made by Shure -- the sound quality just didn't match what I was accustomed to from a ""real"" turntable.  YES, you can use software to clean up the sound a bit...but I can't help but think this dilutes the recording somewhat.My real dilemma came with having to transfer some recordings from tape.

"When a friend purchased the BSG pilot movie for me and insisted I watched it because it was ""great"" I procrastinated.  A child of the 70's I remember the original series, and thought it was basically Love Boat in space. The Ovions were cool, and the robot dog (Moffat?  Moppat?  Muppet?) was cool, but other than that I found it cheesy and for the most part uninteresting.So when I finally got around to watching that pilot movie for the new BSG -- I was blown away -- and within minutes.  It was clearly a quality product right out of the box, good writing, good acting -- great effects.  I went on to follow the series faithfully -- and the series as a whole was fantastic.  Sure, there were some pretty lame ""filler"" episodes, but all in all it was a monumental sci-fi series.Caprica did not inspire the same sort of enthusiasm.  To be honest, I thought it was fairly terrible, but I'm willing to withhold condemnation.  My issues so far revolve around the cast which seems spotty; Morales is a perfect choice for the serior Adama, and Stoltz, too, seems appropriately cast.  However, I honestly couldn't identify with anyone else.  In fact, I found the teenage characters brutally annoying.Without giving away spoilers -- the writing did not engage me until the second half of the movie.  Even then, I sort of felt like hanging on simply for the sake of being able to say I watched the whole thing.  There's also some sexual overtones sprinkled throughout which I'm sure were supposed to be provocative, but I felt were in poor taste. I'm not referring to the club scenes of writhing and dry humping either.  I'm referring more to scenes with the head-mistress.  It was sort of like 90210 in space, the very special ""Just Say No"" episode.  When writers throw crappy and obvious hints like that at their audience, it seems more that they're pandering to kids and shut-ins who's only experience with alternative relationships is what they watch on Jerry Springer.Anyway, for me, the writing seemed reminiscent of that lesbian tie-in that they did in BSG mid-season, Razor. Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition)  That episode left me wondering why the lesbian relationship was integral?  To show Cain had softer, human side? Or to explain why she was so ""tough"".  From what I recall, that Commander was not a completely unlikeable character, sure -- she was tough as nails and very much by-the-books but those were/are respectable qualities.  However, she was an obstacle that needed to be eliminated, and in the process her sexual identity was dumped on the table, she was reduced to a ""woman-spurned"" and then axed. Let me quickly say that I ""get"" that the culture of BSG seemed to have a more open sexual identity, and that the show lacked the bias that real society actually has -- but for a show that has paralleled so many issues and handled them all with grace -- some things just seem thrown out there for the heck of it.  For ratings.  For titillation. For whatever reason, but this deliberate flirtation with open sexuality sometimes seems so cheaply done to me.  I say this not as a prude, but as someone who appreciates a connection between ""sexy"" and ""smart"".But that's just one aspect, other fans might recall that Razor was a bit of a mish-mash.  Caprica, too, is a little neither-here-nor-there as the writers struggle to make it more complicated than a future Frankenstein story.So, while I did not care for ""Caprica"" at all -- I'm willing to have some faith and stick around for a couple of episodes.  While I found this movie to be a poor teaser for the series -- it may take a few episodes to round out the plot and endear viewers to the characters.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6Y0F8DPA30J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RTCP1U#wasThisHelpful","RC6Y0F8DPA30J","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll say first off I bought this at the discounted price, and that makes it a particularly sweet deal.The worst thing about this guitar is the fact it says Hannah Montana on it, and for those of you who are curious -- it's not a decal you can just peel off.  Luckily for me, I work in product development and have access to both acrylic and laser cutters.  So, I replaced the pick guard with one that covers the name of the shrill and annoying Disney Mutant Hell Spawn which is Hannah Montana.As I had this thing apart briefly, I can assure you that, despite some rumors on the web, the neck is not plastic -- it's wood, probably maple.  The body is wood also, but I can't say what type.  So -- this is a fairly solid constructed guitar. It's light enough for a kid, but it is not built like a toy.I can't vouch for the hardware, it seems pretty basic.  I had a musician friend tune it for me, and he had some difficulty tuning all the way up the neck.  He suggested taking it to a tech at a place like Guitar Center and paying for a thorough tune-up.  That would bring my expense pretty much up to full retail, however that may not be such a bad thing.Some better strings are also recommended.I plugged this into my amp at home and played around -- it has a pretty good sound, I'm definitely happy with it.  Strumming along, I had a vision of the future -- wherein my grown-up niece was onstage at the Grammy's -- thanking her aunt for buying her first guitar and changing her life forever.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JID9S3AE9Q9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WZL7RS#wasThisHelpful","R2JID9S3AE9Q9I","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first saw this Dickie's bag during my daily commute -- a woman had the black-with-pink-stars bag slung over her shoulder and I thought it was the coolest looking bag I'd seen in awhile.  Luckily for me, the Dickie's label was prominently displayed on the front -- so I looked up the bag on amazon later the same day.When I received the bag I was pretty happy.  The material is stiff (although it does break in) and certainly seemed at least somewhat waterproof.  The construction seems rugged, the stitching is tight.  I had no reason to question whether or not I'd bought a quality product.  However -- my thoughts on that changed withing a few weeks.Here's the thing.  On one side of the bag -- where the strap meets the actual bag itself -- the strap is looped through an elongated ""O"" ring.  This is to accommodate the adjustable strap.  Because of this ""O"" ring, however, the strap bunches up and forces the O ring on to it's side. This may not seem like a big deal, but it throws the strap off and also looks pretty stupid. It's minor, and initially it didn't bother me too much -- but now that it's been about 6 months it irritate me to no end.  Also, the strap is permanently warped at this point -- it won't lay flat no matter what.So, this is an okay bag for the money -- the quality is good for the most part, the choice of designs is really nice.  But it has a significant design flaw that Dickie's needs to adjust.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S75QZSQ22Q9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MSB09A#wasThisHelpful","R1S75QZSQ22Q9J","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got these to replace a pair of Creative bluetooth phones.  I thought I was happy with my Creative phones, even with the occasional bit of static and the limited battery life.. these things weren't major issues for me.  But I saw a deal on this headset and once I learned they are made by Harmon Kardon I figured I couldn't go wrong.These blow my Creative phones out of the water.  We're talking total annihilation here.First of all, these are designed to work wit iPods 4th generation AND ON.  So this includes the 2G Touch which is what I am using.The receiver is great, matches the Touch exactly.  It pairs in seconds, too.The headphones are comfortable -- soft, buttery leather.They also come with a bunch of swappable tips for the AC charger -- so you can charge these in Europe and Asia.

"Ideally -- for music you want a pair of wired headphones.  They just sound better.  But if you want the convenience of wireless -- these bluetooth headphones aren't bad.I dispute the battery life claims on here -- mine last about 7 or 8 hours.  I make frequent flights from the midwest to California and I listen to these there and back without having to change batteries.I haven't had any issues with connectivity either.  I can listen to music from my computer in the next room without the connection dropping.  I get a second or two of static walking downtown but that's not unreasonable to me.I also think these are fairly comfortable.

"Isn't it funny how some people and vendors think that ancient technology is still worth top dollar??I didn't by this switch from the seller currently under the item listing, but I did buy mine through amazon for a comparable sum.  It's ridiculous, but when you're in a jam I suppose you can't be too particular.My need for this item arose from my video game obsession.  I was not trying to use two computers and one monitor, but rather one computer and a Sega Dreamcast (with vga adapter) to my LCD tv.  Kvm switches would not work for me (I tried several) since there was no mouse or keyboard on the DC's end.So, this forced me to go retro.  This switcher box didn't work immediately for the Dreamcast -- I kept getting a display message saying the signal had to be 60Hz (which I thought was the default anyhow).  But eventually, and for no apparent reason (I was literally just checking all cable connections) it sprung to life and decided to work flawlessly.So, when all else fails -- you may want to take a trip back in time and try a good ol' A-B switcher box.  It gets four stars for being a bile-tinged shade of beige, otherwise I have no complaints other than what people charge for ancient garage-sale technology.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2009","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L4Z47YK1J582/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006B780#wasThisHelpful","R1L4Z47YK1J582","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Last week sometime I finally made up my mind to be more proactive in my battle against winter.. I've got the whole dressing-in-layers thing down pretty good, but I seriously needed a pair of winter boots.  I find the popularity and style of Uggs rather tempting, but not the pricetag.  I also thought that there's no way suede can hold up against snow and water for very long.  Who wants to spend $120 on boots that they only get a season or two out of?So, web searches eventually turned up Kamik.  ""Snowden"" wasn't my first choice, but other varieties were sold out.  Snowden was sold out in many colors, so I had to get them in light grey.I paid just over $50 and let me say -- they are absolutely worth it.  These are heavy duty, water and weatherproof boots.  I think they are tested to endure -40 degree weather.  The soles are thick and stiff and have deep treads.  Inside they are soft & warm.  The liner is removable for easy cleaning.  If I had seen these in a store I probably would have been willing to pay as much as $80, maybe more.  These boots are a quality item.I don't know if fashionistas would like them, however; they might be a bit too utilitarian.  Nonetheless they still look good, they are not cumbersome and they do not make your feet look big.  I've been walking around the house in them to break them in a little bit and they aren't the least bit clumsy.The only minor complaint I have is that they are made a half size too small.  I knew about this in advance, though.  They don't make half-sizes, so I went a size down instead of up and they fit perfectly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B974L5YIMQ3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000WBFB8I#wasThisHelpful","R2B974L5YIMQ3Y","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this movie because I watched Azur et Asmar and was blown away by it; while I suspected that Kirikou, an earlier film, would be more primitive I had not anticipated it would also be less interesting.This is a cute fairy tale, don't get me wrong. But it isn't nearly as complex or visually interesting as Azur & Asmar.One thing to consider, particularly if you are buying this for children -- is that this is not Disney.  This animated film depicts an african village as you might expect to see it; most of the women are only partially dressed.

"I'm not sure why this film is so difficult to obtain in the US, english versions have been released in the UK and Ireland.  I sincerely hope that it's eventually released on Blu-ray -- as this movie is pure eye candy.  It is a joy and pleasure to watch.The story is simple enough; criticisms almost variably focus on the film's message of racial and cultural equality.  Yes, the film has a message but it's presented in a very tasteful way. The movie makes it's pount without rubbing your nose in the obvious.The characters in this film are also beautifully represented; they are robust personalities that you can relate to. I honestly can't say enough good things about this movie.The special edition of Azur & Asmar seen in this listing is Korean and it region 3.  The set itself is wonderful; the book is high quality and contains stills taken from the film.

"I'd owned a few digital cameras before settling on this one, and I never regretted my purchase until now.  I say this because the camera is dead, and Olympus estimates the repair at $174.  That's just plain crazy.Turns out my problem is a fairly common one, so if you get this camera my advice would be to get the protection plan.  My camera lasted about two years.Contrary to the negative reviews on here, I think it got excellent battery life.  Try a Nikon CoolPix if you want to see crappy battery life.  Even with plain old AA's this camera would power up for a good while... but I would typically get those super-duper lithium batteries.  You pay more but they last far longer.As for the slow shutter speed, I agree it is a problem at time.  But I started using the sports setting for my action shots.  This helped.This is a good little camera, and it took great pictures. Just be aware of the fact that it's most likely mechanical failure will cost you the price of a new camera.  I'm not a fan of protection plans, but I would definitely suggest it here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2008","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQEYLKK78VZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A7B9YY#wasThisHelpful","R1CQEYLKK78VZS","A2P21NHBQPON20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P21NHBQPON20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"THE EARLY STRING QUARTETS by Beethoven, as recorded by Takacs Quartet on the Decca label, is a 2-disc set, with a small booklet with seven pages in English.  We learn that the members oare Edward Dusinberre, Karoly Schranz, Roger Tapping, and Andras Feyer.  The recordings were at St. Georges in Bristol.  Bristol is a town on the west coast of England, with an interesting history.  For example, town of Brycgstow (meaning the place at the bridge) was founded by 1000 and by  1020, was a trading center with a mint producing silver pennies. By 1067 Brycgstow was a well-fortified burh, capable of resisting an invasion sent from Ireland by Harold Godwinson's sons.Anyway, this is a review of the cuts on the second of the two discs.  Overall, it is the case that Takacs Quartet sometimes imposes a bouncing, oscillating quality to the music.  Perhaps, the goal is to prevent the music from being bogged down (though, this is not imply that, without the oscillating quality, the music would be bogged down).  Similarly, it is the case that Hilary Hahn's recording of the Bach Violin Sonatas possess a bouncy, springy quality, which makes these recordings especially engaging, and contrast them from the intolerably monotonous recordings by Elizabeth Wallfisch of the same Bach sonatas.  At any rate, the Takacs recording of these Beethoven pieces are exciting, and invite repeated listenings. The second disc has 12 cuts, which consists of Quartets Nos. 4, 5, and 6.Cut 1.  Begins with a theme having slightly ominous overtones.  Cut 1 is vigorous and occasionally bouncing and romping.  The piece is distinguished in that the flow of the piece is occasionally punctuated by a short disruptive motif that resembles a saw being used to cut through a thick wooden board.  (8 minutes, 10 second).Cut 2.  Begins with a dainty dance tune.  The piece is actually a fugue, where the tune is overlaid upon a motoristic chugging motif. (6 min, 18 sec).Cut 3.  This is played with a pronounced oscillation in volume.  At 1 min, 30 sec, the piece has a sudden change in character, perhaps sounding like a shepherd in an alpine valley calling to his flock, followed by a response of bleating.  (3 min, 30 sec)Cut 4.  The piece begins with a skittering motif that is repeated a few times, and this is followed by a lush flowing motif that is also repeated a few times.  At 1 min, 15 seconds, the skittering motif returns but this time it is more aggressive.  At 2 min, 50 sec, the listener is treated to the plucked cello.  This is one of the few cuts on this disc that has some repetitive qualities.  (4 min, 0 sec).Cut 5.  This piece is gentle throughout, and it is distinguished by a motif where one note is played like this, ""Dum-ta-dum-ta, dum-ta-dum-ta,"" followed by a flourish reminiscent of a playground swing, whisking back and forth.  The playground motif is in three quarters time.  (6 min, 35 sec).Cut 6.  This is the boring cut of the disc, because the piece is dull.  At 2 min, 40 sec, Takacs Quartet engages in its distinctive exaggerated oscillations in volume.  This sounds like somebody playing with the volume knob (this is not a complaint, it is just an observation).  (5 min, 10 sec.)Cut 7. This begins with a tune having a descending motif, ""Da-dahhhh, dee-dee-dee-dee-deeeee,"" that concludes with an upwards flourish.  At 2 min, 35 seconds, the pace doubles, and the repeated nature of what has transpired so far, is reiterated.  This piece would be good for contra dancing, because of the steady rhythm, because of the lack of jarring surprises, and because of the repetitiveness.  At 4 min, begins an extended motif sounding like a flock of birds.  The descending motif, ""Da-dahhhh, dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee"" is still hanging on, and at 6 minutes, this descending motif is repeated with enhanced vigor.  (9 min, 10 sec).Cut 8.  Skittering and jittery episodes separated by brief motifs that are gliding.  At 3 min, the vigor increases, and the various motifs are repeated, but at a higher point in the register or at a lower point in the register.  From my notes, it appears that I especially liked Cut 8.  I wrote these notes while commuting from a biotech company in South San Francisco, eastwards over the Bay Bridge, in the slow traffic.  (6 min, 25 sec)  In my notes, I wrote, ""6 min, 25 sec of bliss."")Cut 9.  This cut is more like a contra dance, with more repetition, and a greater number of easily recognizable guideposts.  The violins and cello are treated as equals, and they take turns in leading the way, each singing the same quirky melody.  The melody goes like this, ""Ta-dah, up, down, dup, down, uuuuuup, down.""  I liked Cut 9, though the melody seems a bit silly.  6 min, 0 sec of silliness.Cut 10.  This is a slow piece.  At 5 min, 40 sec, what happens is a brief change in atmosphere, then after a half minute, the original atmosphere returns, and things just fade away.  (6 min, 40 sec).Cut 11.  This is a lively piece, and is distinguished by occasional prolonged violin trills on a high note.  After 90 seconds, comes a special effect, resembling one of the many, many special effects found in the Paganini Violin Concertos.  The special effect in the Beethoven Quartet, is like a slinky collapsing. (3 min, 0 sec).Cut 12.  Starts out very slowly, with an ascending theme, punctuated by ominous splashes. A ten second series of ominous splashes occurs at 2 min, 20 sec.  Then comes a very ominous ascending motif from a low-throated cello.  At 3 min, 30 seconds, a merry tune issues forth.  Despite being a merry tune, it is not repetitive, and certainly would not be suitable for contra dancing.  At 6 min, 20 sec, starts an ominous interlude.  (8 min, 0 seconds).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38T6N4J59EYFS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000SWNHK#wasThisHelpful","R38T6N4J59EYFS","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS takes place in San Francisco, with about equal time given to a run down area in Chinatown and to upscale environment in the nearby financial district.  Please note that, aside from the main street in Chinatown, Grant Avenue, many of nearby side streets are somewhat run down.  The run down areas extend for only one or two blocks, to the east and to the west, of Grant Avenue.  The main characters include Will Smith, his young son, his wife, and a hiring manager at a financial firm, played by Brian Howe.Will Smith's job is to sell bone scanners.  During much of the movie, Will Smith is shown toting a box resembling a typical box that contains a Singer sewing machine.  The film shows Will Smith visiting various doctor's offices, attempting to gain a sale.  We learn that he needs to sell two bone scanner machines per month, in order to break even.  Will Smith's wife has a job too, but it is a humble laundry worker job.  In the opening moments of the movie, we see Will Smith in his neighborhood, accompanied by his son.  Graffiti decorates the outside walls of the businesses on the side streets in Chinatown, and we see an area with the F-word, and next to that is the word, HAPPYNESS. Will Smith asks the owner of the business, an elderly Chinese man, to remove the graffiti, because it is not appropriate.  But the man is not responsive to Will Smith's request.  In a couple of other scenes, we see Will Smith dropping his son off at a daycare center, which is run by an old Chinese woman.  Will Smith requests that the woman discontinue her behavior in exposing the children to television programs, and instead engage in, for example, reading stories or teaching games.  The old Chinese woman disagrees, and resists this suggestion.  These features of the plot line establish that Will Smith is a caring parent who has the goal of acting responsibly.ROADBLOCKS. Don't worry, I do not give away the ending.  In fact, I will only disclose the many roadblocks that occur in the course of Will Smith's occupation as a bone scanner salesman, and in his quest to gain entry to an internship to become a stockbroker.(1) On the visit to one medical doctor, the bone scanner does not work.(2) During his initial visit to the financial firm, when he wishes to apply for a job, Will Smith leaves his bone scanner in the care of a hippie girl who is playing guitar on the sidewalk.  But the hippie girl steals the bone scanner, and disappears in the subway, that is, in Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).(3) A nutty man, with long scraggly hair, believes that the bone scanner is a time machine, and he steals one of the bone scanners.(4) Will Smith's wife has a humble job in a laundry, but the income enables the family to pay most of the bills.  The wife has no faith that Will Smith will every be able to support the family, and she threatens to move to New York, and that is just what she does.  As was the case in the another movie, Kramer v. Kramer, she abandons her young son.(5) Will Smith secures a job interview with the financial firm, but the day before, when he is painting his apartment, the police arrive.  The police take him to jail for the night.  His only clothes are a T shirt, old jacket, and blue jeans, and his face is splattered with paint.  The next morning, when he is released from jail, he arrives at his job interview, but does not have time to dress in his usual formal business attire.  Instead, he shows up for the interview in the T shirt, with face splattered with paint.  Will Smith manages to turn this very negative situation into a positive feature of his character, and he does this by an impromptu spiel.(6) During his internship with the financial firm, Will Smith is invited to a baseball game with a potential client.  The potential client is shown to live in an upper class home, and he offers Will Smith the opportunity to join him in a box seat to see the San Francisco Giants.  Thus, for this ten minute interlude in the movie, it looks as though Will Smith will make a sale.  But then, the potential client exclaims that there is no way that he will ever do business with Will Smith's company, and will not trust this company with his retirement plan.  The refusal is done in a good-natured way, and Will Smith handles the refusal with aplomb and is not fazed.CONCLUSION.  Basically, this is a film about showing tenacity during a prolonged job hunt, when everything goes wrong.  I only know of one other movie that travels along the same territory, namely, KRAMER v. KRAMER, where Dustin Hoffman loses his job and scrambles to find  a new one.  As is the case with THE PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS, it is the case that the main character has a young son and is dumped by his wife.  In HAPPYNESS, the wife moves from California to New York, and in KRAMER v. KRAMER, the wife moves from the east coast to California.  During essentially all of story, Will Smith manages to stay cool, collected, and professional.  On only one occasion, occurring at about one hour and 17 minutes into the movie, it is the case that Will Smith loses his composure.  This movie will likely be an inspiration to any person who finds himself subjected to that feature of the game of life (not always a rational game), called the job interview","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PMBNX45E1UEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N6U0E2#wasThisHelpful","R3PMBNX45E1UEE","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LONELY PLANET MAKE MY DAY SAN FRANCISCO is a guidebook with a cardboard cover that is 20 pages long. The subtitle, ""make my day"" is a reference to a famous line from the Dirty Harry movie, a film located in San Francisco.The cover is made of thick cardboard, and this is not quite a hardcover book. All of the pages, as well as a flimsy paper map in the back of the book, are secured to a white metal spiral binding. Each page is made of sturdy glossy paper, and most of the pages are sliced into three sections, where each of the three sections can be turned independently of each other. Thus, rather than state that the book has 20 pages, it might be more appropriate to describe the book as having 60 flaps.When the book is open, the flap on the left side has a large thumbnail photo of a particular feature while, on the right side, the corresponding flap has an informative paragraph and a tiny color map. This is a very clever and attractive feature of the book. The publisher's goal was to enable the travel to independently adjust the flaps, so that the top flap would show one attraction of interest, the middle flap another attraction, and the bottom flap yet another attraction. Thus, the goal was to enable the traveler to acquire idle amusement by creating ""the perfect day,"" consisting of whatever is revealed by the top, middle, and bottom flap. Of course, just because it is possible to create your perfect day in this way, does NOT prevent you from spending the entire week visiting only features that in the top flaps.Each flap has different attractions, such as GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE, LOMBARD STREET, and CHINATOWN, as well as less iconic attractions, such as CABLE CAR MUSEUM, CITY LIGHTS BOOKSTORE, and DE YOUNG MUSEUM.I have visited San Francisco at least 200 times, in the past few decades, and am familiar with all of the attractions disclosed in this book, except for ALCATRAZ (nevah been there, and nevah will go there), SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS (I did see Pink Floyd perform in the Giants baseball park, though), BEAT MUSEUM, and KABUKI SPA. The written narratives are informative and not merely happy-sounding literary fluff. For example, regarding the MISSION DISCTRICT MURALS, we read that these are found on a street called, Balmy Alley, and that one mural depicts Archbishop Oscar Romero. Regarding CABLE CAR MUSEUM, we read that one can see three original cable cars from the 1870s, and that the cables were invented by Andrew Hallidie in 1873.CONCLUSION. This is a fine guidebook for travelers who do not have patience to thumb through a typical 200-page guidebook. Of course, every resident of the San Francisco Bay area will be able to name a great tourist destination that is NOT in this booklet. In my opinion, the omissions include FORT FUNSTON, where one can view at close range the hang gliders, and watch dare-devils step off into space from the side of a high cliff, and become carried aloft over the Pacific Ocean. Another omission is STOW LAKE, which is one of the tamer features of San Francisco, but which can always be relied upon for a predictable afternoon of relaxing boating among the turtles and stone bridges. But perhaps number one on my list of ""San Francisco attractions,"" is the hike and view from the northern side of the Golden Gate Bridge to Fort Barry, which provides one of the most dramatic views of any city in all America. But technically, Fort Barry is not really in San Francisco. To me, the book is more like a novelty than a real source of information. However, to a person who has been to San Francisco only one time, or perhaps never, than the book is likely to be tantalizing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SZ954A1S2JPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743606990#wasThisHelpful","R2SZ954A1S2JPK","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"ANCIENT PLACES by Jack Nisbet is a 240-page book, apparently about some of the geologic wonders in the Pacific Northwest, that is, in the states of Oregon and Washington.  These wonders include the Willamette Meteorite (page 39-66) and the Missoula Floods (pages 23-38 and 223-229).  It is difficult to understand what this book is about, unless one is already familiar with the subject matter.  For example, in the beginning of the chapter on the Missoula Floods, we read:""Farmed fields spot its interior, and tribal lore tells of epic horse races around its perfectly flat top.  It was a searing summer day when I visited the base of the mesa's north side with a group of Spokane tribal friends.  On the edge of a quiet neighborhood, we parked near a stand of cattails that marked a small spring"" (page 23).Thus, it is the case that in the first few pages of this chapter (pages 23-38), it is impossible to figure out what is the subject matter.  The writing in this book is more like a diary, that is, where the author's intent in writing is only as a sort of self-therapy.  However, for a book intended for the public, the author should refrain from being so evasive in disclosing the intended topic.  Also in this chapter (page 32), we read, ""YouTube videos monitoring the removal of modern concrete dams attest to the power of this process,"" but no citation is given.  The reader is not provided with the names or authors of any YouTube videos.  Moreover, please note that YouTube videos can be removed at any time, without notice.  Again, the book is more like a home-grown diary than a real book.I have done my homework on the Missoula Floods, and I recommend the following books:(1) D. Alt (2001) Glacial Lake Missoula and Its Humongous Floods (208 pages).(2) J. Soennichsen (2009) Bretz's Flood: The Remarkable Story of a Rebel Geologist and the World's Greatest Flood (304 pages).(3) J. Allen and M. Burns (2009) Cataclysms on the Columbia: the Great Missoula Floods (216 pages).(4) V. Baker (1981) Catastrophic Flooding: The Origin of the Channeled Scabland (360 pages).Also, I very much recommend the NOVA video, which is available in the DVD format, and also for free on YouTube.  This video is, ""NOVA:Mystery of the Megaflood (2006) Produced by Ben Fox (56 minutes).CONCLUSION.  To conclude, in viewing the author's publications on Amazon.com website, it appears that the author is successful, and is liked by his readers, and that he has found his own literary niche.  Please also note, that, as a pastime, I have shown an ongoing and chronic interest in the subject-matter of Mr. Nisbet's books, that is, ecology and geology of the Pacific Northwest (as well as of California and Wisconsin).  However, I am not attracted to the aimless chit-chat writing style that is utilized by the author.  Well, as they say, ""to each his own,"" and as they say, ""different strokes for different folks.""","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294P1L6TIO2UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1570619808#wasThisHelpful","R294P1L6TIO2UU","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LONELY PLANET DISCOVER FRANCE is a 415-page guidebook by Berry, Averbuck and Butler.  The book is printed on glossy paper.  Essentially every other page has a color photograph or a color map.  The rear cover has a paper fold-out map of Paris, printed on flimsy paper.  The map includes many colors: beige (city blocks), yellow (main streets), white (other streets), green (parks), and blue (rivers), with names of important locations printed in red, e.g., MUSEE DE LOUVRE, MUSEE D'ORSAY, and CATHEDRALE NOTRE DAME DE PARIS.Because most of the photographs are small, and because there is not much writing, as compared to guidebooks from FODOR'S or FROMMER'S, I would imagine that the budget for this book was relatively small and, moreover, I would guess that the authors were in the state of pain because the small budget prevented them from writing, at length, about all of the glorious things to see and do in France.CHAPTERS.  The book has seven chapters, where the edges of each chapter are color-coded with a different color:(1) Paris;(2) Normandy and Brittany Spears;(3) Champagne and Northern France;(4) Loire Valley and Central France;(5) Lyon and French Alps;'(6) Bridget Bordeaux and French Basque Country;(7) Provence and French Riviera.GRIPE WITH SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS.  The book is filled with many photographs, but unfortunately, most of the photographs are small, and also unfortunately, many of the photographs were trimmed to create a round-shaped photograph.  Although the designers of this book meant well, I find the circular photographs to be annoying.  The circular photos are annoying because they are not true to what was intended by the photographer, and also because they remove the context from the photograph.  The book, as a whole cannot be read for enjoyment --  the book can only be read for information.RESTAURANT REVIEWS.  This reproduces a couple of the restaurant reviews.  The writing is fine.  On page 158 we read about LE MILLENAIRE, which states, ""San and claret hues and contemporary artworks create an air of intimate sophistications at this Michelin-starred haunt.  Chef Laurent Laplaige keeps flavors crisp and seasonal with specialties such as wild sea bass with celery, truffle risotto and Champaigne sauce.""  I liked the fact that the writing identifies the chef.On page 237, we read about LE RESTAURANT DE FOURVIER, which states, ""The views are so incredible that it'd be easy for this superbly located restaurant to be a tourist trap, so it's all the more impressive because it's not.  Instead, it concentrates on well-prepared local specialties, including a stellar salade lyonnaise (lettuce, bacon, poached egg and croutons).""  As you can see, the restaurant reviews are like thumbnail photographs in a high school yearbook.  They really do not provide enough information for you to make a decision.  The restaurant reviews merely serve the purpose of convincing the reader that the restaurant exists.PHOTOGRAPHS.  The most interesting of the photographs are as follows.Roman aqueduct near Nimes (page 21).Chateau de Chambord at the Loire River (page 35)Moulin Rouge, which has performances of dancing with costumes (page 94).Etretat cliff in Normandy, which has spectacular sea arches and white cliffs, where the cliffs have lengthy horizontal sedimentary lines (pages 108-109).Mont St. Michel (page 112) and also six tiny photographs on pages 130-131).Bayeux Tapestry (a very tiny picture on page 113, and a larger picture on page 122).  I have two books about Bayeux Tapestry.  In my opinion, if you did not already know about Bayeux Tapestry, this book would not be able to communicate to you the fact that it is a very spectacular thing.Notre Dame (page 160 (exterior); page 173 (interior).Vimy Ridge (page 176, World War I brick-lined trench where Canadians fought in April 1917).Chateau de Chenonceau (page 179.  This is one of the few full-page photographs in this book.  This is a castle built over Cher River, in the year 1515).Chateau de Charemeont (page 194, with huge cylindrical corner towers, built in 1465).Gorges l'Ardeche (page 223, a river located in a modest canyon, located near Lyon)Basilique Notre Dame de Fourviere (page 233, a beautiful church built in the late 1800s, with nearby Roman theater built in AD 120).Mer de Glace 9page 240.  This photograph is of a glacier near Mont Blanc.  Finally, in this book, we have a photo of a dramatic mountain)Aiguille du Midi (page 242.  More dramatic mountains, also at Mount Blanc, showing tourists meandering around on the snow, who apparently had arrived in a cable car tram.)Le Cap Horn (page 244.  A huge chalet in the Alps, with tourists meandering about)Pont du Gard 9pge 315.  A 3-tiered aquaduct built in 19BC by the Romans.

"WITNESS is a color movie, taking place in the present area, mostly at a rural community of Lancaster, Pennsylvania inhabited by the Amish. Parts of the movie take place in the grittier parts of Philadelphia. (Perhaps this is a tautology, since Philadelphia has been known, for many decades, as a gritty city.) The characters include Harrison Ford, who plays a young detective in the police force, Danny Glover who plays a corrupt policeman who partners with a couple of other on the police force to sell illegal drugs, Kelly McGillis, who is an Amish woman and who plays the love interest, and Lukas Haas who plays the son of single mother Kelly McGillis. Kelly McGillis has acted in about 27 movies, as of this writing, and Lukas Haas, who was about ten years old at the time of filming, has acted in about 54 movies, as of this writing.CLEVER PLOT DIRECTIONS. This is such a gripping movie, that I hate to give away too much. At any rate, I will disclose only one of the clever aspects of the plot. Early in the movie, Kelly McGillis and her son set forth from their Amish community to a train station in downtown Philadelphia. Their plan is to visit a relative in Baltimore. In the train station, the son witnesses a murder in the men's room. From the partly open door of the toilet stall, he sees Danny Glover and another man murder a man who is busy washing his face in the sink. The boy hides in the toilet stall. Within minutes, the murder victim is found, and Harrison Ford is brought to the scene of the crime, and he is the first to interview the boy. There are a few cute scenes, where the mother and son, both dressed in somber Amish garb, are noticed by typical city folk, and are apparently considered an amusing curiosity. At any rate, Harrison Ford brings the boy to the police station, where he is shown a lineup of about ten suspects, and where he is shown hundreds of photos in a book of suspects. The boy responds that none of these are the murderer. The boy ambles about the busy police office. Some employees are busy booking a petty criminal. Other employees are busy typing. Other employees are busy walking too and fro. The boy is fascinated, and he freely explores the busy office, until he comes to a small museum-type display of baseball statues, police paraphernalia, and newspaper clippings. One of the newspaper clippings shows Danny Glover, winning some sort of award. The photo in the clipping is in black and white, and the photo itself is somewhat fuzzy. But the boy recognizes him immediately, and reports this to Harrison Ford. In my opinion, this is one of the most clever moments every committed to film, and it represents one of the distinct turning points in the entire repertoire of American screenwriting.CULTURE CLASHES. As it turns out, Harrison Ford needs to live with the Amish for several weeks. (I am not giving away the reason!!!) Amusing culture clashes occur, where Harrison Ford is provided with an Amish man's outfit, which is all black, and comes with a round wide-brimmed hat. The result is almost comedic. Eventually, Harrison Ford becomes accepted into the community, because he proves himself to be a hard worker and, in particular, skilled in carpentry. He repairs a large wooden birdhouse, he uses a plane with great skill for smoothening wood, he uses a manual drill skillfully during the assembly of a large wooden barn, and he does not complain when he is required to wake up at 4:30 in the morning to milk the cows. The love interest develops very gradually, and the viewer will be impressed by Harrison Ford's behavior in refraining from being too forward with Kelly McGillis. He refrains from being too forward because, in his own words, he realizes that Kelly McGillis might be driven out of her community. In fact, her father expressly tells he that she risks being driven out. The father uses the technical term for this, which is being ""shunned."" Another quaint aspect of the Amish, as disclosed in the movie, is the fact that Harrison Ford has a wound in his abdomen, and one of the Amish elders realizes that the wound will likely be infected, and so he ""treats"" the wound with a mixture of milk and linseed oil. The dialogue, at least for the parts of the movie that are filmed on the rural farm, are peppered with German, though it is apparent that all of the Amish are bi-lingual. Another culture class is that between the Amish and the Mennonites, who lived in a nearby community. The issue is that the Mennonites allow themselves to use some modern devices and machinery, while the Amish are circumspect in avoiding these things. Yet another culture class, takes place when the Amish drive into town in their horse'n'buggy devices, and are met with derision by young hoodlums in the town. The hoodlums harass the Amish, complaining that the buggy is blocking traffic, and complaining that the Amish never serve in the military. Harrison Ford responds by calmly climbing out of the buggy, ambling up to one of the hoodlums, and driving his fist directly into the hoodlum's nose, resulting in the hoodlum becoming an unintentional blood donor.The film also discloses that the Amish are considered to be freaks by out-of-town visitors, who gawk at them and shove cameras into their faces, and this leads up to an amusing moment involving a gentle confrontation between Harrison Ford and an elderly tourist. Please picture Harrison Ford dressed in Amish garb, black pants that are four inches too short, a black jacket, and a round wide-brimmed black hat. The tourist is a wrinkled old lady dressed in a cheap Woolworth blouse. The blouse has a splashy red pattern in the poorest taste. The old lady tries to take Harrison Ford's picture. Harrison Ford warns her, ""If you take my picture I'm gonna rip of your brassiere!""CHARMING DISCLOSURE OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. This film provides a slice of life disclosure of the human condition. Although the film concerns police corruption, and culture clashes of various kinds, I believe that there are some universal lessons to be learned from the story. Throughout the film, the continual cat-and-mouse activities involving the corrupt employees of the police force and Harrison Ford and his new-found Amish friends, provide more than enough thrilling suspense to those who respond favorably to suspenseful action movies.

"CHANGELING is a drama set in Los Angeles and in the Riverside area.  In a nutshell, Angelina Jolie plays a young mother of a 9-year old son, where early in the movie the boy is kidnapped.  The Los Angeles Police Department  (LAPD) shows little interest in providing aid.  Early in the movie, a boy from Iowa is sent by train to Los Angeles, where he claims to be the son of Angelina Jolie.  Much of the storyline concerns Angelina Jolie's continued insistence that she is NOT the mother, and the continuing insistence by the boy and by LAPD that she IS the mother.  The plot goes like this:  ""You're his mother""  ""I'm not his mother""  ""You're his mother""  ""I'm not his mother""  ""You're his mother""  ""I'm not his mother.""  This is a recurring theme.  Eventually, a minister, a police detective, and a prominent attorney, come to Angelina Jolie's assistance, and overcome the Nazi-style tactics taken by LAPD in attempting to brainwash Angelina Jolie's character.One of the many brilliant features of this movie, is the Angelina Jolie's acting, where she has mental breakdown upon learning that her son was kidnapped, and her mixed-emotion breakdown of pain/relief when she learns that her son (the false son) was found in Iowa and is being returned to her.  Another brilliant feature of the movie, is from child-actor Devon Gearhart, who plays a boy who escaped from the chicken coop, and who discloses information about the serial killer to the LAPD detective, and who has a mental breakdown in the LAPD interrogation room when he relates the facts to the detective.The plot concerns The Wineville Chicken Coop Murders, which was a series of abductions and murders of young boys that occurred in Los Angeles and Riverside County, California, between 1926 and 1928.  On the pleasant side, it can be said that this movie is a ""period piece.""  Every viewer will enjoy the outfits worn by female and male actors.  Also enjoyable, are the many automobiles from the era, as well as scenes in a telephone company with dozens of female telephone operators, plugging and unplugging wires, and using roller skates to facilitate mobility about the telephone operator's workroom.On the unpleasant side, it is the case that Angelina Jolie's character is mentally jerked around, and bullied by LAPD, from scene to scene to scene.  But fortunately, it is the case that Angelina Jolie's character is a courageous one, and she prevails despite all.  Also on the unpleasant side, are the brainwashing tactics taken by the Los Angeles Police Department, in aggressively persuading Angelina Jolie that she must accept the fact that she has been re-united with her true son, and in aggressively trying to persuade her that her role in life is to accept the boy as her son (even though she is not), where LAPD's Nazi-era tactics include incarcerating Angelina Jolie in a mental hospital where she is administered electric shock ""therapy.""CHANGELING was written by J. M. Straczynski, who is the author of many contemporary comic books.  Clint Eastwood is the director, and he displays the same genius and wisdom in portraying the human condition, as he did in GRAN TORINO, a film about Hmong immigrants in Detroit, Michigan.  The characters can be neatly divided into the good guys and the bad guys.  The good guys include Michael Kelly, who plays a police detective who believes Angelina Jolie that the boy from Iowa is not really her son.  Michael Kelly tracks down the serial killer.  Another good guy is Geoff Pierson, who plays an attorney who represents Angelina Jolie, pro bono, in her lawsuit against LAPD.  John Malkovich is another good guy, who is a reverend who crusades against LAPD, and who provides moral support and guidance to Angelina Jolie, and who drums up public support for her cause.The bad guys include Jeffrey Donovan, who plays Captain J. Jones.  Mr. Donovan uses an Irish accent.  Jeffrey Donovan is so utterly despicable and disgusting in this movie, that his character is so overwhelmingly appealing that it is a joy whenever he appears on the screen.  In another movie, TUSKEGEE AIRMAN, John Lithgow also plays a character who is so utterly despicable and disgusting, that the viewer shivers with pleasure whenever he appears on the screen.  All of the staff members in the mental hospital are also bad guys.  And last but not least, Jason Harner who plays the serial killer is another bad guy.  He plays a man who is totally nuts, in the same way that Gregory Peck's depiction of Ahab, in the movie MOBY DICK, is another character who is a genuine madman.Also notable are two characters who look ugly.  The front desk clerk in the mental hospital is ugly.  Also, the man who supervises the execution at San Quentin Prison is also ugly.  The ugly people provide a great contrast, to the overwhelmingly lovely clothing that is worn by the male and female actors in this movie.DISCLAIMER.  I made no attempt to explore or confirm the historical basis of any aspect of this film.  I have no interest in politics, and I have never had any interest in politics.  Generally, my only leisure interests are landscape photography, hiking, British history from the years 800 to 1650, classical music, be bop jazz, New Wave music from the early 1980s, and classic rock'n'roll and Motown.

"If Fire Cider is meant to be a beverage, then it is my opinion that it is meant to be sipped in small amounts.  The product is is called, ""cider,"" indicating that it is supposed to be a beverage.  The stongest of the several flavors in this product is HORSERADISH.  The second most prominent flavor is GINGER.  The beverage also has a fragrance, and this is a VINEGAR fragrance.  There are other flavors and fragrances, as is evident from the ingredients list (apple cider, vinegar, honey, oranges, lemons, horseradish, ginger).  In my opinion, I think that more honey should have been included, and the conumer is certainly free to add sugar or more honey.  Although horseradish is the strongest flavor, it is not the case that the product is too hot.  In otger words, this is not in any way hot like jajapenos.  There is a bit too much vinegar, and the result is that the product makes me think of a chemical ckeanser or antiseptic, or what have you.  To conclude, if I am in the mood for an extra-tangy product such as this, I think that i will stick to ginger beer.  By the way, this is not an alcoholic drink.  Actually, I have no idea if this product is supposed to be a beverage, salad dressing, or additive for alcoholic drinks, such as a bloody mary.  If the product is meant as a salad dressing, then perhaps FIVE stars would be fine.  I do like horseradish.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R307FU188VEZZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CLPUYTO#wasThisHelpful","R307FU188VEZZG","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MEN OF WAR by Alexander Rose is a 460-page history book on American military history.  The book is divided into three sections, (1) BUNKER HILL, 1775; (2) GETTYSBURG, 1863; and (3)  IWO JIMA, 1945.  Each of these sections is, in turn, divided into chapters, 8, 19, and 18 chapters, respectively.SCHOLARLY WRITING.  Although the book is a scholarly one, it is easy to read and the narratives grab on to the reader and reading the book is almost like watching a fast-paced movie.  I characterize the book as ""scholarly"" for the following reasons.  First, the section on NOTES is long and it is tiny font, perhaps point 9 font (pages 367-424).  Also, there is an extensive BIBLIOGRAPHY section (pages 425-452), also in tiny font.Second, the book is scholarly because of the use of original sources.  Please note that the first two sections of this book date from before the 20th century.  Page 425 of the bibliography lists 17 sources, and all but six of these date from the late 1800s or before.  To give another example, page 427 lists 24 references, and all but eight are from the late 1800s or before.  I enjoyed the fact that many of the sources are diaries that were written by soldiers.  I don't see how it is possible to get a source that is more primary and more original than a diary.  And note, I think that a diary will be more reliable than a newspaper account.Third, the book is scholarly because the author refrains from using any decorative writing.  There are no fictional conversations.  There is no attempt to invent emotions about the various historical figures.  In the entire repertoire of books on American history, there is only one book that I truly hate and detest.  This is ""The Crisis of the Old Order: 1919-1933, The Age of Roosevelt"" by Schlesinger.  Schlesinger's books (and also other lesser known books on American history) are drenched with imaginary conversations and speculations on emotions.  But Alexander Rose never uses these icky literary devices.GEOGRAPHY AND TIME.  Where appropriate, the book is careful to disclose relevant facts on both geography and time.  On page 16, we read about General Putnam's attack on Bunker Hill.  We learn that Bunker Hill is a moderate rise, that it is on a triangular piece of land, and that it is connected to the mainland by a narrow strip of land.  Regarding the time element, we read about ""late at night,"" ""early the next morning,"" ""either that day or next,"" and ""eventually.""  It is possible that these literary devices are best suited for military narratives.  Perhaps yes, perhaps no.  Either way, I am glad for this author's inclusion of little blurbs about geography and time.TECHNOLOGY OF THE ERA.  To provide an example, we read on page 19 about the clothing of the day.  We read that soldiers wore, ""a kind of loose frock, reaching half way down the thighs, with large sleeves, and so wide as to lap over a foot or more when belted.  Their gaiters or stockings were tanned a dead-leaf color in vats.""Regarding the technology of weapons, we read that, ""Ezekiel Worthen of Kensington, New Hampshire, shouldered a French musket, made in 1752,"" and that ""the British were using Brown Bess muskets dating as far back as 1730.""Moving on the third section in this book, which concerns IWO JIMA, we read on pages 225-226 that soldier Allen Matthews ran through his checklist, ""canteen tops tightly screwed.  Yes.  Grenade pins bent sufficiently to keep them from being pulled accidentally.  Yes.  Chamber and operating rod of my rifle free of dust.  Yes.  And of course extra cigarettes were in the gas mask carrier.""Regarding gas, we read about use of gas by the Japanese, and we learn that at Peleliu, the Japanese kept ""stockpiles of glass spheres filled with hydrocyanic acid, a volatile nerve agent"" (page 226).HUMOR.  The author allows humor to creep into the narratives.  For example, in the account of gas masks, we read that ""James Vedder, a battalion surgeon with the 27th Marines, used his gas mask to store six apples and oranges that he'd liberated from ship's mess that morning.""MILITARY STRATEGY.  Of course, much of the writing in this book discloses military strategy.  In the section on BUNKER HILL, we read that, ""the senior men of local dynasty, the veterans of the French and Indian War, occupied a company's top slots, captain, lieutenant, sergeant, while their younger relatives served as privates or drummers"" (page 43)  In the section on IWO JIMA, we learn that it is a bad idea to share your foxhole with others, ""John McMahon made the mistake of clustering in a shell hole with twelve others.  Inevitably, a shell arrived, McMahon was the sole survivor.""GRAPHIC WRITING.  Well, this is a book about soldiers and war, and so there is going to be some graphic writing.  As is the case with essentially all of the writing in this book, the writing has a YOU-ARE-THERE character.  On page 25, we read that Major Andrew McClary, a New Hampshire tavern keeper, would be torn apart when ""a random shot . . . passed directly through his body"" and that the head of a Dr. Dole would be carried off by a cannonball with such force that a passing sergeant saw ""a piece of the skin of his head with hair on it.""  We read that the most lethal aspect of cannonballs were balls that grazed the ground, bouncing and bouncing, towards dense formations of soldiers.On page 235, in the section on IWO JIMA, the graphic writing includes, ""Dan Levin plunged through ankle-deep water, found his footing in the sand, and next to him he was startled to discover was a Marine with a beautiful face and shoulders, and all below the shoulders was a viscous mess of rag.""CONCLUSION.  The book is a quick read, and would make an ideal gift for any boy from the age 12 and up, and to any and all adults.  The book can also be an excellent adjuvant that supplements books that focus on the decisions and personalities of generals and presidents, during the times of war.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCVUV9HGVXBKN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553805185#wasThisHelpful","RCVUV9HGVXBKN","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BRAHMS PIANO TRIO No. 1 and No. 2 was recorded by Arthur Rubinstein, Henryk Szering, and Pierre Fournier.  The recording is from September 1972.  The sound quality is excellent.  The piano is not muffled at all, and there are no annoying echoes.  Please note that the age of the recording might lead one to wonder about the sound quality.  For example, the Horowitz recording of Schumann's Toccata from the year 1969, available on CBS masterworks, has a sound that is of compromised quality, not unlike music from a radio with marginal reception.  However, the product under review has an excellent sound, so don't worry.PIANO TRIO No. 1.ALLEGRO CON BRIO. This begins with a stately theme on piano, which is then reiterated by the cello.  At 45 seconds into the piece, the violin joins in.  At 2 minutes, the pace doubles but only for 20 seconds, and this is followed by a slower interlude that is somewhat aleatory.  At 3 1/2 minutes, the music becomes motoristic and driving, and at 4 min, 15 sec, borders on being thrashing.  At 5 1/2 min, the trio engages in a sustained thrashing effort, and at 6 min, 20 sec, the original stately theme is revived.  At 8 min, 30 sec, the stately theme appears yet again but in a deccelerating manner that gets progressively quieter, and where each instrument provides individualistic flourishes.ALLEGRO MOLTO.  This begins with a 10-note theme that goes like this: 1-2-3, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4.  There is a little tune that goes with these notes, of course, but the tune just goes up by a note then down by two notes, and then back to the original note.  Although this is not much of a tune, the main point is the slightly ominous quality of the rhythm of the 10-note motif.  At 2 min, 15 sec, the listener is treated to a lovely melody, similar to that of the famed Brahms Lullaby, and here the tune is the main thing (not the rhythm).  At 4 min, 30 sec, the lullaby stops, and the 10-note motif returns.  At 6 minutes, the piano engages in Liberace-like flourishes, with arpeggios sweeping up and down the keyboardADAGIO.  In contrast to the first two movements, which are lively, driving, and loud, ADAGIO is quit and the pace is slow.  The music takes the form of pure elegance, and is not encumbered by any tune.  At 2 min, 40 sec, a melody makes its entrance, and it is vaguely reminiscent of SUNRISE, SUNSET from Fiddler on the Roof.  Later, the following motif appears.  The piano provides a series of 4 chords, slowly ascending as if climbing a flight of stairs.  Immediately after each 4 chord ascent, the strings provide a flourish.ALLEGO.  This begins with the following wistful motif, which is repeated over and over.  The motif is: WHAH-dit-dit-dit-dit, WHAH-dit-dit-dit-DIT, WHAH-dit-dit-dit-DIT.  There is, of course, a tune, but the tune is only two notes going down and then two notes going back up to the original note.  It is not much of a tune, and so the main thing is the rhythm.  (This is not a complaint.)  At 1 min, 10 sec, the motif is repeated but much louder.  At1 min, 20 sec, the listener is treated to a lively melody of astonishing beauty.  At 6 minutes, the original wistful motif makes another appearance, with the same rhythm, but much louder and with a somewhat modified tune.PIANO TRIO No. 2.ALLEGRO.  This begins with an awkward tune on cello.  The awkwardness continues for only a half minute.  At 2 min, 50 seconds, begins a distinctive series of piano doublets, sounding like hiccups.  The awkward tune is repeated at 3 min, 30 sec.  At 5 minutes, the listener is treated to a short dramatic interlude.ANDANTE.  This begins with a tune reminiscent of the opening moments of the song, ""Girl,"" from the Beatles's Rubber Soul album, where the lyrics go, ""Is there anybody going to listen to my story, all about the girl who came to stay?""  At 3 minutes, 55 seconds, the Girl-theme is repeated, but in a strident manner.  At 6 min, 20 sec, the Girl-theme occurs again, but this time it is wistful and gentle.SCHERZO.  This begins with an appealing jittery motif from the strings, which is accompanied by a nervous rumbling motif from the piano.  Then, the strings provide the jittery motif, but accompanied by arpeggios from the piano, sweeping up and down like Liberace.  At 1 min, 30 sec, the jitteriness is replaced by an engagingly beautiful tune, like yet another version of the Brahms Lullaby.  At 2 min, 30 sec, the lullaby is louder.  At 3 min, 20 sec, the jittery motif returns, along with the nervous rumblings from the piano.  And then, the jittery motif returns, accompanied by sweeping piano arpeggios.FINALE.This movement, which is 6 minutes and 53 seconds long, is distinguished by the appearance of the theme from THE SIMPSONS, composed by Danny Elfman.  This is not a complaint.  The similarity is striking.  Simpsons theme occurs at the beginning, and again at 20 seconds, at one minute 50 seconds (in a fragmented form), at 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and at 3 minutes and 47 seconds.  How fun it is to hear the Simpsons theme in this trio by Brahms.  At one minute and 20 seconds comes a brief playful motif, suitable for amusing children.  This playful motif is repeated at 4 min, 50 sec.  At 5 min, 40 sec, the fragment version of the Simpsons theme occurs again, interspersed with dramatic ascending flourishes from the piano.  The following concerns an INVERTED Simpsons theme.  An inverted Simpsons theme occurs at 2 min, 20 sec and again at 6 min, 20 sec.CONCLUSION.  I have only couple of concluding comments.  RCA Victor has a series of many re-issues, all of them in the format of a comfortable cardboard booklet (no plastic jewelbox) and an essay of some 40 pages long.  This series is called THE RUBINSTEIN COLLECTION.  I own several of these, including the BRAHMS VIOLIN SONATAS, also with Henryk Szeryng.  I recommend exploring all of the available titles.  Some time in the late 1960s, my father took me to see Mr. Rubinstein perform an evening of piano solo pieces in a large auditorium in San Francisco.  All I remember is that it was crowded.  Also, my father took me to a smaller auditorium in San Francisco to hear an evening of guitar music by Andres Segovia.  We sat near the back.  All I remember is looking through my telescope (a small one) because I wanted to count the number of frets on Mr. Segovia's guitar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCL2ZNYUS4X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0014LRMXM#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCL2ZNYUS4X8","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN is a chick-flick, mostly taking place in various scenic parts of Italy, with periodic scenes taking place in San Francisco, California. The dialogue is unusually intelligent. Although the plot invited the materialization of cinematographic cliches, it was rarely the case that a cliched plot element made an appearance. Actually, there was one cliched element, namely the romance between Pavel (a Polish immigrant laborer) and a teenaged Italian girl. The depiction of the rock-bottom, gnawing emotions that tend to dog victims of a messy break-up are painfully accurate in this movie. The continual barrage, and generous variety, of facial expressions from actress Diane Lane likely exceeds the variety and number of facial expressions from any other actor in any other film. The film has not one, but two surprise endings. In this review, I reveal the first, but not the second.AT FIRST, THE MOVIE THREATENS TO BE ANOTHER BORING WOODY ALLEN MOVIE. The film begins with a book signing party. A young man with a hint of scruffy beard and long tousseled hair is before a crowd in a book store, proudly holding his new book. He speaks praise of his college writing teacher (Diane Lane), who is in the audience with her Asian friend (actress Sandra Oh). The young man says, ""She said something to me that changed everything. She said that terrible ideas are like playground scapegoats. Given the right encouragement, they can grow up to be geniuses. She told me to work on one of my terrible ideas."" The crowd provides an enthusiastic applause to the young author, and the young man exclaims that he'd like to give his former professor a ""French kiss."" Sorry, I'm married, replies Diane Lane merrily, displaying her wedding ring on her finger. Things are going merrily at this point, and the viewer might suspect that this will become another extremely boring Woody Allen movie about pseudo-intellectuals. But this is not what happens.IRONY AND ECONOMY IN SCRIPTWRITING. A man appears from the crowd and engages in chit-chat with Diane Lane. As it turned out, the man is also an author, and it was the case that Diane Lane had published an unfavorable review about the man's book. In her review, she complained that is was unrealistic that a middle-aged man would live his teen fantasies by having an affair with a much younger lady. Then, the man from the crowd insists that the plot from his book was not unrealistic, because he'd based the plot on Diane Lane's husband (who was actively carrying on with a much younger lady). Diane Lane immediately understands the meaning of the man's comment, and without further ado, the next scene takes place in the office of a divorce lawyer. (I was truly amazed by the unusual economy of this scene. The director made no attempt to pad the scene, with depictions, for example, of Diane confronting her bad-behaving husband.)ANGUISH AND DESPAIR IN THE LAWYER'S OFFICE. In the lawyer's office, Diane Lane's face looks a mess, reflecting her anguish and despair. (I am not sure what she did to herself to make it appear as though she'd been crying for several hours on end, but she succeeded in acquiring this appearance.) The lawyer tells Diane Lane that her husband's girlfriend has a child, and that the husband wants to keep the house because it is near a good school. This further twists the corkscrew of anguish into Diane Lane's heart, and the viewer will easily feel the woman's increasing pain.CAMP DIVORCE AND EMPTY SHELL PEOPLE. In the next scene, Diane Lane moves into a small apartment, speaks with the landlord for a minute, then in her apartment collapses on the carpet in grief and despair. Through the walls, one can hear a divorced man, crying and moaning, because of his recent divorce. Diane Lane has reached rock-bottom. In the next scene, she calls up Sandra Oh, who plays a gay woman. Sandra is with her partner at home. They had been planning to go on a gay tour of Italy, but in sympathizing with Diane Lane, they invite her to accept one of their tour tickets. But Diane Lane is not receptive to this offer. ""What are you doing at Camp Divorce with all those losers,"" says Sandra Oh, regarding Diane's hesitance to accept the ticket. (I enjoyed the term, ""Camp Divorce."") ""I'm busy, I have to review all those books,"" says Diane, giving an excuse that her daytime job is keeping her too busy. Sandra Oh replies, ""I think you're in danger of never recovering. You known when you come across one of those empty shell people, and you think what the hell happened to you . . . this is no time to be a chicken s***.""BACK AT THE APARTMENT. MORE ECONOMY IN SCRIPTWRITING. Diane is back at her desk, and the neighbor's weeping can be heard through the walls again. Diane calls Sandro Oh, and agrees to take the plane ticket. The only thing that Diane says over the telephone is, ""Patty, when do I leave?"" (Sandra Oh plays Patty.) (This part of the plot was really stunning to me, because of its great economy. In other words, a big shift in the plot occurred with the utterance with only five words: Patty, when do I leave?)DIANE IN ITALY. The tour bus has a driver and host. The host says, ""Now I saw most of you hobnobbing, now Francis is straight and she just survived a terrible divorce, and she really needs our support. So Francis, why don't you stand up."" At this point, Diane Lane exhibits one, two, or perhaps three different emotions, and then without further hesitation, stands up with a broad smile. The gay men all applaud.The host then ambles up and down the aisle of the bus, pouring wine into each of the cups held by all the passengers. (At this point, we are only 14 minutes into the movie.) We motion picture camera lovingly caresses the colorful flower arms in Tuscany, gothic churches, and a street market, complete with a honking goose, and colorful grapes. Diane Lane's first attempts at speaking Italian with the locals are amusing, but more important, they indicate her willingness to adapt and learn.Diane pauses to chat with an American tourist, a young man. He asks her to writing a letter to his mom. Diane reads as she writes, and what she reads is, ""Dear Mom, it's market day in Cortona. The Piazza is an on-going party. Cliches converge at this navel of the world, you almost want to laugh. I eat a hot grape from the market and the violet sweetness breaks open in my mouth. It even smells purple."" The young American tourist does not like the letter, and he says that his mom would guess that he did not write it. So he hands the newly drafted letter to Diane Lane.BUYING AN OLD COUNTRY HOUSE. At 20 minutes into the movie, Diane abandons the bus tour, and decides on impulse to purchase an old country house visible from the road. The house is owned by an elderly woman. A young German couple are also interested in buying the house. But Diane Lane outbids them. In disgust, the German woman says, ""You greedy Americans, you think you're so entitled, you ruin everything."" The old lady eventually changes her mind, and decides to keep the house. The old lady adds that she might sell the house if there is a ""sign."" Moments later, the ""sign"" does appear, and it takes the form of poop landing on Diane Lane's shoulder. The poop came from one of the wild pigeons that were flying around the livingroom.DESCENDENTS OF ROMAN GODS. Diane talks with Sandra Oh, who is in San Francisco, and explains that she bought an old house. ""It needs a little work,"" says Diane Lane about her new villa in Tuscany. ""Who is going to do it,"" asks Sandra, knowing that Diane Lane doesn't know much about fixing houses. ""I am,"" exclaims Diane. ""Of course I didn't mean I was going to do all the work myself,"" she adds, ""I'm in Italy, I can hire the muscular descendents of Roman gods to do all the heaving lifting."" (I liked this bit of clever scriptwriting.)PREMONITION. After Diane's mention of ""Roman gods,"" Sandra Oh remarks, ""Have you met him yet? The guy you're going to meet."" Diane Lane is taken by surprise, and she replies, ""Uh, who? Patty please!"" Diane does not give Sandra's comment any more thought, though the viewer can easily guess how the plotline will turn. At 57 minutes into the movie, Diane Lane is being pursued by four romantic young men, and in an effort to escape them, abruptly befriends a handsome young man. The result is shift in plot line, where there is a brief romance. Diane Lane plays the cougar, and the handsome Italian is the cub.GETTING INTO ITALIAN CULTURE. In fixing up the old house, Diane polishes a round painting of Mother Mary. Then, a short bit later, at 30 minutes into the film, there is a scary thunderstorm at night, and Diane hides under her bed covers, and she reaches up to touch the image of Mother Mary, in order to feel more secure. A bit later, at 48 minutes into the movie, Diane states that she has become more fond of Mother Mary, even though she is not a Catholic.THREE STOOGES. The next day (31 minutes into the film) we meet the men who will be fixing the house, they are Polish laborers, Pavel, Jerzy, and Zbignieu. The efforts of these men provide comic relief, and their goings on can be compared to those of THE THREE STOOGES, in particular, with the plumbing skit by THE THREE STOOGES. Pavel meets a local Italian teenager, and the result is a hackneyed but skillfully acted subplot.""A LIFE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE."" At 44 minutes, Diane is speaking with a member of the family that had owned her new house. This person is a man in his mid-40s. He is busy helping her find a snake that had crawled from the garden into the house. ""What am I doing here all by myself,"" suddenly says Diane to herself. She is standing near the man hunting for the snake. ""Don't you think its strange? Me in this big house?"" Then, Diane catches herself, because she is aware that she is about to plunge into a pit of despair. ""Excuse me, I'm sorry"" says Diane, who is crying quietly to herself. The man exclaims that Diane might be cold, and he attempts to comfort her by placing a small blanket over her shoulders. Then she opens up even further about the pain of her divorce. ""I wake up in the middle of the night thinking, you idiot, you're the stupidest woman in the world. You bought a house for a life you don't even have.""MORE IRONY. Then, Diane Lane continues to spill her heart out to the man, and she adds, ""I want a wedding in this house,"" referring to her hopes for her own future wedding. What is ironic, is that towards the end of the movie, a wedding does occur in the house, but it is a wedding between Pavel and the Italian teenaged girl. At the wedding, Diane remarks that her own wish had come true. But, as I mentioned above, this movie has second surprise ending, and I do not reveal it. So don't worry.

"THE PORCELAIN THIEF by Huan Hsu is a 370-page biography of the author's family, with details extending back to the 1800s. The book has 20 chapters.  Along with biographical details about his own family, the author discloses details about the history of the era, for example, about emperors, wars, dictators, and the meddlings of foreigners in mainland China.  In a way, THE PORCELAIN THIEF is like an update of CHINESE HISTORY A NEW MANUAL, a 1124 page book published in 2013, and authored by  Endymion Wilkinson.  Wilkinson's huge book has separate chapters on intriguing aspects of Chinese culture, such as personal names (e.g., courtesy names, nicknames, taboo names), the fine arts (e.g., seals, ceramic inscriptions), and clothing and hairstyles.  In the same way, THE PORCELAIN THIEF provides an first-hand account of personal habits, and cultural quirks, of the mainland Chinese.  The Wilkinson book covers the personality, habits, and culture, of entire history of China, while Huan Hsu's book covers the personality, habits, and culture in present-day China.The author is an American Born Chinese (ABC).  This book discloses his temporary move to China in order to work in his uncle's corporation, where his real motive was to hunt down his roots and, in particular, to learn about the porcelain that was collected by his family and ancestors.But this quest for porcelain is almost like a mere pretext for writing the book.  In fact, the book contains little information about porcelain. Relevant facts about porcelain include the following.  On page 75, we learn that ""about ninety miles east of my grandmother's hometown, Jingdezhen was an entire city that had since ancient times been devoted to manufacturing porcelain . . . nearly all the porcelain exported to the West during the Ming and Zing dynasties originated in Jingdezhen, as did most of my great-great-grandfather's collection."" (page 75)Also, in an extended narrative on the Quing dyansty (pages 81-87), which has a few accounts of porcelain, we learn that Emperor Qianjong was a patron of the porcelain arts, and  read that, ""he closely supervised the imperial porcelain kilns in Jingezhen and compelled artisans to impress him.  As a result, the kilns made great leaps in creativity and technology during his reign. (page 81).  This part of the book also provides an overview of the Opium Wars and the Boxer Rebellion.Instead of dwelling extensively on porcelain, what the book does provide is an elegantly written account of cultural mores in China during the past 100 years of so, with a focus on the present era.  The writing is free of mannerisms.  The writing is the work of a seasoned professional.  Although the book is almost as turgid with details as any scholarly paper in physics or molecular biology, the book proved to be a captivating and fascinating read.  I am glad that the book is filled with turgid, concrete details, and I am glad that the book is a captivating read. Although it is an account that is personal and biographical, I have reason to believe that the anecdotal narrative is universally applicable to experiences that have been common, in the past 80 years or so, in China.The following provides a few excerpts from Chapters 1, 2, and 15.PERSONAL HABITS.  We learn about the personality and habits of present-day Chinese, ""loud, angry-sounding manner of speaking and odd habits."" (page 7), ""people in the farming villages still burned their garbage, and when the wind shifted, it blew right into the living quarters"" (p. 16), ""street sweepers wearing sandals and reflective orange jumpsuits collected litter with handmade brooms and rickety carts"" (p. 16), ""while riding public transportation the Chinese had the same sense of personal space as puppies, often literally piled on top of one another"" (p. 17), ""taxi cab drivers took my wearing a seat belt as a grave insult.  I'm a good driver, they huffed, you don't need to worry"" (p. 30), ""restaurants listing menu items that they never intended to serve -- the loss of face from not offering something outweighing having run out of it"" (p. 31), ""it wasn't uncommon to see mothers instructing children to piss or s*** on sidewalks, in public parks, or on subway platforms"" (page 32).FOODY TALK.  We learn that ""fruit is China's apple pie . . . even the humblest fruit shack in China offers dragonfruits with flaming petals and pink or blood-red flesh, strands of purple grapes, plump as roe and bursting with intense, bubblegum flavor, or crispy starfruit"" (page 55).  Page 80 provides another nice account of foody-talk, and we read that, ""despite horror stories that street vendors cooked with oil reclaimed from sewers, or that the meat of the yangrouchuan lamb skewers was actually cats, I managed to eat street food with no ill effects, breakfasting on jian bing, a thin eggy crepe wrapped around pickled vegetable and a smear of chile sauce . . . for lunch I gobbled sheng jian bao, another type of soup dumpling, but larger, thicker skinned, and pan-fried to create a french fry.  These rested on soup spoons in order to bit a small hole in the top to release the steam and suck out the minced pork juice."" (p. 80)  As one can see, the author Huan Hsu is an excellent writer, when he writes about local cuisine, as well as about other topics.  In this ""foody talk,"" the author (Huan Hsu) is as skilled at bringing life to technical topics, in the same was that Elan Bakker brings life and also infusions of poetry, in her technical accounts of ecology in her book, AN ISLAND CALLED CALIFORNIA: AN ECOLOGICAL INTRODUCTION TO ITS NATURAL COMMUNITIES.CORPORATE CULTURE.  We also learn about certain aspects about the corporate culture in China, e.g., ""China's hardware (technology, machinery, materials) far exceeded its software (know how, critical thinking, moral reasoning).  That's why motion sensors in public bathrooms were installed upside down.  And road and building construction flouted safety codes"" (page 40).HISTORY AND LANGUAGE.  A common theme throughout in this book, is excerpts from history, where the author takes care to name leaders, their kin, and relevant dates.  Throughout the book, the author also discloses his struggles to learn Chinese.  These accounts are amusing and fun to read.  To reiterate one of the many examples of the Chinese language, on page 101 we read, ""There's a Chinese phrase for this, Jewel said, ""Ji tong ya jiang.  A chicken talking with a duck.""  They were both birds, so they went on clucking and quacking and thinking they were having a dialogue."" (page 101).CHAPTER 15, NORTHERN EXPEDITION (pages 257-293).  This provides an excerpt from Chapter 15.  This chapter focuses on the author's visit with a married couple living in Beijing, San Yi Po (wife) and Fang Zhen Zhi (husband).  Regarding porcelain, the book tells us that San Yi Po stated that her ancestors had buried the family porcelain to protect it from the invading Japanese in the Sino-Japanese War, and kept it buried to protect it from the Communists (page 283).  We learn that Fang Zhen Zhi's father built his own porcelain store and had a small porcelain factory, and that the invading Japanese destroyed his business (page 285).  Most of Chapter 15 is about other aspects of San Yi Po and Fang Zhen Zhi.  We read that when the author first met San Yi Po, she was ""dressed in a black embroidered top and pants, with black clogs, her short white hair tucked girlishly behind her ears."" (p. 259).  We read about, ""her husband, Fang Zhen Zhi, a small, hunched-over man wearing large eyeglasses and gray slacks pulled halfway up his undershirt."" (p. 259)  Most of the chapter concern's the life and career of Fang Zhen Zhi, e.g., his marriage in 1946 (page 281), his relocation to the University of Missouri to study physics and metallurgy, resulting in a Master's degree (page 287), his return to China to accept a faculty position at Univ. Beijing and his courses in light metals and on how to extract aluminum oxide from low quality ores (page. 268), his move to the Ninth Institute in the remote Qinghai plateau (p. 272) to work on China's atomic bomb, and the fact that he was tortured and jailed during the reign of Zhou Enlai (p. 273).  Regarding history, this chapter outlines the complete incompetence of Mao and his various absurd policies (p. 269), and we learn about of Den Xioping's rule, beginning in 1978, occurring at the end of the ""Cultural Revolution"" and the initiation of the ""open door"" policy (p. 279).CONCLUSION.  Although intended mainly as an autobiography, this book can also be viewed as a contemporary account of the customs and habits of contemporary Chinese, in the context of corporate culture, as well as of street vendors, and of many walks of life that are in between.

"STRING QUARTET No. 2 and STRING QUARTET No. 1 by Aaron Kernis is recorded by The Lark Quartet on the Arabesque Recordings label.  The sound balance is perfect.  There are no echoes or extraneous sounds.  These, as well as other compositions by Mr. Kernis are integrated compositions.  In describing the pieces, my description might appear to imply that the pieces are episodic, but they are not.  They are integrated pieces that move naturally from beginning to end.  Although my description refers to compositions by other composers, it is the case that Mr. Kernis has a unique voice.  As is the case with some other composers, one could identify these quartets as a ""Kernis composition"" upon hearing a short excerpt.  The disc contains seven cuts (String Quartet No. 2, cuts 1-3, and String Quartet. No. 1, cuts 4-7).ONE.  10:15.  String Quartet No. 2 begins with a happy skittering, nervous motif.  This motif has a pendulum-like quality.  A similar pendulum motif can be found in VIVACE in Beethoven's STRING QUARTET No. 16.At one minute, 45 seconds, starts a slower paced, smoothly flowing motif.  At 2 min, 30 sec, the cello is prominent.  At 3 min, 15 sec, the violins resume their prominent place and pizzicato riffs abound.  Pizzicati dominate briefly at 4 min, 40 sec, 5 min, 30 sec, and at 7 min, 20 sec.  At 9 min, 20 sec, begins a short beautiful anthemic fanfare.  More skittering follows.  The first movement of String Quarted No. 2 by Kernis is somewhat reminiscent of Bartok's String Quartet No. 1, in terms of its style, loveliness, and abundant listenability.TWO.  16:04.  This begins very slowly and quietly, the violins sounding almost like soft flutes.  The cello is dominant.  At three minutes and 15 seconds occurs an angry motif, but moments later occurs a motif sounding like the explorational first few minutes of UNANSWERED QUESTION by Ives.  At 6 min, 30 sec, begins a short vigorous motif, sounding like one of the modernistic excesses that so characterize many of Lutoslawski's compositions.  At 7 minutes, the mood changes and we find not much individual instrumentation, but instead, a series of slowly changing chords.  At 10 min, 30 sec, begins a scary-sounding episode, and still the music takes the forms of a series of chords, that is, like sheets of sound.  The last few minutes is extremely quiet.THREE 9:47.  This begins with a skittish, dancing motif, like that in Beethoven's PRESTO of STRING QUARTET No. 14.  Then, occurs a jolly motif, which might be expected in film music used in a movie about sailing on a clipper ship.  The jolly sailing motif is resumed at 2 min, 30 sec.  At 5 min, 40 sec, we find a proclamatory fanfare motif, and at 6 min, 20 sec, comes a bunch of Bartokian plucks and glissandi.  The cello dominates momentarily at 7 and a half minutes, and again at 8 min, 50 sec.FOUR. 13:45.  String Quartet No. 1 begins with a repeating undulating motif that resides in the background, and other instruments are overlaid on top of this undulating motif.  At 4 min, 30 sec, the piece becomes slower and quiet, with a twisting, exploratory ambiance.  At 5 minutes, comes a fluttery undulating motif, similar to that in the opening seconds of Stravinsky's PETRUSHKA.For a couple of minutes, the music is somewhat bland, but the blandness is not for long.  At 9 minutes, begins a jabbing of sonic daggers and swords which, at 9 min,45 sec, becomes jittery and busy, and which at 10 min, becomes drunken and shifting.  At 10 min, 50 sec, begins a pleasant motif that reminds me of film music used in travelogues.  This pleasant ""travelogue music"" can also be found in another Kernis composition, that is, in Kernis' DOUBLE CONCERTO FOR VIOLIN AND GUITAR.  In Kernis' Double Concerto, the ""travelogue music"" occurs at 30 seconds into the fourth movement, and also at 4 minutes into the fourth movement.  At 12 min, 50 sec, is a mysterious-sounding ascending motif with repeated ping-sounds, which in my opinion, is reminiscent of a mysterious-sounding ascending motif in Tschaikovsky's Ballet Suite of THE SLEEPING BEAUTY (Suite No. 3, Pas de Caractere La Chat botte et la Chatte blanche).  Fluttering resumes for 20 seconds, and then the jabbing of sonic daggers and swords occurs at eleven minutes and ten seconds.FIVE.  11:49.  The second movement of String Quartet No. 1 is called, ""Musica Celestis.""  Please note that an orchestral version, called MUSICA CELESTIS FOR STRING ORCHESTRA was recorded by City of yBirmingham Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hugh Wolf, on the ARGO label.  The first few minutes of Musica Celestis are a good deal like the opening minutes of Mahler's SYMPHONY No. 9.  The first few minutes are also distinguished in that the quality of the sound is like taht of a wine glass, partially filled with water, being stroked on the rim with a wet finger (same sound tone as with another instrument,  the glass harmonica).  Although the sound might appear to be one frequency, my guess is that it is a mixture of a few very close frequencies, resulting in an attractive dissonance.SIX.  This is the scherzo movement, and it is only three minutes and 12 seconds long.  Scherzo begins with a ragged-sounding pizzicato motif, accompanied by fast-paced fiddling.  At the one minute time point, occurs an episode sounding like an Irish reel.  The Irish reel is interrupted twice by a second of ""sonic scribbling.""  The sonic scribbling occurs yet again, for a third time.SEVEN.  5:24.  Mr. Kernis' ""travelogue theme"" occurs for the first minute and a half of this movement.  The travelogue theme returns at four minutes into the movement.  As I mentioned above, this pleasant ""travelogue music"" can also be found in another Kernis composition, that is, in Kernis' DOUBLE CONCERTO FOR VIOLIN AND GUITAR.  Also, this final movement of Quartet No. 1 is distinguished in that it is channeling Stravinsky.  One does not have to listen closely to detect the VIVACE movement of Stravinsky's CONCERTO IN D.CONCLUSION.  Although  this review mentions a number of composers other than Mr. Kernis, it cannot be said that the Kernis pieces are derivative of, or were inspired by, or take the form of a melange of, the styles of other composers.  Instead, it is the case that the compositions on this recording, take the form of a unique and integrated whole.  I will be listening to these two string quartets, as well as Mr. Kernis' SECOND SYMPHONY, INVISIBLE MOSAIC III, DOUBLE CONCERTO FOR VIOLIN & GUITAR, and COLORED FIELD for English horn and orchestra, on a regular basis from now until perpetuity.  With all due respect to Jennifer Higdon and David del Tredici, it is the case that Aaron Kerins is my favorite contemporary composer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HEVB09ALFE0O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000J861#wasThisHelpful","R1HEVB09ALFE0O","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE CLEARING is a color film from 2004 that stars HELEN MIRREN (born 1945), ROBERT REDFORD (born 1936), and WILLEM DAFOE (born 1955). Most of the story takes place in an upper class residence, and in a nearby forest, where lesser time is spent in a nearby big city, including scenes in an urban subway. In brief, the plot involves the kidnapping of a wealthy executive (Robert Redford), cooperation of Robert Redford's family with the FBI, and many scenes where Helen Mirren (Robert Redford's wife) acts glum and sullen. A continuing side-plot, is that where FBI has determined, in its investigation, that Robert Redford had been engaged in hanky-panky during his marriage to Helen Mirren. In the second half of the movie, much time is spent showing Robert Redford's kidnap, for example, where he is escorted at gunpoint through a forest by kidnapper Willem Dafoe. The story has a SURPRISE ENDING WHICH I DO NOT DISCLOSE IN THIS REVIEW. The surprise ending is a mild one. It is nothing to remember. The surprise ending is certainly not in the same class as that found in a handful of the black and white episodes of the Twilight Zone.CRITIQUE. This movie can be used as a classroom exercise, in a cinematography class, where the goal is to critique a film There is much that is annoying about this movie. First, the plot contains many elements that have already appeared many times in television programs and in movies (a wealthy person is kidnapped, a ransom is demanded, a husband has been found to have been engaged in hanky-panky). Ho hum, hooooo-hummmmmm. Second, the kidnapping scene taking place in the forest has elements that make no sense. What makes no sense is that, at one point, Defoe removes the handcuffs from Redford in order so that Redford can easily eat his lunch. This makes no sense. What also makes no sense, is that during the escort through the forest, Redford and Defoe engage in a philosophical chit-chat about marriage. This makes no sense -- who ever heard of a kidnapper holding a victim at gunpoint engaged in a discussion about marriage? Third, the viewer might expect the philosophical discussion in the forest to lead to something (however, it does not lead to anything). The philosophical discussion in the forest does not contribute to the character development, because it serves only to use up time, and it is not logically connected to any further elements in the plot. Fourth, there are too many scenes in this movie where there are close-up images of Helen Mirren looking sad and glum. Okay already, once or twice is enough.THE ACTORS. This is just to note the star power of the actors in this film. Clearly, the tired-out and illogical plot in this movie was not worthy of these actors. HELEN MIRREN has appeared in about 100 films and television shows, including O Lucky Man (1973), Mosquito Coast (1986), and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005). Ms. Mirren was born in London, and she has played the role of a queen in various plays and films. ROBERT REDFORD is a household word in America. he has starred in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), Jeremiah Johnson (1972), The Sting (1973), and Out of Africa (1985). WILLEM DAFOE is also a household word in America. He starred in Platoon (1986), Mississppi Burning (1988), and Spiderman (2002).CONCLUSION. For those who made the mistake of watching all or part of this movie, and realized that it was in the spy-thriller genre, and who were disappointed, I provide the following recommendation. In my opinion, an excellent spy-thriller with acting that is carefully crafted, and with plenty of unusual plot elements, is THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO (2011), starring Mara Rooney and Daniel Craig. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (2011) is like The Clearing (2004), in that both films do not make use of computer graphics, and in the fact that both films do not include much violent bloodshed. But there the similarity ends. The Clearing is boring and annoying while, in contrast, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is exciting and memorable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHLHJKYAKALX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002XVKLS#wasThisHelpful","R2LHLHJKYAKALX","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am just posting this today, February 16, 2015, because of the news. I have been listening to Leslie Gore's music since the very beginning. My grandmother gave me a transistor radio back in 1961. My father thought that I was only going to listen to classical music (ha, ha, ha). It did not take me very long to discover the new phenomenon known as rock'n'roll. I quickly fell in love with The Ventures, The Supremes, Bobby Vinton, The Four Seasons, The Coasters (Little Egypt), April and Nino (Deep Purple), The Four Seasons, The Viceroys (local band in Seattle, WA), The Everly Brothers, Paul Revere and the Raiders, and The Marvelettes.

"HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURAL takes the form of a white-colored hair conditioner in a 400 mL container. The product is secured by way of a flip-top cap. The flip-top has a flexible plastic hinge, but the hinge very small. As an experiment, I twisted it a couple of times and the hinge broke, releasing the cap. The bottle has a nice shape, with rounded corners. The product also has a gentle fragrance, which seemed a bit like ordinary perfume.EFFICACY. Although the product did provide a fluffy texture, when used by me immediately after washing, I did not do a direct side-by-side test with any competing conditioner. Hence, I cannot really comment on the efficacy of the product.PACKAGE LABEL. It seems that the main feature of this product is the wealth of creative phrases on the package label. I liked these expressions. The creative expressions are: (1) 100% hand-harvested CASSIA; (2) ILLUMINATING CONDITIONER; (3) IGNITE YOUR INNER SHINE & BE A VIBRANT VIXEN; (4) with REFRESHING SEABERRY ESSENCES; (5) FIERCELY GOOD FOR YOUR HAIR; (6) WILDLY POTENT; (7) WILDLY GOOD; and (8) WILDLY ILLUMINATING. The list of ingredients is inspiring, in that it discloses that the ingredients includes hippophae rhamnoides fruit extract and cassia hydroxypropyltrimonium chloride. The ingredients list discloses about ten components. One can reasonably assume that most of these have been proven to provide benefits to the hair. There is no question that chemists at Procter and Gamble (the distributors of this product) have a high degree of awareness of the functions of each of the ingredients.EDUCATIONAL. Reasonable minds may differ, as to whether this product has the fragrance of ordinary dime store perfume, or if this product has a more complex fragrance. At any rate, I decided to explore the subject matter of ""seaberry,"" in view of the fact that this conditioner contains essence of seaberry. Please note that ""essence"" refers to extracted oils. What I found was the following, all of which was educational to me:Seaberry is commonly known as, ""sea-buckthorn."" The berries are edible, and though astringent and oily, unpleasant to eat raw, can be treated by being bletted, that is, by being frosted to reduce the astringency.When the berries are pressed, the resulting juice separates into three layers: (1) a thick, orange cream on top; (2) a layer containing sea-buckthorn's characteristic high content of saturated and polyunsaturated fats; and (3) sediment and juice on the bottom. The upper two layers can be processed for skin creams, and the bottom layer can be used for edible products like syrup.Sea-buckthorn fruit can be used to make pies, jams, fruit wines, and lotions.

The towel is more like a tablecloth than a towel, because only the front has the pattern.  The rear of the towel does not contain the pattern that you see on the product page.

"EMERALD RASPBERRY GLAZED ALMONDS takes the form of a foil bag of almonds covered with a sweet raspberry glaze. The foil bag has a sturdy zip-lock top, which ensures that the almonds stay in the bag between snack sessions, and also ensures that moisture will keep out.TATTERED APPEARANCE OF COATED ALMONDS. Regarding appearance, the glaze resembles the deteriorated fur of a dog with a severe skin condition. For most of the almonds, the glaze takes on a lumpy, ugly appearance. For many of the almonds, half of the almond is covered with the lumpy glaze while the other half of the same almond has a very thin glaze that allows you to see the surface of the almond. Some of the almonds are only half-coated with glaze, and here the non-coated half of the almond has a light ochre color.FLAVORING OF THE GLAZE. The flavoring of the glaze is ambiguous, and it can be characterized as having a hint of sweetness, and as not having any convincing raspberry flavor. I recommend that the manufacturer hire a new food scientist.INAPPROPRIATE WRITING ON PACKAGE LABEL. The package label reads, ""Our exclusive kettle glaze, made from real raspberry juice concentrate, provides a sweet trip."" I am not sure what is meant by the term, ""sweet trip."" In the popular lingo, it is the case that the term ""trip"" refers to the psychedelic experience induced by a drug such as LSD. Thus, I also recommend that the manufacturer hire new personnel involved in marketing. I am not sure that it is the best idea for the package label of a snack food to disclose that the product induces a psychedelic experience.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SOVGZ1FBSRCK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00REDUAHO#wasThisHelpful","R3SOVGZ1FBSRCK","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BARILLA FARFALLE PASTA and BARILLA PENNE PASTA are two forms of noodles, where the FARFALLE noodles have a bowtie shape, and the PENNE noodles are short tubes with slanted-cut ends.  The FARFALLE noodles are smooth, while the PENNE noodles have long grooves.  Both products are the same, in that a 100 gram serving provides 370 calories, 3.5 grams of fat, and 17 grams of protein.  Those with a nutrition background will know that this is a heart-healthy product, because of the high ratio of protein to fat.Another BARILLA noodle product, called MINI PENNE has a different numbers.  Here, a 100 gram serving provides about 360 calories, which is about the same as the two products that I mentioned above, but the MINI PENNE product provides roughly half the fat and roughly half the protein.  How could this be?  For the adventuresome consumer who loves to scrutinize package labels, it can be seen that MINI PENNE is made only from wheat flour (with a dab of corn starch), while the FARFELLE and PENNE noodles contain wheat flour plus flour made from lentils and garbanzo beans.  For the noodles that contain lentil and bean flour, the ratio of protein to fat is also heart-healthy, so to speak, but the MINI PENNE product is even more hearth-healthy.  At any rate, based on nutrition ingredients alone, I prefer the products that include the flour made with lentils and garbanzo beans, because of the higher level of protein.  FARFALLE cooks in a somewhat shorter time than PENNE, because FARFALLE takes the form of a bowtie, thus having better contact with hot water.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ3YT2C89AVZI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBKA30S#wasThisHelpful","RQ3YT2C89AVZI","A4JHEO7H330AF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4JHEO7H330AF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They're are all beautifully haunting in their own unique way.While each story seems to stand alone, jumping from one to another wasn't jolting.

"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I love the concept behind this book. I don't get to read too many books about ""old school"" Fae (so to speak) but I thoroughly enjoyed this take on them -- especially regarding the concept with the elders. This book has a fantastic twist ending that I did not see coming, and it was completely believable in retrospect.The only downside to this book, for me personally, was the relationship for the two main characters. I'm giving some allowances due to Acacia going through such a trying and traumatic time, but I got frustrated with her romance and emotions on several occasions.Regardless, the plot fully made up for that and I enjoyed reading it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RRIIMSJT0P2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1506020895#wasThisHelpful","R3RRIIMSJT0P2Q","AGGC8YPL5U41M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGC8YPL5U41M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I love books that have a little bit of every genre in them. Blood Toy includes much of the best: there’s a lot of action, a bit of coming of age story in there, lots of paranormal elements (all combined beautifully), a little smattering of love and lust, and a main character that is very easy to grow attached to.I really enjoyed the fast paced nature of the plot. I was quickly thrown in to Diane’s world and was immediately caught up in the action. We’re introduced to Diane’s antagonist shortly after that and I was not disappointed with his mind games and stalkerish attention to Diane.The plot is a unique one and I enjoyed seeing this twist on the paranormal genre. It’s definitely not your typical “undead” plot. There’s a lot beneath the surface and I’m anxious to see where this series leads.There were only two pieces of the book that I did not enjoy. The first is just a personal preference: I was not a fan of Mace, Roger, and Bree. I just couldn’t connect with them. But like I said, that’s just a personal preference.The second is that the plot jumps around between points of view, dreams, and the past, and several times I had a hard time catching up or knowing if it was a dream or was really happening. But within a few pages I was able to figure it out and felt caught back up to speed.Overall an excellent and entertaining book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XTOTKEWAEIBH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWZP9H4#wasThisHelpful","R2XTOTKEWAEIBH","AGGC8YPL5U41M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGC8YPL5U41M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Maurice Miller takes us back in time (slightly) to pre-cell phone and pre-internet years when struggling entrepreneurs had to rely on making face to face connections with businessmen and organizations instead of tracking them down online.Michael is a well rounded character who starts out with the best intentions, only to find himself in over his head with the contacts he's made and the business he's gotten involved with.The reading flow is steady and the dialogue is great. One of the obstacles that Miller had to overcome was his use of characters who had learned English as a second language. But he was able to pull it off quite well.The Budapest Experiment keeps the anticipation level high as you realize that Michael is headed for a disaster even before he himself realizes it.

"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I enjoyed this refreshing take on the vampire concept. In My Keeper, we get to see the transformation from new vampire to young vampire and it’s more what I would expect as opposed to the incredibly controlled vampire that mainstream media introduces us to in most cases.Margret is not special, and I don’t mean that in a bad way. Instead of becoming a vampire and immediately having control over her new abilities, she has to be trained. The idea of a Vampire Keeper is wonderful and I was really entranced by the concept.Margret’s transformation and maturity is well paced and I love how we learn more and more about her situation as she does. I also really enjoyed the progression of the plot and how the antagonist of the story keeps shifting. It seems to be her captor to begin with, then it shifts to Margret herself, and then continues to change throughout the book.This was a highly enjoyable read that caught me off guard and kept me hooked. There’s just enough steamy scenes and character development to keep me reading despite the high anxiety that I was left with at the end of the book. Looking forward to seeing what the author does with this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R3CAK1KP0LEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W2SGFGQ#wasThisHelpful","R1R3CAK1KP0LEE","AGGC8YPL5U41M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGC8YPL5U41M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.Love Me. . .Again is an enjoyable book about a young girl who struggles with the decisions she’s made in love. Overall I liked the story of Angie, Colt, and Jett. The author is a talented writer who includes good descriptions and smooth dialogue.My biggest concern with the plot (without giving anything away) is that I felt that far too much happened in a short amount of time. I was unable to fully connect with any of the characters and that made me struggle slightly in understanding Angie and Colt’s motivations. I wish that the author had drawn out the plot a little more and included a few more details about the characters’ pasts. I desperately wanted to understand Angie and Jett’s relationship more.However, the end of the book is wrapped up nicely and left me very content.

I found myself attached to each of the characters and was satisfied with the resolution of each story.I never know what to expect when I start reading a collection of short stories. Sometimes they’re all so unique and obscure that I have a hard time jumping from story to story. But what I enjoyed about this is that the author’s voice came through strongly with each story and that’s what connected them – along with having to do with relationships.I enjoyed the lightheartedness of the tone and, despite a few of them being a little sad, most of the stories were enchanting and fun.

"Sometimes I get a little too caught up in the relationships between characters to really see the big picture behind a story. This usually happens to me whenever I read books by Nicholas Sparks. He writes his characters so vividly that I often times ignore the overall theme of the book or miss some key point that he’s trying to get across.Once I finished The Longest Ride, I realized that a lot of the plot went over my head. I was too focused on the details of each character and enjoying their romantic spark. Even though so many chapters were devoted to Ira, I felt like I barely remembered him.It's because of this that I'm so grateful for Book*Sense and their summary books. They give me the plot points I need to remind myself of all the events and details, and I get a little more in-depth look at the plot and some of the deeper meanings and analysis that I may have missed.I love that they give chapter by chapter summaries as well as a full overview of the book, along with short descriptions of each character and their role in the book.

"This was a fascinating story that had me locked in from the very beginning. By giving so little away about what is going on, but creating such lively characters, Katrina Cope manages to hook her readers even before they have any idea what the plot is about!I definitely still feel confused, even after finishing the book. I like where the story line is going, but I really have no idea what she has in store with this series. I'm anxious to move on to the second book and try to unravel a little bit more of her mysterious plot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11DLER5TK4DL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EYSKMF2#wasThisHelpful","R11DLER5TK4DL2","AGGC8YPL5U41M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGC8YPL5U41M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.The plot is intense and provides a lot of anxiety ridden action. I definitely felt bad for Jamison as each twist and turn dug the hole beneath him a little deeper. He seems so good at complicating his life. But although there is a lot of anxiety, Tigg throws in a bit of lightheartedness with Jamison's personal life, which complimented the rest of the book well.This book is very well written and highly enjoyable. Anyone who understands gambling more than I do (not much of a gambler) will probably see more connections than I did, as well as further appreciate Jamison's situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R171ASVJZUC815/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939288959#wasThisHelpful","R171ASVJZUC815","AGGC8YPL5U41M","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGGC8YPL5U41M?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Another exciting story from the Holy Ghost Writer. This time Sherlock and Jack the Ripper have new identities and new challenges to overcome. Sherlock believes that Jack has kept his promise, but instead he has transformed into the dangerous Zodiac Killer. So many questions need answers as Sherlock races to solve the mystery and catch his nemesis.I love the quick pace of this book. I couldn’t put it down; I just had to read it in one sitting. I love the evolving relationship between Sherlock and Jack. And involving the DB Cooper mystery was fascinating.I love seeing how these pieces of history fit together in the Holy Ghost Writer’s work.

"I’ve been looking for about a year for a beginning airplane. This thing went on sale for about 60% off so I bought it. The RTF kit comes with EVERYTHING you need, including AA batteries of the radio and charger (although you may want to spring for the optional AC cord for the charger to save on AA batteries).OUT OF THE BOX:1. Unbox everything.2.  Put AA batteries in radio.3. Velcro on battery to plane, move it near center or back a little and plug it in.4. Wait for plane to blink red light.5.  Push radio throttle (left) stick INWARD (not up, left, right or down) until it clicks and HOLD IT.6. Turn on radio while still holding INWARD  throttle (yes, this is physically awkward).7. Radio should turn on with a squealing noise.8.  Let go of throttle.9. Radio will beep, beep, beep until it binds and then stop.10. You are ready to fly!Yes, that’s how easy it was. Within less than 2 minutes of opening the box I was flying in my front yard. By day three I was flying and not crashing AT ALL provided there was no breeze. Two weeks later I still crash indoors, but on the weekends practically my whole neighborhood likes to watch me fly around their front yards. I’ve never used a flight simulator program and my only other plane was a twin-engine thing with a V-tail (no rudder or elevator) that I crashed years ago so hard the first day it never worked right again. THIS THING IS EASY TO FLY!CAUTION: when you do step 8, make sure the throttle is all the way BACK (toward your body) when you release it or else the plane will bind to the radio and the throttle will make the prop spin: which could break your prop on wherever you have it resting or send it sailing off.You are *supposed* to fly this thing in-doors, but honestly it’s easier to wait for a NO WIND day and learn outside. Beware: any amount of wind will carry this plane away like a plastic grocery bag in a hurricane.My first two flights were awful with lots of crashes onto lawn, roof and sidewalk, but by the second day I flew an entire battery without crashing. The neighbors came out and said I was a great pilot, lol!The landing gear broke off right away, but that just taught me to cut the throttle completely when coming in for a landing (or crashing).  I’ve been flying for two weeks and nothing else has broken off the plane. I never bothered to glue the landing gear back on since now I can glide to a landing with ease. A little bit of the wing pulled of the frame, but a tiny piece of Scotch tape fixed that.In addition to ordering the AC cord for the charger I ordered an “150mAh 1S 3.7V 25C LiPo Battery” which triples the flight (and charging) times. Also, to save weight (this thing is VERY light) I took the labels and velcro off the battery and removed the sliding battery mount from the frame. I just use a piece of Scotch tape *lightly* applied to frame and battery so I can slide it for/aft for center of gravity adjustments.With the supplied battery I can fly about 6 or 7 minutes. It’s powerful enough to do a prop-hang for a few seconds. That’s when you hold the plane with the propeller facing the sky and give it full throttle and let go: the plane with hover motionless like a helicopter. 4d plane pilots can do this for minutes on end—I’m not that good, but I did it long enough for a neighbor to ask where I got “that helicopter” before it pulled out of it and went flying off. That was with the supplied (lighter) battery. A breeze kicked up and took the plane higher and I did a loop, but this is not really an acrobatic type plane: it’s for sailing around.I learned a lot about flying out-of-doors: use less throttle and more elevator to change elevation; launch into wind to climb high fast. I also learned that I have terrible depth-perception and that a lot of times I can’t tell if the plane is facing toward or away from me, which in a faster plane would spell doom: you can really confuse left/right when flying towards yourself and bash into a tree/house/whatever. With this plane you just cut the throttle (to save the prop in case you crash) before you hit the sidewalk or grass. I've also gone high up and cut the throttle completely and just sailed on slight gusts of wind, just giving it rudder and elevator for a couple minutes! After my second day I haven’t crashed at all flying outside. My small living room is actually a bigger challenge. I bash off walls a lot, but nothing else has broken.Caution: cat’s seem to want to shred this thing, and I’ve heard people landing on un-watered dried out and/or un-mowed lawns getting holes poked into the wing covering. Although I’ve crashed into a few shrubs and had nothing happen. Basically, if you can stand on it in bare feet comfortably you can land on it safely: couch, table, car roof, soft lawn, driveway, sidewalk, etc.  I’ve landed it everywhere WITHOUT any landing gear and nothing has broken. Just cut the throttle totally.It is very quiet and my family sits on the porch while I fly and it’s very calming. A lot of times I get lost in it and when I land it I’m stunned to find a crowd of neighbors standing behind me all smiling.The farther back the battery is (to a point) the more the plane floats around with its wings in high alpha (raised up like the hood of a spitting cobra). More forward makes the wings more level, but you have to give it more throttle and elevator to stay up-meaning a faster, more ‘plane-like’ flying style.If you're thinking of trying flying I recommend this plane: it's cheap, you can crash it a lot without breaking anything except the useless landing gear, if you get good enough you can fly it indoors, and it's very quiet. You'll learn: throttle control, elevator and rudder.SEARCH:“150mAh 1S 3.7V 25C LiPo Battery” for 2x-3x longer flight times (although let the plane’s motor cool down between flights).“E-Flite AC to 6VDC 1.5-Amp Power Supply EFLC1005” so you don’t have to put new AA batteries in the charger.Happy skies to you,Mike from Detroit","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11GTC13G5OW94/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009WQF7ZQ#wasThisHelpful","R11GTC13G5OW94","A1YIFPM15ZHNIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YIFPM15ZHNIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this along with a Parkzone Mini Vapor RTF kit. It almost triples the flight time, but also the charging time. It came with a piece of black tubing (I think that's for making a quick change holder?) and a rather large piece of top/bottom Velcro. Since this battery is about twice as long and seems much heavier than the supplied 30MaH battery that came with the Mini Vapor it of course really throws of the center of gravity setting. Luckily on the mini vapor that's easy to adjust. I ended not using the Velcro (to save weight) and just using a piece of loose (to enable adjusting Center of Gravity) Scotch tape to hold the battery on. Works well with the Mini Vapor~although even if you have multiple batteries charged up and ready to go, you should give the plane's motor some cool-down time. I've read where people fly multiple batteries and burn out the little 6mm motor. Charge time on the supplied Mini Vapor charger is 55 minutes (compared to 25 minutes with the supplied battery). Neither batteries (supplied or this aftermarket) heated up at all during flight or charging. Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JT23X94NJWU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005XHKWUI#wasThisHelpful","R3JT23X94NJWU4","A1YIFPM15ZHNIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YIFPM15ZHNIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To use this product you ALSO need a T-Ring that fits *your* specific brand of camera!Once you have your T-Ring (sold separately) and this product you can plug your camera right into a telescope where the eyepiece normally goes.SHORT REVIEW:Yes, this product fits tightly and seems very well made. If you already have a T-ring for your camera this is what you need to thread onto it and slide your camera onto a telescope. But there's more it does: it includes a 2x barlow magnifier which doubles the magnification of what your camera sees through the telescope.Also, the 2x barlow is removable for use on eyepieces when you're not photographing (or if you don't want 2x magnification when you are), and this product can be left in place on the telescope with the camera removed and telescope eyepieces can then be plugged into it and tightened with the silver set-screw (visible in product photo). This allows for quick changes to compare an eyepiece with and without barlow (with and without this product between the eyepiece and telescope). For about the price of a 2x barlow this product gives you a 2x barlow + half of the T-setup you need to bolt a camera onto your telescope for prime astrophotography. Nice!LONG REVIEWTo attach this to your telescope, your telescope must be able to take 1.25"" eyepieces. If it does, you just screw this onto the T-Ring on your camera and then slide everything into the telescope like an eyepiece. Most toy-store telescopes (and many high-quality spotting scopes) take 0.965"" eyepieces, so this may not be the size you need. Take the eyepiece out of your telescope and measure the hole it was in. It'll be either .965"", 1.25"" or 2"". This product is for the 1.25"" hole.This adapter also includes a tiny eyepiece holding screw, so you can leave this in your telescope without the camera and stick eyepieces into it and tighten them in just like normal. This also allows you to pop different eyepieces into the unit to utilize the 2x barlow *without* having to unscrew from this product and screwing it on your different eyepieces: you can pop this unit into your telescope with the barlow attached to it. Then you can place an eyepiece into it to get the 2x barlow effect. You can then quickly take this product out and put just the eyepiece back into your telescope for really quick ""normal vs 2x barlow"" comparisons with the same eyepiece.You may also need the 2x barlow to bring your camera/telescope combination into focus. But it just unscrews if you don't want/need it. You can also take this barlow off and screw it onto your rear-threaded 1.25"" eyepieces to double their power (actually, half their focal distance in millimeters, it'll make an 8mm eyepiece into a 4mm eyepiece) which is actually why I chose this adapter, even though it was a little pricier than others: it's like a 2-in-1 deal. Almost all good 1.25"" eyepieces have threads for filters and barlows like this at the end opposite of where your eye goes--the part that goes inside the telescope. Screw the barlow part from this on and you've just doubled your magnification.After clicking the T-Ring (sold separately) onto my Canon T2i and then screwing this product onto that it took all of 3 seconds to attach my camera to a Zhumell Z8 dobsonian scope. I was able to focus on the Moon and stars before the clouds rolled in. Seems to work just fine optically! It also mounts solidly at both ends as well.Normally I just use an ""Orion SteadyPix Deluxe Camera Mount"" (with an older, flatter lens since the newer Canon zoom lenses are smidge just too long to fit between the camera and the telescope without the front of the lens touching the rubber eyepiece cups of some of my eyepieces) and it holds the camera up to a regular eyepiece stuck into the telescope. You get much more magnification that way. It's called afocal astrophotography, a fancy term for just holding a camera up to a telescope or microscope eyepiece and snapping a photo. What you see with your eye up to the eyepiece of the tele/microscope is exactly what the photo ends up looking like. Honestly, this Celestron telescope T-adapter is probably better suited toward longer exposure prime astrophotography (with a motorized telescope mount), but I figured before I get a motorized mounted scope in addition to the Zhumell dob I could, at the very least, use the included 2x barlow to double the power of all my eyepieces--and this lets me attach my camera to some smaller scopes (that take 1.25"" eyepieces) and turns them into cheap telephoto lenses without the added weight of the SteadyPix.Theoretically you *might* be able to put a short eyepiece into this product and then screw it onto your camera BUT DON'T DO THAT: if your eyepiece or the rubber eyecup extends past the top of this product it will touch/interfere with the flip-up of your camera's mirror. If you can find a short enough eyepiece you **might** be able to up the magnification--but you might also DESTROY your camera/mirror. If you need higher magnification than 2x, I'd recommend trying something like the Orion SteadyPix, since it works with your camera *and* a telescopic eyepiece.POSSIBLE SETUPSCamera  + T-Ring (sold separately)  + This Adapter  + slide into your telescope where the eyepiece normally goes = ""prime focus astrophotography"".Camera  + T-Ring (sold separately)  + This Adapter with the included 2x Barlow screwed on  + slide into your telescope where the eyepiece normally goes = ""prime focus astrophotography"" magnified x2.Your telescope eyepiece (sold separately)  + This Adapter + slide into your telescope where the eyepiece normally goes = normal telescope use.Your telescope eyepiece (sold separately)  + This Adapter with the included 2x Barlow screwed on + slide into your telescope where the eyepiece normally goes = normal telescope use with 2x the magnification (halves the mm of your eyepieces). This will *also*  allow you to swap the adapter+barlow in/out from between the eyepiece and telescope to see the difference the 2x barlow makes on whatever you're viewing.Your telescope eyepiece (sold seperately) + the little Barlow lens unscrewed from this product and screwed onto the bottom of your eyepiece end that goes into the telescope = 1.5x magnification, so you have your eyepieces normal + 2x when lens is on tube + 1.5x when lens is on eyepiece. Basically triples your number of magnications available! Usually a 2x Barlow gives 1.5x when screwed directly to the end of an eyepiece: more variations of magnification is great. I wrote all the combinations on the side of my black telescope in silver paint pen. Example, my telescope has a focal length of 1200mm so a 12mm eyepiece gives 100x mag. 12mm with 2x Barlow gives 200x. 12mm with Barlow lens screwed directly onto it and no Barlow tube used is 12mm divided by 1.5x = 8mm which is 150x mag. Focal length divided by eyepiece mm = magnification. 2x mag means divide eyepiece mm by 2 = new eyepiece mm. For 1.5 divide eyepiece mm by 1.5 to get new eyepiece mm to divide into telescope focal length.Using this product without a camera (between the eyepiece and the telescope) will also yield a slight improvement in near-object focus. This is useful for terrestrial viewing: there is a pine-tree a few blocks from my house that is too close for me to focus on unless I loosen my eyepiece and pull it out of the drawtube, extending the distance between mirror and eyepiece as I hold it in my hand. This product basically `holds' the eyepiece for me--and allows me to focus on the pine-tree easily (and at double the magnification if I leave the barlow in). However, I would think this might impact far object viewing, but as stated earlier: I was able to focus very crisply on a single star with my setup: I took three quick shots playing with the focus rack and I was able to get: a star with 4 diffraction spikes (X shape), a slightly blurry star (a bit of 'seeing' roiling the sky) and a slightly bloated dot (normal photo of a star). The moon was crisp, with craters visible: Theophilus showed it's central mountain peak nicely.  BTW: with my setup (Canon T2i + Z8) and the barlow in place the magnification showed maybe about 2/5 of the moon (if it wasn't a waxing crescent). Thus the 'magnification' factor of your telescope is somewhat negated during prime focus photography--if you want to 'zoom in' on individual craters on the Moon, then check out the SteadyPix for afocal astrophotography (telescope with eyepiece in it and camera with it's own lens attached). Usually, a product like this is used by people doing prime focus astrophotography (no lens on camera and no eyepiece in telescope) which is better suited to telescopes with motorized mounts and for nice, long exposures...but if you're planning on trying both, or want to attach a camera that isn't suited for a SteadyPix bracket, or you have a motorized telescope mount and want to do long exposures without your camera flapping around on a loose bracket, or you have a smaller telescope you want to turn into a make-shift telephoto camera lens, or were thinking of buying just a 2x barlow alone, or just want to play around like me...I highly recommend this product.For what is usually considered a utilitarian ""photo adapter"" (simply half of a T-mount system), the Celestron T-Adapter+Barlow has lots of fun possibilities and features incorporated into it. The fit and finish on this product is also top-notch--in direct contrast to some things I've seen out other `name brand' telescope companies (flaking paint, rough metal file-marks, cheap pins instead of screws, etc.). I was quite happy with all the `extra' uses beyond it just acting as a t-adapter.Oh, and if you order this you might want to pick up a remote shutter release for your camera (or get well acquainted with setting the self-timer function on your camera in the dark)since you may find that your telescope shakes a bit with the added weight of your camera dangling from it...and a LOT more when you try to fire the shutter button with your finger.Clear skies to you!-Mike from Detroit","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M4ILPKL943WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009X3UV#wasThisHelpful","R2M4ILPKL943WD","A1YIFPM15ZHNIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YIFPM15ZHNIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Goja (the seller) ships ultra fast, has low prices on quality products and usually throws in a microfiber cleaning cloth. This Goja branded 58-49 step-down adapter worked well and threaded on (and more importantly, off) both my Canon lens (58mm ) and the fisheye converter I was attaching to the front of it. The finish on the ring was uniform and had no bubbling or flaking, which is important to prevent scratching/binding on the things you're attaching it to. I was also very happy they, unlike some on Amazon, sent the *actual* size I ordered. To me, Goja is like the Zappos of miscellaneous camera parts and accessories: fast, cheap and great selection.

"panasonic viera tc 32lc54 shuts itself off sometimes.Put 2 or 3 layers of transparent tape over the little remote control window on the lower left of the tv set. If not then when you watch tv in a dark room/at night the TV thinks the light from the show you are watching is the remote control and the TV will shut itself off.I had the TV for a while and it worked fine, but I changed jobs (about 3 weeks after the warranty ran out) and also changed my viewing habits: whenever I would come home late at night (dark outside and the lights in the room were shut off) the TV would shut off by itself. It's in a white room and only happened with the lights off, and when I'd watch colorful shows, like anime or Adult Swim or even commercials with bright, blinking lights. I figured the light bouncing off the walls would hit the TV's remote window and fool it.Other people said that it was some electronic board overheating but: after putting the tape over the remote IR window (on the TV set itself) it hasn't shut itself off in over 3 months! Try only 2 or 3 layers of scotch tape-that's what worked for me and the remote can still get through to power on/off and volume control.The other thing I don't like is that if you plug it into your cable box with a coax cable the closed captioning works; if you use the HDMI cable it doesn't work: but that could be the cable box's fault: solution, leave both plugged in and watch HDMI 99% of time, and when I need closed captioning just click the input button until the coax comes on: then the closed captioning (from the TV) works just fine.With all that said: this TV was VERY inexpensive and looks great (with an HDMI cable). I'm actually very happy with it. I'd actually buy another one and just tape it up on the first day: problem solved!

Now I have fewer lost ones.Sometimes these accidentally get washed and dried, but they just get a curve to them which is nice to offset a collar that wasn't ironed well. If the collar lapels are curved up just put a washed and bent stay in pointing downward, the curves offset eachother: sure beats taking the shirt off and re-ironing it.Anyway, they're stays: buy them if you need them.

It's not a liquid, but like a very warm Jolly Rancher: solid, but gooey: and that means a MUCH easier time getting sound out of the double bass. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing this. The only bad part: the rosin is packaged in a nice plastic container that is itself lined with a paper cup--like the kind tarter sauce comes in at cafeterias: kinda lame, but the paper actually doesn't stick to the rosin *that* much.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OC71LG0C8DPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002E3DRQ#wasThisHelpful","R2OC71LG0C8DPI","A1YIFPM15ZHNIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YIFPM15ZHNIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was using a cello and a violin bow on an upright/double bass I just got: the sound was actually okay once I started using Pop's upright bass rosin (which is sticky) but once I bought this bow the playing was much easier. The thickness of this bow's wood portion is about double that of cello and violin bows. The horsehair is almost three times as wide as my other bows, and since this huge bass bow is so much heavier I don't have to exert as much pressure to play: my wrist doesn't ache anymore. Very happy I went with this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RST6G42M5IZB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TJPW46#wasThisHelpful","RST6G42M5IZB2","A1YIFPM15ZHNIV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1YIFPM15ZHNIV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Imagine if Thursday came before Wednesday, followed by Friday. But only for you… giving you the ability to learn the future and change events. I would have so much fun with that. Of course, I’m certainly not as hardcore as Dylan Brice, so I would probably only use it for selfish gain. Luckily, Dylan is trained to deal with terrorism, able to call in the big dogs and assess violent and potentially deadly situations, which is a huge plus, especially since nuclear terror is on his doorstep.This is a really cool time-travelish novel set in present day America. Though I admit that I wasn’t really sure what was happening in the beginning, and it took me a little while to warm up to the characters and the situations, I eventually found myself completely wrapped up in the story. It’s a thriller with a bit of mystery thrown in, taking readers on an awesome ride as it all unfolds. If you’re looking for something a bit different with a strong male lead, then this is definitely a novel for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R0HEM8PYRWP9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611561329#wasThisHelpful","R3R0HEM8PYRWP9","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kemmerer’s Elemental series has been my guilty pleasure for a few years now. And with this novel, Kemmerer has technically closed the story with this final chapter of the Merrick brothers, giving readers Michael’s story as it all comes to a head. And yet… I’m not certain it’s really over.Let me explain.  Kemmerer has always woven a tale that pulls readers in from the get go.  Sacrifice is no different.  By this point in the series, the Merrick brothers and their friends are like a part of my family.  I know them so well because Kemmerer really knows how to create realistic, beautiful characters, and Sacrifice is no different on this end.  The brothers, who I’ve come to love, are again faced with hardship–perhaps the worst yet, and it tore my heart in two as I read.  The emotions are real, and I just adored everything about it.  Everything, except the ending.  The ending, while a resolution that works, comes on quite fast, leaving readers with questions. Truthfully, I wasn’t expecting the antagonist to be who it was, and I liked how Kemmerer threw me for a loop with the big reveal, but I didn’t understand all the aspects that went in to it. I reread it twice, but in all honestly, the ending was too neat; everything wrapped up much too quickly once all is said and done. And I still have questions. I have questions about the bad guy, about newcomer Irish, Hunter’s grandparents, the guides reactions to it all, and what’s going to happen next for the Merricks. Yes, a resolution is there, and I loved it, even though it happened a touch too fast for me and not everyone gets out unscathed, but even so, the potential for more chaos is there, too, and I’m waiting for more–for the other shoe to drop. This is a wonderful novel, and I truly enjoyed it… but I need a spinoff series…Of course, Kemmerer did leave me stunned with one aspect that I knew was coming from the title, SACRIFICE, but still didn’t expect. I spent the next few pages hoping it’d be undone, but alas, it’s not. You might want some tissues. I think I was stunned enough that I didn’t even blink. No tears for me, it just… can’t be. Right? And it happens so fast that if you do blink, you’ll miss it. I really have no words. Except that you must read it. If this is really the end, then you just have to read it, but I’m still waiting. For more. I need more. The Merricks are a part of me now, and… I just need more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3VQ94NAKCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758294395#wasThisHelpful","R3R3VQ94NAKCP","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novel is absolutely amazing, giving readers an in-depth look at the indie publishing world through the eyes of Jayne, a young woman who struggles with intimacy.  Jayne, better known to her readers as Jaina Jacen, is an intriguing character who innocently enough begins a maelstrom when her erotica books take off in the ebook world–a feat Jayne never imagined, nor wanted.  Published under a pseudonym and only in hopes of making ends meet, Jayne’s world is turned upside down when the demand for more, including public appearances and signings, become a reality she cannot ignore.  But these books were never supposed to hit it big, and no one is supposed to know her true identity, especially not her family nor Luke, the friend who is really interested in so much more.  This conundrum adds much humor to the novel as it takes off, and Gordon’s writing style kept me captivated from the very beginning.  Jayne is such a sweet, shy character, and watching her try to dodge all romance, while in the throes of writing and publishing erotica behind closed doors, makes for a great read, perhaps more so because it’s 100% clean.Though I am indeed a prude and dislike heavy sex in my novels, I have to admit that Gordon MADE me WANT to read Jayne’s fictional books just to know what all the hubbub was about throughout this enticing story.  Gordon really does an amazing job keeping readers on edge, snickering, and in love with all the characters as this humorous story unfolds, making it a must read. Especially as Luke is such a great guy.  And perhaps my favorite part is that it’s completely clean. While Jayne does write erotica, Gorgon keeps this NA novel PG, which is exactly where it needs to be to get the point across.If you’re looking for a hilarious, clean, introspective read, then look no further that Neurotica.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R247XZFPSGWBYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=163064014X#wasThisHelpful","R247XZFPSGWBYE","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While I generally love Scott Westerfeld’s novels, this one fell just a bit flat for me. The novel itself is extremely long, and after the first 200 pages, I found that both storylines began to drag a bit, which is unfortunate since the novel started out with much intrigue. Unfortunately, I ended up not caring much for either protagonists, and I think a lot of my enjoyment of the story diminished as I got to know them more and more.Darcy is somewhat of a boring person. Unsure of herself within the world of authors, she stumbles along and overspends on her writing advance time and time again, wrapped in the throes of what, to me, seemed like an instant lesbian relationship meant to shock readers more than drive the plot. The relationship seems to fabricate out of thin air, and while Darcy definitely learns the ropes of authorhood from girlfriend Imogen, this portion of the story felt forced to me. And while I do enjoy novels that portray the world of authors, Afterworlds is the third novel I’ve read over the past month that deals with this topic, and by this time, it sort of felt old hat. Having read and loved both The Write Stuff by Tiffany King and Neurotica by Eliza Gordon prior to Afterworlds, I found that Darcy’s story just didn’t bring anything new to the table for me, aside from a protagonist who’s story was juxtaposed with her novel--awesome in theory, less so in execution.As Afterworlds tells two different stories, one of the real world in which Darcy resides, and one of the paranormal world in which Lizzie, the protagonist of Darcy’s debut novel, resides, I actually found myself more drawn to Lizzie’s story. Westerfeld alternates between the two, and I found myself, in the beginning, really wanting more and more of Lizzie’s story, but again, as the novel progressed, I found myself liking Lizzie less and less, and as it turns out, we don’t get the full story of Lizzie and her newfound powers—instead, it’s more of a shell. And I soon found myself losing interest in Lizzie and her world as well.Honestly, I feel as if the novel could be divided up into two shorter novels as the worlds don’t really intersect in the book, aside from the fact that Darcy is the author of Lizzie’s story, and that the publisher wants massive rewrites to the story. I really would love a fully developed novel surrounding Lizzie and her world, but I doubt we’re actually going to get it.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.  My overall rating is that it's OKAY).","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RO7I67U8QHTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IBHS5LA#wasThisHelpful","R1RO7I67U8QHTI","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes you read a book and the story is so intriguing, the characters so realistic, and the events so vivid that, when all is said and done, you feel like a piece of yourself is missing. That book, for me, is Provencher’s beautifully written Hale Maree. Captivating from the get go, I found myself so engrossed in the story that I truly feel like I know Hale and Oscar—they’re more than just characters in a story—they’ve become friends. I truly feel like I know them as well as I know myself, and while the going was tough and their relationship was touch and go in the beginning, watching them grow together and fall irrevocably in love with one another was absolute beauty.Provencher is a master storyteller, enchanting readers with her words and characters, and I absolutely adored everything about Hale Maree, with its realistic portrayal of humanity and its swoon-worthy, often humorous events. Of course, Oscar is my absolute favorite, and I found myself wishing numerous times that he’d pick me since Hale was so dead set against him. And yet, I am no match for Hale. She, too, swept me off my feet with her level head, fierce determination, and all around good soul. This is a beautiful happily-ever-after that has remained with me since I read the very last page; and I already cannot wait to read it again.Filled with romance, snark, and even a little bit of mystery, this novel is indeed a must read for those who love contemporary romance. While a little hot and heavy in some scenes, overall it is a beautiful testament to human nature and love at its finest. Hale Maree is a gem that I highly recommend for those looking for a lighthearted, fun read.

"Walters is a great writer and I love her world of the runes—it really is Norse mythology at its finest. Cora and Echo’s story is an amazing addition to the already awesome Raine and Torin, and I actually might just love them a little more than the previous main characters… a close tie, to say the least.This novel is a little more hot and heavy than its predecessors, and my one and only issue with it is the sexual escapades. I’m not 100% sold on the love relationship between the characters, but as immortals and soul mates, it is indeed more than plausible—I just feel like I need a little bit more relationship building and a little less sex. I especially don’t need the visuals when it comes to their personal happy times together. Thankfully, Walters fades to black for the majority of it, which I am extremely happy about, but she doesn’t every time, and there’s more times than I personally feel like need to be in the story as it doesn’t necessarily drive the plot. Aside from this, Cora and Echo’s story is fantastic, and I really enjoyed getting to know them more in this novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WRTVCBFSBVZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H15YMJW#wasThisHelpful","R1WRTVCBFSBVZC","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine a person so incredibly selfish she'd ruin lives just to possess the man she ""loves."" Welcome to the world of Aoife, a faerie intent on possessing Liam forever, slowly forcing Allison's mother, Elizabeth, farther into her schizophrenia as she keeps Allison's parents apart. And now, the risks are even greater as Aoife has escaped her binds, intent on finishing the O'Malley's forever, and claiming Liam as hers, wiping his memories and releasing the bind he has with Allison's mother.There is always the question of who to trust in the world of the fae, and Allison has her work cut out for her as she attempts to figure out where Aoife is and who might be aiding her. With Ethan by her side, she has more to worry about than ever lest he be used against her--true for all those she loves in the series. I really enjoy both Allison and Ethan, and their budding romance is swoonworthy-cute. They are indeed my favorite characters in the series, and I hope to see much more of them as the series continues.As with the fae, there are a lot of names that are hard to pronounce in this novel, but thankfully there is a guide for readers in the front of the book. I, personally, would have really enjoyed a description alongside the pronunciation guide in order to try and keep them all straight, because there are a ton of characters in this novel, and at times I got them confused with each other. The good news is, Howard is thinking of putting together just that on her blog, so make sure you stop over and see if its up before you go to read this awesome series!Stone of Destiny is the second book in the Danaan series, and the books do need to be read in order as book two picks up soon after book one, The Forgotten Ones, ends. Luckily, both are short, fast-paced, awesome reads that you’ll really enjoy, so if you haven’t yet started the series, make sure you begin with The Forgotten Ones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2LUK5G17KKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JV4ZMBI#wasThisHelpful","R1L2LUK5G17KKQ","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Originally I picked up this novel when I recently heard that the CW had turned it into a TV series. I generally like the CW’s shows, and I was extremely excited and interested in the premise. And while this is indeed a good story, it reminded me very much of These Broken Stars by Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner. In both, the Earth is no longer inhabitable and an elite group of people have been living in space for years. In both, people from space find themselves sent to Earth against their will, and a battle for survival ensues. So, while I found the premise to by extremely interesting, I couldn’t help but continually feel like I’d read this before…Now, there are a lot more characters in The 100 than in These Broken Stars, and having insight into the lives of characters both on Earth and in space was intriguing as well. I can totally see why the CW picked up the series, and I’m dying to watch it as I enjoyed seeing how people reacted in Space as well as learning about their culture—one that, even though removed from Earth, has not changed much in terms of hierarchy, though punishment for crimes certainly has.Thrusting 100 “guilty” teens on Earth as an alternative to death was a nice plot twist, and learning about each main character’s individual “crime” definitely kept me glued to the pages because in reality, they’re all intertwined with one another, another awesome aspect of the story. But because we follow the story of four distinct characters—Wells, Glass, Bellamy, and Clarke—I didn’t feel like I really got to know the characters as well as I wanted to. There were a lot of questions left unresolved for me, and I did, in truth, find the character’s first few days on earth to be a bit boring. However, there is a fairly big cliffhanger at the end that turns everything on its head, so I can’t wait to read the next novel; I’m hoping that I get to know the characters even more as their stories continue, because while I don’t feel like I know them very well, I want to. The characters are very well written and I have a feeling that a lot more bombshells are going to be dropped in the sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5PFHOSGV2FE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAXFCO0#wasThisHelpful","R3L5PFHOSGV2FE","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am sorry to say that this novel just isn’t for me. I read the Shiver trilogy a long time ago, and I remember I liked it well enough, but this companion novel just didn’t do anything for me. I didn’t care for the characters, especially cryptic Cole St. Clair, and while I did enjoy the idea of a reality TV show, nothing much seemed to happen for the majority of the book aside from tension between Cole and Isabel. The pacing was just too slow for me, and while it is well written, it just isn’t my style.

"This novel pulled me in from the get go with its alluring magic and snarky, realistic characters. I absolutely adored it, and I am really hoping that there will be more novels set in this world. While a stand-alone, I’d love some companion novels or, better yet, a sequel. But, as it is, perfection abounds. If you’re a lover of Downton Abbey and all things paranormal, then this is definitely the novel for you. Similar to the hidden world of Harry Potter, White’s archaic world gives an old-world, realistic feeling to readers, and it exists exactly how I expect the early 1900s to have existed in Europe, but with a catch. Unbeknownst to the populace, the upper class possess magical traits, passed down through their lineage, adding an air of mystery and intrigue to this novel as the plot unfolds. And I loved every moment of it!Jessamin is a wonderful, snarky, quick-witted character, and I just loved her interactions with my dear swoonworthy Finn. While utterly infuriating, Finn is indeed the epitome of the perfect man, and I really enjoyed getting to know him, as well as watching his and Jessamin’s love grow. Jessamin is a strong character, set in her ways, full of pride, and it was amazing to watch her carry on, especially once she was pulled into the magical war between Finn and Lord Downpike—a despicable man we just love to hate.I have to admit that White had me on pins and needles as the novel progressed, especially near the end then the other show seemed to drop and I feared the worst. Thankfully, White does tie the end up with a nice bow, leaving readers exhaling in relief—and in my opinion, White also leaves the ending open enough that there could be more to come, should she choose to write it. And as I said, I hope she does.

"I went through an entire array of emotions as I read this novel, from fear to joy to hatred to sadness, I really think the authors of Branded did an amazing job bringing the story to life.Lexi is extremely real, and while I personally wanted to strangle her at times, her perseverance and mostly strong personality had her bouncing back, time and time again, even when no end to her pain was in sight—and that’s extremely admirable considering what she’s up against. Although insecure about herself due to abuse at the hands of her step-father, Lexi triumphs and focuses on the good that still remains in her life, even though she’s scared beyond belief. She grabs what little life she has left by the horns, and I really respect that about her.I also really liked how this novel unfolded, Lexi’s insecurities aside. There’s a little bit of everything sprinkled into this novel, with a forbidden relationship (yet this novel certainly isn’t a romance novel), a corrupt world, immense danger, extreme tension, and a mystery surrounding the identity of the Commander—and it’s all incredibly well done. I thoroughly enjoyed the ride that the authors take us on, and this certainly is one hell of a ride, if the gamut of emotions expressed above are any type of indication.While I did struggle with some of the actions and interactions of the characters here and there, mainly in regards to some of Lexi’s insecurities, overall, this is an extremely well written, action packed novel that held me captive throughout the pages. And while I did momentarily lose some interest around the middle with Lexi’s antics, I plugged through and found it to be a highly explosive read that I highly recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVVZ1B4L6GXRM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LBBM9WY#wasThisHelpful","RVVZ1B4L6GXRM","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Um, WOW. Blodgett is back in the latest Death series novel, and our beloved characters are all grown up with teens of their own now. And. It’s. Awesome!Gramps is still kickin’ at 80 years old, but as we find out fairly early on, his daughter, Ali, Caleb’s mother (the main character in death 1-6), is dying, and Caleb’s teenage son, Paxton, is having a really hard time with this.So begins the novel, as Paxton struggles with his powers as he watches the cancer eat away at his grandmother (not Gramp’s wife), a woman that so totally gets him, he can’t handle the inevitable separation. And like his father Caleb, Paxton struggles to control not only his gifts, but his anger as well. And it is this anger that sends him and his twin sister, Deegan, on an adventure not unlike those his father and his friends used to have when they were young… lovers of Death rejoice!!Paxton has an awesome ability that is new to the Death series–the ability to jump, or blink, to another dimension, and as the story unfolds, Blodgett presents two vastly different worlds that are so imaginative and amazing that you’ll feel like you’ve blinked there alongside them. As Deegan finds herself in dire circumstance after dire circumstance, and the dead continue to rise in both worlds, readers are in for some action packed sequences as the new “greysheets” once again mess with Harts.This novel focuses on Paxton and Deegan, but soon our beloved Caleb and his old band of friends come on the scene once again, up to their old antics, and the fun really begins. I will admit that I was on pins and needles throughout this entire novel, especially with the new threats that await our characters, and I loved that we get to see the parent/child bond in this novel; seeing some of my favorite characters of all time, all grown up, is a real treat, and I hope that Blodgett continues this tradition with all her novels. And, from the ending we’re left with in this novel, I at least know there will be one more novel following this beloved cast of characters, if not more, as Blodgett leaves us with a fairly evil cliffhanger.

This amazing story pulled me in from the get go, and I loved how much I was able to connect with both the characters and the story itself, seeing the ins and outs of self-publishing as N.S. Blake begins to make a name for herself with her intoxicating stories.  If you’ve never been to a mass signing or weekend book conference before, then you’re really missing out, and you’ll see just how much when you read Kings novel.  I had to laugh out loud at all the antics of the ladies, ogling the male models, lining up for pictures and signatures and insisting that the models take off their shirts for photos–an aspect that has indeed become a “thing” at book conferences and signings.  And King captures the chaos and awesomeness that it is as she writes from personal experience from the many signings and conferences she’s attended (and I’m lucky enough to say that I’ve attended two with her, as well!).  Everything about the writer/reader world that King incorporates in her novel is 100% true, and having experienced much of it at conferences I’ve attended, I was just tickled pink with how much I could truly visualize as I read.  King certainly has a way with words, and I adored her insights into the bookish world, a world we don’t hear much about inside books, which makes it all the more awesome.And Alec?  Mmmmmmmmm.  He is definitely hotness on a stick, and I loved how honest and forthright he was.  He’s a man who knows what he wants, and he has some shocking but valid reasons for denying N.S. Blake, reasons that made me respect him on a whole nother level as the novel unfolded.  Of course, there is definitely a lot of friction between N.S. Blake and Alec, and I loved how their friendship bloomed.  Their relationship is extremely realistic, and I enjoyed their antics as the plot thickened.One of the aspects that I really adore about this novel is that it’s completely unique.  While the “virgin trying to de-virginalize herself” seems to be a plot that I’m noticing more often lately, King doesn’t follow the same patter as others, and her novel really stands apart.  From the intricacies of the bookish world to the chemistry and maturity of the main characters, King takes readers on a realistic journey of love and heartache, and it’s so very amazing.  This is a must read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1622AWH58SZON/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ8YYHE#wasThisHelpful","R1622AWH58SZON","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This companion novel to A Secret Life takes place a few years after the conclusion of its predecessor, focusing on a whole new cast of characters as the plot unfolds, drawing readers once again into the world of the FBI as they track a killer hell bent on finding the only girl he ever lost, Courtney (also known as Kat in A Secret Life). This is a well written story, and I liked the change of pace, seeing everything from the opposite side as Brownell focuses on the “bad guy” as opposed to the good, as she did in her previous novel.I will admit that I feel as if a piece of the story is missing—the gap between how Taylor survived and has since outwitted the FBI alludes me a little, mainly as Taylor was portrayed as being less than smart when a teen. Years have passed, and he certainly has turned hard, but I really want to know the backstory here—how, why, and while there is a sentence of two that define this a little for readers, I’m dying for the whole story and am hoping that Brownell will fill readers in with another novel in this series.Brownell does a great job making Taylor a likeable character. We don’t see the bad in him as much as maybe we ought to, which is the same issue Maggie has as she attempts to infiltrate his business, and watching the two dance around one another was a ton of fun. The instant-love connection showed up again in this novel, though, and I’m not really one for a whirlwind romance. However, I completely get the characters feelings, and I do love how hard they fall for one another, even if it is instant.This is definitely a book that needs to be read after the first in the series, A Secret Life, so that readers understand Agent Cam’s obsession with Taylor, and who Taylor really is, in the first place. Though seemingly far-fetched at times, this is a fun read and I did thoroughly enjoy it. I am certainly hoping for a follow-up, or perhaps a novel that bridges the gap behind the lost years.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.  My overall rating is that I liked it.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPUOB4KZOSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500301949#wasThisHelpful","R2GPUOB4KZOSF","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read this novel a few weeks back, and it’s stuck with me ever since. While I did find the insta-attraction portion of the novel just a tad cheesy in the beginning, as the novel progressed and the characters grew up, going from high school to college, I found myself rooting for the lovebirds, Cam and Kat, enjoying their antics and so happy that their attraction to one another lead to a much deeper relationship. Brownell tells their story in two parts, glossing over a few years in between in order to take her YA novel into the NA world while keeping it clean, and it works very well.This novel has many different layers; many stories to tell. It’s about a mother and daughter in witness protection. It’s about first love. About danger. Crime. Grief. Protection. The FBI. Doing what’s right. Outrunning your past, and looking to the future. And I enjoyed this aspect of the novel very much. There is so much going on and Brownell slowly peels back the layers, providing a fun, easy, engaging read, though I will admit that I have many more questions than I have answers, and I think that’s one of the reasons this novel has stuck with me long after I finished it. I find myself trying to figure it out at random times during my days, and that’s a rarity for me as I read so many books and move from one to the next quite rapidly.I am intrigued by Cam and his love for Kat. I love Kat’s tenacity and her yearning for a simple life. Together, they are perfect, insta-love aside, and I’m glad they found one another. What I don’t necessarily get is what happened during the climax of the novel–we’re led up to it, but as we’re looking through Kat’s eyes, and she’s not watching events unfold, we seem to miss everything as it unfolds, and as no one clarifies the event for Kat, we are left in the dark. All we know is that some very bad things went down, and I’m dying to know what happened to everyone. I need to know. And I also need to know how some of the people mixed up in it all got mixed up in it all. I’m not giving names nor explanations, because that’d be a spoiler, but I keep wracking my brain trying to figure it out. I need to know, and Brownell’s next novel in the series, Secrets and Lies, releases tomorrow… so here’s hoping for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROVP7P6CAY6SV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H3HIBEU#wasThisHelpful","ROVP7P6CAY6SV","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella is the perfect end to the amazing Deamon Hunter series, and I just adore it. Tiffany King is a master storyteller, able to transcend genres from the paranormal to contemporary, YA to NA; King had indeed written some amazing novels, and the paranormal YA Daemon Hunter series is definitely one of my favorite series out there. A spinoff to Kings first ever series, The Savings Angels, the Daemon Hunter series is its own story; no need to read The Savings Angels series to understand what’s happening in any of the three Deamon Hunger books, but since The Saving Angels series is so amazing, you’re going to want to. Trust me.This final installment is, like the title denotes, a final battle between heaven and hell. Jordyn, a daemon killer created by heaven, is a kick butt character who is strong yet fragile, smart yet wild, capable yet unsure of herself, and King blends these traits all together to create a realistic young woman set on doing what’s right, what she’s been created to do, even if that means giving the ultimate sacrifice. Jordyn is far from perfect, though, and her inner monologue, questioning of herself, show her vulnerability, a side she attempts to hide from all those around her.This novella is indeed sad, but triumphant as well—King delivers punch after punch in this amazing conclusion, and readers will find themselves on pins and needles as the final battle looms ever closer. Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27HNN4OL396Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1500113204#wasThisHelpful","R27HNN4OL396Z5","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, I want to assure readers that, while this novel does deal with child abduction and pornography, there are no descriptions. This is not a graphic story—allusions are made, but readers never learn what Kick herself experienced, and there are no descriptions of the photos or pornography sites the characters reference. This, for me, was a godsend. I was interested in the story, but I knew going in that I couldn’t stomach any graphic imagery at all, and as this is a very sensitive subject, I was very happy that Cain tread lightly here. However, I must admit that I still didn’t really enjoy the story. Honestly, I'm a bit disappointed in the main character, Kick. Said to be the new Lisbeth Salander by the editor in the introduction of the novel, I was expecting great things, but Kick falls bit too flat for me. There is what I consider a lack of action in this novel—with all the hype surround Kick, such as her ability to kill a man 571 ways with just her left hand, I expected to actually see her fight. She rarely does, and, in most instances that she does, she’s actually bested by her opponent. For all the time and training she put in to the arts, self-defense, knife throwing, and the like, I was really looking forward to seeing her skills. But they were not noteworthy, and for me, that’s somewhat of the opposite of what I expect when a character is compared to another kick-butt character, such as Lisbeth Salander.Kick is still in a fragile state of mind, though she tries to put on a tough front. Abducted and used in child porn for five years of her young life, this is expected. She does have a good handle on herself in most situations, and I admire her perseverance; I find her realistic, though she wasn't essentially deep or fleshed out in the story. Perhaps one of the reasons Kick is bested time and time again as she hunts for the missing children from Portland is because of her background; freezing up in situations when action is key and she must push herself to survive. Thank goodness she has Bishop there to help her when the going gets tough.Then again, Bishop is a jerk. The main reason that Kick continually freezes is because Bishop has thrust her back into the world of abducted children. Kick seems to function relatively well in the real world, but once Bishop comes charging in, her entire world shifts, and Bishop is none to kind in his treatment of Kick. In fact, he doesn’t do anything within the novel that redeems him in my eyes. So while the mystery aspect of the novel was indeed intriguing, I did not connect with any of the characters and I wasn't spurred on to read the novel as much as I'd hoped I'd be, based on the hype surrounding this story.The first chapter is indeed an attention grabber, but as the novel unfolds, much of the intensity tapered off for me. Overall, I’d say it’s an okay read for me, but it’s really just not my speed.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.

"If you haven’t yet added this unique novel to your TBR pile, then I’m going to suggest that you do so right now. Written in free verse, this novel throws out exactly what each character is thinking as it happens, and while initially jarring, I found that I liked it very much. Readers easily know who is thinking and speaking as the sections are chunked, focusing on one character at a time, but it certainly isn’t a traditional novel in the sense of its flow.Ghosting, told through the eyes of the many teens involved in the prank/misunderstanding, allows readers an up close and personal look at these teens inner and outter lives before and after the life-altering event. I have to say that it took a while to lead up to the event in question, painting a vivid portrayal of the characters lives, and it was as if I was their shadow, watching, knowing something bad was coming. This put me on pins and needles, and I liked how well I got to know all the characters as the plot slowly drove toward the event that changes everything. And once we are there, it all seems to then quickly tumble to its end as those involved attempt to heal in many ways. It’s beautiful, and the ark of a story is followed superbly as we build to the climax and resolution. Due to the way it's written, this is actually a rather fast read, though it looks to be much longer than it really is, so do not let the size of the novel stop you from picking up this unique read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q94UMBS8I67M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICWYTPA#wasThisHelpful","R3Q94UMBS8I67M","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you enjoy magical-realism and/or the paranormal set within the realms of everyday life, then I highly suggest you pick up this novel. It reminded me just a touch of the movie Sin City based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller, with the spells and abilities replacing superpowers and villains, though I wouldn’t say Dark Metropolis is nearly as gruesome or action packed. Secrets abound, magic flies, and as the novel unfolds, Dolamore does a great job foreshadowing what’s to come, nudging readers in the right direction as they attempt to figure out just what is at work in the depths of the city.I enojyed the characterization and the surprise at the end, and am interested to see what happens next in this surreal world full of danger and magic.  Told from the perspective of multiple characters, a writing style that I just adore, I think many will enjoy this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39OOCE33ZDOMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HVMARDA#wasThisHelpful","R39OOCE33ZDOMU","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a very interesting concept, but the development of the story was just a tad slow for me. Part of this stems from the fact that I was able to predict many of the events prior to them happening, which in turn made the mystery aspect of the novel fall a bit flat. I did like the main characters, but much of their conversations and actions didn’t pique my interest. Much time is spent leading up to their meeting and hashing out theories, but I didn’t feel that there was very much action within the novel at all, and I really need more action to keep my attention. Unfortunately, this novel just wasn’t for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KF2VF2QDYX1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBYCOKE#wasThisHelpful","R2KF2VF2QDYX1W","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was a little bit disappointed in Riggs’ latest novel, Hollow City. Not only did it take three years to write, much too long to keep my vigil going without a new gem to devour, but it also was a bit bland. While there are events happening, there wasn’t enough to really keep me preoccupied or glued to the pages, and I found myself repeatedly having to stop and look up characters to remember who they all were. As the novel picks up right where the first ended, this would be a great read for someone who hasn’t yet read the first book if they were planning to read them back to back. I really enjoyed Miss Peregrines…, but for me, this middle novel fell short. I am really hoping it doesn’t take another three years for Riggs with write book three, because Hollow City ends on a cliffhanger, just like it’s predecessor, and I would like to know what happens next, but I think another huge long wait will sink the novel for me before it’s even out, which is a shame. I liked this second novel enough to finish it, but it just didn’t have the flare or novelty effect that the first one did, and I can’t figure out why. If you’re like me and a huge wait time for cliffhanger novels just isn’t in the cards, then I suggest picking up this entire series when it’s complete, because book one is great and definitely worth the read, and I’m hoping book three is just as good—perhaps Hollow City met with that dreaded middle book syndrome that happens sometimes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39EADF19O1GH3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594746125#wasThisHelpful","R39EADF19O1GH3","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Kindle Keyboard is the best Kindle ever.  I broke my first one, and coming by this refurbished second one was difficult, but I found one, thank God.  The reason I insist on it is because it has the Text-To-Speech feature in both male and female voices.  Yes, it's mechanical, but I've gotten used to it and I love it.  As I'm always on the go, I love this feature as I can always listen to the book when I can't read it the traditional way--such as when doing lawn work (earbuds), driving (plugs right in to the car radio), and the list goes on.  I love it.  I wish ALL the Kindles had this feature--they don't, I checked, and though some Kindle Fires do have it, as does the DX, they don't sound the same.  Plus the DX is just so large, and the Fire is in color which hurts my eyes (the whole reason I bought a Kindle in the first place was for the bookish background that doesn't hurt the eyes).","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S4I1XAJSVA6Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004HFS6Z0#wasThisHelpful","R1S4I1XAJSVA6Q","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has turned out to be a great purchase.  I bought this because I recently purchased a 60 inch flatscreen and I had NOTHING to put it on.  I was going to buy a stand in the story where I bought the TV, but they wanted to charge me money to bring it to my house AND they didn't have the one I was looking at in stock.  Turns out, that was a Godsend.  I found this beauty on Amazon for half the price of the stands in the store, and it shipped for free.  As it was going into the basement, I just opened it at the door and carried each piece downstairs individually.  Set up was really easy, though it took me a few moments to really understand what they were asking me to do because some of the labeling was weird.  The glass doors were the hardest to put on and that's because I wasn't reading the directions right.  All-in-all, it took me about 30 minutes to put together.

"In the wake of the recent tornadoes touching down across the Midwest, perhaps the most prominent being those in Arkansas and Oklahoma, Miller creates a touching, poignant story that truly captures the fear, panic, loss, and ultimate renewal that comes from the destruction of Mother Nature’s ferocity. Told through the memories of survivor Jules Blacklin as she relates her story for a video memorial, readers are brought into her personal world and experience events through her eyes as an unexpected tornado rips through the Friday night hang out attended by many of the counties teens.Imagine turning around and seeing a tornado coming for you. Miller captures the fear and horror surrounding these events as her main characters experience their lives being ripped apart, both literally and figuratively. Recounting her experiences, and with a new outlook on life, Jules takes readers through her healing process, her revelations of love and loss drawing the reader even deeper into the story. The tenses in the story are a bit jarring every now and then, jumping between past and present, first and third person as the story develops, but I feel like this fits the upheaval of the storyline itself, and as Jules is recounting past events in a present memorial to the dead, it works.“From the Wreckage” is both a literal and figurative phrase that perfectly fits as the title of this novel. From the wreckage comes loss. From the wreckage comes survivors. From the wreckage comes unity. And from the wreckage comes rebirth, love, fear, and strength, and it’s a beautiful story that I highly recommend.

"Oblivion is a beautiful yet disjointed story that sucks readers in from the get go. Much like Callie’s mind, pieces of the story are told in fragments and Callie struggles to live in the here and now while dealing with her debilitating graphomania—a compulsion few truly understand. But through all its disjointed glory, the reader begins to experience what Callie truly feels when unable to get her words out, and she struggles throughout the entire story to make sense of it all, focusing on her words and events from the past in order to understand what truly happened that fateful night a year ago. Slowly, the pieces come together, and as they do, readers will find themselves glued to the pages. Both frustrating and intriguing, I could not tear my eyes away, and in the end, the novel left me breathless.Dawn’s debut is absolutely superb, and I adored her characterization. I felt that all the characters were extremely real, and though I’m sure others will disagree, being a teacher I see students from all walks of life, and though I’ve never had any with graphomania, I have had those in similar situations as Callie and her beau, and I think Dawn captures their realities quite vividly in this novel.Truth be told, I never knew graphomania was a reality for some people, and it was intense watching Callie attempt to deal with her compulsions. As a teacher, I feel like I would have responded much as Callie’s teachers in the novel do, and that’s disheartening. While it is true that we don’t truly understand something until we experience it, I hope to now be able to say that, should I ever have a student who suffers from graphomania, I will show compassion.This is a truly haunting story that I loved immensely, and I hope you will too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8CHLFNTZ4Y6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H12BKUO#wasThisHelpful","R8CHLFNTZ4Y6C","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting story filled with magic, murder, and mayhem; just what I like in my paranormal novels. However, the main character rubbed me the wrong way on many an occasion, which is unfortunate for me, as the novel is extremely well written. In my personal opinion, Indie is a less than likable, and my inability to connect with her made the novel a little less enjoyable for me. She begins as the token cheerleader who thinks she’s amazing and treats those less than “cool” like dirt, including her neighbor Paige, who she comes to rely on in many ways. Rarely is Indie sorry for the way she treats Paige, instead questioning why Paige isn’t elated that Indie is even talking to her, and I have a really hard time dealing with unlikable characters like this. While it is true that Indie slowly changes over the course of the novel, my initial impression stayed with me and we just never clicked. We are just too opposite.Now, Bishop was an intense, fun character that I did connect with, and I enjoyed him immensely. He is swoon worthy and so aggravating, but my type of guy 100%. I felt the relationship between Indie and Bishop was a little too quickly developed, almost forced, if you will, but he does tend to being out the best in her as the story progresses, and I really liked that about not only the story itself, but also Bishop as well.One aspect I have noticed in many YA novels lately is that many tend to have some big reveal or climax during a school dance. Hexed is no different in this aspect, but thankfully Krys adds some key elements that make her rendition stand apart from all the rest. I won't say more because I don't want to give it away, but this was definitely a plus that made it different from all the rest. In fact, the school dance was my favorite aspect of the novel as a whole. Magic plus papier-mché just doesn’t bode well, and I just loved what Krys does in this scene.Reader beware, this novel does end on a cliffhanger of sorts, and while I usually dislike them, this works. As there are a lot of unresolved conflicts in this first installment, the cliffhanger reminds readers that more is to come. Would I have like more resolution? Of course, doesn’t everyone? But the way this novel ends is sort of perfect, in my mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBKI4MKEQ9UQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385743378#wasThisHelpful","RBKI4MKEQ9UQ0","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine knowing the exact day you’re going to die—as if you could forget, the clock tower is counting down the days for you. Imagine knowing a cyborg army is coming to kill you and everyone you love; knowing there is no chance of survival. Welcome to the future, where the select are creating a new world, and you’re not invited. In 15 days, the cyborgs will come, and everyone knows it’ll be a painful death—the 24 hour TV footage of other sectors’ demolishen proves that. You can’t hide; there’s nowhere to go. No one in any sector has survived the cyborgs. No. One.This is Sia’s reality; thankfully it’s not ours, but Ormand does a great job putting readers right in the thick of the action as Sia lives out her last 15 days, first in fear, then in resignation, and then in determination to fight back. Who has the right to say you’re not worthy to live? According to Sia, nobody.While the novel starts out believable enough, with Sia’s revelations and resignations, I have to admit that as the action begins to quicken, the believability became a bit disjointed for me. Infiltrating a high security site with little to no incident just didn’t seem real, especially as Sia flys by the seat of her pants, has had no infiltration training, and doesn’t know anything about the people she needs to know about in order to survive in this new world. Her ill-thought-out plan does backfire, but the ease of escape was just too perfect in my mind—not that I’m looking for terrible things to happen to the characters, but it just seemed to me that every time an obstacle came up, it was easily overcome by the characters in one way or another. Of course, this is just a small segment of the overall novel; much more is to come for Sia and the characters after her antics, and the final events and showdowns were, in my opinion, much more up to snuff in terms of believability. So while the novel seems to take a small dive in the midst of it all, by the end I found it to be back on track and intense, and I certainly do not want to switch places with Sia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EV1XROY1LA41/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628735945#wasThisHelpful","R3EV1XROY1LA41","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say that I enjoyed this story overall, but some of the events were a little far-fetched for me. Vivian Divine is an extremely well known celebrity, so when she’s forced to go on the run, she has to hide in plain sight, which is much easier said than done. Still reeling from her mother’s murder, her boyfriend’s betrayal, and a scary run in with a man in a black suit, her mind isn’t in the best of places, and her only option, so she believes, is to run. But, running off into the deep of Mexico alone to meet someone she has never met doesn’t seem like the best course of action…Between a rock and a hard place, Vivian embarks on a journey filled with peril. I almost feel as though the events themselves would be more fluid on the big screen than on paper as the action seems to just jump for sequence to sequence, but it is engaging nevertheless. While some of the events and outcomes are indeed obvious, others were much more discreet, and the revelation of Vivian’s pursuers was rather shocking. Though I have a few questions about certain cover ups that take place within the novel, overall it was a fun read. I wish that Vivian had a better relationship with others and was able to confide in them more, especially since grown-ups really can help, but I also understand the feeling of being all alone and feeling like there is no one to turn to.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25J87XDVWTAS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ34Y2I#wasThisHelpful","R25J87XDVWTAS","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DEATH WHISPERSI really like this novel.  I especially love that the main character is male, as more often than not, lead roles in YA literature are female (why is that?).  I’ve been looking for something along these lines to promote reading among my male student for a while, and thankfully, I’ve now found it.  With a main character that can raise corpses, how can you go wrong?It is obvious that Blodgett spent a lot of time writing Death Whispers, perfecting the scientific and technological aspects of this futuristic dystopian novel.  I was reminded of one of my favorite TV shows, Heroes, as I read.  While many young adults will come into their special power during puberty, not all will choose to use their powers for good.  And, with many new powers coming to light each year, the government, of course, is going to be on the lookout for any powers that may be politically important.  One main difference, though, is that all young adults know that they may manifest these powers, and they are, therefore, subjected to a mandatory AP test to determine their placements in high school—which I think is a really ingenious idea that Blodgett incorporated into the novel, as it creates suspense in the terms that “big brother is watching you.”As the synopsis states, Caleb has a very rare talent, as do a few of his friends, and it was really fun to follow the characters as they discover their different abilities and learn to control and hide them, especially as the ever looming government could easily swoop in at any moment.  What I really love about these powers, especially Caleb’s, is that Blodgett doesn’t sugarcoat them.  For instance, the corpses don’t come back as they were in life, but rather in their various stages of decompose, including the smell.  It was really interesting to read about this, and Blodgett writes in such a way that the reader can easily visualize it (though thankfully not smell it!).This novel takes place over a few months, and another aspect I really enjoyed was that I was able to keep pace with the timeframe.  Keeping the reader on point with elapsed time can be very difficult for writers, and I’ve read many books in which the events all seem to happen within a day, and no timeline is ever provided for the reader, causing confusion.  Blodgett, however, easily guides the reader through the story without having to state the time and, because of this, the love story portion of the novel becomes feasible, as it obviously doesn’t happen “overnight.”The dialogue in the story, as well as the action, was also very well done.  Caleb and his friends banter back and forth much as my students do every day in the classroom, and I catch them doing very strange things in class as well, such as sticking things in their nose and ears…  Blodgett captures the true essence of adolescents in her story, making her novel that much more enjoyable.  As the story unfolds, events seamlessly build off each other, capturing the reader’s attention until the very end.I know that my favorite character should be one of the main ones, but actually, my favorite characters is Ali, Caleb’s mother.  Why?  As I’m an English teacher and older adult, I find we connect.  She has a strong love for her son and also a strong love for English.  She is constantly correcting Caleb’s language and, as exasperating as that can be to others, I love it!  I do it all the time too; I see myself in her, and I see my students in the young adult characters, solidifying Blodgett’s capability of creating very real characters that we can all connect with in some manner.Something else I absolutely adore about this novel is the Caleb’s relationship with his parents.  Caleb goes to his parents, first and foremost, when he realizes he’s in trouble.  Most YA novels deal with characters that feel they need to hide everything from the adults in their life, and I loved that this was different.  I’ve read many YA novels in which adults are excluded or deemed untrustworthy, and it was refreshing to finally read a YA novel in which an adolescent trusts his parents.  Caleb goes to his parents on many occasions, and though they can’t always help him, the moral support that is there is awesome, and it portrays parents in a positive light, whereas, more often than not, YA literature portrays adults negatively.  I like this positive reinforcement because that’s an aspect that teens need in their lives—adults who listen and care—yet Blodgett doesn’t paint all the adults in her novel as such, in order to keep with the reality of the world.  Not all the adults (or other teenagers, for that matter) in the novel can be trusted, and Caleb and his friends aren’t obtuse.  They see the warning signs and give their trust sparingly—they have a great sense of “street smarts,” as my parents would put it, and I enjoyed that very much.Of course, the technological aspect of this novel was amazing.  As it takes place in the future, technology must be vastly different, and Blodgett does not disappoint!  She has taken our current technology and morphed it, creating “pulse” technology in which cell phones read our thoughts and send them virally.  Hence, texting and calling are obsolete.  I loved reading about this, and how the characters used it, and I would live to see “pulse” technology actually come to fruition someday—though that could be a nightmare to us teachers in the classroom…Overall, this novel was great, and I highly suggest adolescents and adults read it alike.  You will not be disappointed! Four starsBLOOD SINGERSThis third installment of the amazing new adult Blood Series by Tamara Rose Blodgett takes on a much darker, edgier tone as tensions rise between the three groups: Singers, Vampires, and Weres. Julia, thought to be off the hook and out of danger since choosing a mate among the Singers finds rather quickly that some knowledge has been withheld—mainly, how the Queen Singer must align the three groups through marriage… something neither Scott nor Julia want to hear having just declared their feelings for one another.To make matters worse, Julia’s husband (by human law), Jason, is on the prowl, and he’s none to happy to see his wife engaged to another, even if their past human lives bear no authority in the magical realm and he feels nothing for her… or does he?  Mix in an honorable vampire, William, who is willing to risk all for Julia, and everything Julia thought she knew and wanted becomes extremely strained as tempers flare, profanities fly alongside fists, and dangers lurk around every corner.Full of angst and with the reappearance of Jacqueline and the sadistic, misogynist Tony, relations are even further tested and, unbeknownst to our would-be heroes, there is more dangerous magic at work than they ever realized existed.  Forced to put their anger aside and work together, Scott, Jason, and William along with the most trusted among their groups plunge head first into a war they most likely can’t win against an ancient and powerful magic they’ve never dealt with before.  It is here that Blodgett really wows her readers with the insertion of a magical realm thought only to be a rumor amongst the groups, thrusting the characters into danger unparalleled in the previous novels and, sadly, ending with the death of a beloved character, for a magic this dark will cannot leave all unscathed.I was completely blown away with Blodgett’s additional magical group—a group I’ve read much about in many other novels, but never thought would show itself within the Blood Series, and yet, they fit quite nicely, and Blodgett’s definitely done her homework concerning with sadistic group of meddlesome entities.  But, no spoilers here.  If you want to know who they are, you’ve got to read the series, because it’s a great one, touching on realistic emotions and not sugar coating the ups and downs of life. You’ll be hooked. Four Stars.THE PEARL SAVAGEThis is a very well written novel.  I’m not exactly sure what I was expecting; I’ve read Blodgett’s other book, Death Whispers, and I knew she was a great writer, but she still blew me away with this novel.  It’s completely different from Death Whispers and, if I didn’t already know that Blodgett wrote them, I’d never think that the same writer was responsible for both novels.  They are so completely different, yet both beautifully written.What I really love about this novel is that Blodgett keeps the story fresh and original—I’ve never read anything like it—and she maintains an almost archaic tone throughout the prose and dialogue, never straying into modernization or slang, which I’ve noted a lot of authors do accidentally when trying to write a novel from another time period.  It is obvious that Blodgett has put a lot of time and love into this novel, perfecting the language and causing the reader to transport to another world entirely, becoming lost within the pages of this epic novel.Although the story takes place in the future and is superior in terms of technological advances (a sort of steampunk novel), the society seems to have backtracked as well, at least in terms of language, giving it a historical feel while at the same time lending itself to both the paranormal and fantasy genre.  I thought it was ingenious that 19 states in the USA are kingdoms within themselves, set inside a sphere, as the outside air is tainted and savages roam the land.  Although the background concerning the Guardians/Evil Ones is not fully disclosed, including how the divide between the sphere and the outside world truly came to be, the story will maintain reader interest through the constant action and fascinating love triangle of sorts—and the sequel is set up to answer any ensuing questions one might have.While more of a romance story than that of suspense, Blodgett still captures the reader and creates suspense in terms of character actions, withholding key information until the perfect time to drop it upon the reader.  On more than one occasion I found myself fretting for Clara, the kindhearted princess subjected to abuse from Queen Ada and her betrothed, Prince Frederic.  These two characters set my teeth on edge and their interactions within the novel made me cringe.  Yet, juxtaposed with these two evil characters is a cast of dashing young men forever at the aide of Clara, and I honestly cannot pick a favorite.  I think I switched loyalties at least five times within the novel, constantly going back and forth between the characters as new information was provided.  And as of yet, I still haven’t decided where my loyalties lie!Blodgett does not end her novel hanging by a thread, but she does leave it open for a sequel, for which I am very excited, as there are new mysteries waiting to be solved.  I cannot wait to find out who Clara chooses and how the Guardians/Evil Ones come into play, forever changing the earth.  This novel, set to release June 16th, is completely different and a truly wonderful read that you won’t want to miss!

"Two Moons of Sera—Omnibus, is the complete four part series all in one book. For me, it was like the element world met fantasy, complete with land dwellers–Erlanders, water dwellers–Sualwet, and even a fire dwellers–A’aihea. Segregated and at war with one another, Serafay knows little of any world. Half human and half Sualwet, and despised by both races, she’s lived her life in seclusion for her sixteen years. But today, everything she’s ever known is going to change.This four part volume takes place over the course of about a week, beginning with Sera as she hems and haws about her mother not allowing her to go anywhere aside from their beach, however, a sighting of a strange Erlander piques her interest and is the beginning of the end of life as she knows it. Meeting Tor is a godsend in a way, because soon after, the war between Erlanders and Sualwet takes a turn for the worst, and Sera is forced to flee. Hand in hand with Tor, the strange Erlander she met on the beach, her adventures begin as they find themselves in many a precarious situation.I loved learning about the different people of this world Tyler has created. The Erlanders are just like humans as we know them, living within the confines of cities, believing themselves superior, starting wars. But the difference here is the dystopian aspect—Erlanders are at the mercy of their government; they are matched with others, are given three chances to reproduce within their match, are assigned jobs, and are unable to make their own choices about basically everything. The Sulawet live underwater and are the equivalent to merfolk in my mind, but they also have the ability to walk on land. Their eyes and webbed feet give them away, and because land is foreign, most do not tread the ground often. They have their own distinct language, live in underwater cities, and disown/dislike any foreign object, people included. And the A’aihea are fire dwellers. The closest equivalent I was able to make in my mind was those who live near the equator. While the A’aihea people of Tyler’s story dwell in the mountains and deep underground, their lack of clothing due to heat, and their vast hatred of any and all foreigners, Erlander or Sulawet alike, made me think of a more tribal type of group.Overall, the vast similarity between these groups is their hatred for any and all foreigners. And it is this was Tyler speaks about in her writing, though it’s more of a theme than a direct admonition of the world today.I found the beginning of this novel to be a bit slow, but when Sera met Tor, the storyline began to pick up. As events unfolded, I found myself engrossed in the story, rooting for Sera and Tor and becoming quite protective of them as they found themselves on some fairly wild adventures with both Erlanders and A’aiheas alike. However, I must say that the very last volume left me wanting; there is minimal closure, and so I am sure that Tyler must be planning a sequel of sorts. While an epilogue does exist, it creates more questions than it answers, with the biggest of them all still left unanswered: what is Sera’s purpose the A’aihea spoke of? Overall, this is a great fantasy serial that I highly recommend, but know going in that this isn’t the whole story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VEZHWY6858ZF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005U81SCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VEZHWY6858ZF","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was an interesting whodunit type mystery dealing with college aged students, though it reads more as a YA or MG novel. It’s easy to understand prose and characters draw the reader in from the get go, and it’s definitely a fun ride. There are a bit more characters involved in this story than I’m used to, and so as a reader I had more people to try and keep track of, but overall Flann does a good job keeping the reader on track. I will say that I didn’t really connect with any of the characters due to the vast amount of them—they were spread a little thin in terms of characterization for me—but overall, they were likable and intriguing, spurred on by different motivations that cast them in different lighting as the novel progresses.While I found some of the events within the novel to be a little far-fetched, the premise was on point and I thought the search for the missing artifact to be actually quite enjoyable. From crazy sleuthing in the dead of night to false antics, the characters and events kept me on my toes as it all came to a head. This is a clean novel with a somewhat humorous take on the “whodunit” mystery, and if you’re in the mood for something a bit light, then I suggest taking this novel for a spin.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.

"This novel is split into two parts: the “before” and “after.” It’s a very interesting way of dealing with a novel that involves a school shooting—whereas the beginning of the novel shadows that of Jack as he spirals downward, the second portion of the novel jumps ahead 10 years, following Jason, a young man returning to teach English at the very school he attended when the shooting occurred. This allows readers to gain the unique perspectives of both those leading up to the event and those still recovering from it years afterward.Perhaps what I found most frustrating, but also rewarding, is the fact that Cook doesn’t give readers a specific reason for the violence that occurs on any account within his novel. No one aspect or person can be pinpointed for blame, which is, in reality, a truth I feel many people do not want to accept. Why do people do the things they do? The news constantly tries to pinpoint one specific reason, and I feel like it is our human nature to try and understand, to cast blame, but in reality there are so many factors that make up these nightmares that the finger pointing and blame game is speculative at best. Thus, Cook leaves readers with more or less an ambiguous look at the mindset of both Jack and Jason, which I admit frustrated me, but is probably more accurate in its portrayal of events than anything else.Having escaped his hometown for a while, and reluctant to be back, Jason is roped into becoming the school spokesperson as the 10 year anniversary of the shooting comes upon the town. I found this fascinating, but as Jason tries to deal with his memories, his students, the faculty, and the people of the town, he begins to break down. I don’t know if this was intentional or not, but I really zoned in on the antics of Jason as a teacher—perhaps because I am one myself—and I just couldn’t get over how terrible he really is at his job, morally speaking. Having witnessed illegal activities, I would expect him to report them right away—to intervene—to speak up—but instead, Jason begins to hide inside himself, pushing everyone away from him and, as faculty members begin to die and the blame game once again becomes the town’s favorite pastime, he begins to lose himself. While a very interesting look at the human psyche, my morals as a teacher made me quickly begin to lose any respect I had for Jason as the story unfolded. I think the point was that Jason was completely and utterly shaken to his core during the shooting; that it is an event he will never truly recover from, but as an adult in charge of children, I expected more out of him in this aspect.I also found some aspects of the novel to be a little too predictable in terms of the current deaths plaguing the school, which is unfortunate, but could also be intentional as I feel Cook is more so interested in human nature and the psyche than a full on mystery novel. Overall, this is a well-written novel, but remains somewhat ambiguous on many fronts, especially with the ending, and there are a few grotesque events in the novel as well, aside from the mass shooting, so reader beware.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.

"While the premise behind this novel is indeed very good, I personally found it a bit slow. The main character, Cady, jumps between flashbacks and the present, which is usually one of my favorite types of writing styles, but this time, it fell a bit flat for me. I really just felt like this was a story about some cousins who visit an island every summer, only to watch their parents fight with one another over money and other superficial things. The story itself didn’t really move, and while the kids are friendly and they have a few fun excursions, I must have completely missed the segment that explained how, exactly, they were known as the liars—they didn’t seem to do anything, let alone talk to one another.Gat is a friend of the family and soon becomes Cady’s crush, but there is no development there aside from her pining for a boy she can’t have, so the romance aspect was a little bit of a bust for me as well. Truthfully, I could have done without it, since it didn’t go anywhere, and much of the grumbling on Cady’s behalf became monotonous fairly quickly for me. In terms of characterization, Cady isn’t a character I like, and though not much time was spent on the other characters, I didn’t really care for them either. Because of this, I think I struggled a little more than usual trying to connect with the character, and hence, I wasn’t a fan of the story overall.The last few pages of the novel reveal a surprise I didn’t see coming, and I liked it very much, but by that point the novel was basically over, so it was a short-lived revelation for me. I think, had the novel had a little more action and characters that meant something to me, I would have enjoyed this story so much more, but as it is, it just isn’t for me. However, a lot of my friends absolutely loved this novel, so I highly suggest you check out other reviews and give it a try because I may be the odd man out on this one. As is, though, I can only give it two and a half stars.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DZ1IJP1EG3JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FPOSDGY#wasThisHelpful","R2DZ1IJP1EG3JK","A13DHT9IJA4J13","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A13DHT9IJA4J13?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let me compare this to the T300 which I have used several times at my friends house and you will understand why I say this wheel is a Game changer in the steering wheel market.First of all the T150 steering wheel is not removable like the T300 but IMHO that was not much of a big deal, it also does not have the same quality pedals but for half the price what can you expect.What it does have is excellent driving control and a fantastic feedback system.  When you first take it out of the box and turn the wheel and hear the whirring sound of the internal belt it's a little disconcerting, you start to wonder how smooth it will be when hooked up. Also at first glance the pedals do not look like they have bolt down holes but on closer inspection they DO, so that's great. Unfortunately the wheel itself is clamp down system only.When I started using it with my PS4 I was shocked at how smooth this $200 wheel felt, I was expecting a very loose feel and a fairly large dead zone but instead I found it was excellent!  I could detect almost no dead zones or free play in the wheel, and the feedback also had no dead zones. In fact it's a very good steering wheel that gives me a good sense of realism with a very good turning radius and unbelievably good feedback.  The only really noticeable difference was that the T300 is a bit more of a precise feel, but as I said at half the price your getting a wheel and pedals that are more than adequate for just about anyone except the most avid drivers.Another nice thing is that you can hookup an external shifter if you want and other accessories and you can swap out the pedals if you want to upgrade to metal ones later on.  I did find the break pedal to be a bit soft but the $5 rubber insert mod I found on YouTube fixed that problem in minutes.Overall the T150 is a great buy, if you have the cash and can spring for the T300 or T500 go for it, but if your not an absolute racing fanatic the T150 is a really great match for a PS4 or PS3.  I did not try the PC driver and see how it worked on the PC but I suspect it will work pretty well.I can't say enough good things about how pleasantly surprised I was with this wheel and it's various controls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RINAYGAS0PC6J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014US02ZA#wasThisHelpful","RINAYGAS0PC6J","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Beast!At our work place we use a lot of server power supplies for various servers, but this one has got to be one of the largest and heaviest 750W units I have ever seen.  It fit perfectly in the case but it uses every inch of length and width available.The packaging for this power supply is unbelievable.  It felt like I was opening up a box from Tiffany's.  Everything is in top class molded foam and you get so many spare cables that you will never have an issue with that.  It even comes with a elegant black fabric bag to hold the spare cables.As for the performance, it does not disappoint, it is virtually silent and it has no problem working with the server we put it in.  Time will tell with the durability, but I am guessing that this is going to last a long time, because it has so much thermal mass that the supply is very cool and a cool power supply that is not overly dependent on a fan typically lasts a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18OHQ0L9RT89Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IKDETOW#wasThisHelpful","R18OHQ0L9RT89Q","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"How do they fit it all in there, that's the first thing that came to mind when I got the Mobi Pro.They did and it works great!  For me it's a great way to take my  older digital SLR camera and add WiFi to it.  Now I can transfer pictures to my PC without having to attach a cable or pull out the card.  I really cannot find anything bad about the Mobi, it's pretty much perfect at doing what it says it will do.It does come with a cloud based storage offer, with some free time then a yearly fee and the Mobi card will upload your photos once it gets a WiFi connection and it can also be configured to post to twitter and Facebook accounts.  Since I am not into sharing my personal photos with the world I did not test that aspect.  For those who are Facebook fanatics this is a great tool as you can have your photos uploaded to your account right away.I was intrigued by the cloud service as it seemed like a very practical application when your traveling.  When I am on vacation I always have a fear that my Camera will go missing and all the great photos will be gone with it.  The Cloud service would allow me to instantly upload the photos when I get to the Hotel without even having to think about it.  So that a nice feature.Construction etc are excellent and 32GB is more than most of us will ever use during a typical vacation or trip, so overall this is certainly a five star product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF68PLC0NY0E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKFEPHA#wasThisHelpful","RF68PLC0NY0E0","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Absolutely great!  My shooting accuracy went up by several notches in just the first week of usage.  The method of scoring and resetting etc is brilliantly implemented, you can just stand back and shoot, then shoot the score circle, write down your score and then shoot the reset circle and start again without having to go back to the device.  If I have any gripes it's that you really need to count your shots because if a second one land on top of another you still only get one LED lighting, so you need to do the math of dividing your score by the number of shots to figure out were the non visible ones landed.  They really should have used triple pin LEDS so that the duplicates would show up in another color.The count down and draw timer is great for increasing your draw and shoot speed and it's even better if you have a double action auto or a revolver, for me with a single action it's a bit more challenging, but none the less it gives me excellent results for that all important first shot.The construction of the case and everything else is OK, but it's not spectacular and could have been better but it's good enough to get the job done.  There is a wall mount hole on the back along with the battery case for 4 AA batteries and the on/off switch is on the side.Overall if your looking for a method of improving your accuracy, this may be one of the best ways of doing it short of going down to the range.  It's also the safest way possible to practice quick drawing and firing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I09I1F9MMWG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYY4CJG#wasThisHelpful","R2I09I1F9MMWG3","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wish this had been a 5 star product but unfortunately it has some issues that take away from what could have been a great product.For starters the watch is a lot sleeker and slimmer than I first thought, it is actually a very nice looking watch for people who don't like bulky watches.  The band on the other hand is pretty cheaply designed and is very awkward to put on each day.  They do give you a spare grey band along with the attached black one and also a nurses type pendant band for people who need that kind of band.The software installed seamlessly on my iPhone 5S and updated the watches firmware, I think that eliminated a lot of the bugs that other people had experienced. so on the software side I give it high marks.  Where the watch falls flat is in the way it operates on your wrist and the actual usage of available LCD display area.I am not sure who designed the system for it to show you the time, but it took me several minutes to figure out that you needed to lift up your hand and also give your wrist a slight twist to point the screen at your face to get the display to show the time.  Now this may seem like a no brainer but believe me it's not just the the action that is required but the way you do it that makes the difference, it's like you have to learn the movement in both speed and the motion steps to get a reliable readout.  Then there is the Tapping of the screen to move between the different items, it's not very reliable and I ended up tap tapping and more tapping to get it to change.My second gripe is the LCD itself.  It's really nice looking but it uses a fraction of the available screen size to show you the time and date!They could have easily made the Font double the size if not 4 time bigger but instead they made it so small that you have to look hard to see what time it is.  Why did they do that, I can only assume to save battery power.Speaking of battery life, it is pretty much what I expected, it's about one day and then it needs recharging.  The funny part is that it does have enough power to probably get you part way through the second day, so why bother saving that power and just use it to make the display lettering bigger, your going to have to charge it daily anyway unless you want to have a dead watch at lunch time every other day. The good news is that the app does a good job at syncing it with my iPhone and it does seem to have relevant info, although I think it would be a mistake to assume each step it measures is really a step and not some other form of movement, therefore the Calories burned is dubious but none the less relevant because one can see a trend in activity and therefore know if your doing more or less each day.  I also like the 14 day memory ability, you don't have to worry about syncing it with your phone every day.Overall given the price and what you get for that price it's not bad but it could have been so much more if they had made a better band and added even a single button to the frame so I could just press it to see the time.  Lastly, if they are not going to use magnetic induction charging and instead use physical contact pins I can see why it's not rated as being water proof, only water resistant.  So if it's water resistant why not add some buttons instead of depending on tapping?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GGMH56VNX1CW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUEWD2#wasThisHelpful","R2GGMH56VNX1CW","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used lots of electric shavers over the years and each and every year they keep getting better.  A model like this would have probably sold for $200 three years ago.  Blades on the other hand seem to be limited to just adding more blades which does not really make the shave much better.The PF7400 gives me a very close shave without any irritation and the batteries are good for approximately two days of shaving and then it needs recharging.  The overall unit I suspect from past experience will last about 1 year before the foil starts to develop holes or the blades just get dull.  This will still be a significant savings over buying expensive razors.  The Remington 7400 is constructed ok, it's not a $250 Braun but then again it's not supposed to be.  What you get is a mid priced razor that fairly quiet and shaves surprisingly well.  The bonus is that it will save you a bag of money over it's lifespan.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PMSJ2V3PKC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0X2T42#wasThisHelpful","R30PMSJ2V3PKC4","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Brilliant idea, and it's a well constructed heavy piece of equipment that is well thought out and engineered but I had to take one star off because the weight of the unit plus the attached drill made it pretty difficult to work with until I ggt all the slack out and the tension started to build, after that it's pretty very easy to deal with.  At first I was a bit concerned my less than optimal she man cordless drill was not going to be up to the task, but they have so much gear reduction going on in this thing that my puny drill had no problems moving about 350 lbs of weight straight up into the air.This is a great piece of gear to add to your tool collection, it does not use up a lot of space and it really has a lot of power.  Great if you need to remove pieces of fallen tree out of your property or to hoist  some heavy items into your pickup truck.  BTW It also has a built in system that will prevent damage if you try to lift or pull too much weight.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EY9YA7465II2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SF70SN4#wasThisHelpful","R3EY9YA7465II2","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Chair is an absolute 5 star chair, but IMO the assembly instructions or lack of are 2 star.  Maybe it was just mine that lacked them.  None the less if you read my review you should have no problem.The first thing that impressed me is how heavy the whole package is and how well made the piston assembly that moves the chair up and down is.  With all the previous office chairs we have had to replace, this mechanism was the weak point.  After a few years they fail and the chair starts to slip downward on it's own or the piston starts to wobble.  With this Basyx chair the piston is about 2 times thicker and it really feels heavy and solid.  Also it's the first one I have seen with a locking mechanism.The chair itself was not as comfortable as the one it replaced but that's expected since the leather and padding are new and still a bit hard.What might get to people is the complete lack of documentation, now at first I was not a concern  because these chairs are not rocket science to put together, but what was frustrating was that you see threadings in each of the holes that hold the piston but you see nothing to hold the piston in place, like a big locking nut.  After a few minutes I decided to just stick it together and sit on it.  Evidently that's the right move because your own weight pushes both ends into what are really gripping threadings and after that the chair seems almost impossible to separate the lower and upper halves.  I should also mention that  I did appreciate the extra screws and screw covers and the fact that they are clearly labeled as extras.What else can I say, I have assembled about 5 or 6 office chairs before and this one is certainly the best in terms of how the materials feels.  The wheels have a very solid feel to them and as I said the piston assembly is first rate,  the leather surface is smooth and has no pattern in it, some may like that and others may not.  For me it was not an issue.  I also like the rock back feeling on this chair, it goes back nicely but does not feel like it's going to tip or anything.In the end I had to base my review entirely on the chair itself since the 30 minutes it took to assemble it is just a tiny fraction of time and not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQ6ERTBWD7DQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVKEZO8#wasThisHelpful","R2HQ6ERTBWD7DQ","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I kind of have mixed feelings about this Drill press.It's pretty good for light to medium work, but not so good if the item is heavy or getting to the point in size where it uses more than 1/2 of the opening width.  I found the screwdriver type turning system with pull out and bend 90 deg for tightening it down hard to be a very neat idea. I also liked the quick release button for sizing the jaws quickly.  What I did not like was how flimsy the quick release and the 90 deg turning elbow felt.Bottom line is that it's small, compact and fairly easy to put away in a drawer yet can be used to hold small and medium sized items for quick drilling.  It's just a pity that they did not include a bottom attachment that would allow me to clamp it down on a table.  The idea of drilling holes in my work bench to hold this clamp in place permanently kind of defeats the portable nature of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH7PTG5IP7S2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F5XU07A#wasThisHelpful","RH7PTG5IP7S2W","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Excellent portable charger, most likely one of the best on the market, but it is pricey.  For someone who is on the go and needs to have their phone working at all times this charger is fantastic.  My wife is one of those people who is always forgetting to charge her phone, so I gave it to her and she keeps it in her pocket book for emergency charging.  So far she has used it about 4 times in just 3 weeks and I only had to recharge the power pack twice.I did some test and found her iPhone 5S takes about an hour to charge from the 20% marker to 100%.  The unit had enough power left to fully charge her phone again, so it's like having two spare battery packs on you.The great part for most women is that they can just connect the phone to the battery pack and just drop the two back in their pocket book and go about their business while the phone is charging.  I really like the fact that I don't have to worry about her running out of power while she is on the road.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6AGTP814GKS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TUH8LDM#wasThisHelpful","R6AGTP814GKS2","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After 3 weeks of use let me just sum this one up with a Good the Bad and The Ugly type review.THE GOOD1) Sounds pretty darn good for a low cost portable speaker. If you have Never owned a set of portable speakers before, you will be surprised at just how loud it can get and how good the Highs, Mids and even the Bass can be from something this small.  Keep in mind the size and don't expect miracles, but let me just say it is good enough to used at a small get together party.  The Bass is probably the only thing that is less than stellar, but for the size and the fact it's battery powered, it's amazing.2) The construction is first rate!  From the moment you pull it out of the box you know this speaker is not a toy but instead a well constructed piece of gear, it's solid yet light weight and seems to be designed towards budding audiophiles who are on the go and need something portable.3) Connectivity via Bluetooth was easy and straight forward, it should take almost anyone just a minute or two to have music playing.4) Comes with a lot of accessories, including a nice case that can be used even when playing music, it really does not effect the sound very much. Also included are plug adapters for use when traveling abroad and a few other items.5) Pretty good built in rechargeable batteries. I would hate to estimate how long it will play on a single charge because that it really based on how loud you have the volume.THE BAD1) Bluetooth range is a bit more limited than expected, I got about 14 ft before the audio started to drop out.2) It requires a bit of boosting to the the various frequencies to get the best sound. The default sound setting from your phone will be a bit flat, but if you go into the phone/tablet audio settings you should find one that makes it sound good to you.THE UGLY1)  The controls are confusing and not all that well thought out.  You will get use to it after you play with it for a bit, but it is not intuitive to operate,the manual is like everything else you get today, a fold out multi lingual confused mess and I have noticed a few glitches in the button presses.CONCLUSION:  It's not a $500 powered Bose speaker, it's a portable speaker and in that arena it's a very good product.  I took one star off because the controls bugged me and I also think they should have gotten at least 25 feet of range on the Bluetooth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R221SS2993N1M6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9ID070#wasThisHelpful","R221SS2993N1M6","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Very cool unit, I never owned a cordless phone with this level of features.Besides just being a regular Panasonic cordless phone (meaning great reception and call quality), the Link2cell has built in Bluetooth, so it can link to your cell phone and extract your contact names and numbers and store them in it's own memory.  So when someone calls your house you not only see the caller ID of the number but also the name and it announces the name via voice.  That's a nice feature, but even better, is the fact that when your home and a call comes in on the house phone it will also instantly ring your cell phone via bluetooth and you can answer it on your cell phone.  It also works in reverse, a cell phone call can come in and the house phone will ring as well and you can answer it on either device so long as they are both within blue tooth range.  All of these features can be modified the way you want them, you can prevent the phones from pairing automatically, that way you can just extract your phones caller list but not have the auto pairing or both phones ringing and sharing numbers.  You can also turn off the voice announcement.  This phone has a ton of features in the menu, it can do so many thing that it's impossible to right about  them in a small review.One thing I should stress, is that the phone itself is well made and solid.  It's full color hi-res LCD gives you a hint  that a lot of stuff is happening in the phone. Like all my cell phones I expect that one day either the Answer or Hangup button will fail from all the use, that's what seems to be the killer of all my phones is dead buttons.  With the Link2Cell you can buy extra handsets, I think it supports 4 at a time.  I bought one extra one that will be left in it's box until the original one dies.  For just a few extra dollars I should be able to double the life of this fantastic phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OCE6Q8CFLEH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJOMEV6#wasThisHelpful","R3OCE6Q8CFLEH0","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

IMO probably not a bad thing since you don't typically read or write  thousands of small files on drives like this.  For large files it's absolutely flying, this is probably the fastest portable drive I have used for large files.I am taking off one point because the speed difference between large and small is huge, with that said it's still one super fast drive and is fully USB port powered.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28UBWIUWOZTUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TKFEE5S#wasThisHelpful","R28UBWIUWOZTUP","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I am a backup fanatic!  After losing the first 5 years of my sons baby photos in a hard drive crash I learned my lesson and now I backup everything onto a raid drive system. I already own a Western digital 4 drive NAS  so when this Seagate Pro2 fell into my lap I was really anxious to not only be able to backup more stuff but to see how they compared.The unit comes in a fairly plain square brown box, but it is well padded with internal holders and you also get another box inside the box that has the separate brick power supply and an Ethernet cable along with a small fold out starters manual.It has 1x USB3 port on the front, one USB3 on the back and a USB2 port on the back.  Also two Ethernet ports that can be configured for separate IP's.  So you can basically configure this to work at your home and backup your home PC's on port one and have the second port configured for another network location like your office.Now you need to know this, the fold out manual is a bit confusing.  If the unit you purchased already has drives in it you do NOT need to press the reset button.  Just unpack,  and attach the Ethernet cable to your LAN and then decide if your going to use port one or two on the back of the Pro2. Next attach power and press the power button and the drive will go through a series of sync ups that take about 8 minutes.  The drives come already set to RAID 1 so they are mirrored and your available space with the 4TB version will be about 1.8TB which is the norm. You can change that for full 4TB storage but do so at your own peril as you will no longer have redundancy.Once the power light is no longer blinking you can then open a browser window and go to the URL that is provided.  That site will guide you through the rest of the setup.  Keep in mind this drive is like a full PC with dual core 1.7mhz cpu and 2Gb DDR Ram, so it can run software independent of your regular PC's. I think you are limited by what Seagate has to offer, but I did see several programs including torrent software for those who are into that.  BTW it also has full UPS communication support for power outage shutdowns.I ran some benchmark tests and had very good results, I am truly impressed.Write Speed from PC internal HD to Pro2 was 117mb/s with large files (5gb) This thing flies when your writing to it.Write speed with 30,000 small system files was about 60mb/s which is also impressiveRead speed large files was 83mb/sRead speed with small files, same 30,000 files was about 57mb/sMaximum internal temperature reached was 50C and the smart fan had revved up to 1230 RPM.BTW you have a full real-time diagnostics page when you open the browser. You can see performance graphs over time, for almost every aspect of the drive including transfers speeds, it's CPU usage, memory usage, temperature and fan speed etc.The Seagate Pro 2 is well constructed, it feels solid and while it lacks the LCD info screen of the WD  it makes up for it in other areas like faster speed, and a few extra ports.  The only thing that I did not like was that the ejection system for the hot swappable drives, it is a little less robust than my WD ejection system.Overall I am very impressed, it's fast, it came with NAS drives installed, so that means the failure rate should be really low compared to regular drives.  The FAN is absolutely silent even at full speed and its not a little fan, its fairly big for a bay of this size. It certainly keeps the exterior cool to the touch.  Always keep in mind that heat is the number one killer of hard drives, so a good cooling system is something you really want.  I also really like the the ability to configure it for two different network systems. I have already set one port up for my home IP range and another for my office IP range.Time will tell, but after almost two weeks I am very happy with this NAS drive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJEFZEBI6E8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LM6LBOU#wasThisHelpful","RJEFZEBI6E8T","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all this track is a load of fun for younger kids and it’s great that it is expandable and can be added to a much larger track system.  You will not be disappointed with it if your kids are into hot wheels cars.With that said I do have one major gripe, why did they not include another car in the package?  I mean it probably costs hotwheels Co. less than 50 cents to add another car and yet they make a track system that requires two cars for it to be useful and then give you only one!  Arggg oh well, just remember to order another car if your child does not have one available already.So the way this track works, is that one car goes from the top tower and can trigger the launch of two more cars as it goes down the track.  Depending on how you assembled the track you can end up with different configurations of how each of the cars will exit the track and what they will do.  As I said before, you can join this into another set your child may have, so think of this track as a kind of nexus hub that can make a normal track layout much more interesting.  If you don’t have another track it is still great because the layout is large and interesting on its own.  Just don’t look for collisions etc. it’s not designed to be a smash up track but more of hub for creating interaction between multiple cars.I am sorry that I had to take off one star on this one, because it is a really good toy, but it was very frustrating on the first night when we finally got it all setup and both of us realized that another car was needed to make any of the magic happen.

So I was really intrigued when I got the opportunity to test a Netgear commercial router against one of our 16 port Cisco routers that we installed last year.Well I am happy to say for 1/2 the price the netgear was on par in speed performance with the Cisco router I had and it has a few bonuses that the other companies could learn from Netgear.  For instance the Snap on wall mount is so much easier to deal with than the typical screw down bracket, the corner power plug in makes it easy to turn off or just reset the router.  It also has the typical reset to default recessed button at the back.The built in power supply with the Netgear Prosafe makes it easy to plug into my UPS.  With some of the other routers at work (Not Cisco) router,  I have to figure out how to plug in the wall adapter without it covering over an extra plug.The Ethernet ports on the netgear are solid and the cables plug in with a very positive and secure feeling.  The internal configuration software is easy to get to and you can setup QSO for the ports.I really cannot think of anything bad to say about the prosafe. I have been running it for a week and so far everything has been perfect.  Once again I cannot stress how nice it is to have that quick snap off system, it eliminates the biggest problem I find with normal routers when I am trying to check cables or ports.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33I0Z87OX4V50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R92CI20#wasThisHelpful","R33I0Z87OX4V50","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this Fan a 4 star instead of 5 simply because it does not oscillate like I would have expected.  You can aim it up or down but the real trick of this fan is it's use of  air diffusion so that the baby does not get too much direct air blown on them but at the same time that kind of limits it's use in keeping away mosquitoes etc.One thing that is great is that you can tell safety was the prime motive about the design.  From the child proof switches to the grill openings that are made in such a way that it is impossible for a baby to get their fingers inside, to even the plug cord which is hidden in the base and retractable.  It all comes together into a very safe package that's easy to clean and keep dust free.  The noise from the fan is about what you would expect, it's not whisper quiet but at the same time it's kind of a soothing white noise sound that may aid the baby in sleeping.Overall a very good design in a compact package.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KTG4VTY3AE0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XB4P8#wasThisHelpful","R2KTG4VTY3AE0C","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Turbo Calcium is fantastic stuff, it works great for getting up your calcium levels up quickly.  Just make sure to read the instructions, don't add water to dry calcium, that can be very dangerous.  You need to do it the other way around and add calcium to the water in increments and stir it up.  You should expect some heat to be generated if your adding it to water in a small container.It's not a complicated product so I don't think it needs a complicated review :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BLGK2R7CE5CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000255PEO#wasThisHelpful","R2BLGK2R7CE5CB","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unit worked fine on low volume setting but when switched to high volume the unit worked in an erratic manor.  Put in a fresh set of batteries, it worked fine again for a day at high volume then the same problem came back.  I checked the batteries with a volt meter and each time the combined voltage drops by a little due to usage the audio goes erratic.  The other problem is that the low volume is too low so that makes high volume the only option.

"It really is important that you read the instructions for these units.  If you already have mice you need to get rid of them first using traps etc. before installing these or it's just going to be a waste of time.  Mice that already know your house has a nice supply of food are willing to put up with some sonic irritation if it means a full belly.  If you where hungry and the only nearby source of food was a room full of huge speakers playing rock and roll at 100db level, you might back off at first but when the hunger really strikes you will certainly bare the noise to fill your stomach.  On the other hand if you had no idea that this room of pain had food in it you would most likely move on and check somewhere else for a snack, that's the reason that you need to get rid of the mice that already know your house is a feeding ground.So what you really have is a device that makes your house unattractive to scouting mice and send them scurrying before they even begin to locate food sources.This would have been a five star review if it was not for the fact that the design needs a free plug and that can really limit where you can put these units.  Before making a purchase make sure that you have unused electric outlets in the areas that you need the Repellers. IMO that would be in the kitchen and other places that have food sources.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BA7LN6QAOGCJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OIP1G9W#wasThisHelpful","R1BA7LN6QAOGCJ","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Very disappointed that it does not work with XBMC for playing directly off the hard drive.  Sure the internal player can play anything you throw at it, but I purchased this believing what it said, that it could run XBMC and play media via XBMC.  Well yes it can do it but only if the media is not in HD!  If the show is in 720p or 1080p you get massive stuttering and frame dropping.  Why use XBMC?  Well the Scrapping ability of XBMC is fantastic, the one that the built in player has is almost worthless.  You have to go in over and over to keep getting it to scrape movie info and even then the info is very limited.  You also have very little control over organizing your shows with the built in player.  With XBMC you can do all these things perfectly.  And yes to make XBMC work  I have tried all the recommended accelerator settings etc.  I spent 3 days looking up stuff on the web, even editing command lines in files but  in the end it was clear that for STREAMING HD media XBMC from external sources XBMC will work fine but for playing local HD media it just does not have a proper driver for that and XBMC does not seem interested in providing one either.Also beware this unit has no fan that I can see for the internal hard drive.  In my experience that's a really bad thing that's going to lead to a rather short life of the hard drive.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKGWNBHI72G1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J90X0RC#wasThisHelpful","RKGWNBHI72G1G","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave this to my little Niece, she is 5 years old and her parents recently bought her a Leappad 2 Ultra for Christmas.First of all what you receive is a cartridge that fits into the to top of the leappad.  So you can only have one of these cartridge based games on the system at a time.  You can download other software into the system using the online store but cartridges are one at a time based.Onto the game itself.  She was already familiar with Umizoomi characters so I guess that made it more fun for her.  She quickly mastered the Game play and was learning some new math concepts along the way, I would imagine that all of the shape building games would be great for slightly younger child, say 3 years old, but at 5 they pretty much have basic shapes down pat, none the less a few did have her a bit confused and she learned some new shapes as the game progressed.  IMO Umizoomi Math is a win win for any parent that has a child with a Leappad unit and is looking for a nice educational game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65I7KDZGOJO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KNT6NHM#wasThisHelpful","R65I7KDZGOJO9","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was easy to setup and has fairly good range.  The speed is a little slower than I had hoped but all in all not too bad.Construction quality is good and I like the dual antennas, I would hate to know what the range would be like with just one. I used my web browser and pointed it to 192.168.1.1  which is the routers default address. I then logged in using the User Name ""admin"" and the WiFi password.  I went ""Applications & Gaming""/QOS and disabled WMM as people have mentioned and it did have a bit of an impact on the speed, but not the super amount I expected.

"First of all my 5 star rating is based on the Toothbrush itself and the excellent job it does at cleaning my teeth.This is probably the best electric toothbrush I have ever used and you can definitely tell that your teeth are a lot cleaner than they would be had you used anything else, short of a dentist cleaning your teeth. The construction and build quality are first rate and I see no problems at all with anything in it's construction. I expect this unit to last a pretty long time.With that said I was almost tempted to take off a star because my first impressions of the Bluetooth hookup was that it was just a big gimmick!  After all I know when I brushed my teeth I have an idea of how well I brushed them, an added app is really not going to make much difference.  Then I started to think about it and realized this might be a useful tool for monitoring my Sons brushing, so I attached an extra head and loaded up the app and gave him a lesson in using it.  The end results are excellent!  He feels like it's a bit of a game/competition and I get an easy way to monitor that he has really brushed his teeth properly.  About my only complaint is that the app is a bit intrusive and of course it's another device to plugin and charge.  Those issues aside this is the Mercedes Benz of electric toothbrushes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36P8JGE3U8QZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O8ODHOA#wasThisHelpful","R36P8JGE3U8QZ2","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First of all Read the manual, this is one of those items that it is a must that you read the manual.  After you have read it, you still need a few important tips.1) Turning on and off the unit using the touch sensitive buttons is a hit or miss thing depending on how dry your finger tips are.  I found that wetting my two finger tips with a little water made it work perfectly. (I think they went a little too far on the child safe stuff on this one)2) Using the included voltage tester is great for making sure the unit is working properly.  Make sure to run a test the first time you use it.Now onto the review:I tried the Petsafe on my 100lb Rottweiler and I can tell you that it does work on larger dogs, the shock that is emitted is very mild (tested it on myself) and that's exactly what you want, the pendant will work on any size dog as the shock can be adjusted from very mild to just mild.The problem that most people will have is that they may be trying to use this device to train a dog that has no previous training, that is not what a device like this is used for, you have to first have your dog trained using a regular collar and leash and the main thing is to instill into your Dog a very good understanding of the word ""NO"".  Dogs that behave badly are often timed the result of the owner letting the dog get away with the bad behavior because they just cannot be bothered to correct it every time it occurs early on in his life. This leads to the dog getting the idea that he can do it again with a good chance of not having a reprimand and this is a very hard thing to undo.  If you take the time when they are a puppy to correct problems gently, they will behave properly without you having to do much work later on.The Petsafe pendant becomes an ideal tool when your dog gets a bit older and wiser and starts to realize that your too far away to see that he's breaking the rules.  At that point you may call out a stern ""NO"" through a window or down the stairs and if he ignores you.  A short burst from the Pendant will fix the problem and let your pet know that your rules need to be followed at all times.  I have trained several dogs and it would be beyond the scope of a simple review to go into details but this has worked well for me except when it comes to Shih Tzu's.  I have found that breed of dog to be extremely hard to train once the owner has let them rule the house during the puppy stage.As for the pendant itself, it may be problematic on long haired dogs but it certainly works with most breeds.  The shock is very mild and the audible chirp button is IMO too low, but it is enough to get your dogs attention. The unit is well constructed, it feels very durable and is fairly waterproof.  Mine has actually gotten wet when the dog got caught outside during a sudden rain storm and decided he was going to have fun playing in the rain instead of going to his shed.  The battery life is short on the collar unit, maybe 8-12 hours but you can get around that by charging the device and leaving your dog in the environment that he's misbehaving in.  For example if he's digging up your garden, put him outside with a freshly charged collar and then covertly watch him from a distance. As soon as he makes his first attempt at digging shout out ""NO"" and then give him a small burst.  The shock is so mild that he will most likely just stop and wonder what was that!! And go back again. Repeat it and he should stay away for a few minutes.  After a couple of repeat attempts I stopped shouting at him and just gave him the shock. I found that by watching him for an hour or so I was able to completely correct this behavior and he no longer goes for that section of the garden.If used in a correct manor you can stop most of the problems in a week or two and at that point you can remove the pendant for good and put it up in case your dog starts to ignore the rules again.  I know many people will have mixed views on using a device like this, but it is a far better solution that what typically happens, which is that the dogs behavior becomes increasingly more difficult to deal with and the owner eventually decides to drop him off at the pound, which as we all know is often times a death sentence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IXC0U7JSK5Y1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9FR5A2#wasThisHelpful","R1IXC0U7JSK5Y1","A1RDHBBZE1NPS3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RDHBBZE1NPS3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Fortunately we learned this is a combination of agressive Lacrosse practice and a big growing spurt in the past several months.KT tape is fabulous.  It provides the extra needed support to relieve the tension and pain my son has been having.We have relied on this brand of tape to support, wrists, ankles, feet and just about everything.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MBM2JJ0NEL4O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006O67XCW#wasThisHelpful","R1MBM2JJ0NEL4O","A33Y8C4818EJL0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33Y8C4818EJL0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The app is not much of a game, there is a chance to kind of take care of your Furby...feeding him, bathing him etc.  Which is kind of cute but I don't know that it will hold interest for long.But like I said, my kid truly oves the little guy so it's a great toy.Pros+ My kid loves these things+ Star Wars tie in+ It was fun to explore the possibilitiesCons- Annoying- Expensive- Kind of ugly","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BG1S63IGJE5C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV0T0HY#wasThisHelpful","R1BG1S63IGJE5C","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful, light and crisp scent.  Immediately upon putting it on, it has a strangely candy shop sweetness to it.  I'm assuming it's the vanilla, but with a sense of sweet fruit.  But this seems to fade leaving a healthy lower scent of cedar and slight muskiness and some vanilla.  Again the scent remains pretty light.This crispness makes this a perfect work scent.  It is not over powering and moderately complex. But could also work well on the town afterward. The dispenser is nice in appearance and design and has one of the best pumping actions I've seen on a bottle recently.

"This is a great premise, but  a somewhat lewd adult game.  We play a lot of board games with our kids ranged 8-14, and much of this game was racier than we would want for them, but they desperately wanted to play it once they heard how it plays.  So we made a pass through the cards and pulled out the inappropriate ones (about a third.)We found out a couple things, one, we are not that great at impressions and accents and secondly, our kids are much worse.  Which was very funny in itself.  The game consists of a judge who draws an accent card and then the other contestants pull quote cards from their hand to see who can make the funniest combination for the judge.  The judge then picks the best of the group.  We did start going to a panel for picking the best performance.All in all, it was a fun game.

"Easily the worst thing about this book was that I didn't read book one.  It is obvious that this plot is interwoven into book one considerably.  This book can and does stand on its own, but I really wish I had read the first book first.  I am definitely tracking down book one to fill the rest in.The best thing about this book is that it filled with suspense and dinosaurs...bunches of dinosaurs.  I am very impressed how well the author handles them.  This is what makes this a great book for my dinosaur mad sons.  What made it great for me was the way he handled the dinosaur knowledge of two time traveling experts that start 30 years apart but find themselves in the late cretaceous.  In fact, there is some much popular culture play in the book that you kind of have to be a parent to truly appreciate it all.  Not many kids know about Knight Rider or would understand that a kid from the 80's would be wowed by a VW Beetle from the 2000's.The book reads well, looks like it will be well illustrated and really engaged me.

"I like this package, espcially that it comes with a couple of refills.  It made quick work of dust on the TV and book shelves without the need to any Pledge.  It is great for quick dust ups before guests, and at least in the short run it got the kids super excited to dust.  Although I am not counting on that lasting.The Swiffer really does seem to have a magnetic attraction to dust and I'm impressed how well it picks it up.  The sides are soft and size is nice to work in and out of niches.  On the bad said, we pulled the dusting head off to fluff it as instructed, then had a hard time figuring out how it went back on.  For a while we had it flying off the handle every time we tried to dust before getting it to stick.  Would be nice if there was a more obvious way to reinstall the dusting head.I don't know that this is a life changing product, but it is handy enough and warrants the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU1392UHGOX3Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLUOM1W#wasThisHelpful","RU1392UHGOX3Q","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw these offered, I immediately thought ""camping in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.""  They seemed perfect for packing in a cooking oil, as well as an oil for rubbing out muscles that have paddled a little too long.What I got was a box of wonderfully individually packaged coconut oils.  The packages themselves are rather small, but enough to use to fry potatoes and vegetables for breakfast or to carmelize onions for burgers.  I wince a little when i think that they are very overpackaged, but for camping I forgive that.  I could see it taking a couple of these on some bigger meals, but the shelf stability and travel convenience is fantastic.Our camping season is pretty much done for this year, so to test the quality of the oil, we tore one open and popped popcorn in it.  The coconut adds a subtle sweetness to the popcorn and worked perfectly for popping.  Then we squeezed the left over for back massages. For back massages, it is great how to oil melts when it hits your hands and lubricates well for kneading muscles.  And afterward my girlfriend smelled delicious.  It feels oily for a while but soaks into the skin well and left her skin super soft.So it works perfectly for what it is.  We look forward to putting it into our food pack next summer as well a few winter massages.  It's pricey and it's over packaged, but it is perfect for travel and I have no doubts about the quality of the oil.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIBNM68K5THPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YNJPUYK#wasThisHelpful","RIBNM68K5THPA","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This appears to be a good cream. It applies very well. The scent is subtle, really smells like nothing, which is very nice. It absorbs well without a greasy feel. There does appear to be a little tingling after application. Skin feels soft and supple after application, but time will tell as I use it.I am very optimistic based on reviews and what others have said about eb5 products. The pricing seems decent and love that it is free of Parabans. There is a lot to like about this.

"Well the dogs seem to like this dog food well enough. We mixed it in with their normal food and they eat it preferentially. We have also been using it as treats and they eat it semi enthusiastically. There has been other foods that they have had better responses to, but for taste this seems a little above average for them.I like the grain free, which is a must for the dogs, but I'm not overly excited by the very long ingredient list, I see that most are supplements but some seem suspect like copper and zinc sulfates.The food is priced as a premium brand, and it probably is, but I trust our usual brands more. It does seem like a premium, but I think we're sticking to our usual. But I have to admit, the packaging is very nice and love that they give instructions for introducing new foods. That is thoughtful and promotes good dog care, kudos for that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UVKIV51OQL9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WUIG7BG#wasThisHelpful","R2UVKIV51OQL9C","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, I have to admit this was kind of an intimidating game.  The instruction books is big (although lots of pictures) and at times a little confusing.  We had to do a little interpreting and a little negotiating to make sense of some situations, but I think we have a good sense of how the game is played now.  Also I was a little concerned that having not watched the TV show, that we might be at a disadvantage.  This does not seem to be the case at all, although the glossy images from the show are probably a little lost on us.The game ended up being pretty intriguing.  I like the elements of distrust as you did not know the roles that others were playing and each person has a different incentive to hinder or abet terrorists. I was thinking that this would be basically a form of clue, but it is much more, and very playable.  Which is also kind of a surprise as I recall a slew of crappy movie and TV based games.The pieces are good quality.  The small plastic pieces are enough to keep younger kids kind of interested, but we found that our ten year old had problems tracking it.  It is definitely a more mature - 13 and up game.  The cards and board are decent and all in all, this is a very decent game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDD93RPSEDYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940825539#wasThisHelpful","R1GDD93RPSEDYE","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like Fluxx.  It's not the greatest strategy game in the world, but it is one of the most refreshing.  It is amazing how the game can change on a dime, but there is some strategy but it is fragile and it becomes a game a tactics and reacting to what is on the table.  These seem to just throw another element into the game that might not be needed.  It just puts a little more strength on the side of chaos.  Personally, I think the game is well balanced now.One thing I really wished the makers would have done is to think about the packaging.  This box could have held a full deck, but instead it held a couple dice and a few cards.  With a little foresight, they could have made a protective case that could hold, the dice and an entire deck of Fluxx cards.  Perhaps with a clear case to show off themed sets.Otherwise the materials are ok.  A little pricey for what you get, and note this is not a stand alone game.  You will need a Fluxx game to use this with. It was fine to play with this addition, but I don't know that it made the game better. But if you have never played Fluxx, I recommend it.  Especially with children, as the chaos kind of levels the playing field.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28D9YBQ8TKGVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010NL056O#wasThisHelpful","R28D9YBQ8TKGVI","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a beautiful book that is wonderfully visual and digestible.  It is perfect for my step daughter and her friends, and eight to ten years old seems to be the bullseye audience.The graphic design of the book is super strong with very simple illustration composition and instructions.  The illustrations show very clearly what do do with the hair and the materials needed.  It is beautiful just flipping through the book with it's simplicity and stunning visuals.  Although I did laugh when I hit the page showing flowers inserted into a girls hair with a glue gun illustrated next to her.  It took a second to realize they were gluing the flowers to the bobby pins, not her scalp. Many of the design ideas are tiaras and such, outnumbering the actual hairstyles.You will need a few things to fully use this book.  Bobby pins, Fake Flowers (go to Michael's), Glue Gun, and very long hair.  The fact that it is heavy on glue gun usage means that young children should be supervised.  But all the ideas as easy to implement.  I anticipate this book will get a lot of use in the next year.  Perhaps peaking again when the sequel comes out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MI7TL0J1KJJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940787351#wasThisHelpful","R3MI7TL0J1KJJX","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have never been much of a paper towel user, but my partner is.  And she is something of a paper towel snob.  She prefers the premium towels that are thick like fabric and are perforated every few inches so you can take just what you need.  I have to admit that whatever brand they are, they are nice paper towels.These paper towels don't quite live up to them.  These are decent paper towels. But they have a much more paper napkin feel than a cloth feel.  I would consider my partner's as ultra-premium and these to be plenty good.  I did use them to clean up after a breakfast and they held together well and absorbed spilled juice well.  Tree saving technology sounds good, but I can't help but think how many trees are saved over a year by using reusable cotton cloths.The big mystery on this is whether the pricing can match Costco/Sam's Club pricing.  Since this appears to be a new packaging option, there is no pricing available.  For the most part, you are getting a very decent paper towel in bulk packaging.  The differentiator here would be price per unit.  So if you need bulk paper towels, this is your product.  But check the pricing when it is available.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCDPVSD9AE0NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012HE3U2G#wasThisHelpful","RCDPVSD9AE0NF","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very easily digested, visually stunning book.  I really like that not only does it tell the facts, but it also freely tells the areas of contention.  I feel better about a source that is willing to address what we do know and what we don't.  The best example of this is when the authors include quotes for and against supplements.I am not looking for a great change in my lifestyle, I was just looking for guidelines to help me get as much active life and I can out of my chance here. Much of this book's content is kind of clichéd but the presentation is not. For example, don't smoke.  But  the authors and designers go beyond with info graphics, illustrations and factoids that bring the information home and make it clear. It's kind of light reading with heavy duty information.

"OK, I know nothing about Adventure Time but my kids sure do.  And we are all familiar with Fluxx and I for one love the premise that the game changes on a dime, every third play.Per my 14 year old, this is a perfect union.  With each play, I get a long narrative about why something is so cool about this edition.  Granted, it all sounds like garble to me, I can definitely say that this edition is perfect for fans of Adventure Time.  Or at least I can convey their strong endorsement.If you don't know flux, it is a unique game where you play by adding rules and end goals to the game.  You can be close to victory and find that just before crossing the finish line, the goal has changed to something your are no where near to winning.  But on the other hand, you can be completely out of the game, then find that you have won.  This hampers long term strategy, but can enhance the short term tactics a lot.Personally, I really like the game.  Mostly because of it's uniqueness. The game is pretty easy, and I think the rules say that it is easiest to learn if you play with at least one person who has played it before.  This is very true.  You can pick it up easy, but it's a rough first game with a lot of close reading of cards and some debate about how cards should be played.  But you quickly pick up the gyste of the game.I've played the original and Bat Man version and I think I would trust any themed version of the game.  At least for the ones I've played, they use some rather insightful details of the theme to make an interestingly different and meaningful game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D5Y6MEUDM52E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCTMC7E#wasThisHelpful","R3D5Y6MEUDM52E","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very likeable book. It fits well in to the easy reading books that scholastic puts out.  In fact, after 40 pages or so, I actually flipped to the publishing page to see if it was a scholastic.  The story is unique enough and the writing is good and propelled me through the book.The story has essences of many books but it reminded me of modern and lighter combination of Narnia and A Wrinkle in Time.  I suppose because of the combination of a magic portal and an attempt to rescue a lost father.  But the tenor of the book is far more light and whimsical.  This is not a piece a literature, but a fun little romp.My biggest concern is that the son I gave the book to has been having problems staying locked in on the book.  He typically inhales books so I look forward to see if this one eventually catches on with him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XAGIOIX9AJ3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544419510#wasThisHelpful","R1XAGIOIX9AJ3U","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was worried about this game as it required our 8, 9, 10, and 14 year old blended children to negotiate every five minutes, but they did great. Although as the values of different gems is becoming understood, this is changing. They now know the value of the black gem and the relative scarcity of diamonds. Our first two games, the initial values were based on how pretty they are.And they are pretty. The gems are nicely created and make the game visually and tactilely exciting for kids. The cards and their artwork are high quality and the timer and privacy blinds are decent. All in all a game that should hold up well.Strangely for me. The strategy is in negotiating for the value of the gems. There are straight counters, bonuses for each set with one of each of five gems, a high pointer gem that makes other bonuses useless, and high bonuses for having the most of any gem type. So you can set a strategy for procurement to lead your negotiations. If negotiations fail. All the loot for that round is lost to everyone. Which has been enough motivation for flexibility amongst my kids and no fights have arisen so far.So it's a unique game for us. And I expect the negotiations to heat up as we realize the values of the gems more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ICTZJ53SIE1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1631402897#wasThisHelpful","R2ICTZJ53SIE1F","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"First, I wish I had gotten these as a Christmas gift for the boys.  The packaging is great and when they opened up the flap to expose the cars, their eyes lit up.  They have a lot of shock and awe when opened and keeps going while you are downloading the app in anticipation of playing these.My kids were a little skeptical at first because we have had a similar product with AI and iOS controls.  That one proved to be pretty flaky and left them pretty dissatisfied.  These had none of that.  The App ran even on iPhones and iPods that were at least a generation old.  The pairing was easy and worked well.  The controls seemed a little tight but the kids seemed to get the hang of them quickly.  All in all a very good experience.We had some issues with the AI in tight areas, but to be honest, everytime these have come out, there has been a waiting list and some squabbling to play with them.The game play is pretty good.  It's like a James Bond gadget car battle.  The battles have been full of laughing and good spirits.  There have been solid collisions which have so far proven the cars to be really sturdy.

"Most of us had never played Fluxx before so this is our only exposure to the game, but the game play is amazingly wild.  The changing rules make it possible to have victory snatched from you at the turn of a card, or suddenly find yourself holding the winning hand.  I have never played anything like it.We have played a number of games now and the kids truly love it.  I can see how there could be a whole fleet of games created around this concept.  For this one, there are some very Batman specific rules that fans of the franchise should like.  For example, there is an Archam Asylum rule card that contains the villains in play.  There is a rich collection of characters and equipment from the Batman world, which I am not a expert at, but I appreciate how they work the storyline into the game.  Much of it must have been specific rules which change the game at least a little from the original game.The art work is great, the cards and game are easy to read and understand, the quality is nice.  All in all this is a really great little game that can be learned and enjoyed in a single hand.  And due to the fluctuation in the rules, no game is the same and I have yet to discover a general strategy.  You just have to play the cards as they lie.Great Game","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UC84VXSROGVF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111E4EAA#wasThisHelpful","R2UC84VXSROGVF","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really think that this product lives up to, you get what you pay for.  This is a reasonably priced pad, and it works reasonably well.  We have a number of more expensive pads and at least one cheaper, and this one does not match up to the more expensive pads for quality and comfort, but I would not consider it too cheap to be worthwhile.This is a very thin pad.  The ones we currently use are much thicker and have a much thicker waterproof layer.  This one has an internal waterproof layer pressed between ""quilted"" layers. (quilted by impressions, not stitches.)  The thinness does make it very portable and we will probably use this as our camping pad.The one concern I have with this is how well it holds up after washings.  Our others are very rugged and I just can't envision this one to holding up to a ton of washes.  I will update when we see how that plays out.  But for now, the pad is effective, has the benefit of being thin and packable and it is reasonably priced.

"Four of us have read this book and we have all said the same thing.  This book is ridiculous. The premise alone, the only boy in the school that can morph from a boy to a boat is a pretty random way to set up a book for teen conformity angst.  And it gets even more whacked from there, while somehow staying in a real world setting of a high school and community.The maturity level is strangely eclectic as well.  The wackiness seems fit for 8-12, the high school setting and drama seems to be 14-17, and some of the jokes are clearly sent over their heads to parents.  There were a few things I felt were perhaps a little mature for young readers like nautical puns for swear words and (spoiler alert) a woman who is impregnated by a submarine.  But all in all, it is so ridiculous that it holds all readers.It is a quick read, very visual with very good, although almost computer generatedly clean graphics.  It lacks an artistic looseness, but is visually wonderful.  The dialogue is cleanly written and was easy for all readers from 8 to middle aged.  None of us really put it down after we picked it up.

I really recommend this to anyone who has interests in Dolphins, nature in general, or our environment.

It seemed like mostly we were purchasing the idea and could have done the same thing with supplies we had around the house.

When we saw that Wellness also made moist cat food, we decided to use it to help get pills down.  The plan has worked perfectly.  They ravenously take the spoonful and pill down.I do have to say that Wellness is not cheap, but the quality seems to be there and the taste is obviously fantastic.  You can tell just by watching the dogs.  We actually have cats as well, but they are going to miss out on these because they work so well in getting pills into the finicky dogs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GFJVTJA7C3KN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4GLVJM#wasThisHelpful","R1GFJVTJA7C3KN","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I tried to read this book and could not get through it due to time, so I gave it to two of my kids.  When asked they gave a rather lackluster, ""It's Good."" Which is kind of an endorsement, but far less warm than their usual reaction to books. And that was kind of the feel I was getting from it while reading it. It was interesting enough, but I don't know that I feel compelled to finish the story.  It was not bad, but it also wasn't great. I am glad that it kept the kids interested enough to finish the book.The kids were super excited to find a couple more books at the library, but apparently it was to glean codes to put into an online game. As of right now those books have remained unread after an initial flurry to find the codes. I'm not a huge fan of that kind of online tie in or marketing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX4KW5LWLUFUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545830001#wasThisHelpful","RX4KW5LWLUFUU","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, visually this is a beautiful book.  I love the layout design and the great images of mustangs that go along with some very good and eyeopening information about what mustangs are facing.  I don't think much of the country realizes the pressures that these wild horses are under. And I guess for that matter, I bet most people in the country don't realize that mustangs still exist, let alone be able to conjure an image of horses living on open range.  This book does a great job of informing the reader and building that image of horses living wild.The author gives a great background history of horses in North America, from fossil record to reintroduction after they were extirpated 8000 years ago.  The Paleontology is a little glossed over as is the release by the Spanish, but they are noted and the stage is set.  Where the book truly focuses and succeeds is in illuminating the current management crisis the horses are facing.  It informs the reader of the thousands of horses that are being held in government pastures, the traumas of roundups and hints at the true effectiveness of our current management policies.  She does a great job of painting that picture of wild horses and their natural habits, followed by the fear and breakdown of that pattern during and after the round up.  Also she points out the barely veiled industry of slaughtering the horses for dog food and other uses.The one thing that did kind of confuse me is that the Young People are prominent in the subtitle, but seem to be relegated to the last 30 odd pages.  It would have been nice to see the stories of the young horse lovers spread throughout the book to help connect with kids.  As it is, you have an excellent book about mustangs with an appendix of people helping out.I'm a little concerned about the somewhat graphic information about the roundups and slaughter. As a parent, I read the book first, and there is some mildly shocking information included.  To an extent, this is the information that needs to be disseminated to kids and adults to shock them into action, but you may want to read it first and judge how your little onces can handle it.  For me, there is some concern for a pretty informed 8 year old.  I don't think I would have any qualms for tweens and up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBMBAIE36JXQR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544392949#wasThisHelpful","RBMBAIE36JXQR","AYUF7YETYOLNX","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AYUF7YETYOLNX?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read the reviews, and one of the more helpful ones states that the shirts with holes in the sleeves run LARGE, the opposite of those without holes which run SMALL. It's too bad they're listed together, but I'm writing to confirm this is the case. I ordered this shirt in a size S. I normally wear an M/L, so I was a bit nervous about that S, but it fits perfectly. It might even be able to go a touch smaller, but I like the fit of the S. It's very flowy and doesn't show off a waist-line, and my husband doesn't much care for the shoulder exposure, but I think that dresses up an otherwise ordinary shirt. It's very comfortable and I like the Olive green color.

"First of all, after reading other reviews, I decided to go ahead and order this shirt in a 2XL (XXL). I normally wear a M/L, so this hurt my pride a bit, but I still gave it a shot. I probably could have gone a size down to XL because it is slightly baggy on me, but that suits me well, and it's super cute. I pair it with dress pants for a formal look and with jeans for cute and casual, and I absolutely love this shirt. My only complaint (besides the XXL) is that it's supposed to dry flat. I live in the South, so it is humid down here, but it's also autumn so it isn't that bad. Even so, I tried to dry it for two days, one day under a ceiling fan, before finally throwing it in my dryer on ""air fluff"" mode to get the last traces of damp out of it. It's not a huge deal, and I can live with it, but don't plan to wash it one day and wear it the next.

"Once you get the sizing right and the considering the price, this is a nice shirt. I haven't seen anything like it at this price-point, and I thought it was very flattering! The color is beautiful and so overall I am pleased with my purchase.  I even went on to order a second one; I do recommend this, with the following very important caveats:First, I followed the advice of other reviewers, and ordered a size XL for this shirt (I normally wear a M/L). The XL fit well, although a bit tighter than I expected considering I was nearly two sizes up. As other reviewers had said, this shirt runs SMALL! Order at least one size up, probably more like two. Secondly, the material feels cheap. Although it is a handwash-only shirt, I would not be surprised if it started to pill very quickly. But I paid very little for it, so that's probably the way it goes. I  have washed it twice without pilling, so I could be wrong, but I don't think so. I do have a fabric shaver, so hopefully I can still get a fair amount of life out of this really cute shirt.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20H0QEPKEEKRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKYTPUS#wasThisHelpful","R20H0QEPKEEKRX","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to start by saying that I loved this book absolutely. I delved deep into the world, and even though Wulfric is not the sort of man I could ever love, Balogh made me believe in the true romance between Christine and the duke. My only complaint about this book was also something I enjoyed: it is so clearly inspired by ""Pride and Prejudice"" that sometimes I struggled a bit with certain expressions that were almost too reminiscent of the original, although Ms. Balogh preferred her characters to speak what Ms. Austen usually did with narration. However, while it was occasionally distracting to recognize certain lines or sentiment, it didn't stop me from diving in and loving it. In fact, I suspect over all the impression helped, as saw the characters mirrored so carefully.The vivacious heroine of the lower gentry who fines humor in everything and uses her fine eyes to express it, the proud and sullen and powerful hero who never smiles and yet still finds himself falling in love with the opposite spirits of a woman he cannot approve, the spirited male friend who appears to say one thing but is actually maliciously saying another, and of course the scandal which plagues the heroine only to be rescued by the hero, the only one she trusts enough to tell, the proposals, and I could keep going. It's a story I can't help but enjoy when the author is as good as Mary Balogh at descriptions and characterization, even though Christine occasionally behaves as Elizabeth never would, and I couldn't really picture Colin Firth as Wulfric and so instead ended up picturing sort of a young Peter Capaldi. Ha! I also had fun picking out the more minor characters: Basil and Hermione as Caroline Bingley and her sister and Wulfric's aunt and niece as Lady Catherine and her daughter, for example.I don't think you'd have to be able to quote P&P to love this book, however. The characters stand alone quite well, certainly many of the situations and the path of the plot is unique to ""Slightly Dangerous,"" and while Wulfric is not a particularly likable guy throughout most of it, Balogh made me wish for the success of the romance anyway, which is quite a skill. Usually, if I don't like the hero, the book can't capture me, but I was just engrossed. I have also enjoyed reading later books and watching the duke and duchess interact after their marriage (although I don't think he would actually call her ""my love,"" just my opinion). This is a well-written and wonderfully detailed story about two unlikely lovers who compliment each other well. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIT69ZK31JH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=044024112X#wasThisHelpful","R2AIT69ZK31JH","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh no, this book was such a disappointment. I am a huge fan of Mary Balogh, but I have read enough of her books by now to realize I won't like all of them. That's understandable. Especially when it comes to male characters, she writes about a great variety, and certainly each man won't appeal to every reader. But I just couldn't stand Sir Gerald.It was a let down, because I read The Ideal Wife and was looking forward to Sir Gerald's story, but I didn't even want to finish the book. And that does say something, because this is the first Mary Balogh book where this has been the case - even books I haven't particularly liked in the past have been suspenseful enough to lead me to want to read until the end. I found the writing to be lacking Balogh's usual elegance, and when it came to the story, I simply didn't care. I still don't completely understand why Prissy became a prostitute. It didn't sound to me like she was dying in a gutter and decided she had no choice, nor was there any blackmail, although I'll admit that by half-way through the book, I was skimming a lot of it out of boredom. I can understand a prostitute being passive, although it doesn't make a great romance. But beyond that, there was no reason for Prissy to love him, except that apparently the other men she ""serviced"" must not have been gentle with her (although except for one, that's never stated). Lord knows he clearly wasn't a very good lover, and he didn't care for her as a person in any way. But Prissy is clever, accomplished, pretty, and a lady, and there was simply nothing about Sir Gerald that would have drawn her interest. By the way, my dislike of him isn't because he's portrayed as having a learning disability, it's because he's an awful clod who never really does come to see Prissy as a person, as far as I could tell. Instead, he simply realizes that without the comforts she provides, he is unhappy. And then (spoiler alert!) he has the nerve to take her back to his home, where she will forever be recognized as his whore, when she's managed to create a comfortable and accepted life in a small town despite her occupation. How romantic. If you've never read a Mary Balogh book before, please skip over this one!!!! It is not a good first impression, but she has several books that are so much better. If you have, well, read at your own risk.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSFFAV256UMGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VD6NIC#wasThisHelpful","RSFFAV256UMGZ","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I borrowed the Kindle version of this book, and was very pleased. This is exactly what I was looking for to get my son interested in Japanese. He likes to learn things for himself, and so this book is perfect. It's very simple, it gives each line in English, romanji, and hiragana. I used to hate books that only shows the romanji, but since my son doesn't yet read hiragana, he needs something to help him make the connection, and he began making it right away.

"I will start with the negatives. First, the Ferdinand in this book is in no way the Ferdinand of MORE THAN A MISTRESS. They're not the same guy. This was fine with me. I was a bit hesitant about reading his story given what a ignoramus he was in the first book, but don't go into it if you liked him in the first book. He's not the same guy.Secondly, this book is completely implausible. It requires you to suspend belief from beginning to end. Ferdinand and Viola living together? No, it wouldn't happen. Viola choosing to go back to work instead of accepting Ferdinand's help? I doubt it, although I guess she could be that stubborn. As for the Ton ACCEPTING Viola at the end because she's courageous???? Are you kidding me? I completely expected that Ferdinand would denounce town and decide to live out his life in the country with Viola where no one could recognize her, which was the only way I could see the story ending satisfactorily. The ending was lovely, but ridiculous. I can agree with some reviewers that this wasn't the best novel, but it didn't change how much I enjoyed it.Frankly, I don't read Mary Balogh (or any romance novelist) for the realism of it all. The number of scandals she writes about would have us believing that historically, every great lady was a mistress or prostitute and every great gentleman had run off with his fiancee's brother's wife first. A certain bit of reality must always be suspended unless the plot was only to be man and woman get married for political/familial/financial reasons and then manage to make it work. And I would read that book, because I don't require a ton of action to my stories as long as I can get into the characters and their lives. I was able to get into this one because I liked Ferdinand so much.I didn't find Viola that annoying, as some other reviewers did, and I absolutely adored Ferdinand. As people can probably tell from my other reviews, I really sort of detest the ""alpha males"" that often show up in romance novels. I prefer sweet, thoughtful men who truly adore their women, and Ferdinand was all that I ask for in a hero. I really enjoyed reading about his thoughts and he proceeded through the plot. His interactions with his brother, Tresham (who I couldn't stand), were some of my favorite of the book. This is just a sweet, fluffly, feel-good story. It doesn't require much thought or contain much action, but I came out of it feeling happy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK00TUVWVUGSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440236576#wasThisHelpful","RK00TUVWVUGSC","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed this read for several reasons. I think the characters are delightfully imperfect, I love the writing style, which is descriptive and deep and flows well, and I remained wrapped up in the plot throughout the entire book. This is a somewhat dark romance novel, with intrigue and war as well as incredible sexual tension. The attraction between the main characters is almost a physical presence in the book, and the sex scenes are very steamy, but there is a lot of plot outside of the romance as well, as well as a couple of bends and twists in the plot. The heroine is both strong and insecure, determined and fearful, and she knows who she is. The male character wants to be more of a blackguard than he actually is, and the author does a good job of making his developing affection clear from the early stages so that it is quite believable by the time romance develops. The secondary characters were also interesting, and did not exist in the story simply to exist but rather played important roles throughout.The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is that I really struggled with some of the plot points, specifically the main hero's role in the heroine's life as savior/captor made me a uncomfortable. Even when they fall in love, he remains her blackmailer and jailer until nearly the end, as though she was Murasaki being raised for Genji's pleasure. I also didn't like the coercion that was involved when they finally had sex. The author does delve lightly into the psychological struggles of the couple, and she also tried to make up for that situation by making sure the heroine first acknowledges that she always wanted to make love to the hero, and finally breaks free at the end, and we learn that the hero loves, and even respects her for for it, but the manipulative nature of the couple's coming together made it difficult for me to see those scenes as romantic.However, even the scenes that I had some trouble with are well-written and interesting, and while I don't feel that this is the light and fluffy read that I usually seek out when craving a romance novel, I will undoubtedly pick it up again and reread it some time in the future. I absolutely recommend this book as an absorbing and interesting read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PH428G5N7IQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=055329945X#wasThisHelpful","R3PH428G5N7IQN","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our second Naturepedic twin mattress, and we've also purchased multiple crib mattresses. We always love them, and feel good about our kids burying their faces in this organic, harsh-chemical free mattress. I read through the reviews, but have to disagree that this mattress is too firm, at least, not for a child. I bought it for my preschooler, and little kids often use firmer mattresses. I've fallen asleep on it multiple times and think it's fine, and my kids sleep well on these. I love that one side is water-proof for now, and that we can flip it over for a softer side for when the kids are a bit older. I have no complaints at all.UPDATE: At age 6, my son did start to complain that his mattress was too hard. It was wonderful to be able to simply flip his mattress over from the water-proof side to the softer side and please him without having to buy a new mattress! I also have to add that Naturepedic stands behind their lifetime guarantee. After less than 6 months, a spring had somehow rotated itself sideways in our second of these mattresses and was poking to the side. We don't know why or how this happened, but we wrote to Naturepedic and sent them pictures, and they immediately sent us a new mattress. No charge, no hassle.

"I actually want to give this book 2.5 stars, but rounded up since Amazon won't let me do that.Before I read this, I would have said I was a Lynsay Sands fan. I bought it when I saw the high reviews, because I very much enjoyed the Devil of the Highlands trilogy, as well as several of her regency-period novellas. I haven't read anything in her vampire series as I'm just not much of a fantasy person, but I have read enough to know that I enjoy her writing style. In the books I had read before, I sometimes thought scenes were a little silly but could skim through or overlook them for the sake of the rest of the story,. That wasn't possible with this book, since I was rolling my eyes almost all the way through. Nothing, from the premise to the dialogue to the characters' behaviors were in any way appropriate to the time-period or in the least bit believable. The romance between the main characters certainly wasn't. There was no heat, no attraction, just random moments when Radcliffe kissed Charlie out of the blue, to emphasize that he was only attracted to her and not to Beth, which any reader with half a brain understood from pretty early on. The scenes were steamy, but I didn't really have any emotional attachment to the characters as a couple.There were times when I felt like the romance actually distracted from the main plot, because while the romance was so weak, I actually really enjoyed reading about Charlie's experiences as a man, and her perceptions of the world around her and the on-goings of life as a man, as well as her attempts to help those around her. I found her very strong, practical, and charming, and decided to give the book an extra star because of her, but Radcliffe's only redeeming quality was the ability to put up with the misfits Charlie brought home. Once everyone knew that Charlie was a woman, I truly did lose interest, and finished just for the sake of it.I'll be donating this book to the library.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CKGZMBFLJBSR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003P2VO2S#wasThisHelpful","R3CKGZMBFLJBSR","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our oldest child has outgrown the trailer, but he is extremely cautious, and has shown extreme reluctance to learn how to ride his two-wheeler (even with his training wheels). Family bike rides became impossible. Then, while in a bike shop, we discovered tandem bike attachments such as this one. We went online to read reviews and compare prices, and found the WeeRide Co-Pilot.It is a two-person assembly, and took my husband and I less than an hour to attach it to his bike. It wasn't difficult or complicated; but has a lot of parts, and someone needs to hold the adult bike up for straight attachment. I have read the negative reviews, but we didn't have any of the issues mentioned. We had no difficulty getting it attached tight enough (there is some give, which allows it to turn more smoothly).We have now used this attachment on three separate bike rides, and it's wonderful. Our son is excited, not fearful, when riding, he loves to help pedal. His Daddy tows him, and has had no trouble with balance. It performs well, and we're extremely pleased!Just a couple of notes for prospective buyers. First, this is a pretty hefty trailer. It is heavy-duty when lifting it, and takes some extra effort to tow up hills. Second, this bike is really for kids 6-7 years old +, not because of the balancing per se but because of the distance from the seat (in the lowest position) to the pedals. My son is 5, in the 90th percentile for height, and he has to stretch his tippy-toes to touch the pedals in the lowest positions.All-in-all, we're extremely pleased, and recommending the Co-Pilot to all our friends!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2025EG895RLSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BD45NEK#wasThisHelpful","R2025EG895RLSN","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was my first Meggan Connors book, and I really enjoyed it. I would give it 4.5 stars as well.Kenneth was a wonderful romance hero (sweet and gentle while strong and manly), and if you can forgive Isobel for not instantly realizing that he wasn't Malcolm, her estranged husband, she is very likable as well, if a bit odd for the time period. Their sexual tension is good, the romance is very sweet, and it is a steamy read. Although this is a romance novel, and thus by definition a relatively light read, I thought the suspense was good. I didn't even skip to the end, which I usually do with suspense novels, because the book was so detailed that I was sure I would miss too much by skimming through it.All of the characters, even secondary characters, are surprisingly multidimensional. I was particularly impressed by the depiction of Malcolm, who is definitely the villain of the story, and yet with softer contradictions that leave his character less certain, and his motivations remain unknown to the very end. While originally I wondered why the author intentionally neglected details about major events, I also think it added to the strength of the story. Those details would have been interesting and provided insights, and yet were ultimately unnecessary to the story, and far too many romance authors seem to throw in details for no other reason than to make the story longer. I respect the author for not feeling the need to expand on every little event in the characters' pasts. I do hope, however, that she has some plans for Ethan.The writing is detailed and absorbing. I think the author tried to maintain the historical atmosphere, and though it is not a time-period I know well, I bought it. I think Meggan Connors is an up-and-coming new romance novelist, and I shall watch with anticipation for her next work. If you are looking for a quick, sweet, and interesting romance, I recommend this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31Z9YW0KYWXTL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3D2JS6#wasThisHelpful","R31Z9YW0KYWXTL","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first time reading anything by Erin Knightley, and I really enjoyed this book. The characters were fun, the sexual tension was good, and just as I was really getting into it - it was over.I do know that is the point of novellas, and usually I'm fine with it. But this time, I thought there was enough material that this could have been a full novel, and the ending was far too abrupt. Instead of feeling like I'd had a fun, fast read, I felt cheated out of a longer book. Still, I enjoyed it, and I'm going to go on to look for other intriguing books by this author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11X71LNM197EE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4CSUDG#wasThisHelpful","R11X71LNM197EE","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"What a huge disappointment. This is one of my favorite Elizabeth Rolls books (in novel format), so when I saw it had been turned into a manga, I was curious, since I sometimes enjoy manga and I already knew I liked the plot, so even though the price was more than $4 for  a digital book, I bought it.Less than 20 minutes after buying it, I deeply regretted spending the money. It is as though someone sat down and said, ""Okay, let's make a comic about this book. Remove all of the character development, all the romance, and basically everything that made the story interesting. Now draw some pictures about what's left!"" Thank goodness Amazon has an awesome return policy, even for Kindle books. If you like Kasumi Kuroda or Elizabeth Rolls, this still isn't the book for you.

"We bought two standard-sized organic cotton/PLA fiber pillows with the low-fill option that is available from Naturepedic. I wanted a natural, chemical-free, washable pillow for my children (ages 2 and 4), but I was afraid the standard-fill pillow would be too thick for their little necks.I am very pleased with my purchase. The outer shell of the pillows is a soft, satiny cotton, and they are soft but supportive pillows. According to the Naturepedic tag, these pillows can be machine washed and machine dried, which I have done once with good results.A couple of notes: when the pillows arrived, they had a sharp, woodsy smell that made my nose itch, but one trip through the washing machine (using unscented detergent) and the smell was completely gone. Once through the drier, the pillow had fluffed up a lot more than I wanted (hence the low-fill), but it returned to it's flatter shape after one night. It does look like it is a bit thick for my 2-year-old (although she uses it happily), but it is the perfect thickness for my preschooler.I highly recommend this pillow in general, and I recommend the low-fill version (currently available on the Naturepedic website, hopefully available on Amazon soon) if you are looking for a good organic pillow for young children, or if you don't want as firm a pillow.

"We bought this toy for our 2 and 4-year-old for a 10-hour car trip, and it was a huge success. In fact, the kids loved it so much that I am now in the market for a second one, since sharing became an issue.Basically, you fill the pens with water (despite that there are 4 colors of pen, the pens do not write in color!) and then just color. Within about 5 minutes, the surface dries and you can color again. My son (age 4) in particular had a blast writing his name on one side, flipping it and writing his sister's name, and then flipping back again, and practicing his letters in his big writing that would take up multiple sheets of paper. My daughter loved to scribble and then watch her scribbles vanish. They didn't have any complaints that the pens didn't write in different colors, luckily.My only complaint is that the surface marks if you get anything besides water on it (little kids can have greasy fingers) and thus far, I haven't found a way to get the stains out with scrubbing (and I am afraid to use soap in case I stain the surface further). This is why I deducted multiple stars from the durability of this toy.Overall, I really recommend it. I still plan to buy another, even with the occasional grease stain, and the water-pens and fast-drying non-paper mat make this ideal for car trips. Just make sure your kids' fingers are clean, first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IWZHWCE1BYMJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002YIX2H4#wasThisHelpful","R2IWZHWCE1BYMJ","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This particular book, along with its counterpart ""She's Got the Look,"" are my two favorite Leslie Kelly books, hands down.

My only complaint is that the sexual attraction and tension is overdone, but that is a trait of Ms. Kelly's, and I've learned to look past it.

"We live in the south, and for the last couple of years in particular, that means fall/winter days in the 60s-70s and nights in the 30s-40s. We love to sit out on our porch, but once the sun sets, it can get pretty cold pretty fast. We bought this heater so that we wouldn't have to head inside as soon as it begins to cool down.The pros:This is a large enough heater that it sits far above everyone's heads on the patio table, which not only means we can feel the heat but also that there is no real risk of accidentally bumping it somehow.It feels very steady on our table.It is relatively easy to set up.The propane tank (which you can buy at any camping store - our Walmart also carries them) lasts for a decent number of uses.But there are some things that potential buyers should keep in mind.The cons:This is a very large heater! I put this as a pro, but it is also a con, as it takes up a considerable portion of our rather large patio table. I think it would take up an entire side table with no extra room. People should be aware of this before purchasing it.Perhaps I should have realized this before buying a table-top heater, but the heat stays ABOVE the table-top! This heater will not heat your legs and feet AT ALL. It probably would if you put it on a side table next to you, but then the risk of bumping it would increase considerably. If you are planning to use this with a patio table, you will still need blankets to keep your bottom-half comfortable.This heater is lovely for keeping us warm on a cool evening. It is perfect for 50-degree weather, instead of jackets and blankets. But unlike the full-sized standing propane heaters, this one isn't strong enough to make real winter weather tolerable for outdoor seating.Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21TON0MUI10BC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001F0S2NG#wasThisHelpful","R21TON0MUI10BC","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really enjoyed reading this book, but I was pretty disappointed with the ending. It felt very rushed - there is so much lead-up to the characters, and then a little bit of an issue between them, and then suddenly everything's all better, the end. Rita is very likable, but it would have been nice to hear a bit more from her perspective about why she is attracted to Matthew (besides his green eyes) that lead her to never give her virginity to another man but to choose this man on their first date. Matthew could have been a wonderfully deep character, but all we find out about him happens before he is in a relationship with Rita. They never do work out why he throws her out of his house (the reader knows, but they never manage to communicate the miscommunication to each other), and why does the author spend so much time proposing that Matthew's family won't approve of Rita if, in the end, she is going to gloss over how happy they are about the match?This is a fun read, and I'll be looking up other books by Elizabeth Bevarly. The writing style is refreshing and light, and you find yourself caring about the characters. Which makes the quick and undeveloped ending even less satisfactory. I hope she does a better job on the next one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR9ZAEXPBCBVK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004GEAR36#wasThisHelpful","RR9ZAEXPBCBVK","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with many of the negative reviewers on here. Pendleton, while a nice shell to reflect Kit, is a one-dementional character, and you never do understand why he has fallen for Kit. Kit is entirely and completely unlikable - none of the ""vulnerable"" moments that Bevarly shows us in any way make up for her awful treatment of the men in her father's employ. Furthermore, although we are assured that her father and brothers care only for the money, that isn't what we see - Holt Sr. is very cold-blooded, but he also apparently spent her childhood chasing off gold-diggers who don't love his daughter but only her money, and for this she deeply resents him. Huh? Her brothers get the same blame, even though Holt Jr. is, by all appearances, a good brother who watches out for her, even if he, too, likes the money (find me a multi-millionaire who doesn't like being rich, please). So the characters never clicked for me, because I couldn't see them the way the author apparently intended, and Kit in particular is so unlikable that you do find yourself understanding why the only men who chase her want her money - lord knows no self-respecting non-gold-digger would love such a selfish, childish brat.Having said all of this, I really enjoyed Bevarly's style of writing. I found it light and witty, a fun read, and I rarely (if ever) rolled my eyes at the characters' interactions, an action that is almost unavoidable when reading romance novels. Analyzing the book, I find it didn't meet expectations, but while reading, I had fun. Pendleton, while he didn't have much personality, was a nice character to follow, and I liked him. I always kind of assume that the free book isn't the author's best (or worst) work, but just a taste. This author has room to grow, and I hope she does. I won't be rereading this book, but I might read another Elizabeth Bevarly book before making a final decision.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35FD3XFUZQTEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00597TKSC#wasThisHelpful","R35FD3XFUZQTEE","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I live in Northern Kentucky, and our winters can get fairly cold (20s & 30s) and we also get snow regularly. My husband and I walk with our kids year-round, but bundling both toddlers into snow-suits, boots, heavy jackets, gloves, etc. every single night is exhausting, not to mention that I have to resize the straps on the stroller for their outer-wear.I read the descriptions of the JJ Cole Original Bundle Me and the Urban, and settled on the Urban because it is advertized as water-proof and we do get snow. Since I read that the purpose is to be able to avoid heavy coats, snow-pants, etc. in the stroller, I thought this blanket would be as warm as a winter coat. However, when the Bundle Me arrived, I was disappointed. Although the interior material does seem very soft and the exterior material feels like the stuff that is on the outside of a sleeping bag, the blanket itself is very thin. If it works to keep the wind out, that's something, but it is so thin that I worry it may not be able to hold any heat, and I am hesitant to even bother with it. I returned to Amazon to read some of the other reviews, and I see that several other people comment on the thinness and lightness of this particular Bundle Me.

"What pieces of junk.I love my MacBook, but these adapters aren't worth $10, much less $80 apiece. In my first two years owning my MacBook, I went through 3 adapters. They all died through a disconnect at the joint where it enters the computer, and the third adapter actually began to smoke and crackle! Oh, and by the way, even though I went to the Apple Store each time, only the fourth adapter was free because it was ""under warranty."" When I asked them why I had had to pay for my second one and my third one, the genius I was working with at the time assured me that I shouldn't have had to, that someone had made a mistake, but was unable to give me a refund for the extra adapters I had had to buy since I didn't show up in their records (not sure why) and I had moved and was unable to find the receipts, so I couldn't prove that I had purchased the other cords there. Nice. Great customer service.The fourth adapter, which was free to me due to warranty and an educated genius, was this new design. I was thrilled, thinking the problems had been solved. Well, I'll give them this - the newer design did last longer. In fact, the new adapter design actually lasted a full 14 months - more than twice as long as the old adapters. But since I had already spent $160 on adapters that should have been covered by warranty, I'm not pleased by the longevity. Because 14 months is OVER the 12-month warranty that at least some of the geniuses were willing to honor. Yet another $80 that I might as well just flush down the toilet. Not only that, but when I took my laptop in again, the genius informed me that the charging port was corroded, as though I had ""splashed water on it or something."" I asked him if one of the previous adapters smoking and crackling in the port could have caused that damage - oh, huh, maybe.I absolutely won't be using the ""genius bar"" again, since I don't trust their geniuses, and I'm going to have to think long and hard about replacing my MacBook with another when the time comes. I may hate PCs, but these two are no longer my only options. What a disappointment.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF7MQSSKNS1F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TLTIS8#wasThisHelpful","R3JF7MQSSKNS1F","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am very pleased with my purchase of the JJ Cole Toddler Bundle Me Lite. We bought it earlier this Fall, when the weather was starting to drop into the 50's in the evenings when we take our daily walk. We always put a jacket and hat on my 13-month-old daughter, but we were noticing that her legs (and particularly ankles) were very cold. Blankets fell off continuously, when they weren't caught under the wheels of our stroller.This product has solved our problem. I was not sure that the blanket would fit on our Graco travel system stroller, but it works well enough. There is nothing obvious to put the head elastic around, but I've made it work by wrapping it around the sun visor, which prevents the blanket from sliding down (I don't know if this is necessary - it may not be since the straps also fit through the provided slots). It is made from waterproof material (we found this out for ourselves when it began to rain on us suddenly!) with a very soft liner. It is wonderful for keeping the wind off of children, but I wouldn't use it below 50 degrees, as it doesn't have padding (lite). This is why I just now purchased the JJ Cole Urban Bundle Me, which I hope will be equally nice but heavier, and serve us over the winter.We did attempt to use it with our (currently rear-facing) carseat, however, without much success. Although it can be done, it was just a hassle to get the straps to line up, to get the fabric unbunched, etc. I cannot comment on whether it would work better with a forward-facing carseat, and I don't think it was worth the effort (especially since blankets are more likely to stay on a carseat than a stroller).The Toddler Bundle Me does zip up high enough on my (quite tall) 13-month-old daughter to cover her hands and arms completely, and I imagine it will last for at least one more winter before she will outgrow it. I have not yet washed it, so I don't know how it will hold up that way, but it doesn't often get dirty. The Gray Circle pattern is very pretty. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2461HDJBAFXX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004FPYG0G#wasThisHelpful","R2461HDJBAFXX9","A23VQICT4TSKRQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23VQICT4TSKRQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this free to read and review.It took me a while to get into the story,The first two pages get off to a very exciting start and seems that it is going to be a political/murder mystery although set in non-earth location.The central character Jon although an accomplished high ranking politician does not come across as a particularly nice or even having a strong personality. In fact later in the book he seems quite out of his depth.Once the book gets into its stride and Jon gets his “personality” I can’t think of a better word to describe him being transferred across an enormous distance in space and into the body of a “ female aged 22”, hence the title of the book.It is interesting that the story is written by a man but for a large portion written from a female perspective, I have no idea how accurate this perspective is.All goes well until he cannot return to his own body, it is then a case of him trying to convince everyone that he is actually Jon.Much is dependent on different political and legal structures of the two planets and the negotiations between them, but this is essential to the story.In some places the stereotyping is a bit extreme, such as there has never been a female or small man as a “leader”.It is an interesting and thought provoking story, and at the end just when you think all is working out, at least for Jon there is a final twist to the tale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1THEL8LU5QEHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EVCEFI#wasThisHelpful","R1THEL8LU5QEHA","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a pre-release version to review.It was an interesting story but it just did not grab me.The main character “Meriel” is left as an orphan after the spaceship “Princess” is attacked by pirates. She then sets out to reunite the surviving children including her sister “Elizabeth” and find the location of “home”So far so good except everyone thinks she is delusional and do not believe her story as it is assumed that piracy is impossible in deep space due to the difficulty of finding where spaceships are.So the question for readers; is she imagining it all or did it really all happen and we do not find out which until near the end of the story.To add weight to the fact she is delusional is her determination to find the location of “home”.This is a good premise for a story but for me it just did not work I could not visualise or relate to any of the characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLQNTXFLFE40X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012CS64U2#wasThisHelpful","RLQNTXFLFE40X","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book free to read and review.Somehow I missed reading this one which would have cleared up some of the details in the next book. It does however stand well on its own the main disadvantage of reading out of sequence is that you know who survives to the next book. Having said that this one starts with one of the characters reappearing from the previous book that I was quite sure had been killed off.From this start the story switches to a whole new plot and away the story goes, in this there is a new rogue character that is intent on causing trouble to put it mildly at the very heart of the establishment.Nick Hartland in this story joins up with the British “security services” to catch and eliminate this new character. The plot is tightly written and at the end when all is resolved a new character is revealed which provides continuity into the next book. I also found out what happened to the character that I thought dead from the previous book and it was not at all what I expected.A good series which individually stand-alone but are much better when read in the correct order.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TLZVXRGDCX57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NS69RO8#wasThisHelpful","R1TLZVXRGDCX57","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this ebook free to read and review.As this book covers a period of about 20 years it was always going to be difficult to cover it adequately in a single book and at times it seemed too slow paced and at times too much was condensed.The first half of the story built up the background to the characters including many that did not make it past the first half; I certainly was not sure about it at this stage. I thought the second half was much better as the story got into survival mode.As this is science fiction you have to suspend disbelief and accept a few facts such as a man who baring accidents will live for ever and a drug that gives super intelligence. Once you accept this the story is involving with well portrayed characters and locations. I did in truth prefer some of the animals to the people. Other than odd occasions this is not a violent book which is surprising as it deals with a cataclysmic disaster.With two separate groups who have survived using different methods it is perhaps inevitable that they will eventually meet, but not in this book.It certainly is an unusual tale of survival and rebuilding with a small number of people trying to return Earth to how it was before the disaster.Although I was not sure about this book initially; it grew on me and I will certainly read the rest of the series. At the back of the books the author states that it does not matter which order the books are read in however while that may be true of later books I think this one needs to be read first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3919PK3KOKQXI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3OB63M#wasThisHelpful","R3919PK3KOKQXI","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free to read and review.Although I liked the story it did not initially work for me and I could not work out why. I have read a number of books by this author and liked them, this is the fourth in the series.Characters have been reused from previous stories but this is a complete standalone story.  The characters and locations were well described I particularly liked George.Suddenly I realised why this did not work for me, the era and style seemed to be more suited to an earlier period. Take away cell phones and modern cars and it could easily have been set in an earlier period, then I thought “Dennis Wheatley” as it had a similar feel to some of his novels.So a good story but I don’t think it was one of the author’s best, it is probably me but although with earlier stories “I could believe it” even though I knew they were fiction this one I had trouble “believing” it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSTIMTV2KAHBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012J1QQXW#wasThisHelpful","RSTIMTV2KAHBD","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free to read and review as a pre-release issue.I have read the previous book in the series “Zara’s Flight” which I though was a very descriptive book. This one continues on the same theme and I thought that it showed a very imaginative glimpse into the future. It was not particularly way out which made it seem all the more plausible.It is worth reading for the descriptions alone which allowed me to visualise the imagined locations. However I felt that the plot was very straight forward with little in the way of twists and turns except at the very end which then sets the story up nicely for the next in the series.The first half is mainly descriptive and very good in the second have although the excellent descriptions continue however without revealing the plot it seems to be a reverse of the previous book.Still a series worth reading as a laid back type of science fiction rather than an all action battle one, this actually makes a refreshing change.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G92U8F24HZFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0110LW956#wasThisHelpful","R3G92U8F24HZFQ","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free to reviewShort stories are always difficult as they often get the balance wrong and spend too much time on character development and the story is lost or indeed the other way round. This is not a problem with this story as there is a good balance between the two.Essentially a story told from the victim’s point of view and her developing self-confidence until all is revealed.Lainey the main character works well and feels very realistic as do the other characters with just enough background to give them depth. Likewise the locations are vividly described. There are a number of twists and turns to the story and until near the end I was not sure who were all those involved in the robbery.I would however not have read the prologue if I had realised it would reveal something that happened later in the book I would have preferred it to creep up on me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTEFIJZ4FKGAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQWUBUU#wasThisHelpful","RTEFIJZ4FKGAZ","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this at a discount to test and review.I like this a lot it is a stylish card holder which has 6 card slots that fan out when open to allow the cards to be taken out easily, it will take more than 6 cards as the slots are large. As it is a metal box (10.2 x 7.4 x 1.8 cm) it will protect the cards well, I travel light and have the habit of managing to bend cards when they are in normal leather card holders.The box is attractive with a lightly brushed finish and polished ends; it opens easily with a push button but also closes securely.It will provide better protection from the elements than a leather case and it is certainly weather resistant. I did a crude test by leaving it out in the rain for 10 minutes and no water came in so it could be IPX2.I could not test for RFID protection as my test equipment is loaned out at the moment but as it is a metal box I am pretty sure it will provide RFID protection.In all a well-made stylish case, I like it a lot.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34N7CNP3ND46V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MO72QV8#wasThisHelpful","R34N7CNP3ND46V","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free to read and review.This is certainly not one for the children as it contains adult themes such as rape, in fact the descriptions are all the more harrowing as they are described with an almost clinical detachment. The story itself is excellent the “Ivory Tower Cop” of the title is a university professor who although having a high level of academic knowledge has little or no real world experience.When I received this I had no idea it was based on a true story.The police have no clues as to the identity of the person committing the crimes so “Dr David Roth” the cop of the title joins the police as a cadet so he could be assigned to assist in the investigation. This is the only thing that does not ring true in the book as I don’t know why he could not just be brought on as a civilian I do not know.The story then gets into its swing and becomes a tightly written plot. Not only is it a detailed police investigation but also explores the relationship between Roth and the person he is assigned to. It further looks into the mind of the rapist. Unlike many detective stories in this one although we get to know much about the villain as the detail builds up throughout the book, he is not known to the police or any of the other characters in the book, so it is not a book that you can look for clues and try and work out who is the perpetrator.This is a stand-alone novel but I would like to see it become the start of a series, if it is I will certainly read the rest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YPEWBL3XFOKL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDTEZRG#wasThisHelpful","R1YPEWBL3XFOKL","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this ebook free to read and review.This was a very different story to the ones I normally read. From the beginning I thought this was going to be one of those stories that is great in character development and locations but does not do a lot.I was very wrong. Initially a travel reviewer wrote a very damaging review about a holiday destination, the sunset in the title, he is invited back to hopefully be persuaded to write a better story.  The two main characters Mathew Kane, the review writer and Kate Hampton, a psychiatrist, who is a regular guest there and wants to save the resort. Both of them leap off the pages as do the description of the locations. As well as the two main characters all of the others are well described and all are integral to the story. In fact this would be enough to be a satisfying read however about halfway through the story it takes a darker and certainly more adult turn.I can’t say much about the actual story without giving away the plot only that everything works out well in the end for most but not all of the characters.It is a book that would be worth reading just for the descriptions but the plot sets it apart from many.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YXMR8U5YZB50/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L7BVDFM#wasThisHelpful","R2YXMR8U5YZB50","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have others where there is a separate gadget for pushing out any bits left in the holes, these work but I usually lose them. With this press you just flip the handle over and just squeeze to clean out the holes a great design feature.Apart from the fact it works well it is also very stylish, which is not something you can usually say about the normal drab cast ones.

"I received this book free to read and review.I have read the “Inspector Drake” series by this author and this is a comparable series but by far more exciting.  Still set in Wales but this time set in Cardiff it starts as most detective stories do with a murder when a body is found floating in the river Taff.There starts the mystery with inspector Marco and his sidekick Boyd investigating this murder it soon however becomes apparent that it is not just a murder that has to be investigated and the story expands to involve people trafficking in the Polish community.There is plenty of the characters background to get a real feel for them and the descriptions of the locations just leap off the page. I liked Marco’s family background and the emphasis on his Italian roots and the family way of doing things.The interplay between characters is good with Marco being worried that another inspector “Hobbs” is trying to take the case away from him.This could have been just a good solid detective novel but elevates itself above this by Marco’s involvement with one of the characters which at about half way into the book turns it into a faster read without losing the investigative aspect.A very good book and although part of a series it works well as a standalone, I will read the rest of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPHMHF4P39TL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FA12DA4#wasThisHelpful","RLPHMHF4P39TL","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took me a little time to get into this book as it felt I was not starting at the beginning of the series but there is no information on whether this is the first or not.As I read on more and more of Cal’s (the main character) background was revealed which made the story more engaging. I wish the author had let on where Cal had got Molly (her car) from as it was a supercharged one when I had a WRX it was a turbo.This is what I describe as a gentle mystery with no graphic violence but a good solid plot which allowed me to try and find the clues as the story progressed, some I found, some I did not. Although Cal is portrayed as a hard person she did come over as having a human side to her character. I liked how all the characters were portrayed but would single out Mickey, Cal’s assistant and general IT expert.I found that a lot of the descriptive passages added to the atmosphere and made the story seem more real, one example is where a description of “crispy tacos” was given, a small example but it grounded the story.As the title implies there are loose ends at the end of the story which no doubt will be explained in the next of the series.

Although this is a violent book it is more spread out than in the previous book with more time spent on planning and developing the actual story.However the end of the story is worthy of any Chicago gangster novel.Although John Kane is undoubtedly a villain by the end of the book I was feeling quite a bit of sympathy for him. Despite his actions there were characters in the book that actually I felt come over as more evil than he was.I liked the way all of the characters were portrayed in particular Harold who I thought was the most evil of the bunch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R1L6YLRSIPUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EKQRJUY#wasThisHelpful","R3R1L6YLRSIPUV","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free to test and review.As I have a ""Leatherman Wave"" I thought I would do a comparison. This should not have been a fair comparison as the ""Leatherman"" costs at least five times as much.

Both have convenient pouches which will hang on a belt, the Leatherman's as the name implies is leather. When folded the Leatherman is slightly more compact which means the pouch is also smaller.On opening to reveal the pliers they are very similar with the Leatherman's being slightly more tapered and having a cut out at the bottom of the cutter for wire stripping. The Gelindo has the advantage that the pliers are spring loaded so that they open more easily than the Leatherman.The knife and saw are similar the saw of both performing about the same however the Leatherman's knife is marginally sharper. The other tools are very similar except that the Leatherman has more of a range of screwdrivers and very useful scissors.The Gelindo has a 2 1/2"" ruler on the back of the fish scaler a tool which is not included in the Leatherman.Between the arms of the pliers on the Gelindo is a bottle gripper/opener which I found was also good for cracking walnuts.I would not like to say which is the best, they are both good quality but the Gelindo certainly wins on price.If I had to buy either, both of these were gifts one from the manufacturer and one a birthday present I think I would buy the Gelindo mainly on cost but also by the fact it will crack walnuts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BS7D23JAQXFU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZCDT8PI#wasThisHelpful","R1BS7D23JAQXFU","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free to review.This I suppose comes into my gentle murder category in the sense there is little graphic violence.Set in the 1960s this captures the feel of the times and the old boy network that surrounded the government and secret services at the time and for all I know still does. The author has obviously done much research into the planes. Cars and trains of the period and I was very impress until one of the characters was said to have been driving an “MG sprite” (This would never have been said, there were MG Midgets and Austin Healey Sprites)  I know it is a silly thing but from that point on I was looking for mistakes I did not find any more but it did change my focus on the book.Anyway, the story proper starts with Alex Swann being engaged to find out if a Miss Townsley’s fiancé had been murdered. With this fairly slow start the story expands into one with much wider implications with government departments and the secret service from both the UK and the USA being involved.I liked how all the characters were portrayed and the locations were vividly described and made all the more real by the supporting background an example is the change of trains at Crewe.As the story expands the pace increases with a number of twists and turns drawing me into it and eventually the mysteries were solved.  Not the most satisfactory ending from the point of the characters but very plausible.It does seem to prove that while time moves on the actions of governments of whatever complexion never seem to change.A very engaging story if a bit slow to get going and well worth a read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MMJNWNIWPO7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XEG44Y0#wasThisHelpful","R2MMJNWNIWPO7U","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free to review.This starts with what I thought was going to be an exciting page turner until the end of the first chapter when it turned into a “teen romance” type of story. At this point I almost gave up and left it for a few days. I returned and waded through this part and the story picked up. It was full of very descriptive passages of both the characters and the locations. Surprisingly one the main character in the story Ana was the one I had the most trouble visualising.There were odd lines like “………..but tonight my dying friend was the priority” I never found out who the dying friend was. Likewise near the end of the book there seems to be content missing between the end of chapter 26 and 27. Both of these may be because I have a review copy however I can only review what I have.The actual story involves humans, Fae, Siis and the odd witch. I particularly liked Maria the witch and Adam one of the Siis. The Fae are ever present as malevolent beings and well described but I would have liked to have been given a better look at their beginnings.  Although this is the first in the series which really starts with Ana coming into the scene most of the rest of the characters have been going for 1000s of years so fitting it into the present often left me wanting to know more about the past of these characters. Reference is made to a war going on but I am not sure at this stage if it is between the Fae and the Sii or if others are involved.This is a story that captured my imagination after a fast beginning and then slowing down as it is a series it leaves much untold for future instalments.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HQ999ZCN1SDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5S66N2#wasThisHelpful","R2HQ999ZCN1SDP","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book to read and review.This is a good one to read as an introduction to science fiction, nothing is too way out but still a good story. As this is Part one there is obviously much more to come. The only thing that let it down for me was the title as I kept wondering and waiting for Zara to get a flight. Eventually of course she did which is almost where the story ends and sets itself up for the next in the series.There were good and bad characters with no aliens at this stage most of the book concentrating on the rise and fall of two rival corporations and their leaders. The characters were all well described particularly Zara as she develops from what could best be described as a spoilt brat into a confident woman.I did like the story and will read the rest of the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9BHVMUN6KK08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1512129755#wasThisHelpful","R9BHVMUN6KK08","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this free to read and review.To say this book was hurried is a bit of an understatement, everything moves at a frantic pace. It has the basis of a good story but little time is devoted to either the character development or the plot. The book shows it is Episode 1 which means that it is only part of the story and quite a short book. I would have liked to see this expanded into a complete novel rather than being a part work.

"I received this free to test and review.At last a car charger with three outputs and I do not have to worry which one to plug into. All will deliver 2.4A but are equally suitable for 500mA devices. It is a well-made charger with a nice feel to it with a rubberised outer coating. I am not sure if I want a car charger to look stylish but this one manages it with a simple blue line at the top and a blue led indicating when there is power to the charger.Supplied with the charger is a coiled usb cable 7ft or 2.15 metres long when fully extended. The advantage of this is it allows back seat passengers to have a phone or tablet on charge while sitting normally. I also liked the way the cable had the manufacturer's name on one side and a lightning symbol on the other, it is not always easy to see what you are doing in a car when you are trying to plug in leads but with this one and the raised logo it is easy to feel which way the plug should go.These days I find I am using more and more usb devices in a car and this one allows me to run my Satnav, car camera and still allow me to charge a phone. I wonder how long it will be before 3 outputs are not enough.A nice and very useful charger.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROW461F4X17TJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJAVDAY#wasThisHelpful","ROW461F4X17TJ","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received these free to test and review.Although a good cable the advantage for me is I no longer have to worry which cable is which. I normally keep cables connected to an 8 way charger and have devices that need different current supplies. It would not be so bad if all the outputs were 2.4 A but I need to make sure to get a fast charge that I have the right output going to the right device. I also have devices that need mini usb connectors so I now keep these as black or white leads and I no longer pick up the wrong one.The actual cables are a bit unusual in that they have a braided outer rather than the usual smooth plastic ones. I also liked the Velcro type strip that enabled me to keep the cables coiled up, usually however much I try I end up with cables all tangled up and even if I try to roll them up they always manage to unwind themselves.The actual micro plug end is interesting as it is slightly longer than most which means if the socket is slightly obstructed by a case they still fit, until now I had to keep a specific cable for one of my phones. Both ends have the Velutz name on one side and a lightning flash on the other so I can easily see which way up the plug goes.I primarily use the leads for charging but being usb 2 I also tested that they would transfer data they did this at usb 2 speed with no problems.I have always thought that a cable is just a cable but these are well thought out and have lots of advantages over the standard black ones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R81DHQQZEE8LR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T38OHQ8#wasThisHelpful","R81DHQQZEE8LR","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this free to test and review, tested with a Canon EOS 70D.The first thing I noticed on opening the box is that this is a substantial and well thought out bit of kit. At 390g it is not a light weight. If you are used to a simple flash that just flashes when you press the shutter this will come as a revelation.BUT read the instructions or you will not get the best out of it and although the instructions are comprehensive they do need careful reading.The flash can be used in two modes on or off the camera as it will work as a wireless connected slave. Off the camera there is a supplied bracket that doubles as a table stand or tripod mount.It can be rotated horizontally through 180⁰ and vertically through 90⁰. 45⁰, 60⁰ & 75⁰ being marked, useful for bounce flash. It even comes with a soft pouch to store the flash in when not in use.Without reproducing the instruction book it is difficult to describe everything that it does, even the crisp display screen which can become crowded at times shows every conceivable operation. In practice it is likely that you will have a preference for a particular mode and this can be tailored by using the “customised function” however I found the most useful thing was that the flash remembered the last setting so once set up it was easy to shoot a sequence.I particularly liked the fact that it could be used as a slave flash and positioned easily exactly where I wanted it. If I have any criticism it was with the “catchlight” & “wide-angle diffuser”, this slides out of the body of the flash and the diffuser folds over the flash head, no problem, however the catchlight panel can slide back in and be difficult to get hold of to pull back out. This is such a minor niggle with an otherwise excellent and versatile flash.There were other things I liked such as being able to use it as a modelling light for one second. With such a powerful flash there is a possibility of overheating if you use stroboscopic flash more than 10 times in succession so if you do this leave it to cool down for 15 minutes before you try again so the flash head is not damaged, there is however an automatic cut out to prevent overheating.With a flash although having many features is nice there is nothing more important than even illumination. I took a couple of photographs of a grey screen and I could not see any variation in the coverage.A rechargeable battery/power unit is available however the 4 AA cells give at least 110 flashes and I find it just as easy to pop in some new batteries.In summary; a superb flash that will do everything you want.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XZT8667H154/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S89H41I#wasThisHelpful","R12XZT8667H154","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free to test and review.Although advertised as a device for detecting dog urine stains (I am trying to be careful with my words so Amazon publish this) and it does work well in this mode, some friends have a new puppy and were surprised what this torch showed when they thought that they had cleaned up.It not only shows up traces that animals have left behind it also showed up residual from a coffee stain that I thought I had cleaned up and could not see with the naked eye. It does give an ultraviolet light but also into the visible spectrum so you can see what you are pointing it at. The instructions say it works better in the dark and although this is no doubt true I found it was fine in normal lighting conditions.However I did not get it for that, now that I am semi-retired I have become a “jack of all trades” one of my contracts is to check documents, passports etc . There are loads of forged documents about and this torch makes it easy to identify where security markings are missing or changes have been made to documents.It is a well-made device looking like a small torch, it takes 3 AAA batteries that are inserted in a removable carrier which makes changing batteries easy although as it will not be used for a long continuous period I expect the batteries to last for ages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y8RYPPGMHQ5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RV8PREI#wasThisHelpful","R1Y8RYPPGMHQ5V","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free to test and review.Although this is an Apple certified device it has many more applications. I often have a number of things running in the car and these days the current demands are getting greater all the time. As this charger has 3 high power outputs 2 x 2.1 A and 1 x 2.4 A it is more than adequate to power my satnav and dashboard camera leaving one output so I can charge something else if I need to. (I leave the 2.4A one free so it will cope with anything.It is solidly made and fits securely into the car socket due to the sprung buttons on each side.

"I received this free to test and review.I do not intend to do any camping during the winter so I will not be able to test it as a camping lantern at the moment, however even without camping it is a very useful gadget. I have not seen another lantern like this before.Initially it is a compact disk that has a lens in the center which serves as a torch however twist slightly and it pops up to turn into a small lantern. It is equally easy to fold back. The trend these days is to make everything rechargeable; however this one needs you to put in your own batteries. Actually I prefer this as I see it being used more as an emergency light in the case of a power failure than camping.In the dark even with the dim setting it provides enough light to see in a reasonably large room, perhaps not to read but more than adequate in the case of a power failure. However on the ""bright"" setting I could read with it admittedly not from a great distance.It is claimed to be water resistant to IP44 which means that water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical shall have no harmful effect. Test duration: 5 minutes. Although I am not disputing this I am not sure I would like to expose it to that much water, but it should certainly be OK in normal rain.A useful light, which will be kept next to my electricity meter, waiting for the next power cut. I will take it camping with me next summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10F460QVV54GR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QWPGF7Y#wasThisHelpful","R10F460QVV54GR","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A well-structured book with an unusual premise, for some reason, which becomes apparent later in the book adults are being killed by animals and fighting amongst themselves. Against this background the characters in the book have to survive, there is plenty of graphic violence and it is essentially a simple story of survival but well written.Later on in the book it becomes more of a mission as the group realise the danger they are in. I thought all the characters were well portrayed and although there is a mild romantic involvement it does not bog down the story.This is part one of a series but it stands well by itself and I am not sure were subsequent books will go as there to me seems little to add.I will however read the next in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ALTN2FROXK13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NJCL302#wasThisHelpful","R1ALTN2FROXK13","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This is only a real problem with passwords where I have been locked out of a site a couple of times due to hitting the wrong key.This stylus solves all the problems as it allows precision touching and although I will probably not use it for everything I have found it essential if it is a cluttered screen that has not been formatted for use on a small (4”) screen.The business end has a soft but seemingly substantial “point” which will not scratch or otherwise damage a touch screen. There is a useful pen if you pull off the end with the pocket clip. I do not know however what size refills it takes or if they are replaceable as I did not recognise the type.Unlike some styluses I have used in the past this one is well made and looks to all intents and purposes a well made stylish pen.

"The author kindly sent me all three of the series and I read them all before posting the reviews as often I find that often series turn out to be serials where they run into each other and you need to read all of them. In this case there is no such problem although the series contains references to the other books they read well as complete stand-alone books, after reading them all the more I thought that they did not need to be a series as there was little relationship between the individual books.The series are;-Worldship Praxis (The Worlds of Man)Shadow of Worlds (The Worlds of Man)Vanguard of Man: The Worlds of Man Book 3The first in the series ""Worldship Praxis"" is an exploration vessel which is sending colonists to distant worlds since Earth became uninhabitable and in the meantime having the odd battle with the Andiki an insect race. It is an interesting book that spends a lot of time in developing the characters and the enormous ship.

"I received this free to test and review.This is going to be something you like or dislike depending on if you like the style or not, I did. I found it easy to pair with a number of phones including a Blackberry, Nokia and an iPhone. Read the instructions carefully as they are not too clear. I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality both talk and listen. The display although small was very clear and displayed the caller’s number on incoming calls. I liked the fact that with nothing happening the face was completely black until a touch on either button brought up the time. With power off if you want to conserve power although it does have a standby time of up to 72 hours the watch keeps time so when you power it back up you do not have to reset the time.Charging was easy with a unique clip (a bit like a crocodile clip) which had two little prongs that clipped on the bracelet. As anormal charging lead will not fit remember to take it on holiday and don’t lose it.I have often worried about using an expensive phone in a busy city as it could so easily be snatched, with this you can keep the phone in your bag / pocket and answer or make calls from the watch without taking the phone out (outgoing calls are only to the last number dialled). One of the things I use in cities is the phones sat nav (Nokia Ovi maps) where it talks directions I found this very useful to have on my wrist rather than having to keep the phone out all the time.Music streaming worked but I think I preferred using an earphone off the phone.I am fortunate that I have a slim wrist as the bracelet does not expand very much and anyone with thick wrists may find it will not fit or be very uncomfortable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H99YUJLTXKFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQZU8H2#wasThisHelpful","R2H99YUJLTXKFZ","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I often have problems with translated books but this works well. The author (in the publicity blurb) challenges us to decide which is real and which is fiction, some is decidedly fiction and whether the rest is I just don't care.Connor is a very interesting character who is determined to live his life how he wants and surprisingly his wife goes along with the unusual relationship without complaint. At the end of the book there is an epilogue which is set in the future and pulls everything together.

"I received this book free to read and review.For a while I wondered if this was actually a science fiction/fantasy novel as it seemed that it could have been set in many early periods in Earth’s history except that it was played out between rival bands on floating rocks (aerocks). I thought that it worked well as a descriptive work of the location and all of the characters seemed realistic. The story slowly developed and although the mystery of who and where the knight of the title came from was a central thread it was more about the interaction between characters and the changing alliances.

"I received this book free to read and review.Unfortunately the car was better than the story, I was intrigued when I saw the book as I used to own a GT6 like the one featured in the book, however I was disappointed in the book.None of the characters seemed to be realistic and the story although coming to a logical conclusion did meander getting there. Much was made in the publisher’s blurb of the detective wanting to seek proof that Elvis is still alive, although passing reference was made to this it was not developed in the story.  I assume it was intended to be an amusing story but perhaps I have no sense of humour. The descriptive passages were good but just not the book for me. There are more to come but I will not be reading them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2IZ3MY1DT3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7M465O#wasThisHelpful","R3N2IZ3MY1DT3T","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is essentially a save the world there is a countdown to disaster type novel. The twist is that only the bad guys know the disaster is coming and try to conceal it from the rest of the world.There are a number of converging story lines which don’t seem to be leading in the same direction but eventually came together.An exciting tale with interesting characters and although I am not sure about some of the science it all sounded very plausible.Certainly a different take on a disaster novel, and did wonder until late in the story if everything was going to work out for the best.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFLH3QKTIZQG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BGPMNG#wasThisHelpful","R1CFLH3QKTIZQG","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this free to read and reviewA long short story if this makes any sense and one that is pitched firmly at the lower age groups. Told from the perspective of the alien and from that of the little girl whose family adopts the alien “Alfear”. Almost reading like a fairy story there is much that does not logically hold together like why should a family be able to suddenly adopt a boy found at a zoo. I actually liked the story from the alien’s perspective better, strangely it seemed more real. Slowly as the aliens powers became more apparent I thought it was going to have a twist and become more of a horror story but no it retained its gentle style to the end. One of the few friendly alien stories and a nice introduction to science fiction.There is more to come as Alfear has more adventures in the wide world and I can see this series creating a following however I am so far out of the target age group that I will not be one of them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R97T18LXOYPBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I5X4UMS#wasThisHelpful","R97T18LXOYPBV","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An all action thriller that proceeds at a fast pace. Everything is thrown at the reader and it requires you to suspend logic to for it to work. I have no idea why the “Robin Hood Hacker” Ronnie the central character as well as being a hacker has high tech (science fiction) weapons and devices, but otherwise the story would not work. All of the characters are very comic strip and larger than life as is the action.Thrown into the mix are “black death”, “Evil secret society (The Hidden Hand)” a few scientists, secret service agents and not to forget paintings from the great masters and even “Elvis”.There are twist and turns all through the book with a bit of romance thrown in.If you look as all the elements thrown in it just should not work but it does and does very well.Although this is the first of a series it works well as a stand-alone leaving just enough loose ends for the series to carry on.I will read the next in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DE2BU3EMGZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007E5TVMM#wasThisHelpful","R19DE2BU3EMGZ0","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is however badly let down by its instructions which contains some gems such as “Charging, the mobile power hosts a slight fever which s a normal phenomenon” I assume this means it gets hot in use.. If you have never used one of these before it is difficult to know which is the input and which the output as it is not labelled on the battery (It is micro usb to charge and standard usb for output) there is no indication in the instructions how to tell if it is charged.(While charging a red led lights up, when fully charged it turns green and when used to power a phone etc it turns blue) Unfortunately there is no way of indicating the charge level other than fully charged.It is remarkably simple to use just charge it up and plug it into whatever you want to charge, I have a sat nav with a dud battery that is not replaceable and this powers it nicely and lasts all day.It has 4 interchangeable tips which allow you to use it with mini usb, micro usb, iPad and the small Nokia connector.Worth getting if you need a stylish and good value battery.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15GTGFBNIJQZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E2YI052#wasThisHelpful","R15GTGFBNIJQZC","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this torch free to test and review.I have a number of these types of torches but this sets itself apart from the others for a number of reasons one of the main ones being the battery. Usually these torches use 18650 rechargeable batteries which although very good are quite difficult to get in the UK. While this torch is no exception it also has an adaptor that fits instead of the rechargeable battery and takes 3 AAA type batteries, so much more convenient. The actual torch fits easily in the pocket being 135mm long or about 5 ¼ "". The other distinguishing feature is the ""zoom"" marked ""dimmer"" on the torch, instead of the normal intense but narrow beam this has a ring which when twisted changes the focus of the beam which can then become although still bright a wider angle which is very useful as often a spot beam does not light up everything you need it to.Simple to use with just a single on/off button at the end, no fancy SOS settings. It just does what it is supposed to do and does it very well. EDIT I have just found the flash setting click the on/off button twice for flash.There is a built in clip on the body of the torch so it can be clipped to a belt or pocket etc. It also comes with an adjustable head band with a couple of loops in various places to secure the torch, top of the head or either side. There is also a quick release clamp to fit cycle handlebars and finally a wrist strap.In summary a very versatile and useful torch.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JN8V9S06KPI0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEWYNTQ#wasThisHelpful","R3JN8V9S06KPI0","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book free to read and review.Although this states an adult book I would suggest it is pitched at the YA market and although I am far from that, but getting younger all the time, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Although dealing with time travel which can be confusing this book did not fall into the trap of using too many pseudoscientific descriptions some certainly but not too many. This was grounded by also trying to start the time craft with a truck battery.The romance stated in the description is a bit one sided but may develop in others in the series, when I started reading it I did not realise it was a series but it works well as a standalone novel with enough left over for the next one.I liked the characters, there were not too many of them, and they had a feel to them so that I could visualise them I actually liked the way Lola Garth (no relation to Garth of the comic strip) the lady from the department trying to close down the time travel operation was portrayed. Woodstock features quite a bit and it is a slight deviation from the main story line however it is described in such a way as the atmosphere of Woodstock comes  across. It is how friends of mine described it at the time. I would have liked to have gone there but my time machine (actually camper van) broke down about 100 miles away.In all a nice light read it does not stretch the reader but is very enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WVQHN2UWSMCA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G9ADV2O#wasThisHelpful","R2WVQHN2UWSMCA","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book free to read and review.Some science fiction manages to have good descriptive passages of strange new worlds and others have good strong stories this manages both. On some levels it is a conventional detective novel but raised to a new level by the setting. It also deals with science, some very way out, in a way that makes it all seem very ""normal"" if multiple personalities, arms that convert into a multitude of weapons and implants that store all your memories and more can ever be normal.The two main detectives Lieutenant Hoskin and Sergeant Quinlin come across as real people going about their normal job with just enough background given to be able to visualise them. In fact all of the characters are well described, I particularly liked the enigmatic Sakura.In the end everything comes to a satisfactory conclusion and all the loose ends are brought together.There are enough of the characters in the book left for this to be the start of a series and hope it is.A great science fiction and I would like to read more from this author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38ZXTITNCZ4VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D19LB0U#wasThisHelpful","R38ZXTITNCZ4VA","A15YT5AKBDUGU0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A15YT5AKBDUGU0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using Serif software since they started and with most of the range I update every other version unless there is an upgrade that I particularly want. However I do not do much video editing and could not see much point in updating from a very early version. I however received a good offer from Serif which included the handbook, which is worth having.It is impossible for me to list all of the improvements from my early version but thought I would start the easy way and use a wizard (Quick Movie) to create a short movie and that is where I ran into trouble.I selected a theme downloaded 3 short clips with the intention of using them for an Amazon video review. So far so good, it created the movie with Title screen formatted all the frames in keeping with the theme and created a credits screen for the end.BUTI did not like the theme and could find no way of changing the theme without starting again (It is probably possible but I could find nothing in the help files or in the book. As there are loads of themes I would like the opportunity of trying an assortment to see which I liked best.I did find one I liked and then proceeded to try and customise it, I could enter additional title and other text boxes and change transitions of which there are many, I liked the 3D page roll. However I again ran into trouble here as I wanted 2 sequential text screens I could not find any way of preventing them merging when I ran the movie so the text was not readable.Once I had eventually produced the video it was extremely easy to save in almost any format and it does have formats specifically for ""itunes""  and ""youtube"".IN SUMMARYA very comprehensive video editing package however I did not find it as intuitive as claimed.

"I have a new favorite book of the year: Sarah Bird’s Above the East China Sea. This is one of those deeply satisfying reads that works on many levels. It moves among several settings: the U.S. military base on Okinawa in the present day and Okinawa outside of the base; Okinawa during World War II when the Island served as a defensive barrier between Japan and U.S. warships; the Okinawan spirit world, led by spirits called kami.This book is the story of two young women and is narrated in their voices. The first, Luz James, is a military brat (a term she uses to describe herself), daughter of a single mother. Luz’s world has been torn apart by her older sister’s unexpected enlistment in the Air Force and her death in Afghanistan. She is responding to her sorrow with drug use and risk-taking, common pastimes among her two groups of friends: the “Quasi” crowd composed of other military brats (quasi because that’s the only sort of friendship one can establish with the constant moves of military life) and the Smokinawans, the local stoners.The second young woman is Tamiko Kokuba, an Okinawan originally a fanatical supporter of Japan (many Okinawans at the time considered it a compliment to be mistaken for Japanese), who works in the cave hospitals set up on the island for the Japanese forces, and who, pregnant at age fifteen after being raped by soldiers on both sides of the conflict, chooses to commit suicide. Okinawan custom requires recovery of the body and regular tending to the remaining bones in order to to have a life after death. Because she has committed suicide by throwing herself into the sea and her body was never recovered, Tamiko and her unknown child have been unable to move on. Their spirits await guidance by the kami, hoping the kami will provide them with a body whose spirit they can displace, which will allow them to move on to the afterlife. Tamiko spends the years as a waiting spirit by recounting her life story to her unborn child.Luz and Tamiko’s paths cross in both literal and spiritual senses as Luz contemplates suicide and Tamiko waits for a body to house her spirit. At several moments I was sure I’d guessed how these two different crises would be resolved, but Bird’s nuanced story-telling keeps adding complexity to the narrative, taking it to deeper, richer places than I’d imagined.I don’t want to say more than this because readers deserve the pleasure of following the several paths of this novel without having parts of the narrative revealed ahead of time. Whatever your preferred genre—history, historical fiction, contemporary fiction, mystery, fantasy—Above the East China Sea offers a satisfying read that will stay with you long after you close the book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5HD09R43P6RC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H12A0NW#wasThisHelpful","R5HD09R43P6RC","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jonathan Auxier’s The Night Gardener is an absolute delight—one of those “children’s books” that can just as readily pull adults into its magical world. I started it one night, read until I was exhausted, then picked it up again the next morning because I couldn’t wait to get back to that magical world.This tale was inspired, the author tell us, by Bradbury’s Something Wicked This Way Comes and the stories of Washington Irving, among other texts, but it is much more than a new twist on previously published works. One can see moments where these inspirations shine through clearly, but The Night Gardener remains its own creature throughout: moody, sometimes deeply unsettling, populated by a cast of characters one quickly grows fond of.The novel is set in the Victorian era, and the cast include young Molly and Kip, who may or may not be orphans, making their way to a mysterious manner house in hopes of gaining work as servants; the failing, fading family who make this mansion their home; a story-telling crone; and a self-satisfied rationalist doctor, alert for any opportunity to receive scientific fame.In addition to the human characters, we also have the Night Gardener of the title and the overgrown, menacing tree he tends and that grows not just outside, but throughout the home, shaping the lives of all who spend time there.This is one of those novels that meets expectations, but never disappoints by doing so. Our young heroes summon bravery in difficult straits. The threatened family’s love is dissipating, but emerges still at crucial moments. To paraphrase Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest, the good end happily and the bad end unhappily; that is what fiction means. Just as Harry Potter’s expected defeat of Voldemort does nothing to lesson the pleasure of reading J. K. Rowling’s series, the fact that our young heroes end (mostly) happily does nothing to dilute the pleasures of The Night Gardener. The fact that Auxier is a wonderful prose stylist doesn’t hurt, either.Whether you live in a home with children or without them, this is a wonderful book to keep on the shelves for those moments when one needs to sink into the company of literary “friends” and to allow the cares of day-to-day life to fade into the distance. After you’ve read this book once, you’ll look forward to returning to it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7I7PAJ0Q53MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVY32QA#wasThisHelpful","R7I7PAJ0Q53MP","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Natalie S. Harnett’s The Hollow Ground, the characters attempt to make peace with themselves and each other while living—both literally and figuratively—over a great emptiness. The setting for this novel is a group of former coal-mining towns. The mines have closed, but the coal still in the ground has caught fire and has been burning for years. These underground fires can render playgrounds and basements literally too hot to walk across; they produce carbon monoxide, a constant threat for those living in these towns; and, as coal burns away, great holes develop underground, undermining the foundations of homes and sometimes collapsing, taking homes and lives with them. Whole cities are being destroyed in a major eminent domain project involving the digging of enormous trenches in hopes of ending the fires’ spread.This is where we meet our narrator, Brigid Howley. Brigid is in her early teens and her life has been completely destabilized. Her favorite aunt has died in a sink-hole collapse in the family’s backyard, the family’s home has been condemned, and they now live in a run-down local hotel on temporary assistance. All the adults in her life—mother, father, paternal grandmother—are at odds with one another, and when Brigid’s family move in with her grandmother, her life grows less stable, not more.Brigid’s father, Adrian, is a seldom-employed former miner, who lost the use of one arm in a mine collapse. Her mother, Dolores, was left at an orphanage after her father remarried—although the couple chose to raise her younger brother as their own. Brigid’s grandmother (whose mother also grew up in an orphanage) is the second wife of a man who lost his “true loves,” his first wife and children, in flash flooding caused by a mine collapse. Everyone, including the children has learned to keep their feelings and desires well hidden because, as Brigid tells us several times, the easiest way of losing something is to let others know you want it.Given this bleak setting and contentious cast, I admit to having a hard time really getting going with The Hollow Ground. The first third or so just seemed like an onslaught of unpleasant people being unpleasant with each other. But that changed as Brigid began to develop a friendship of her own and to create a (small) life for herself outside of her family. She still spends much of her time observing the adults around her, but she also becomes more of a girl: not completely jaded, experiencing a great many things for the first time.If you’re looking for mindless (or just comforting) entertainment, you’ll find this book deeply unsatisfactory. On the other hand, if you’re willing to fight your way through the unpleasantness, you’ll find yourself deeply engaged with Brigid, admiring her character, if not always enjoying her story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LOW7XCLTK759/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GETG0FK#wasThisHelpful","R1LOW7XCLTK759","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nathan Dueul's, Friday Was the Bomb, recounts his experiences living in the middle east, working as a freelance writer, and caring for his daughter, while his wife worked as a war correspondent for National Public Radio. This isn't a full-on memoire, rather it's a collection of some of his freelance essays (with revision) that originally appeared in a variety of publications, including Al Jazeera America, Los Angeles Review of Books, and The New Republic.I requested an electronic ARC of this book anticipating that it might give me an insider's view of the political clashes and civil wars currently fomenting in the middle east--but it's Dueul's wife who's the war correspondent, not Dueul. One learns little about the Middle East in these essays beyond the fact that an interesting range of ex-pats live there and that occasional violence breaks out with loss of life. In other words, this isn't really a book about the middle east.What it is is a book about balancing fatherhood and work, these tasks complicated by worries about a spouse with a very dangerous job. He is sincerely interested in events around him:I was excited and honored--overwhelmed, really--to be standing in the middle [of this region], hoping the darker forces of death and destruction would keep their distance and that my own enthusiasm to learn more--with Kelly's [his wife] ability to report well and stay alive, with the resilience of the Iraqi people, with America's ability to be honest about its power and priorities, with my ability to have faith in something it was difficult to have faith in--maybe things might actually get better.But what Dueul writes most about isn't the political aspirations of the Iraqi people or America's honesty. We get stories of taking children for a snow day in Lebanon, of an art opening made lively with ample beer, of getting the best shave and haircut of his life from a barber in Instanbul.Dueul isn't blind to the struggles being played out around him, but when he thinks of them, he's putting a good bit of his energy into watching his own responses to them, using the times in war zones to try to work out what sort of a man he is. Near the end of the book, transitioning to life back in the U.S. he notes that, ""On the eve of our new life in America, I had a feeling that everything I'd struggled with the last five years--worrying, death, guilt--would dog me no matter what country we lived in.""If you want to read a collection about the challenges of fatherhood and manhood--albeit in an extraordinary setting--you'll enjoy this book. But I was looking for insights into a political struggle often minimally covered by the U.S. media, and I left this book feeling none the wiser.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QTABOXMC0QT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K627XAC#wasThisHelpful","R1QTABOXMC0QT5","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’d been itching to read Norman Lock’s The Boy in His Winter: An American Novel since the moment I heard about its premise: Huck Finn and Jim sail down the Mississippi and along time, arriving in New Orleans as Hurricane Katrina hits. This synopsis (who knows where or how I absorbed it) isn’t really accurate. Yes, Huck and Jim are on a raft. Yes, the raft passes through the edge of Katrina. But The Boy in His Winter is much more complex in its aspirations.Rather than offering a quick one-line summary that includes only a small part of the book’s overall narrative, it might be more useful to look at the publisher releasing the book. In this case, the publisher is Bellevue Literary Press (BLP), which bills itself as “the first and only nonprofit press dedicated to literary fiction and nonfiction at the intersection of the arts and sciences.” BLP hopes to “promote science literacy in unaccustomed ways and offer new tools for thinking about our world.” This isn’t a Huck-meets-Katrina book; it’s a much more metaphysical work that questions the nature of time while traversing key moments in American history.I enjoyed this book at the beginning. Huck, now very old and near dying, is recounting his story to an anonymous amanuensis. He wanders a bit, he cogitates, he questions as much as tells: “Of course, I reckon time differently now than we did then, sweeping down the Mississippi toward Mexico as though in a dream.  Those days did seem like a dream, though not mine, or Jim’s, either, but one belonging to somebody whose hand I almost felt, prodding me onward in spite of my reluctance.” That’s rich language, the kind one wants to read aloud for the pleasure of feeling it roll about in one’s mouth.As the book progressed and the metaphysical pondering continued, I grew less charmed. The prose was still lovely, but as I read I felt as though I was waiting for someone or something to appear that, Godot-like, never showed its face. What I was longing for, I think, was the physical Huck, the boy of flesh and blood. Yes, Huck was a thinker, but he was also young, vital, alive, and to have this aspect of him jettisoned from the beginning left me frustrated.Many of Huck’s thoughts—on slavery and race, on friendship and its limits, on the human condition—are interesting. And the book offers some small moments of action: a Civil War battle, the brief glimpse of Katrina, the birth of jazz from southern blues music. Jim, who dies before Huck, reappears in different guises and the reader enjoys seeing him change as his spirit is transported to new eras. But too many of Huck’s thoughts are repetitious, and the blurred depiction of the external world leaves readers anchorless on this float down time and river.The Boy in His Winter does “promote science literacy in unaccustomed ways,” but the “tools for thinking about our world” are limited: Time is fluid; People do and don’t change. This isn’t so much science literacy as scientific generalization written over and over again.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8EEGJZGNAAFC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6UZVC4#wasThisHelpful","R8EEGJZGNAAFC","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Set in World War II France and Germany, All the Light We Cannot See is my favorite kind of novel: long, rich, populated by a range of imperfect characters, some who try to transcend that imperfection, others who cannot see it.The cast of characters includes Marie-Laure, blind since age six, with a quick mind and a great deal of self-confidence; her father, locksmith for the Museum of Natural History in Paris; Marie-Laure’s great-uncle, an agoraphobic haunted by ghosts since he returned from World War I; the great-uncle’s elderly housekeeper, who finds the courage to join the French resistance; Werner, a German orphan who is a prodigy in the creation and repair of radios; Werner’s sister Jutta, left behind when Werner is accepted into a science academy for Hitler Youth that offers more political indoctrination than science; and a whole host of others.Anthony Doerr brings this wide assembly of individuals to life, moving among them, slowly drawing them nearer one another, fleshing each of them out so that even those we might expect to be stereotypes are much more multifaceted.And among these multifaceted characters lies a multifaceted stone: a diamond with a legendary history. In less able hands, the diamond would have dominated this story, which would have degenerated into a variation on Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it’s the characters who are the heart of All the Light We Cannot See. There are a few we hate, but for the most part, we can’t help but see the better parts of them. The question is whether they will discover these better selves in time to make a difference of some sort in a world quite literally in flames.I’m hesitant to provide more summary. Reading this book, meeting the people in it, sharing their journeys, is an engrossing experience that shouldn’t be undercut by foreknowledge. All the Light We Cannot See contains a great deal of action, but that action is more than balanced by the development of characters we witness over the decade or so that this novel encompasses. This is novel of people more than it is a novel of events.I received and electronic ARC of this book to review and find myself longing for its release date so I can get a paper copy, one that will feel as solid in my hands as Doerr’s narrative. We’re less than halfway through the year, but it wouldn’t surprise me at all if in December I remember All the Light We Cannot See as my favorite read of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U7AITU0LUVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7TIG#wasThisHelpful","R3U7AITU0LUVO","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jurek Becker is probably best know for his two novels Jacob the Liar and The Boxer, but this is the first of his works I’ve read. It’s a slim volume, just under 150 pages, containing five short stories and one essay. Becker is a Holocaust survivor—one who was quite young during WWII. He was born in Lodz, Poland, and lived in the Lodz Ghetto for several years before being sent to the Ravensbruck concentration camp at the age of five. Later, he was sent to Sachsenhausen. His father, from whom he’d been separated, survived as well, and the two were united after the war. His mother died just as the camps were being liberated. He lived in East Germany for many years, a dissident author and playwright, but moved to West Berlin in 1977, retaining his East German citizenship.The editor (Becker’s wife) has placed the one essay at the end of the book as a way of demarcating the line between fiction and non-fiction, but, not surprisingly, this line is significantly blurred, and the book is better because of that, detailed in its brevity with stories in which scene and character are quickly established.If there is one theme that runs through the book, it’s the ways that we don’t understand the stories of our own lives as we live them. Four of the five stories are narrated in the first person: and each narrator’s grasp of his own situation is limited in some significant way. In the title story, an unnamed boy whose family is moved from one part of the Lodz Ghetto to another, recounts the adventures he and two friends devise. The narrator is aware that people are being summarily executed—an elderly shopkeeper friend of his was killed for the “crime” of having a plant in his apartment—but at the same time, cannot quite grasp the risks he faces, even in moments when he fears his own death is at hand.In “The Most Popular Family Story” an uncle relates a “prank” played on him while he was on business in London, one made possible by his lack of English and limited knowledge of local customs. In “The Suspect” a loyal East German deals with the fact that he’s under government surveillance with a series of rationalizations that make him unable to see the true nature of that government.This lack of full understanding is made clear in both the introduction and in the book’s final essay, “The Invisible City,” written to accompany an exhibit of photographs of the Lodz Ghetto. Becker, the author, knows the outline of his own childhood, but doesn’t remember it; he knows about the war years only through the handful of stories his father told him.I found this incomplete understanding moving. The opening story and the young narrator’s incomplete grasp of his own situation are heartbreaking because we, the readers, know so much more than does the story’s central character. What the boy sees as arbitrary rules and limitations, we see as the leading edge of a horror about to be fully enacted.The incomplete understanding also made me think of my own time and the things we choose not to understand because full understanding would overwhelm us. We “know” of injustices, famines, human rights violations, natural disasters, but for those not living through them understanding is not just impossible, it is also unwanted. As is the case with several of Becker’s narrators, it is, in fact, our lack of full understanding that allows us to survive.While this is a brief book—so brief as to be frustrating—it is absolutely worth reading, offering us mirrors on the past and, if we look closely, on our own present as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NCKLTIUEPL2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J75IQL4#wasThisHelpful","R1NCKLTIUEPL2V","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Steve Burrows’ A Siege of Bitterns introduces Inspector Domenic Jejeune, a detective recently assigned to the village of Saltmarsh who is deeply ambivalent about his work. Yes, he’s something of a prodigy when it comes to solving murders and missing persons cases, but he’s also a cipher of a man—one who would prefer the rather isolated life of a field ornithologist to his own.A Siege of Bitterns is the first in a promised series of “birder mysteries” featuring Jejeune, and I can’t wait for more.Well, I suppose I will have to wait for more, but I don’t want to. I’d much rather there were already a dozen volumes in the series that I could pore through, watching his character develop, seeing his changing relationships with colleagues, listening to his frustrated, conflicting internal dialogues.Whether or not bird-watching interests you (I grew up in a house of birders, but never became one myself), if you like high-quality police procedural mystery novels, you’ll be deeply satisfied with A Siege of Bitterns. Enjoy it now, then join me in waiting eagerly for the next volume.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6A62KMQT83SP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CMPEXVI#wasThisHelpful","R6A62KMQT83SP","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Upside Down in the Middle of Nowhere is one of those luminous YA reads that bookstores would do well to stock with adult fiction, as well as YA. It’s a “problem novel,” but the problem isn’t a distant boyfriend or a fight with a bestie; the problem is Hurricane Katrina.Armani Curtis’s family has yielded to her imploring and decided to remain in New Orleans, despite the pending storm, to celebrate her birthday. This is a bad decision. A very bad decision that puts everyone involved through all the worst that we’ve come to associate with Katrina: being stranded on the rooftop of their flooded house, losing (and not always finding once again) family members, traveling across and in badly polluted water, facing the misery and incipient violence in the King Dome, and trying to avoid child protective services, so the family won’t be broken up further.The pacing of this novel is just right. At first, we see the world simply, through Armani’s eyes. She chafes against some of the restrictions imposed by her parents, but respects the discipline and sense of personal history that they and her grandmother provide. The shift from normality to disaster begins gradually enough; we can see why the family might choose to remain. But when Katrina hits, things change quickly and dangerously.Yes, this is fiction, but it does a wonderful job of placing readers in the middle of a challenging, devastating disaster that may be beginning to slip out of current memory. This is a book we—adults and teenagers—need to help us grasp the magnitude of natural disaster. We also need it just so we can meet Armani and watch her, sometimes unwillingly, rise to the occasion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXASE6V82RT3U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOJT8G8#wasThisHelpful","RXASE6V82RT3U","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Resurrection of Mary Mabel McTavish is an odd sort of creature, rather like the result of some mad gene splicing experiment combining DNA from Nathaniel West, Carson, McCullers, and Horatio Alger. It is at once innocent and deeply cynical, a romance that litters the road to true love with all sorts of wreckage.Mary Mabel, stuck with a drunken, uncaring father, and living at the finishing school at which he serves as handyman, is both unhappy and genuine: dreaming of a different life, while seeing both the best and the worst in the world around her.The characters in this novel are types most readers will recognize, but they’re painted with enough detail that at their best moments they transcend stereotype. Besides Mabel’s father and the woman who runs the school (and later poses as a titled gentry) we have a half-crazed, going on fully crazed revivalist preacher; a sanctimonious con man; a newspaper man who will do anything for a story, and who hides a a streak of decency beneath his opportunism. There’s also the ghost of Mary Mabel’s mother.The story opens with a resurrection. Mary Mabel impulsively lays hands on and reanimates a boy struck by lightening during a revival held in a tent that was previously the site of an adultery-inspired double murder. And the story goes on from there: complex, ridiculous, mocking.At its best moments Mary Mabel is humorous and engaging, but at other times (those most West-like) it feels heavy-handed and deliberately provocative. The characters are never quite fleshed out enough to carry the weight of the narrative. Instead the author gets by keeping readers off balance and throwing one knuckle ball after another their way.This isn’t a book to read when you’re hungering for a narrative you can get lost in, but when you’d like some narrative pyrotechnics you may find it amusing.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YOIFNHXWKOR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGCHQW4#wasThisHelpful","R1YOIFNHXWKOR5","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cara Hoffman’s Be Safe I Love You follows soldier Lauren Clay on her first few days home following a tour of duty in Iraq. There’s a strong arc to this story: unsatisfactory meetings with old friends and family leading to Lauren’s decision to take her younger brother on a survivalist journey through a remote area of Canada in midwinter.Suspenseful as that narrative is, the real heart of the book is the characters and their wrestling with questions of identity. What makes this book exceptional is what people think, not what they do. Lauren, not surprisingly, has the roughest time of it, unable to drop her vigilance and expectation of command (she was an NCO) as she returns to civilian life. For her, entering the military was an economic, not an ideological, decision and she questions what exactly it was she fought for. In her old church, she redefines the faith in which she was raised:The stained glass windows were dimly lit and she looked at them pane by pane; the long slow journey of Jesus, dragging his cross from window to window, until the Roman soldiers crucified him. It was a storyboard, she thought, like the kind you have to make and go over with your CO when you get back from a capture or kill. The stations of the cross were so everyone had their story straight, created agreement and uniformity in reporting the event. [...] Insurgent Jesus. [...] The stations of the cross made sense now, one more common war story hiding in plain sight.The characters around Lauren struggle with their own displacements. Her high school boyfriend has moved on to college and resents reminders of his working class origins. Her best friend’s early motherhood has limited her to minimum-wage jobs despite her outstanding high school record. There are “the Patricks” three brilliant, but failed men and a choir director who lost a promising career to alcoholism. All of these characters are drawn with a detail and honesty that makes them simultaneously sympathetic and irritating.If I were to call any book I’ve read this year a “must read,” it would be this one. The examination of the price paid by those who go to war on our behalf and of the compromises made necessary by poverty is rich—as is the prose in which it is presented.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189X11IEZ74PX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM8066#wasThisHelpful","R189X11IEZ74PX","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Train to Warsaw is an interesting work in both content and style. Jascha and Lilka, Jewish lovers who met in the Warsaw ghetto, escaped separately, and reunited in London years later are the passengers on this train. Jascha has become a famous writer and is invited to Poland to give a reading. He has no desire to return to the country that nearly killed him—and did kill so many. Lilka, with fond memories of prewar Warsaw, wants to return “home” and convinces him to accept the invitation. Of course, the home she remembers ceased to exist years ago.The plot of this novel is predictable: Jascha and Lilka remember the horrors of the past, and on their journey both reveal parts of their stories to they’ve hidden from one another for more than forty years. But the fact that the reader can predict the overall arc of the novel, doesn’t make it any less engaging. Edelman presents these two characters with such care and specificity that their experiences seem new precisely because these are their experiences.A major theme here is complicity: the complicity of the Poles who handed Jews over to the Nazis for the benefits this would bring them; the complicity of the Jewish police within the ghetto; the complicity in the suffering of others that no ghetto resident could avoid. Both Jascha and Lilka view their survival as a betrayal of sorts. They lived when so few did, and both lived because they found ways to construct new, non-Jewish identities for themselves.Jascha and Lilka keep their sense of complicity close at hand, probing it the way one probes any physically or emotionally painful area—to confirm the pain and to keep reminding one’s self that the pain has been survived, if not escaped.The Polish nation they return to, unlike them, is determined to forget the past. When Jascha challenges his Polish audience by reading a particularly devastating section of one of his novels set in the ghetto, everyone finds a way to distance herself or himself from the genocide. The young say they weren’t born then; the old say they suffered as well during the occupation; those in the middle claim they were too young during the war to have any kind of responsibility. And the reader, of course, is left to wonder if such deliberate forgetting may lead to repetition.The novel is composed primarily of conversations, both in the present and the past, and because Edelman doesn’t use standard dialogue formatting (no quotation marks here), the reader is forced to be attentive to the shifts in the narrative being constructed. The prose is deceptively simple, obscuring at first the fractal-like complexity of events, time, and emotion.This is a book that can be read in an evening, but one that will require a much longer period than that to fully absorb—the sort of book that remains satisfying long after one has finished it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A567LFKX786/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWGLWIY#wasThisHelpful","R3A567LFKX786","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ellen Gilchrist’s short story collection, Acts of God, is a quick, interesting read that will leave you with lots to turn over in your mind. The characters in these stories face, as the title suggests, acts of God: floods, hurricanes, and smaller, but equally unnerving disasters. These characters aren’t heroic in any grand sense. They’re ordinary—sometimes irritatingly so—individuals faced with immense challenges outside their control. As the publisher’s write-up notes, these people “somehow manage to survive, persevere, and even triumph.”In so many permutations, this cast of characters and their ability to overcome could lead to unsatisfactory results: sacchrine or histrionic or just plain unbelievable. Gilchrist’s achievement is that she allows her characters to overcome while keeping them human. Some of their triumphs are small, but they ring true. And together these stories build a sense of hopefulness that feels more like realism than like wishful thinking.This is a good book to pick up when you’re feeling worn down, dissatisfied, and short on energy. It won’t transport you to any magical world—but it will make this world seem a bit less daunting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DT6QZIPQ4WJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GU2RLU4#wasThisHelpful","R1DT6QZIPQ4WJR","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Always Emily is another book in the genre of literary figures, in this case Emily and Charlotte Brönte, turned detectives. Although it’s being marketed as a YA novel, this book offers fun reading for any fan of the Brönte sisters’ work.The usual (though not necessarily inaccurate) characterizations are in play here: Emily is dreamy, unconcerned with others’ opinions, determined to spend as much time as she can wandering the moors, while Charlotte frets about propriety and attempts to direct the lives of others in the household. Their brother Branwell appears, too, playing an unwitting role in the case as he fritters away time and money drinking with friends of dubious loyalty. Charlotte and Emily squabble, but they also have moments when they realize their value to each other. Charlotte can be brave when necessary; Emily is capable of compromising her gruff individualism at necessary moments.The book has elements one would find in a Brönte novel: a woman unjustly diagnosed as mad; a mysterious, handsome hero who’s been denied his birthright; self-righteous industrial barons. In fact, each chapter opens with quotations from the work of the Brönte sisters, which set the tone for each new stage in the action.This book offers no great revelations, but it’s a fun read, and one could hope for more in the same vein—including, perhaps, some stories in which Anne also plays a role. Given the sisters’ short lives, this concept will have its limits as a series, but that doesn’t mean another volume or two wouldn’t be enjoyable. And we can hope that this volume will lead a new generation of readers to the works of the Brönte sisters themselves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PYRK25GTR0EH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GOJT6HY#wasThisHelpful","R1PYRK25GTR0EH","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been loving the Kronberg Crimes series since the first volume appeared. A cross-dressing female epidemiologist in Victorian London who matches wits with Sherlock Holmes—what's not to love? These books are smart and the characters are well-developed. That said, this volume doesn't work as well as a stand-alone as the first two volumes did. There's no mystery intrinsic to this volume, just another episode in the multi-book narrative, and if you haven't read one of the earlier volumes, you'll have a hard time following what's happening. I'll keep reading every book that comes out in this series, but I'd prefer volumes that work well in isolation, as well as working as part of an on-going narrative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQPQAPA42482/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J28B5L4#wasThisHelpful","R2UQPQAPA42482","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Turn of the 20th Century Coney Island. A young woman trained to impersonate a mermaid. A Jewish photographer, refugee from Ukrainian pograms, fleeing his own cultural heritage. A former mob boss turned horse-whisperer. A highly cultivated wolf-man, whose life has been transformed by Jane Eyre. A hermit with a pet wolf. The Triangle Shirtwaist fire. A mysterious disappearance. What more do I have to tell you to get you to reach for this book?Alice Hoffman’s The Museum of Extraordinary Things is an extraordinary thing itself. Yes, it has all of the above elements, any one of which would make me pick it up in a bookstore and think about making a purchase. What it also has is a rich storyline, with engaging, complicated characters, and a trio of narrative voices that leave one hungry for more.The first two characters I mentioned, the mermaid and the photographer, provide two of the narrative voices. The third is a traditional omniscient narrator. Each chapter opens in one of the two character voices, then transitions to the omniscient narrator. In odd-numbered chapters we get the mermaid. In even-numbered chapters we get the photographer. And each of the three voices sings, distinct and true, creating a story that lets us move in and out of the hearts of its characters, seeing events from multiple perspectives.The Museum of Extraordinary Things balances dark and light. It’s full of menace, but never becomes hopeless. This is one of those novels that’s worth purchasing while it’s still only available in hardback.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TY4TR850NUEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7YM2#wasThisHelpful","R2TY4TR850NUEX","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lisa O’Donnell’s The Death of Bees was issued in hardback in 2012 and has just been released in paperback this winter. I have been buying up the remaindered hardbacks wherever I find them because I feel compelled to share this remarkable novel with as many of my friends as possible. This book, the story of two sisters who bury their dead parents in the back yard in order to avoid being put into the foster care system, depicts a world of poverty, violence, and drug use—but this bleakness is balanced by unlikely relationships the girls build with some of the adults around them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BT5BMRAYSTZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LOIWI#wasThisHelpful","R2BT5BMRAYSTZT","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Gifts of the State was released in early December, but I just received my digital review copy a week ago. From the moment I began reading, I knew I’d been lucky enough to come upon a unique, engaging title that I was eager to share with others.The editor, Adam Klein, ran English-language writing groups in Kabul for Afghans over a period of several years, and the short stories in this collection come out of that workshop. He undertook this project “to gather from a few aspiring writers the larger possibility for voices in a country too easily collectivized by frontline reports, historians who make Afghans seem like undefeatable warriors incapable of love, humor, heresy, let alone creating peaceful homes of democratic assembly.”Most Afghans who speak English speak it as a third (or fourth or…) language, and Klein admits to spending a great deal of one-on-one time with the authors editing for grammar and wrestling with style. I was worried at first that this might affect the quality and variety of the finished pieces, but I was delighted to find that the voices varied significantly from one story to the next.Given the recent history of Afghanistan, most of these stories have war as a background, but the number and complexities of these wars will be unfamiliar to many English-language readers: the revolution that ended the Afghan monarchy, the Soviet invasion, the battles between socialists and mujahadin, the triumph of the Taliban, and the more recent U.S. invasion. For the past half-century, Afghan life has demanded an ability to fit in among the current power group without developing a place in that group that would make death inevitable with the next change in political fortunes. We see many different characters negotiating this difficult “being, but not being”—and sometimes paying a high price when their efforts are unsuccessful. While all the pieces in this collection are fiction, they have the ring of painful truth.Interestingly, many of the writers—both male and female—chose to write from the perspective of the other gender. From my outside perspective, I would have anticipated that this would appeal to women writers, but I lacked the imagination to see how important it might be to male writers to attempt to see the world through female experience.  This is only one of the many ways in which this collection both confirms and confounds expectations. American readers will find situations and characters that seem familiar, but even more that break open our assumptions about life in the region.This book is available through bookstores in paperback.

"Marcela Serrano is a well-known writer in Chile, but Ten Women is the first of her books to be translated into English. The concept underlying the book is straightforward: nine women, all clients (some paying, some pro bono) of the same psychologist come together to tell their stories to one another. After the nine speak, an assistant to the psychologist tells the psychologist’s story as well. These chapters are framed by very brief opening and closing vignettes describing the psychologist viewing the women at a distance as they arrive for this group session.I wanted very much to love this book. I’m particularly interested in literature from post-Pinochet Chile, and the idea of such a multiplicity of narrative voices was tantalizing. I wanted to love this book. But I didn’t. I’m not sorry I read it. I learned from it. But that act of reading was rather like eating a large serving of Swiss chard: I knew it was good for me, but the experience wasn’t intrinsically rewarding.The women in Ten Women represent a broad range of classes, ages, and life experiences, including a young lesbian; the wife of a man who was “disappeared” during the Pinochet regime; a well-known television host; a poor woman struggling to provide not only for herself, but for her bipolar daughter and disabled mother as well. Unfortunately—and I don’t know if this is a characteristic of the original or a result of the translation—these voices come across in a sort of monotone, difficult to differentiate from one another.The structure Serrano uses, while interesting in concept, is part of the problem here. The book is essentially ten monologues with almost no cross reference. Each woman speaks about herself, but we hear only her voice as she speaks. There’s no exchange of words among characters. In addition, we’re not offered visuals of the group or the room in which they’re meeting, so our experience is abstract. We get no interplay of voices, no facial expressions or body language.The distance inherent in the monologues becomes most perplexing when the story of Natasha, the psychologist, is told by Natasha’s assistant. Natasha’s story is interesting, but doesn’t explain why she hasn’t met with the group herself or why she’s decided that this indirect form of self-revelation is appropriate in this therapeutic setting.One learns about the details of daily life for women in contemporary Chile: the expectations and opportunities that are largely regulated by class. However, since we can’t really connect with these too-similar-despite-their-differences women emotionally and since the novel as a whole lacks any narrative arc, what we get is a set of details that could have been communicated with equal efficiency in a shorter work of sociological non-fiction.If you’re interested in understanding some of the variety of contemporary Chileña experience, read this book. However, if you’re hoping to build relationships with characters and to travel along beside them you’ll be disappointed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R381KXLDDND8EQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRFP1XG#wasThisHelpful","R381KXLDDND8EQ","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent a good part of the last two days of 2013 reading Anthony Marra's A Constellation of Vital Phenomena. Although I'm not sure why, this book was on my radar before it came out, and I bought it in hardback within a few days of its release, certain somehow that that would be the right choice. Right, indeed.The best word I can come up with to describe this book is luminous. The prose, the characters, the plot have a glow about them. That is not to suggest that Constellation is a happy book. Rather, this is a book that radiates truth so that, even though much of it is sad, one finds a beauty in its precision. Marra has taken a difficult subject, life in Chechenya during the decade from 1994 to 2004, and explored it in a way that does justice to its topic and characters, granting them a well-deserved dignity that is free of pretension.The constellation at this book's heart is earthly, not heavenly, a constellation composed of intersecting moments in a series of lives. None of the characters fully understands the way he or she is related to others, but Marra allows us to see what they cannot: an outline of meaning that rises from their combined choices. The omniscience works here because it does not judge. The narrator isn't telling us a simple tale of right and wrong (though, of course, right and wrong are the bones it's built upon). Rather, he's broadening our field of vision in a way that lets us bear and understand what might otherwise be unbearable and incomprehensible.I don't want to provide a plot summary here; readers deserve the experience of moving—innocently? pure-heartedly? virginally? un-forewarnedly?—through the plot as it unfolds. Suffice it to say that people struggle to do their best, often falling short, and the Marra's gift to readers is letting them travel beside the characters as they make their choices. This is a book to pick up when you want a rich meal, one that will make demands of you and will return every bit as much as it demands. Read it when you have time and presence to savor and to wrestle. This isn't a book you'll use as escape, but one in which you will find yourself arriving somewhere absolutely new and necessary.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSKV03P30ENU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5MS0Z0#wasThisHelpful","RSKV03P30ENU9","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Originally, I’d meant to read Jimmy Santiago Baca’s The Lucia Poems over the Thanksgiving break, but it was only yesterday that I got a chance to settle myself into this collection of poetry, a companion volume to The Esai Poems, which I reviewed back in November. Each of these books carries the subtitle Breaking Bread with Darkness, which captures the wrestling Baca is doing in these poems: engaging in the day-to-day business of child-rearing and work (Breaking Bread) while simultaneously observing and responding to events in the world around him (Darkness).Lucia is six years younger than her brother Esai, so these poems deal with more recent events (the Gulf oil spill, the hurricane in Haiti) as well on-going events treated in the earlier book (the war on terror, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict).Again, Baca’s poetry is at its best when he balances the security and love of home with the uncertainty and danger of the broader world. He tells Lucia “I believe your laughter is the truest form of democracy/that you can spread peace through the hearts/of Haitians destroyed by the hurricane,/[...] Lucia, you know that a day in the park/petting stray dogs/is worthier than a visit to the White House/or an appearance on Oprah.”While the book can’t solve the challenges we face, it offers a way of living with them without accepting them, fighting them without being conquered by them. Whether or not you’re a parent, this is a book that, like The Esai Poems, can see you constructively through hard times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GE1930C6QRHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1890932434#wasThisHelpful","R2GE1930C6QRHP","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ned Hayes’s Sinful Folk is based upon one of those small historical events—a tantalizing mention that goes unexplained, so the lack of a full record makes it the territory of the novelist, rather than the historian.In this case, the mention was of a suspicious fire that killed five young men in 1377 and the decision by a group of folk from their village to travel over 200 miles in mid-winter to present the young men’s bodies to the King and demand justice.For us, a journey of 200 miles may seem negligible: three or four hours in a car and there you are. In the 14th Century such a journey was a truly heroic undertaking for several reasons. First, those making the journey were peasants. Not the happy, well-fed, well-clothed, folk-dancing peasants one encounters at a present-day “medieval” fair. Real, 14th Century peasants: hungry by mid-winter, unsure whether the food they’ve stored will see them through the remaining months of cold, dressed in rags, their feet wrapped in strips of cloth with a bit of leather tied to their soles for a little more protection, illiterate all of them—except the central character, Mear—blaming witches and Jews for the misfortunes that befall them, quick to fight, accustomed to sudden injury and death. These are the people traveling 200 miles, on foot, in the snow.In addition, at that time peasants needed sanction from their Lord or local Abbott if they wanted to undertake any sort of a journey. The villagers, as Mear reminds us partway through the narrative, “have no blessing or sanction from our Lord, Sir Peter, to be abroad upon the open road. This makes us vagabonds; any man may kill or injure us without consequence.” The territory they pass through is populated by people as poor, as hungry, and as desperate as they are. They can hope for no assistance and must constantly fear attack, theft, and murder.The story is told in Mear’s voice, and reading it, listening to it is a genuine pleasure. Mear isn’t the 21st Century ethos in a 14th Century body that populates too much of the fiction set in this period. Mear is a man—actually woman—of the time: educated and intelligent, but with a sense of what is possible and what is right that is shaped by his—her—era and social class.Mear, Miriam, posses as a mute man and has done so for ten years, since first arriving in the village. Over the course of the novel, we learn her life story in bits and pieces and come to understand why she’s made this choice. Mear’s story provides the primary narrative thread holding the novel together, but this novel has other narrative threads as well, including the slow process of discovering how and why the five young men died. These threads weave over and under the story of Mear’s past, creating a whole that offers both complexity and integrity.It may sound clichéd, but I truly didn’t want this novel to end. Over and over again it provokes real thought about the characters, about human values, about the limited vision of Mear’s time and of our own. It offers immediate entertainment, but is also the sort of work that will hold up to repeated readings. I would happily spend many more hours, and many more pages, in Mear’s company.*****Ned Hayes’s Sinful Folk is currently available as a Kindle download via Amazon and will be released as a paperback by Campanile Press on January 22. This is an absolutely wonderful read, so let me just note that I don’t know which is the better choice: to buy the electronic copy so you can begin it now or to wait for the print edition for the pleasure of holding a physical copy of this excellent read. I read this book as an electronic ARC, but I’m planning to pre-order it in print, so I’ll have both. And I expect I’ll be making my way through the print version more than once over the next few years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18JZACA8FRTL5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8J6ME6#wasThisHelpful","R18JZACA8FRTL5","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I’ve just finished reading through a review copy of Chandra Clarke’s Be the Change: Saving the World with Citizen Science and have to say that this little eBook is something everyone should own. It’s electronic format-only book, and not everyone I know has an eReader, but those who do are getting a copy for Christmas (sorry if that’s a spoiler for any of my dearer readers).Clarke, who also writes the blog Citizen Science Center, has a clear, lively prose voice—and she knows her subject. What she does in this book and on her blog is gather and share information on scientific projects that can genuinely use the help of ordinary non-scientists (of course, scientists can participate too).The best-known citizen science project is probably SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence), which offers a downloadable program that will enable your computer to spend time analyzing radio astronomy data to try to detect life on other planets. Similar analysis programs do everything from running docking simulations on malaria proteins to help with drug development to searching for neutron stars.But maybe you want to participate a bit more actively instead of letting your computer do all the work in its down time. Projects at this level often involve analyzing photos, films, or sound: humans, for now at least, are still more discerning viewers/listeners than are computers. You can look for evidence of cancer in tumor samples, try your hand at folding RNA, or listen to a live-feed underwater microphone and note whale songs. I’m planning to help classify sea floor ground cover and species on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute’s HabCam (or Habitat Camera).Think you don’t have time to participate in citizen science? Think again! Clarke points out that “Americans (just Americans!) watch more than 200 billion hours of television every year. If that statistic doesn’t boggle your mind, consider the online game World of Warcraft: one source suggests its 11 million players have spend as much as 5.9 million years on it… or as much time as humanity has spent evolving as a species.” Your ten or twenty minutes may not seem like much, but when enough people participate they can accomplish wonderful things.You can buy this eBook for only $2.99.

"O.K., the title might seem a bit of a stretch, but if you stop and think about what life must have been like in Henry VIII's England, fascist isn't inappropriate. Loyalty to the nation meant unquestioning loyalty to the crown. This was  ""Christian"" state in which the meaning of Christian changed regularly and was determined by the crown. Dissent was a capital offense.This is the setting for Nicola Shulman's highly engaging Graven with Diamonds, The Many Lives of Thomas Wyatt: Poet, Lover, Statesman, and Spy in the Court of Henry VIII.  Wyatt's poetry was wildly popular during his life, but has been looked on less favorably ever sense. It's sort of an obscure, but obligatory stop along the road that runs from Chaucer to Shakespeare.What Shulmam does is to look at the politics of Wyatt's time in order to understand the popularity of his poetry and to shine light on some of the less well-known aspects of his life. Anyone who reads much Tudor history will recognize Wyatt's name because he was one of the men confined to the Tower at the time of Anne Boleyn's fall—and the only one of that group to make it out alive. What fewer people know is that Wyatt went on to a career as a diplomat and, despite repeated political intrigues against him, managed that rarity (yes, yes, I'm exaggerating) for a courtier in Tudor England: a natural death.What's brilliant about Shulman's book—and it is a brilliant book—is the way Shulman combines genres in order to think about Wyatt, his times, and his work in genuinely new ways. This isn't just an individual biography, isn't just portrait of an era, isn't just a critical study of a minor poet. It's all of these and something more.In Henry VIII's fascist England ( and fascist is my term, not Shulman's) the game of courtly love was played for deadly stakes. As Shulman puts is, Wyatt ""like Mandelstam or Akhmatova, was a poet writing under tyranny."" To be a success at court, one needed to master courtly love, while at the same time never engaging in behavior that might come back to be used against one. Anne Boleyn and the men she flirted with, but most likely did not have sex with, learned this lesson the hard way. What was an enjoyable intellectual and emotional play-acting could become deadly real as the mood of the King, and therefore the mood of the time and law, shifted.This situation—the need for language that was vividly emotional, but topically ambiguous—was ideal for a poet like Wyatt. As Shulman shows us repeatedly, not only could any one of his poems serve as a window into more than one event in his life, his poems could also serve as windows into the lives of others and were used in this way. Wyatt's poems were copied out by hand, passed among courtiers, used as occasional pieces, with minor modifications as needed. That interpretive plasticity is what made Wyatt so popular. Whatever a courtier was feeling, there was a Wyatt poem that covered it.One of Shulman's central claims is that Henry's court was so dangerous because Henry himself took love so seriously. Others played at courtly gestures; Henry lived them. This meant that when one of his wives fell from grace, all those around her were at risk as well because they all had, as courtiers did at the time, engaged in badinage that suddenly could be taken literally.For those inclined to explore the sort of musings Shulman offers, this book is a delight throughout. It enables one to imagine life under Henry in a way that standard histories do not. If you currently think of Wyatt as an unimportant figure or his poetry as inconsequential, you'll have reconsidered that thinking by the end of the book.This book is a delight not just because of its intelligence, but also because of Shulman's knack for finding slightly whimsical, but perfectly apt, ways of describing people and situations. Catherine of Aragon had ""a little pointed chin like a lemon."" She characterizes the continental linguists of the era as perceiving ""English in its current state... [as] a shaggy and hopalong means of expression."" At one point, in a comparison I find more entertaining than accurate, Shulman depicts Henry as ""sincere in all his doings. If he were alive today, he'd be Canadian."" In other words, reading this book isn't just interesting, it's fun.*****In the interests of full disclosure, I will acknowledge that I received an electronic review copy of this book, but I don't think that influenced my evaluation of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L4KT3LXK6Q1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009MYA3KM#wasThisHelpful","R3L4KT3LXK6Q1J","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like much of the world, I followed the discovery of the remains of Richard III with great interest. I read a fair bit of Tudor biography so, as the King whose fall led to the Tudor triumph, Richard is a compelling character—particularly when one adds in the long-fought battle over his depravity and/or virtue.I’ve just finished the first book-length work on this archaeological project, The King’s Grave, authored by Philippa Langley and Michael Jones. Langley, chair of the Richard III Society, coordinated the dig after a “revelation” of sorts convinced her that she had identified the location of Richard’s burial. She is not an archaeologist herself, but pulled together a fine team of experts for the project. Michael Jones is the author of a key pro-Richardian history, which provided much of Langley’s initial inspiration. (While the two are co-authors, I will often refer to Langley as author in the course of this review because much of the book is written in her voice.)For centuries, Richard’s story has been carried along on two very different tracks. After Richard’s defeat and Henry VII’s rise to power, any number of scholars were eager to ingratiate themselves with the new king by writing biographies denigrating Richard. As a result of this historical bandwagon, Langley and Jones tell us, “By the time of Shakespeare this propaganda had reached its zenith. Richard had now become a crouching hunchback, whose bent and distorted body mirrored the hideous depravity of his crimes. By then, the king’s actual body, buried hastily in Leicester after the Battle of Bosworth, had disappeared from view.”Langley is among those who are convinced the portrait of Richard as murderer and usurper is false and who dedicate their research to furthering a more generous view of the man as honorable, a good king known particularly for his sense of justice. From the beginning, her Looking for Richard project is as much tribute as scientific/historical research. Her original proposals for the dig also included plans for a new tomb and monument in Richard’s honor.Well before Richard’s body disappeared from view, the bodies of his two nephews, the heirs of Edward IV, Richard’s elder brother, had disappeared. Originally Richard was part of a regency council to rule in the name of the young Edward V until he reached his majority, but quickly Richard became sole regent, then went on to rule as king after the princes were—murdered on his orders? victims of unfortunate, but natural, deaths? By the end of the book, Langley proposes a rereading of Richard as patriot, rather than murderer: “Richard transferred his loyalty, duty, and service to the kingdom since he could not commit his allegiance to Edward’s illegitimate sons.” This seems somewhat disingenuous given that Richard was a player in the process by which the princes were illigitimatized.Langley isn’t entirely uncritical of Richard, but she sums up her still-partisan goal early on: “To bring [Richard] back to life we do not need to try to replace a villain with a saint; rather, we need to understand better the bravery and self-belief of the line of horsemen who charged across the battlefield to meet their foe, and the astonishing courage of the king who led that charge.”The book proceeds in chapters that alternate the story of Richard’s life with the story of the dig that uncovered his remains, a move which breaks the continuity of both narratives. The chapters on Richard’s life are quite interesting at times, particularly when Langley and Jones provide close readings of the historical record, discussing the different ways that key documents and actions can be understood. At other times, the historical narrative feels a bit speculative, which has the effect of undermining the attempt at objectivity in the chapters focused on the dig.Chapter nine is the best of the chapters focused on the dig and analysis of the remains. It offers summaries of the many kinds of methods that were used to identify Richard’s remains: carbon 14 dating, osteology, forensic analysis of perimortem wounds, and facial reconstruction. Chapter eleven, on the other hand, makes one wonder at Langley’s judgement as coordinator of the dig as she recounts further attempts at “scientific” analysis that include handwriting analysis and work by a psychological profiler.I acknowledge that I lack the scholarly expertise to determine which portrayal of Richard—the wise ruler or the scheming murderer—is more accurate and certainly Langley has more expertise than me, but at times I found myself distrusting her because of her determinatin to find what she’s already decided should exist.For now, this book is a good initial read on the finding of Richard’s grave and his reign, but I don’t think it’s the definitive work on the topic. It may be that a definitive read on what are essentially two topics just isn’t possible. Nonetheless I find myself hoping that more and better books will follow this one.*****Note: The discovery of Richard’s remains has launched a complicated legal struggle over the issue of where they will be reburied. Langley and Jones’ book ends on the assumption that the story has ended—but the final ending is still being contested.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DN76AMKR2649/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQY9FDG#wasThisHelpful","R3DN76AMKR2649","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jimmy Santiago Baca has been saved by the word. And by word, I don’t mean the Bible; I mean the written word. He learned to read and write while in prison and since then has become a fierce, courageous presence on the American literary scene. He’s won honors like the Pushcart Prize and the American Book Award—honors that are well-deserved and that, thankfully, have not diluted the character of his work. He writes to call out injustice, to wrestle with ideas, to balance the horror and hope present in our day-to-day lives.I’m in the process of reading two of his collections of poetry, each written for one of his children: The Esai Poems and The Lucia Poems. At the moment, I’ve just finished The Esai Poems. I’m holding off on The Lucia Poems until tomorrow morning, when I can take advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday and let myself spend several hours sinking into his words.In her introduction to this collection Carolyn Forché tells us that “Jimmy Santiago Baca gives us the secret and present—and yes, dangerous—reality at the heart of our democracy.” What makes The Esai Poems so remarkable is the way they balance his rage and marvel: rage at the daily loss of human potential through war, imprisonment, indifference and marvel at the infinite miracles, both physical and spiritual, that mark the life of his son, Esai.Let me start by giving you a taste of his sense of marvel. In the poem “Prolougue” that opens this collection he describes his son in phrases that are Whitmanesque: “let your beautiful feet rush through the/grass as if each/blade of grass/were a harp string/and you were falling from string to string, a/tiny little fellow/reduced to the size of a lizard,/and my goodness, play the songs of giants my son.”Looking at his son, he celebrates “the festive possibilities of all earthly infants/from Jesus, Dalai Lama, Mother Teresa, Buddha, to Essai/star at the tip of the tree of life.” He shows us the divine in the ordinary, the ordinary in divine.Despite the inherent marvel of human life, Santiago Baca sees life as a battle, with the marginalized struggling to survive while those who have cling tightly to their wealth and focus on generating more. He describes his infant son’s “tiny hands/that will have to fight for dignity;/ claw through and dig up/struggling your way to peace/bloody knuckled, scratched and cut.” In a later peom, he return to this theme of the struggle for survival that even children face: “much of what I write—/the poems, that is—are stones/I litter the dusty roads with/so kids can pick them up readily/to throw at tanks.” The written word has saved Santiago Baca. He continues to craft it in hopes of helping other survive.Santiago Baca the father is also Santiago Baca the activist (though “activist” seems inadequate to describe all he does), who tells his son “your steps are acts of love against cruise missiles/your open arms as you rush headlong to me,/acts of love against bigots who would label protesters/terrorists.”It’s this dual vision that makes his poems so compelling. Santiago Baca describes the incongruencies of our lives in ways that enable us to see them more sharply. Working our way through his poems, I found myself nodding, yes, and yes again, feeling deeply grateful that he could give voice to issues I’ve so often wrestled without without achieving any sort of satisfactory resolution.Read Santiago Baca. Read him once. Read him again. Let his poems help open your eyes to both beauty and horror. At this time of year when we remind ourselves to give thanks, let him help you keep in mind the things we might someday be thankful for if we demand a fairer, more loving world.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L34202SAE5TE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FVCVEIE#wasThisHelpful","R2L34202SAE5TE","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ascoli was a young, half-Jewish woman who was deported first to Birkenau (a women's camp inside Auschwitz), then moved to Bergen-Belsen near the end of WWII. In her author's note, she explains her purpose in bearing witness: ""[T]oday, before the last survivors pass away and a veil of forgetfulness descends over the Nazi death camps and the genocide of the Jewish people. I... feel a sense of duty to contribute my testimony.""  At the same time she notes that she ""deliberately left out many facts so [the] story will not become oppressively bleak for readers."" This reticence, which might at first seem a failing, is one of the great strengths of this book. Ascoli's spare prose makes her story much more moving than a more ""dramatic"" account might. She lets the events speak for themselves, and they do speak--loudly and disturbingly.The camps themselves were designed to maximize the suffering of those interned there. For example, ""There were no roads, just tracks, and one had to walk everywhere through mud""; slave labor and starvation rations weren't enough, these we augmented by energy-draining slogs across the camp to the locations where the labor was performed. Prisoners were repeatedly ""sorted""  via a process with no apparent logic--at any moment, they might be counted off and every third or every fourth prisoner would be sent to the crematoria. To make the process even more inhumane, the women were often stripped at the beginning of this process.In some Holocaust narratives, a few individual prisoners manage to retain their humanity, but this was not Ascoli's experience: ""In the camp I met all kinds of people, from intellectuals to farmers and factory workers. Without exception, they all had become dehumanized through their suffering and grown selfish in their struggle for survival. Despite the huge number of people in our camp, each of us carried our cross alone.... the only thing that would matter anymore was your own existence, which--despite the tragedy of it all--was all you had left and might soon come to an end."" I don't point this out to suggest that Ascoli is in any way a lesser person than the writers of those other narratives, but rather to argue that her honesty about her own loss of humanity requires significant courage. She doesn't turn herself into a heroine, doesn't claim she had some resilience others lacked.Reading Ascoli's narrative is a difficult experience that calls into question any beliefs one might have about the essentially good nature of human beings. The guards inside the camps, the citizens living outside the camps or along the rail lines that take prisoners to the camps at best observe the suffering with equanimity--and many of them take great pleasure in it. This willing participation in (or at least indifference to) genocide is a reminder of how carefully each of us needs to protect whatever spark of decency and love lies within us. Ascoli's narratve suggests that participation in brutality is all too easy to become accustomed to.So why read this book?Because it offers us a truth. Because it forces us to live with the memory of the worst our species had done. Because it keeps us from thinking ""I would never...."" We mourn as we read this book, but it can also strengthen us in our own resolve to be the best people we can be, to have the courage to say ""no"" to abuses of authority. I can't overemphasize the value of this book--you will come away shaken, but also strengthened by bearing withness to Ascoli's experiences.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZSY2LKHGSH1W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FWDDK9S#wasThisHelpful","R1ZSY2LKHGSH1W","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Doherty’s book is written for popular audiences (at least those patient enough to wade through a number of technical passages) and he’s open about his purpose from the start: he wants his readers to become “citizen scientists” who “contribute [to science] by helping collect key data on, for example, what’s happening to the birds, to the butterflies, or to the life forms that live in or on the banks of our rivers and streams.”Doherty gives us two pressing reasons to “enlist” as citizen scientists. First, many diseases originating in birds can be threatening, even deadly, for us—think of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Catching a new virus before it develops human-to-human transmission, is crucial to launching a successful attack against it: “Data from the CDC [Centers for Disease Control], which tracks ‘seasonal’ epidemics in the USA, show the [flu] virus traveling to every state in the space of 4-6 weeks. Contrast that with the four years it took West Nile Virus to get from New York to California using a bird-mosquito infection cycle.” That’s the difference between a virus spread by sneezing and one spread by mosquito bites.Second, birds can show us the current impact of climate change through changes in population size and ranges. Yes, Doherty—like pretty much every scientist I know—not only acknowledges climate change, but is appalled by our inability to respond with force and commitment to the threat it presents. In his estimation, we come off as something less than the dinosaurs killed by an earlier period of climate change: “While our willful behavior may ultimately ensure our elimination, and that of many other life forms, there is no way that the big dinosaurs could have deliberately contributed to their own extinction. Consciousness, reason, callous greed, deliberate ignorance and true malevolence are very much unique to Homo sapiens sapiens.”So what does Doherty want us to do? He wants us to participate in programs like the Audubon Society Christmas Bird Counts and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s Project Feeder Watch. “Indications that a population is at risk are most likely to come from the careful, systematic counts made by birdwatchers and amateur ornithologists [who] participate in [programs like Audubon's] Backyard Bird Count Program. You don’t even need to leave your own property to be part of this study.”And if this work sounds unimportant or dry, think again: “While our birder ‘citizen scientists’ might be more like the passionate amateurs of the French Resistance of WWII than paid members of the contemporary US National Guard, American democracy is characterized by volunteerism and broad, public involvement. Being an unpaid ‘birding James Bond’ might appeal to some though, but rather than a Walther PPK or a Beretta, the weapons of choice for our ‘bird spies’ will be leg bands, and binoculars made by Zeiss, Swarowski or Leica.” Forget your stereotypes of little old lady birders; you’re working for national defense.While it might be easy to laugh at the call to arms, or rather call to field glasses, Doherty’s point is crucial. In the face of threats to our health and our planet, we can take action, we can make a difference, even if we are neither particularly powerful nor particularly wealthy.  Doherty shows us what birders can do. We need a whole series of such manuals to help inspire other communities as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIX46P2PN6MS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPLKD76#wasThisHelpful","RIX46P2PN6MS0","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I move between history and historical fiction frequently in my reading, which leads me to think about the difference between the two. Obviously, history is history and fiction is fiction—but the two aren’t so neatly separate. Good writers of history (at least of history for popular audiences) work to achieve the flow and engagement we associate with novels, and good historical novelists research carefully to get their facts straight.Reading history can be like pondering a map: we see the outline of a land, its topography, the most prominent structures and features. Reading historical fiction is, at its best, like time travel: we don’t necessarily get the big picture, but we perceive one small part of that picture vividly and even, at the best of times, feel that we’re experiencing it for ourselves.I’ve just finished with Sisters of the Bruce, 1292-1314, by the Australian author of Scots descent J. M. Harvey. My knowledge of Scots history is very limited, so I pretty much had to approach this book in isolation; I didn’t have a preexisting understanding of the tumultuous time period in which it’s set. I’ve read a bit about the two English kings Edward, who fought the Scots around the turn of the 14th Century, but that’s left me able to recognize the occasional name and little else.In the preface, Harvey tells us “In this fictional narrative, the five sisters of Robert the Bruce speak to us from the past. Their remarkable story deserves to be told, so that they might no longer be ‘unwept, unhonour’d and unsung’—to borrow a line from Sir Walter Scott. The Bruce, Robert the Bruce, was a legendary king of Scotland, devoted to uniting the warring clans and ridding the country of the English.  His five sisters (and their sisters-in-law, children, and nieces) are, indeed a remarkable bunch. Isabel (Isa), the eldest, marries the King of Norway and watches the lives of her siblings—when information is available—from afar. The next two sisters, Christina (Kirsty) and Mary are captured by the English, along with a sister-in-law and a niece. Christina is “caged” within a convent; Mary is literally caged, hanging in a wood and metal pen in the open air above an English castle. The younger two sisters, Mathilde and Margaret, evade capture; filling in a gap in the historical record, Harvey imagines them as fugitives in Orkney.One can understand why Harvey was eager to write this book. And, having read the jacket synopsis, I was certainly eager to read it. My feelings now, as I’ve finished it, are mixed—contradictory enough that I want to deal with them as individual bullet points, rather than trying to sort through them all at once.• These are interesting women. I’m delighted to have had them brought to my attention and expect they’ll continue to live in my imagination for some time.• Harvey is scrupulous constructing and maintaining her timeline so, as long as you read the afterward and sort fact from fiction, you can leave with a fairly clear outline of this period of history as seen from the Bruce perspective.• The novel reminds us—we seem always to need reminding—of what a barbarous, messy business war is and of the brunt of the suffering borne by civilians: the Scots peasants face misery regardless of who has the nominally stronger hold on the land. English invaders murder, rape, and pillage; Scots defenders burn crops and destroy villages to keep them out of the hands of the English.• The book has occasional moments of real beauty. For example, in her first letter to Kirsty, Isa writes of her leave-taking and journey to Norway: “For an unusually long time, sea creatures followed our vessel and I could not keep my eyes from their sleek forms and gentle eyes. I hoped they might travel back to you and whisper in their strange tongues that all was well; that these things shall indeed pass.”• Unfortunately the prose style here is—I was going to say “uneven,” but actually the problem is that the prose style is too even. The above sample is a rarity. Most of the parts of the book written as correspondence among the sisters, sound dully identical. Isa’s letters to Kirsty and Kirsty’s letters to Isa are interchangeable, except for the geographic references.• The omniscient narrator who directs other sections of the book has a voice like a history textbook—dry and all-seeing, taking the life out of what should be vivid events. Early on in the novel, the narrator tells us “It is as well that foresight is denied mere mortals. Had they [the books' characters] known what terrible price they would have to pay to achieve their goal [of a united, independent Scotland], their steps may have faltered and turned from such a perilous path; their actions would ultimately fracture their beloved family and the country they so revered.” This doesn’t build suspense, as perhaps it was intended. It flattens the narrative.• At times, the writer seems to abandon sense in order to ride the flow of a phrase she’s begun. As Mary festers both figuratively and literally in her cage, we’re told, “When some of the older folk no longer wandered by, [Mary] presumed illness or death had overtaken them. Such benign thoughts helped to fill the long hours.” Illness and death, benign? I don’t think so, not even in comparison with Mary’s miserable state.I found the historical thread running through this novel fascinating, but as a reader I was less than fascinated. Harvey writes fiction as though it were textbook history, drying it out and rendering its varied terrain to a single level of flatness. I appreciate Harvey introducing me to these remarkable women, but I’m still waiting for a novel that will capture their lives vividly.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR7GNV32WVYAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FK2872G#wasThisHelpful","RR7GNV32WVYAR","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes I want something that’s truly interesting to read, but that doesn’t require a multi-day or multi-week commitment. When that urge hits, few titles work as well as books from the “The Best American” series. No doubt you’ve seen them; they pop up in bookstores every October and cover almost every topic imaginable—from infographics to comics to travel writing.My personal favorite is The Best American Science and Nature Writing. For one thing, the publisher, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, always lands the best editors. I sometimes wonder what might be on the reading list of some of my favorite authors. Well, this series answers that question. The 2000 collection was selected by David Quammen, author of The Song of the Dodo (on biodiversity and extinction, among other topics) and of Spillover (on the spread of animal diseases to humans). Other editors of past volumes have included Brian Greene, Natalie Angier, and Freeman Dyson.This 2013 editor is Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of the 2010 best-seller The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer. What a great group of pieces he’s gathered. Authors in the collection include David Owen, Alan Lightman, Oliver Sacks, and Elizabeth Kolbert. Topics range from microbiology to cosmology. And, yes, I’m pretty convinced these pieces are “The Best.” Let me tell you a bit about three of my favorites just to illustrate.Sylvia A. Earle‘s “The Sweet Spot in Time” is a call for us to recognize our historical moment as crucial to the survival of healthy oceans. Her data-rich essay offers fact after fact about what we’re failing to do (and about some of the things we’re doing right) to protect the 2/3 of our planet covered by water. One of the topics she raises is EEZs (Exclusive Economic Zones), the offshore territory that a nation claims as its own. How many here in the U.S. knew that “[t]he landmass of the United States covers more than 3.5 million square miles, but the EEZ embraces more than 7 million, the largest square mileage of any nation, essentially double the size of our country”? Those 7 million square miles represent both great wealth and great responsibility. Along the way, she also discusses her role as a ground-breaking female scientist and traces historical perspectives on the nature of the oceans. If you went to grade school in the late 60s as I did, you probably remember the the-oceans-are-so-big-they’ll-feed-all-of-us-forever zeitgeist of that era. Well, no. Earle shows us why that’s not true and illustrates the swiftening pace of our losses.Michelle Nijhuis also focuses on threats of extinction in “Which Species Will Live?” Yes, the title means what it implies. Right now different constituencies—scientists, governments, environmentalists—are deciding which species we can/should save and which to abandon. Do we save the attention-getting, “sexy” species? The rarest? Those that underpin entire ecosystems? Those who come out on top triage-style as least likely to be doomed? Further complicating this already heart-breaking and obscene decision-making process are complications we’ve created. Nijhuis tells us: “Protected areas and parks, however, can be difficult to establish and police, and because climate change is already shifting species ranges, static boundaries may not offer the best protection for some species.”One last piece worth specific mention is Gareth Cook‘s “Autism, Inc.” Before I began reading, I expected some sort of exposé on quack cures for autism or the ways big business is profiting from rising autism rates. Well, the second guess was somewhat close, but not at all in the way I’d expected. Cook profiles a Danish company, Specialisterne (trans: the specialists), that hires autistic individuals with certain profiles to do intellectually repetitive, but challenging work requiring a level of focus most of us are incapable of. Thorkil Sonne, founder of the business and father of an autistic son has received international awards for entrepreneurship and is opening up new company offices in a number of countries, including the U.S. The kind of work Specialisterne focuses on can only be done by a small proportion of autistic individuals—but for those individuals, this work offers high pay, respect, and stability.So, if this cluster of previews has whet your appetite, pick up a copy and read more. Even if you never knew you liked science writing, I feel comfortable promising that The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2013 will contain pieces you’ll find deeply engaging.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7CG8L5DPYLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B0SCFC2#wasThisHelpful","R1R7CG8L5DPYLR","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a child (circa 1970) my entire family spent weeks watching the BBC series The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth. That marked the beginning of my interest in Tudor history.When a new popular book on one of the Tudor monarchs comes out, I'm always eager to read it, to see how it confirms or challenges the understanding I have of Tudor history based on my previous reading. So, I was delighted to be offered an electronic review copy of Leandra De Lisle's Tudor: The Family Story, just published earlier this month. This is the first book I've read that focuses on the entire family, instead of just one or a few individuals, and it's added a great deal to my understanding of the era.De Lisle is a historian who's a relatively new arrival on the scene (her first full-length work was published in 2005)--and a prolific one, given that Tudor is her third title in the seven years since then. The 2005 volume was a study of the transition from Elizabeth I to James I and VI. The 2008 volume looked at the Grey sisters, the eldest of whom had a brief reign as Queen Jane during the interval between the death of Edward VI and Mary Tudor's rise to power. In other words, she's focused on some very interesting transitional moments in addition to the lives of the monarchs themselves.Given this focus on transitions of power, Tudor is an engaging read, whether you've been reading Tudor history for years or are looking for a first book on the subject. De Lisle's prose is crisp; she piles up detail without ever becoming tedious. I particularly appreciate the clarity with which she treats her sources--she takes time to explain her interpretation of key documents, and she's also done some digging to locate documents not used in previous biographies of members of this family.Tudor offers a blend of continuity and revelation. The continuity helps readers see the period as a series of related historical events, rather than as individual reigns in isolation from one another. The revelations are many (at least if I didn't forget a great deal of my Tudor history just prior to reading this book) and well-explained.One example of these revelations is her discussion of the deaths of the two princes in the tower that preceded the rise of Richard III. She asks, as many have, why Richard didn't firmly acknowledge the prince's deaths, putting to an end the possibility of uprisings led by pretenders. She also asks (a question that to the best of my knowledge is a fresher one) why Henry VII didn't search for the prince's bodies after his ascension. After all, proving Richard a regicide would seen an appropriate move to strengthen Henry's claim that he served by moral, as well as military, authority. De Lisle's answer to both these questions draws on the instability of these two reigns and the popularity of pilgrimage in still-Catholic England. Both Richard III and Henry VII were threatened by the growing cult of and movement to canonize Henry VI: the last thing they needed was a new, more-threatening religious movement viewing the princes as innocent martyrs whose deaths could unite citizens in opposition to either regime. She reminds us of the gathered throngs after Princess Diana's death, suggesting a similar response were the prince's deaths to be publicized. That's the sort of new, interesting thinking this book is full of.I also appreciated de Lisle's commentary at the end of the book, offering analogies like the above one between events in the Tudor period and our own. She compares the political villification of Catholicism in Protestant England with the west's current villification of Islam. She reminds us of the biases created by our own popular culture: Elizabeth is played by Cate Blanchett, Mary Tudor by Kathy Burke.If you want an interesting historical read that does more than rehash earlier work and that surprises with its reflections on the past and out own time, I absolutely recommend de Lisle's Tudors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R146UES9WHWQLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E257TBW#wasThisHelpful","R146UES9WHWQLA","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, I’ve jumped into the middle of a mystery series—this time the Oscar Wilde mysteries by Gyles Brandreth. I requested (and received) a review copy of the sixth book in the series, Oscar Wilde and the Murders at Reading Goal. I figured Oscar Wilde, mystery novel, free ebook—that’s a chance worth taking. And I was right.This book is largely set in (no surprise) Reading Goal, where Wilde spent the majority of his two-year sentence for gross indecency. (There’s a whole back story here that deserves study from biographical, legal, and cultural perspectives, but I’m not going to go into that here; just know that if you poke about on the internet or in a library there’s lots to learn.) The pace is slow. The clues, which often aren’t immediately recognizable as clues, are dealt out sparingly. The beginning, end, and a central interval are set in Dieppe, France, after Wilde has been released and where he is recounting the story of his imprisonment to an unknown man who’s offered to write the story up for publication and split the profits.Because Wilde’s prison life is monotonous (both as lived and in the later retelling), one needs to be prepared for a somewhat turgid pace. (Note that I don’t mean “turgid” in a bad way; it’s just the best word I could come up with in terms of denotation, even though it’s not quite right in terms of connotation.) This novel isn’t a cliff-hanger that ends each chapter leaving the reader desperate to begin the next. Once one adjusts to the pace, this is an ideal book for end-of-day reading: engaging, but not over-stimulating, something that will allow you to enjoy settling in for the evening without tempting you to sacrifice sleep in order to keep reading.I prepped for reading this book as I often do by searching for on-line reviews, both professional and amateur. Most of the reviews agreed on a few points:• the murders are secondary to the central story• the central story is, in fact, a tale of Wilde’s emotional and ethical maturation that results from his imprisonment.I have to say I disagree.I approached this book anticipating a character study, but found myself reading—as the cover promised and as most reviewers denied—a mystery novel. Yes, Wilde reflects a bit on his life during his time in goal, and he is somewhat changed. But the material of real interest starts about two-thirds of the way through as one begins to see the puzzle that’s being presented, but can’t yet begin to predict its answer. The mystery is presented with subtlety, but mystery it is, and as far as I’m concerned the mystery is the heart of the book.I’m not going to say more about the plot here because I think this book is best approached “chastely,” without the bump-and-grind or quick feel provided by spoilers and near spoilers. There is, however, one last topic I’d like to remark on, and that’s the pleasure of reading a book peopled in part by writers whose work I appreciate. Wilde is the only author who is present as a character in the book, but Wilde’s friend Arthur Conan Doyle is an on-going presence. Wilde knows Conan Doyle’s work and identifies with Holmes with the same sort of smug self-confidence typical of Holmes himself. I enjoyed the amalgam created by this blending of bon mot and great detective. I’m eager now to read earlier books in the series in which Conan Doyle appears as a character. (And Bram Stoker appears in the second volume in the series—bonus!)If you have the patience—or the need—to move slowly and take pleasure in thinking about the ways writers’ mind operate, I expect you’ll enjoy this series as much as I enjoyed the one volume I’ve read thus far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29A7H1B4PDSHP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J4B4AY#wasThisHelpful","R29A7H1B4PDSHP","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My wife and I have what we call the ""essentials"" shelf. Right now, it's not an actual shelf, but the books themselves are real. What makes a book an essential is not just the fact that it's  good read--it has to be the sort of read that is rich enough to invite rereading, that promises to keep providing moments of surprise and insight even as it become familiar. We often get our books in paperback or electronic copies, but once we've decided a book is an essential, we pick up a hard-cover copy. We feel comforted knowing that we own a copy of the book that is ready to stand up to the years of revisiting we intend to spend on it.One of the essentials I discovered this year is Lee Smith's Fair and Tender Ladies. This book opens with a one-way correspondence from Ivy Rowe, a young girl growing up in Appalachia, to her unresponsive Dutch pen-pal, Hanneke. From the start Ivy's voice rings true and spills out across the page in an engaging  jumble of observations and reflection:""My dear Hanneke,""Your name is not much common here, I think it is so pretty too. I say it now and agin it tastes sweet on my mouth like honey or cane or how I picture the fotched-on candy from Mrs Browns book about France, candy wich mimicks roses. Have you seed any such as this? I have not. I have seed them in her red book that is all.""In her next letter to Hanneke, Ivy announces ""I want to be a famous writer when I grow up, I will write of Love,"" and despite her circumstances, we already feel as if this might be possible, given Ivy's voice and force of personality.And a bit further along, as Ivy rants at her unresponsive pen-pal, we can't help but both laugh at and admire her change in tone and her angry re-imagining of both Hanneke and the Dutch countryside where Hanneke lives: ""I hate you, you do not write back nor be my pen friend I think you are the Ice Queen instead.... I know you are so rich with all your lace and those fine big cows. I know you have plenty to eat.... I hope that the sea will come in the hole in the dike and will flood you out and you will drown. I will not send this letter as I remane your hateful, Ivy Rowe.""From the moment Ivy turned on Hanneke, I knew I wanted to spend time with Ivy--a book's worth of time. I wanted to see what sort of woman this feisty girl would grow up into; I wanted to watch her take on the world. I wanted to be around when she became that famous writer, writing of Love.Ironically--spoiler alert!--Ivy never leaves the mountain community of her birth, but her life is remarkable nonetheless.Given the pleasure my time with Ivy brought me, I'd been waiting eagerly for Smith's latest book, Guests on Earth. In this novel, as in Fair and Tender Ladies, we first meet the narrator, Evalina Toussaint, as a girl. Evalina, the soon-to-be-orphaned daughter of a New Orleans exotic dancer, is an altogether different creature than Ivy: unsure of herself, carried along life's eddies and unwilling to chart a path for herself. She does gain the opportunity to attend music college--but recognizes that she's happier as an accompanist, using her playing to highlight the accomplishments of others. While both girls are highly observant, Ivy charges into the world, while Evalina watches it from a remove.Evalina spends much of her life in and out of Highland Mental Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina--the hospital in which Zelda Fitzgerald spent much of her adult life and where she died in a fire, trapped in a locked ward. So this isn't just a novel about Evalina; it's a novel about Zelda and Highland's other residents and staff as well. Evalina half watches, half participates in their lives, accompanying them as much as traveling on her own journey.I've been interested in Zelda's life story since I read Tennessee William's play Clothes for a Summer Hotel--one of his last works and one that features Zelda Fitzgerald. Guests on Earth doesn't focus on Zelda nearly as much as the jacket blurb suggests it will, but it turns out that's not a problem. Zelda comes across as a talented woman, as much conceited as self-confident, and given to sudden bursts of unkindness. Evalina is a pale character beside her, but she's nonetheless a much more interesting character.Reading Guests on Earth, I had an experience I don't recall having had before with a novel: there were moments when I forgot I was reading fiction. Yes, I've been lost in the worlds created within novels any number of times, and the characters of my favorite novels feel utterly real to me--but Evalina's story made me forget I was reading a story. I kept slipping into a different sort of consciousness, one that I can't define well, but that I know I experience when reading memoir or biography, not fiction.I'm not quite certain yet whether I'll be buying a hardback copy of Guests on Earth for the essentials shelf, but I do know it is a remarkable book with a subtle magic that has nothing to do with the occasional, fiery presence of Zelda Fitzgerald. Read it. Read Guests on Earth. Read Fair and Tender Ladies. Spend some time with Ivy and with Evalina.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TNSKGYLDA3J5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CL08LKS#wasThisHelpful","R3TNSKGYLDA3J5","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the odder books I've read recently is Howard Anderson's Albert of Adelaide. The cover image of the platypus makes it easy for one to expect a heart-warming animal tale along the lines of The Wind in the Willows, but that impression doesn't last long. Albert--he's the platypus--has escaped from the Adelaide zoo to search for ""Old Australia,"" a human-free promised land of sorts, dreamed about by the creatures in the zoo. He's tired of his daily routine: wake, get shoved out into his viewing area, get fed, crawl back into the burrow at night. He's also haunted by the memory of his mother's death defending him from a dog when he was just a pup (a pup? a kit? a platypette?).When we join Albert, he's wandering lost and on the verge of heat stroke through the Australian desert. The book quickly moves into a sort of hallucinatory western, ""peopled"" with kangaroos (most of them gun-carrying), a pyromaniac wombat, a pair of gay bandicoots, and a raccoon who landed down under after a panicked flight from the docks of San Francisco on a ghost ship. There are also dingoes. And a badly scarred, formerly prize-fighting Tasmanian devil.I don't watch westerns. I don't read them. But one way or another, this book kept me going. Partly, I just wanted to see what craziness would happen next; partly, I really did start to grow fond of the blood-thirsty little marsupials. When you need a little something unexpected, you may want to pick this volume up. Just bear in mind that you'll be reading the equivalent of a collection of just-so stories penned by Hunter S. Thompson.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G1OQNS5YX6WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006QBKGTW#wasThisHelpful","R3G1OQNS5YX6WX","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"White Room, Yellow WallpaperI've just finished reading Stephanie Carroll's A White Room, a novel set in the first decade of the 20th Century. As my title suggests, one of the inspirations for the book was Charlotte Perkins Gillman's The Yellow Wallpaper, a novella that I've read again and again and that I've encountered in completely different ways, depending upon my age, my mood, and the topics I'm most enjoying or most wrestling with in my own life.My first encounter with The Yellow Wallpaper occurred when I was in junior high and found it in an anthology of horror stories. The story in brief as I understood it then--creepy house, the creepiness of which only the female protagonist is aware; she knew the house was trying to drive her mad, no one believed her, and the house won. The story was particularly disturbing because it hinted that this woman was not the first the house had destroyed.I confess that when I was in junior high, photocopiers were a new technology and I had not yet figured out that one could go to a bookstore and ask that a particular title be special ordered. But I wanted, needed a copy of The Yellow Wallpaper because I relished its menace, the way the reader becomes isolated along with the protagonist as she sees her own doom while those around her deny it. So, I copied it. By hand on binder paper.In college, when I was coming out, I read The Yellow Wallpaper as a novel about the inherent inequality in relationships between men and women--the heroine goes mad because her husband refuses to take her seriously, insists on his perception of the situation being the accurate perception, an insistence that ultimately comes at the price of his wife's sanity.More recently, I've read it as a historical piece, a documentation of the specific ways in which women were treated/tormented by the medical profession in the early 20th Century--the protagonist has the time to dwell on the house (particularly the wallpaper of the title) because she's perceived as being in fragile health and is condemned to a ""rest cure"" (endless days in bed, no reading, writing or stimulation of any kind allowed) that drives her mad. This reading is, I believe, closest to Charlotte Perkins Gillman's original purpose. She wrote The Yellow Wallpaper as a work of social criticism. The rest cure was standard medical practice at the time she was writing, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman was subjected to a rest cure herself with devastating results, so she wrote to depict the rest cure in a way so horrifying that the medical profession would be forced to abandon it.All of this is a long preamble to my consideration of A White Room, which, given its inspiration, I can't help but compare to The Yellow Wallpaper. A White Room initially feels like a slower, expanded remake of The Yellow Wallpaper--a woman is forced into a marriage in which she feels unloved and disrespected and in which her sense of self slowly deteriorates until she is hallucinating, imagining the house in which she lives is attempting to destroy her.If this were all A White Room did, I would probably be telling prospective readers something along the lines of ""don't bother; stick with the original."" But Carroll is trying to do something different than Perkins Gillman did. Her protagonist descends into madness, but also finds a way out again. At this point, I don't want to offer more summary; I don't want this essay to be a ""spoiler."" I just want to say that I enjoyed Carroll's imagining of a positive alternative for a woman of that time.The book is uneven. The pace in the first half is slow, slow, slow, while the second half races along in a ""this happened, then this happened, then this happened"" fashion. It contains far too many descriptions of the protagonist's clothing, most of which don't contribute purposefully to the story. The characters are unevenly developed, so, while we can understand the perspectives and motivations of some, others, particularly the ""villains,"" are drawn with much less nuance. At times, the phrasing and word choice felt decidedly un-1900-ish--though I can't claim expertise in this area, so it may simply be that the book didn't meet my preconceived notions.But despite these weaknesses, A White Room is still most definitely worth a read. It attempts to solve a problem, not just depict it, which is challenging work, indeed. It leads one to some very worthwhile consideration of the quality of women's lives, the impact of class divisions, and the practice of medicine in the early 20th Century. So, instead of saying ""stick with the original,"" I'd say to give it a go. Don't expect perfection, but do expect intellectual engagement and a worthwhile use of several hours of your time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13GRKBX9RZB4Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CY6GKU2#wasThisHelpful","R13GRKBX9RZB4Q","A2R3699K4D8I0T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2R3699K4D8I0T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It can be purchased in three volumes (the way I'm reading it), in a single volume, or as individual installments of the serial.

Unlike the first volume, which moves back and forth among characters, this one covers three central characters and tells their stories one at a time, which really lets a reader settle in and see the world from that character's point of view.This volume is a bit more action-driven than the first, but still contains the ethical wrestling that makes it compelling.

"This my 3rd purchase from this vendor. I have to admit that so far so good. With my first purchase, I had my doubts after reading couple of user's reviews than I found out that people write these reviews even for the original Brother products. I took a risky shot and gave them a try and I am absolutely happy that I did. I had no issues installing them since I am not really a computer whiz however, I had to reset the printer since the printer does not want you to use any other brand than theirs. After reading some reviews I also realized that these print many more pages than the originals since these do not give false alerts as ""Low Toner, Replace Soon"" warnings. They helped me save a lot which means a lot for small business owner like myself. I am glad that they work perfectly fine for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JXQSJJH8P300/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HCSMLN2#wasThisHelpful","R2JXQSJJH8P300","A12EHXYVUQV7CB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12EHXYVUQV7CB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 6:51 MinsWatch my video and you will see just how amazing this is! I recommend to any and every girl!! I have never in my twenty six years of living have EVER experienced doing a hairstyle to myself with such ease, and so quickly! I have stick thin hair that normally does not hold a curl WHATSOEVER. I have tried every barrel size, I have tried high end, low end, every price point you could think of and to no avail! Just a ton of waste d time, money, and effort.However, the MiraQueen is a godsend! If you watch my video, you see just how incredibly effortlessly I curl every hair! It is AMAZING! It is safe, there is NO possible way to burn yourself. And it even ""knows"" somehow if you have too much hair in as it will unwind, and halt the curling pricess. It is so easy to use. It has a guided set of beeps sounds so that you know exactly how long to leave it in your hair to get the desired look shape and tightness of the curl. The longer the setting, the tighter the curl, the less heat and less seconds on the Digital screen, the looser and wavier the curl.It is really a no brainer. Perfect for girls ages 10 and up to  (in my opinion), perfect for single dads who are clueless as to how to do a little girls hair, really perfect for ANYONE!With the holidays just around the corner, this item is the perfect gift for any female any age in your life. This is great for the mom on the go, the fashionista (like myself) any length of hair(I mean not bald obviously) and any type of hair, curly, straight, processed, not processed etc.It is made of tourmaline ceramic so it is not going to add any further heat damage to your locks. The style will last for days!I recommend this highly!I am not quite sure how I lived in the beauty world without this amazing gadget!Do not hesitate for a moment to purchase!

"A lifelong fan of Dave Barry's work, I've recently begun working my way through his audiobooks in the local library.  ""Dave Barry is Not Taking This Sitting Down"" seemed to be typical Barry, a mostly random collection of his newspaper columns.  I laughed out loud a few times, chuckled a bunch of times, grimaced several times, and generally enjoyed the experience of listening to it.  I loved how several themes, especially the one about low-flow toilets, continued to reappear throughout various columns, sometimes as the central topic of the column and sometimes as a mere passing thought.  But that insistence on regurgitating some of his most memorable themes is a Barry trademark, beautifully executed in this book.  Most importantly, I listened to the five discs on various road trips and never once struggled to stay awake while driving, which is one of my most important reasons for listening to audiobooks.  Barry never failed to hold my attention.My primary disappointment with the book was the audiobook reader, who wasn't Barry himself, much to my chagrin.  He's read some of his other books for the audiobook production, and it just seemed as if his voice was sorely missing in this case.  To be clear, the reader wasn't bad and was actually quite dramatic in trying to make the most out of Barry's absurdist writing.  He was fully committed to the various voices, accents, and sound effects that were required of him.  But since Barry's writing is often so personal, it just seemed a bit inauthentic to be read by someone else.But, reader critique aside, if you like Dave Barry, you'll enjoy this book.  And if you're unfamiliar with his work, this is a fine place to start.  I'd recommend it to anyone interested in a few hours of quality humor writing...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6TJPHDGFCQE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1593557019#wasThisHelpful","R6TJPHDGFCQE9","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I missed Dave Barry.  After reading his column for most of my life and even a few of his books, I haven't encountered his stuff for many years.  So when I stumbled upon the audiobook version of ""I'll Mature When I'm Dead"" at the local library, I snatched it with hesitant expectation, wondering if I'd enjoy it as much as I once did.  And, though there were a few misses, I realized how much I have missed this guy.I knew that this book was gold very early, when Barry jumped into a description of early fatherhood, something I'm experiencing right now.  I was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my face, and I could barely see straight to keep driving.  Though I wasn't excited to become a terror on the highway, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.  And though the rest of the book didn't reach that level of hilarity for me, I spent much time smiling, chuckling, and snorting at various intervals.To be honest, there were a few parts that were utterly worthless to me.  His script for an episode of the TV show ""24"" was lost on me.  His parody of ""Twilight"" couldn't end soon enough.  But, I suppose, that's the nature of this random collection of different sorts of essays.  These are not newspaper columns.  There is no thread that runs from beginning to end.  It's just a bunch of random, disconnected humor writing.  And, as such, some of it will work for some readers and not for others.  In fact, I was shocked to read some reviews that thought the ""24"" and ""Twilight"" pieces were the best parts.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was especially glad that Barry himself read the audiobook, as I love to hear audiobooks from the actual voices of the authors.  With such personal stuff as Barry often includes (including the vasectomy piece in this one), it all just seems more authentic that way.  In any case, I'm glad to have reengaged with the humor of Dave Barry, and I'm hooked again.  I'll be scouring the public library shelves again to see whatever gems I might be able to find, no matter how similarly uneven they might be.  There's no one quite like Dave Barry...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXIH1GNAPVIKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0142427772#wasThisHelpful","RXIH1GNAPVIKQ","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having previously read Stewart's ""Earth,"" I already knew that Stewart's trademark acerbic wit would not translate perfectly into book form, so I began this book with slightly lower and more realistic expectations.  But because it tackled a much narrower and more manageable topic than ""Earth,"" I found ""America"" to be the more enjoyable of the two, for several reasons.Thankfully, I listened to the audiobook version of ""America,"" which was read by Stewart himself, as well as various correspondents and contributors to ""The Daily Show.""  And this aspect added some hilarious spice that I suspect would have been missing on the written page.  Ultimately, what Stewart and his team do best in this book is pick apart many of the absurdities, hypocrisies, and lunacies of the American political system, all under the guise of an educational textbook.  But, just like on television, Stewart manages to aggressively and provocatively take on this unwieldy beast while maintaining a genuine sense of admiration and respect for the overall American experiment.  He seems to earnestly love this country and its unique contributions to global peace and the general well-being of many millions of people, without feeling any need to safeguard the sacred cows (both ideologues and their ideologies) that rightfully deserve to be mocked and chastised.  And though he clearly leans to the left, he takes consistent aim at those on both sides of the aisle.Interspersed between Stewart's stinging critique are a host of silly contributions from the likes of Stephen Colbert, Ed Helms, and Samantha Bee.  I especially enjoyed Helms' hypothetical essays about what he would do in various powerful political positions, and I actually thought Bee's comments from a Canadian's perspective were possibly the first time I've ever laughed at Bee's stuff.  Thankfully, the peripheral stuff (i.e. the absurd ""discussion questions"" at the end of each chapter) in this book didn't seem like mere filler but actually added to the hilarity of the rest of the content.  As always, the book was unnecessarily profane and sophomoric, which I always think cheapens some of the brilliance of Stewart's comedy, but shockingly, that is what Stewart and his crew always do, despite my regular protestations.Ultimately, this book was classic Stewart.  He made me laugh, made me wince, made me think, and made me appropriately irritated by some of the ridiculousness of our political system, all the while making me thankful to live in this great nation.  This is no great piece of literature, and it will surely become increasingly dated with each passing election (though it was surprisingly fresh ten years after publication), but I'm happy to recommend it to those who can wade through the crude profanity to find the intelligent, stinging, and even occasionally encouraging political analysis of Jon Stewart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VM1UMFX7J4FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006IU7NQ#wasThisHelpful","R2VM1UMFX7J4FC","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I was assigned to read this book along with a group of my teaching colleagues, I had never heard of ""A Tale of Three Kings"" or its author, Gene Edwards.  So, I began it with zero expectations, grateful that it was so thin.  What transpired was substantial and meaningful, and I'm so glad that someone made me read this book.I sat down to give it a whirl and before I knew it, I had finished the whole book in one sitting, something that I rarely do as a slow reader and slow processor.  But this book is so short and so engaging that it was no struggle to blast my way through it.  And what followed after finishing it was a series of reflections and conversations that continue to this day, several months later, as I try to figure out what to do with the content that gripped me so profoundly.This book certainly isn't a verse-by-verse exposition of Scripture, so those looking for such a thing will surely be disappointed.  Instead, Edwards takes the biblical stories of three kings (Saul, David, and Absalom), fills in some hypothetical dialogue, extrapolates some incomplete aspects of the biblical accounts, and makes some challenging and provocative conclusions about the best and healthiest course of action when we encounter opposition from leaders with authority over us and when we encounter opposition from those over whom we have authority.  With various sub-points worth further reflection, I would summarize the main point of the book as the following: regardless of our position of authority, our best course of action is not to resist or fight but to allow our combatants to pursue their antagonistic approach without our opposition and trust God to sort out the consequences.Ultimately, I'm not yet sure that I completely agree with all of Edwards' conclusions.  But based on my own recent experience, I am totally on board with his primary point about refusing to fight those who oppose us.  It was interesting that Edwards made no mention of Jesus in the entire book, but I couldn't help but draw an obvious connection between David's choice of engagement with Saul and Absalom and a certain cheek-turning instruction from Jesus centuries later.  It seems to me that David apparently understood and practiced turning the other cheek before the idea had ever been explicitly stated.In short, in a world that seemingly celebrates victimhood and fighting for our rights, I think that Edwards offers a compelling alternative, refusing to become a victim, a choice that at least many of us in comfortable 21st-century America have readily available to us.  I think this message is needed and helpful, if admittedly uncomfortable and potentially controversial.  I've read this book twice and expect that I'll read it again and recommend it to others as a simple tool to wrestle with a profound idea of how God might invite us to embrace His sovereignty and live at peace, as much as possible within our power, with those around us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AYRTERLO1S1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0842369082#wasThisHelpful","R1AYRTERLO1S1M","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having loved the Car Talk broadcast for years and having listened to several other compilation albums, I was excited to enjoy this collection called ""Maternal Combustion,"" a random smattering of segments from the show that were calls from various mothers and even a few that included Click and Clack's own mother.  And, as always, there was much laughter, much laughter about the laughter, much self-deprecation, many brotherly insults, a few motherly insults, and even a bit of actual car advice.As with the other compilation albums, the regular flow of a normal radio broadcast is lost, which actually makes these compilations less interesting to me than a typical hour of ""Car Talk"" whimsy.  This particular collection includes a few ridiculous calls from mothers in which the actual talk about cars was completely lost in the midst of absurd parenting advice.  But, of course, that's part of the fun.So, even more than normal, you really won't learn anything about addressing car problems with this album.  And you certainly won't learn anything about how to raise children.  But you'll hear the boys laughing at each other and at their mom, and even you'll hear her laughing at them (demonstrating where they learned their distinct laughter cadence).  It's a chuckling hour well spent, one that I can happily recommend to others, with appropriate expectations...","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KW3CKAVOPTV2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BQ7BPU#wasThisHelpful","R1KW3CKAVOPTV2","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having listened to the audiobook version of Levitt and Dubner's ""Freakonomics"" and thoroughly enjoying it, I was curious to find out how the sequel would compare. In my estimation, ""SuperFreakonomics"" was even better, an utterly fascinating journey through the most random of topics that kept my rapt attention during many hours of boring driving.Levitt and Dubner stuck to their formula of poking holes in conventional wisdom from every conceivable angle, all ostensibly from the vantage point of economics, but in an accessible style that requires no economics background.  The basic premise of the book is that rewards drive human behavior, and the authors loosely use that idea to frame their analysis of various topics, including prostitution, terrorists, the bystander effect, child seats in cars, hospital safety, global warming, and a host of other seemingly unrelated issues.  I don't have a natural interest in any of this stuff, but herein lies the genius of Levitt and Dubner.  They make it all utterly captivating.  From chapter to chapter, I couldn't get enough of it.To be clear, I'm not planning to utterly reorganize my life around the conclusions of ""SuperFreakonomics.""  We'll still have our children in car seats when we're in the car, even if they are virtually useless.  But I love what the authors do throughout this book, asking great questions about any conceivable category of the human experience, making insightful observations, analyzing relevant data, and making compelling arguments for nontraditional solutions.  I like the way they think, I like the way they write, and I hope that they keep producing books like this.  If they do, I'll keep reading and pondering and chuckling and rethinking some of the ways I naturally think about a great many things.  It's challenging, fun, and fascinating to hear from these guys, an experience which I'm happy to recommend to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ACI2P7QR38XZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TNABPK#wasThisHelpful","R3ACI2P7QR38XZ","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently taught a Christian apologetics course for a private Christian high school, and I took the risk of using this book as our primary textbook, even though I had never read it.  But I read enough positive reviews and was sufficiently impressed with Greg Boyd's other books which I'd previously read that I decided to go for it.  And I couldn't have been more pleased with the choice.  It turned out to be even more compelling and helpful than I had imagined.To be clear, Boyd comes from a particular Arminian/Wesleyan theological position (more formalized as open theism in his more recent publications) that drives staunch Reformed/Calvinists absolutely batty (as evidenced by the one-star reviews of this book).  Hyper-Calvinists take note, as you will surely hate this book as a heretical abomination.  But, for those of us who are trying to figure out how free will and real choice and meaningful human agency fit within the big picture of God's will and sovereignty and power, then this book can offer at least a set of cogent and consistent responses to the most pressing questions that both Christians and skeptics ask.  My own Wesleyan theological proclivities allow me to more readily embrace some of Boyd's thoughts in this book than my Reformed friends would, but I would suggest that a lack of complete or even significant resonance with Boyd's theology doesn't mean that this book wouldn't be valuable.  In fact, I think some Calvinists would do well to wrestle with some of Boyd's concise but profound ideas in this book.Theological tensions aside, as much as I personally appreciated and agreed with many of the fabulously clear summaries that Boyd offered to seemingly unanswerable questions, I thought that the main strength of the book was not so much the theology but the tone and attitude of the interactions between father and son.  What a charming and challenging premise, a skeptical and agnostic old man (Papa Ed) firing away at his pastor son with a series of the most vexing theological questions, batting these incomprehensibly huge topics back and forth over the course of 30+ letters.  I absolutely loved the father's brutal honesty, and in this context, wasn't bothered by his occasionally profane rants, as they reflected the authenticity of his positions and the earnestness with which he pondered these hard issues.  But I was absolutely captivated by the way that the young pastor (Sonny Greg) engaged with his dad, never angry, never frustrated, never pushy, never arrogant, never dismissive, never frantic.  Instead, Greg's posture was unflinchingly gracious, patient, humble, kind, loving, and winsome, all the while being perfectly direct and crystal clear that he was fully confident that his dad was on the pathway to faith in Christ.  Yet, that confidence was not based on the exhaustiveness of his own brilliant answers but more so dependent on the ongoing work of the Holy Spirit to continue to draw this grumpy old man into the loving arms of his heavenly Father.  Oh, what a beautiful picture of what it looks like to be part of God's work in pursuing those who don't yet know Him!!  And, to use admittedly flippant language for a gloriously complex journey, it worked.  By the end of their correspondence, Ed received the gift of salvation in Christ and became an adopted son of God (and, as we might expect, a dramatically changed man).I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone.  Skeptics, cynics, and indifferent Christians would do well to ponder the marvelous answers that Greg offers to seemingly impossible questions.  He handles these hot topics with not only theological rigor but also appropriate simplicity (such that high school students were certainly challenged but could absolutely follow the discussion).  For Christians who want to know how to talk about Jesus with people who have real issues with Christianity, this book is an excellent model for all of us to consider and follow.  Of course, the particulars of our own evangelism will likely not involve a series of letters exchanged with our fathers, but there remains much that we can learn from this book.  And even as I learned how to share about Christ more effectively, my own faith was strengthened and solidified.  This is one of the best books I've read in years, and I expect that I'll return to it again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IKMPCQ6N7Z3T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1434799808#wasThisHelpful","R2IKMPCQ6N7Z3T","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently taught a one-semester Christian apologetics course at a private Christian high school, and this 12-part DVD series was handed to me as our primary curriculum.  In short, with high expectations based on Ravi Zacharias' name and ministry affiliation, I was very underwhelmed.  Unfortunately, the quality of the 12 lectures was highly erratic, varying from solid to downright boring.  The production values were rather amateurish, with the twelve lectures recorded in a small, rather dismal room somewhere in a forgotten corner of the Oxford campus.  The cutaways to audience members were often awkward and unnecessary.  The graphic overlays of the Powerpoint presentations were archaic, screaming 1980s technology even though this thing was apparently produced in 2011.  There were even a few typos.But, most significantly, I just thought that much of the content was just plain stale.  A few of the presentations actually offered substantive, interesting, engaging, compelling content (Michael Ramsden and Amy Orr-Ewing immediately come to mind), but, in general, it just fell flat, for me personally and for the students in my class.  Even the stuff from the big names like Alister McGrath and Ravi Zacharias himself was ultimately blase.  To be clear, I greatly respect McGrath and Zacharias and have thoroughly enjoyed their stuff that I've previously encountered.  This just felt like a rather pedestrian and uninspired contribution from these great minds.In nearly twelve hours of apologetics content, some helpful ground is surely covered.  But this compilation is decidedly less effective than it could have been and just didn't seem to warrant its gargantuan investment of time and expense.  I wouldn't necessarily dissuade apologetics enthusiasts from using this material, but I am unable to recommend it as a means to draw out enthusiasm or provide deeply substantive and impacting content for the skeptic, cynic, or dispassionate believer.  For whatever it's worth, though a completely different medium, I found Greg Boyd's book ""Letters from a Skeptic"" to be the most interesting, compelling, and meaningful apologetics resource I've ever encountered, and I cannot recommend Boyd's contribution to the field highly enough.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IACW64IEAD1G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612562124#wasThisHelpful","R3IACW64IEAD1G","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's hard for me to fully explain how much I dislike this book.  Having agonizingly worked through all 365 Bible stories with our 4-year-old daughter (who immediately became enamored with the daily number count), I felt such unfettered relief and joy at being able to permanently banish this mess into the rubbish heap.  It's all so badly done.To start, the quality of the cover and paper is poor, so our copy is beaten to smithereens having read through it only once.  The illustrations are few and far between, tiny, and bland (by modern children's literature standards).  The two questions at the end of each day's reading were usually so vague and abstract as to be virtually worthless.But all of these criticisms are insignificant in light of the big one, that this book was just not written with even the vaguest notion of how children learn and think.  Quality children's literature is a unique form of writing that understands the distinctions between simple and simplistic, between honest and inappropriate.  I can't explain this art form very well, and I absolutely couldn't do it myself.  But I know a story well-told for children.  And this just isn't it.  It may be targeted and marketed for children, but these stories were not written for children.One glaring example of this is the story of Jael and Sisera, but this specific case is indicative of the entirety of the book.  The actual sentence on page 80 is this: ""Then Jael drove a tent peg into Sisera's head and killed him.""  Yes, this is a book, as the back book jacket says, ""written specifically for ages three to eight.""  What three-year-old in the universe is able to process someone driving a tent peg into someone else's head and killing them when described so directly and dispassionately?  Of course, the argument in defense of this sentence is that the story is part of the Bible.  That's all well and good, and if anyone thinks that the entire Bible is appropriate for children to understand, then go ahead and just read the Bible to them.  I, on the other hand, think that God's revelation through Scripture, though all of it inspired and useful and necessary, is not entirely appropriate for any person of any age or any level of spiritual or physical maturity.  That's the potential power and beauty of children's Bibles, when thoughtfully and skillfully assembled, to help introduce children to the majesty and wonder of God's Word, through judicious, careful and creative excerpting and paraphrasing.I realize that this review may seem harsh, but I think that the Bible and our children deserve better than this book offers.  Obviously, many other reviewers disagree with me.  If you are looking for nothing more than 365 short, simplistic blurbs that summarize various stories from the Bible, this will do the trick.  But we are blessed to live in an age when there are countless better alternatives that help the Scriptures to come alive for children, visually and verbally, so I would highly recommend that interested folks look elsewhere.  ""The Jesus Storybook Bible"" is the best one we've discovered so far, which isn't merely a fragmented collection of random Bible stories but a cohesive and brilliantly written journey through the main theme of the Bible, explaining God and humanity and sin and grace and salvation in terms that children can understand and embrace enthusiastically.  In comparison, this book falls infinitely short.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G9AQPOWQW2SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1557482640#wasThisHelpful","R2G9AQPOWQW2SA","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thousands of reviews have now been written about ""Freakonomics,"" and many of my own thoughts resonate with both the acclaim and criticisms since its release almost ten years ago.  I agree that Levitt and Dubner turn a rather remarkable feat, taking the most random and seemingly irrelevant topics and regaling the reader with statistics and anecdotes to yield their counter-intuitive conclusion about the particular topic at hand.  From cheating teachers and sumo wrestlers to poor crack dealers and unethical realtors, the authors managed to keep me thoroughly intrigued, even if I didn't necessarily know where they were trying to go.  I'm not even remotely an economist, so it certainly wasn't clear to me how this book was necessarily a work of economics.  But as a non-economist, I am willing to embrace Levitt and Dubner's most generic of definitions, that economics is fundamentally a study of how incentives drive human behavior, a sufficiently sturdy point from which to launch into their fascinating analysis of whatever strikes their fancy.To be sure, some of their conclusions are quite provocative and controversial.  Of particular note is the suggestion that, rather than the host of alternative theories that have been offered over the past two decades, the steep drop in crime rates in 1990s America can be attributed to the legalization of abortion in the 1970s in the post-Roe v. Wade era.  I vaguely remembered hearing this theory before, but absorbing the idea as presented in such a direct and emotionless manner was shocking to this pro-life advocate.  However, the authors are not guilty of politicizing their analysis, making sure to avoid any pronouncements about the moral implications of this historical event.  They merely look at the numbers and draw some striking conclusions.  Their methodology is consistent and utterly fascinating, no matter how much I might disagree or even just want to disagree.Having recently worked my way through most of Malcolm Gladwell's books, I found myself comparing ""Freakonomics"" to his ""The Tipping Point,"" ""Blink,"" and ""Outliers.""  These authors seems to be attempting the same things, compiling extensive academic research (primarily economics for Levitt/Dubner, primarily psychology/sociology for Gladwell) to draw interesting, practical, and surprising conclusions about everyday life.  And I find that I love this developing genre of literature.  But I would add that I think Gladwell does it a bit better.  He's a superior storyteller and manages to make his presumed points of application more compelling to the reader.  Of course, he also appears to have a slightly more well-designed purpose than they do, so maybe it's a matter that my preferences align more closely with that purpose than the admittedly random and meandering approach of Levitt and Dubner.  In any case, if you like Gladwell's stuff, I suspect that you'd appreciate ""Freakonomics,"" too, and may especially enjoy the points when their statistical analysis yields directly contradictory results (such as their public disputes about their respective opinions about crime rate drops).And as another particular note, I listened to the revised and expanded audiobook format of ""Freakonomics,"" read by Stephen Dubner, one of the authors.  I thought he did a great job as an audiobook reader, not true of all authors, though I'm pretty sure he actually mispronounced a few words, .  And I appreciated some of the additional elements of the revised edition, including their very humble acknowledgement that they were at least partially hoodwinked by the featured participant in their analysis of the Ku Klux Klan.In conclusion, ""Freakonomics"" is a great, if imperfect, book, a captivating journey through a most random collection of topics.  The final chapter about names was an anomaly, decidedly less interesting than the rest.  And I'm not sure that the other chapters have necessarily informed my thinking in any substantive way.  But I spent many hours in the car listening to my very first entry into the world of popular economics, and it was hours well spent.  As they consistently turned conventional wisdom on its ugly head, I was surprised and even shocked, intrigued and even inspired, bothered but never bored.  And I look forward to seeing how else Levitt and Dubner can mess with my mind in their other books...","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109VT166Y2OQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062314246#wasThisHelpful","R109VT166Y2OQI","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was never a weekly listener, but I always enjoyed listening to CarTalk whenever I was in the car at the appropriate time, and I've even read their newspaper column over the years, even though I have absolutely no interest in cars or engines or anything remotely related to the topic of their show and column.  But Tom and Ray have such an endearing and captivating rapport with each other and their listeners that I never tired of hearing them talk about things that mean nothing to me.  That's a sure sign of true radio charismatic genius.In looking for some quality audiobookishness for a heavy dose of road tripping, I was delighted to stumble upon this collection of the best of CarTalk at the local library.  And I made quick work of these two discs over the course of a two-hour trip.  To be sure, I found myself chuckling along with these guys are various points, as I always do.  Their laughter is simply infectious, and as they enjoy their own silliness and the silliness of the callers, it's only natural to relish in the absurdity of it all.But therein lies my primary critique of this collection; it was a collection of the silliest and most absurd of their calls over the years, which are more fun in smaller and less frequent doses.  What I missed in the ""Best of"" discs were the more standard, simple questions that normal people have about their cars, and the ingenious and goofy way that Click and Clack are able to answer those questions.  The ebb and flow of a typical CarTalk show is part of the charm, from questions I might actually ask to puzzlers and bizarro situations that could never happen twice.  Unfortunately, this collection misses that rhythm, focusing only on the freakish calls.So, I enjoyed listening to the ""Best of"" collection of CarTalk, and I laughed with these guys as I always do.  But, frankly, I'm just as inclined to listen to a typical episode of the show as I am to this collection.  If you need a dose of CarTalk, this will do just fine, but you're just as fortunate to stumble upon a regular show on the radio.

"I've heard people reference Malcolm Gladwell's work approximately eighteen billion times over the past ten years, but other than a few articles he'd written for ESPN's Grantland, I've never actually read his stuff before listening to the abridged audiobook version, read by Gladwell himself.  And I would say that the book held up reasonably well to my rather high expectations.In general, Gladwell makes the seemingly obvious assertion that virtually every aspect of human life (infectious human behavior, booming businesses, pop culture fads, fashion trends, etc.) has the ability to explode on the scene out of nowhere, which he calls reaching the ""tipping point."" He attempts to offer a series of explanations for what factors cause a particular thing to tip.  Though some reviewers passionately dispute the scientific veracity of Gladwell's analysis, I'm not qualified or especially concerned about whether each and every one of his points is experimentally airtight.  I'm more interested in the experience of pondering his main conclusions and figuring out the widespread implications if he's right about any of it.My initial impression of the book is that Gladwell is a master storyteller.  I'm not a businessman or a marketer or a salesman, and I don't give two hoots about big business practices.  But like Jim Collins in several of his best-selling books, Gladwell is able to tell the success stories of companies like Hush Puppies, Airwalk, and Gore in such a compelling way as to intrigue an uninterested ignoramus like me.  Similarly, like Daniel Pink in several of his best-selling books, Gladwell is also able to analyze and describe sociological and psychological phenomena like crime rates, mass school shootings, ""Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon,"" and many other seemingly random historical events and relational realities of modern American life in ways that make sense to non-academicians.  It is a true gift to be able to distill and organize literally dozens of anecdotal incidents and scientific studies into a book that not only makes sense but is actually quite compelling.  Gladwell has quite a gift in this regard.My primary critique of the book relates to its ultimate purpose or lack thereof.  Gladwell covers a lot of ground and introduces a lot of terms (connectors, mavens, immunity) and concepts (the law of the few, the stickiness factor, the power of context), but it's not always easy to connect the dots.  On some level, I wonder if Gladwell blazed such a broad trail that some readers may be unable to actually process and apply the concepts in any meaningful way.  Ultimately, I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to do with all of this fascinating information.  Of course, Gladwell doesn't seem to be terribly concerned about answering this question.  According to the afterword, he directly states that he's perfectly willing to allow folks to use his compiled information and insights for whatever purposes they might desire, to start their own ""epidemics"" of whatever nature.  I suppose that broad applicability is what makes the book so wildly popular because we all feel capable of dialing into these reasonable and logical ideas for our own desired outcomes.  But, at least on some level, my concluding thought was, ""Huh, that was interesting, but what in the world can I do with it?""To be sure, I'm glad that I read the book.  It offered a lot of things to keep pondering, as I wonder if my personality might allow me to thrive in the role of a ""maven"" and considering if I could implement this concept of the tipping point to initiate some sort of epidemic around the things that matter most to me.  I have no clarity about what they could be, but I'm intrigued to keep thinking and processing.  I'm happy to recommend this books to any big idea thinkers, and I suspect that I'll be digging more into Gladwell's other books within the relatively near future.Audiobook note:  I didn't realize when I borrowed the audiobook from the library that this was an abridged version, and whenever I listen to abridged audiobooks, I'm always curious about what parts of the whole book I missed.  There was even some discussion in the afterword that specifically mentioned a case-study that I hadn't heard because it was obviously excluded from this version.  I have no idea if the book in its entirety would have been just more of the same or if it would have helped to provide some better connections between the points and helped to clarify the ""so what"" that I thought was not intuitively clear to me.  Who knows, I may decide at some point to read the whole book to try to fill in some of those gaps?I also found Gladwell's unique voice and cadence as the reader to be both soothing and at times disengaging (i.e. sleep-inducing).  But it always feels more authentic to listen to audiobooks when read by the author, not some random hired hand, so I'm glad that it was his voice reading to me.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GCNEVHU00GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1586217453#wasThisHelpful","R12GCNEVHU00GS","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read Klosterman's work for ESPN's Grantland and heard him speak a few months ago, so I was curious to stumble upon his ""I Wear the Black Hat,"" intrigued to see what his book-length treatment on a topic as fascinating as villainy might be like.  And it was one of the weirdest books I've ever read.Klosterman offers an opening thesis, that villains are the people who know the most but care the least, and spends 200 pages telling stories and anecdotes of varying interest, both personal and very public, to presumably connect to that thesis in some way.  My primary critique of the book is that those connections were stretched, at best, and impossible to find, at worst.  I often found myself thinking or even muttering aloud, ""What in the world is he trying to say?""  If ever there was a book that was nonlinear and nondidactic, this is it.  Though peppering very strong opinions throughout about fundamentally trivial things, Klosterman doesn't preach from a high horse of self-righteous superiority, as writers about ethics and evil are easily inclined to do.  But he also doesn't seem to have a point.  That left me rather baffled and even irritated at times.  To top it off, Klosterman is consistently and unnecessarily profane.  I find the use of profanity for shock effect, the only possible explanation for such a thoughtful and capable writer to use such language, to be lazy writing, much below Klosterman's considerable intellectual and linguistic abilities.On the other side of the coin, Klosterman's breadth of knowledge and insight is impressive.  He is conversant in a range of categories from pop culture, music (from The Eagles to N.W.A.), and sports (from Muhammad Ali to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) to major and minor historical figures (from Adolf Hitler to Bill Clinton).  His perspective is interesting if not always coherent.  And I especially appreciated the chapters about the O.J. Simpson saga, long-forgotten for many of us, and about D.B. Cooper, a minor historical figure that was completely unfamiliar to me but whose story is utterly fascinating.  Though Klosterman fancies himself a funny writer, his humor most often elicited a wry smile, though a few chuckles did emerge.Ultimately, I don't know what to think about this book.  It was easy to read, and I genuinely didn't want to put it down.  But I'm also not sure what purpose it serves.  I think Klosterman hopes to speak on a deeper level than mere entertainment, but his lackadaisical style and directionless approach didn't help me understand villainy in any profoundly new way.  Even so, it was an interesting book to read, and I suspect when I'm looking for an engaging and readable book of contrarian randomness, I might just find my way to another one of Klosterman's books.  With appropriate expectations, he definitely offers something different and possibly important to the literary world.  I'm just still trying to figure out what it is...","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX8C3G65OI9BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439184496#wasThisHelpful","RX8C3G65OI9BM","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the midst of an unexpected job loss, I read through this book with a colleague who was in a similar situation.  And, in general, I found the content to be moderately helpful but not sufficiently thorough.  The first half of the book addresses the theological idea of calling and its implications related to vocation/jobs/career.  This was the more helpful part of the book, as I think that Creel addressed a number of important, if sometimes lofty and even idealistic, aspects of pursuing a calling from God as we consider what sort of work He intends for us to discover and employ.  Though there was nothing earth-shattering or especially profound, he covered some important ground, which fostered some great discussion and reflection.  I would happily encourage anyone who is interested in the notion that God might call us to particular work to read these chapters and discuss them further with thoughtful friends.The second half of the book is ultimately a ""how to succeed in the workplace"" guide.  This was the less helpful part of the book, as these chapters mostly felt like vastly underdeveloped descriptions of the vital workplace traits of endurance, character, integrity, frugality, mentoring, discipline, skill, humility, weighing your words, family, and boundaries and balance.  I certainly valued the topics, but these sorts of things cannot be adequately unpacked in the course of just a few pages.  Frankly, I feel as if I had read all of this content elsewhere, in much more compelling and engaging ways.My final critique of the book is my disappointment with the ""Seasoned Advice"" that followed each chapter.  These words of wisdom from various ""experts"" felt especially trite at times and often very disconnected from the chapter which preceded it and upon which it was supposed to expound or clarify.  It even seemed a few times as if the seasoned advisers were indirectly contradicting what the author had just written.  Frankly, I thought that these segments added very little to the book and could have been excluded to allow the author to cover his intended content more comprehensively.To be sure, much of my disappointment with the book may be the simple fact that I am a decade or more older than its primary audience.  Twenty-something college graduates may find this book much more helpful than I did, and I certainly think it has much to offer any reader pondering these issues of calling and vocation.  But I would have preferred if the author had tried to cover fewer topics and instead pressed into some of the nuance and finer details of the most important ideas which he had to offer.  This book certainly isn't a total loss, but I'll keep looking for something to more thoroughly address some of the big picture questions that are relevant to my own situation as I look towards the next chapter of ministry to which God is calling me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNX8IEEOWDUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1581349521#wasThisHelpful","R2NNX8IEEOWDUB","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the entire Sherlock Holmes canon when I was a teenager and absolutely loved it, but after a 15+ year hiatus, I decided to return to Holmes during a recent beach vacation, diving into the iconic ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.""  What a great decision!!I was amazed that several of the stories, characters, and specific case details were very familiar to me.  Of particular note, I remembered ""The Red-Headed League"" and ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"" as if I had read them last week.  Some of the other stories were seemingly completely new to me.  In either case, the experience of reading these short stories was so much fun.  To be sure, there is a delightful simplicity to these stories which did not yield the same intellectual wonderment that I experienced as a kid.  But the narrative creativity, snappy dialogue, and vivid imagery made each story its own small-scale page-turner.In some cases, I had a good suspicion of the resolution of the case.  In others, I had no idea what was to come.  But all the way through, Doyle's writing style is engaging and accessible, even with all of its 19th-century British vocabulary and the various London geographic markers which mean absolutely nothing to me.  It's a credit to his genius that Doyle created these characters that are truly ageless, in the sense that these stories can be read and appreciated in any age (at least from the 19th-century through the 21st-century) and by any age (at least from a teenager through my present age of 36).I've hardly read any fiction over the past many years, but my brief foray back into the world of Sherlock Holmes has motivated me to read through the rest of the Holmesian tales, novels and short stories.  I might even check out some of the recent television representations of the Holmes character to see how well this amazing mind and personality translate to the screen.  In any case, I'm grateful for rediscovering this gem of literary history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R198M41CS26GBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0895772779#wasThisHelpful","R198M41CS26GBL","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an American evangelical Christian, I have been raised to view missions work as glorious, glamorous, and almost always successful, based on the missions stories that we (rightly) celebrate and share in our church communities.  Endo's ""Silence"" offers an uncomfortably different view on one of the possible outcomes of global missions work, in which the missionary arrives with grandiose ideas about what (or who) he is bringing to a needy people but who is ultimately rejected, tormented, and converted to some fundamentally new forms of spiritual understanding.Of course, the response to Endo's work is understandably widely varied and even controversial.  Some might interpret the journey and ultimate destination of Endo's Father Rodrigues as a tragic trajectory toward generic syncretism.  Others might interpret his departure from his initial assumptions about Christ and faith as a triumphal arrival at tolerant pluralistic spirituality.  I would argue for some sort of middle ground, that there is a tragic aspect to the disillusionment and reorientation that Rodrigues experiences but also a necessary and helpful distancing from some of the ethnocentrism and smug cultural superiority that can easily accompany the best of missionary intentions.To be sure, what makes this uncomfortable journey through ""Silence"" worthwhile is not just the end result but the entire emotional experience of walking this journey with Father Rodrigues.  From his optimistic beginning to his downtrodden end, the story is gripping and fascinating.  The characters are well-developed, the imagery is evocative, and the themes are necessarily complex and nuanced.Though I think that Endo was overly critical of the purpose and vision for Christian missions work, I consider this book to be well worth reading.  Anyone with a heart to share Christ with others would do well to consider many of the presumptuous and unintentionally arrogant assumptions that can easily accompany the very best of intentions.  Though I am deeply and firmly committed to the need of all people for Jesus, there is much nuance required when we consider introducing Jesus from one culture to another.  ""Silence"" is an agonizingly helpful tool to consider the complexity of that task and some of the inherent challenges when cultures and religions collide and cross-pollinate.  My appreciation for that complexity was expanded by reading this book, a journey I'd highly recommend to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE2E2SJ2LYG7D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800871863#wasThisHelpful","RE2E2SJ2LYG7D","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have appreciated Richard Foster's books in the past.  ""Celebration of Discipline"" is a genuine classic, and ""Streams of Living Water"" is one of the most fascinating and illuminating books on church history that I've had the privilege to read.  So, I began listening to the abridged audiobook version of his ""Longing for God"" with relatively high expectations, only some of which were met.The primary strength of ""Longing for God"" is its broad approach to combing through church history to uncover or at least rediscover literally dozens of saints throughout the ages who have approached their pursuit of God with different perspectives and orientations.  In fact, this non-sectarian, theologically-gracious approach to not just discussing those who fall within one particular stream of theological thought is what made ""Streams of Living Water"" such a fabulous book.  And in ""Longing for God,"" Foster against manages to find so many nuggets of wisdom and Scriptural insight from church fathers, both famous and obscure.  As someone who appreciates the value of church history, I find these sorts of journeys to be utterly fascinating and extremely helpful.  We are so often smitten with the largest craze or hottest fad in the church, but there is truly nothing new under the sun, and Foster helps us to engage with the work of the Holy Spirit throughout the ages.However, in contrast to the six clearly defined and easily understood paths that Foster describes in ""Streams of Living Water,"" I never got a clear sense of what differentiated the ""seven paths of Christian devotion"" into which Foster organized the vignettes within ""Longing for God.""  Quite simply, the seven paths all rather mushed together in my mind as I was listening to the book, and I couldn't recite even one of them without looking at the back of the book.  The implication of this muddled approach is that I ended up experiencing the book much like a series of encyclopedia entries.  Yes, Foster included some fascinating historical insights, but they didn't personally connect with my heart or mind in any substantive way.  I can't help but wonder if some of this effect might result from listening to an abridged audiobook version, but nonetheless, this was my experience.In short, ""Longing for God"" includes some great information, but it's a far cry from much of his other more inspirational and captivating work.  Rather than recommending folks to investigate this one, I'd instead point any prospective reader to his ""Streams of Living Water,"" to which I hope to eventually return to dig from its deep well of insight and perspective.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EF3S88BS5LLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0830835261#wasThisHelpful","R2EF3S88BS5LLC","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a pastor, not a businessman, so I read business/leadership books like those by Daniel Park from a different vantage point than many.  I don't pretend to have any experience in the marketplace and certainly have no business acumen.  But I have benefited greatly from reading books by folks like Jim Collins, Patrick Lencioni, and, more recently, Daniel Pink, who offer big-picture ideas that have applications across all of the human experience, not limited specifically to the business community.I read Pink's ""Drive"" a few years ago, and it provided such clarity and challenged several of my assumptions about what motivates human action, which has plenty of applications not just within church ministry but also in education, parenting, and many other arenas of leadership.  Though I haven't embraced every idea from ""Drive"" as some sort of pure truth, it has substantially influenced my thinking for the past several years.I began reading Pink's ""To Sell is Human"" with comparable expectations, which were augmented when I recently heard him speak at a technology conference for educators where I was again favorably impressed by his approach.  And, to be sure, ""To Sell is Human"" offers a very compelling case that we are all in sales, in one way or another, as long as we are willing to broaden the definition of sales as Pink does to mean ""moving others"" to a particular action.  From that perspective, my job as a pastor is some level of salesmanship.Unfortunately, ""To Sell is Human"" disappoints on the level of focus and clarity.  In fact, one of the chapters in the book was about clarity, but I think that Pink failed to follow his own advice in this regard.  In contrast to ""Drive,"" which offered one big idea with three primary bullet points, ""To Sell is Human"" offers a collection of big ideas, each with their own bullet points and sub-ideas.  At the end of the book, I was a bit lost amidst all of the chatter.There is no question that Pink is an outstanding writer.  His prose is engaging, his stories are relevant, and his ideas are insightful and challenging.  But I think he failed somewhat in this book to take the reader on a clear and direct journey from beginning to end.  Instead, I think he did more meandering than what I would prefer.  Having finished the book just a few weeks ago, I can't say that I remember any particular point or idea with any level of specificity.  It is for this reason that I am unable to more highly rate what was otherwise a pleasant and accessible book to read.I continue to like Pink's style and content, and I suspect that I'll read more of his books in the future.  But at least for general readers like me, I hope to rediscover the simplicity and focus that so captivated me in ""Drive,"" rather than the vast and semi-directionless musings that I encountered in ""To Sell is Human.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IUO6VYMA1F2H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594631905#wasThisHelpful","R1IUO6VYMA1F2H","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"While teaching through the ""I Am"" statements of Jesus from the gospel of John, I was thrilled to stumble upon Warren Wiersbe's ""Jesus in the Present Tense,"" which promised to cover the very same ground I hoped to use in our teaching series.  Having heard Wiersbe's name for years, I was glad to finally read one of his books, and I expected that it would be most helpful.Unfortunately, I was largely disappointed by ""Jesus in the Presence Tense.""  It's not that I disagreed with much, or even anything, that Wiersbe wrote in the book.  To be sure, his writing is nothing if not biblical, with Scripture references generously peppering every paragraph.  And Wiersbe is clearly a preacher and Jesus-follower with much wisdom and insight to share.My disappointment is that the book seemed like little more than a randomly collected string of theologically true statements.  It didn't grab my heart.  It didn't challenge my mind.  It didn't motivate my actions.  It didn't offer anything substantially new or profound or unique.  It didn't take me anywhere.  And that's exactly why I am so captivated by great writing, because the best of books mess me up and inspire me and encourage me and embolden me to feel differently or think differently or do things differently.  This book had no such effect.The final evidence of the meandering and purposeless nature of this book was the final chapter, which hardly even mentioned the ""I Am"" statements of Christ.  It's as if Wiersbe had a bunch of stuff that he wanted to say, but not being able to force those thoughts into one of the preceding chapters, he just dumped them into a random, final chapter.  Quite simply, I expect more purpose and intentionality from such an esteemed author.In summary, for readers who are satisfied with a bunch of true statements, feel free to check out this book.  Wiersbe is no fool and no heretic, and he has many good points to make.  But having finished the book merely a few weeks ago, I truly can't remember a single thing that I read.  That's the sign of a book that lacks teeth, as far as I'm concerned.  I've not given up hope that some other entry in Wiersbe's voluminous catalog of books might be helpful to me, but this one certainly failed to satisfy, and I'm not able to recommend it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IK4ID9U03B5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0781404878#wasThisHelpful","R3IK4ID9U03B5A","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always appreciate N.T. Wright's writing, and this little 84-page booklet is no exception.  It's basically a compilation of nine messages that Wright preached in 2005 through Holy Week (with two on Maundy Thursday and two on Easter Sunday, hence a total of nine).  Rather than teaching through the most traditional Holy Week accounts in the gospels, Wright wades through several of Jesus' parables after the triumphal entry in Matthew 21, before redirecting three of the final lessons from various passages in the gospel of John.Frankly, it's an unexpected and somewhat circuitous journey through some atypical Easter passages, but Wright does a good job of drawing meaningful and fascinating connections to the events of Holy Week.  I wouldn't say that the book offered me any transformational or utterly captivating ideas, but it was a refreshing approach to consider the events of Holy Week from a new vantage point.  This certainly doesn't represent Wright's most earth-shattering work, but it serves a purpose of giving the reader something fresh to ponder in the midst of one of Christianity's most familiar (and, therefore, most susceptible to staleness) seasons.  I hope to revisit this little book over upcoming Easters and may even integrate some of Wright's teaching into my own preaching in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZFS3WR5MZP2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664230512#wasThisHelpful","RZFS3WR5MZP2X","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I literally haven't read an autobiography in 15+ years, but for whatever reason, I decided to try Phil Vischer's ""Me, Myself, and Bob"" while on a beach vacation.  And I was positively astounded by how much I both enjoyed and appreciated the entire experience.  For the uninitiated, Vischer is the primary inspiration, brains, and brawn behind the inexplicable force of nature within 1990s evangelical Christianity that was (and still is, to a degree) VeggieTales.  I've only seen a handful of VeggieTales episodes in my life, but I have liked them and have thoroughly enjoyed the ""Jonah"" full-length movie several times. And my daughter absolutely adores the VeggieTales series, so I figured it might be fun to read about the history of VeggieTales' origins.What I discovered in Vischer's book was so much more than a history lesson, but was instead a fascinating and honest description, from the initial idea all the way through to the ultimate bankruptcy and apparent dissolution, of the VeggieTales company that Vischer had founded.  What a gripping and entertaining account it turned out to be!  As many of us know from those silly talking vegetables, Vischer is an extremely engaging storyteller, a gift not limited to singing asparagi.  And in the midst of an interesting tale, Vischer unpacked significant ethical and spiritual dilemmas in the context of an explosively growing company that got a little too big for its britches.  It was all packed with ample servings of humility, humor, candor, confession, intrigue, and inspiration.Of particular note was Vischer's obvious decision to not name names, except for the folks that he was praising and thanking.  There were several individuals whose actions really wounded Vischer personally and professionally, but he made the honorable decision to refer to them with only vague descriptors (the brilliant CEO, the marketing guru, etc.).  Clearly the heart of the story did not depend on us readers knowing the names of these individuals who were not well portrayed through Vischer's account, and I'm grateful and appreciative of his decision to allow them to remain anonymous, contrary to how most such ""tell-all"" books tend to operate.Finally, it is worth noting that there is great spiritual depth to Vischer's journey.  He experienced amazing highs as his company and his ""Big Idea"" gained phenomenal fame and tremendous financial rewards, followed by the crushing disappointment as the VeggieTales empire crumbled around his feet.  Thankfully, he chose to use the entire journey as an opportunity to learn about himself and to learn about God.  And we have the pleasure to go along that journey with him through this book, to learn with him and from him.  But, if VeggieTales has taught us anything, it's taught us that learning and fun need not be separated.  So, as deeply impacting as this book was for me, it was also simply a joy to read.  I'm happy to recommend it to anyone who isn't too proud to be willing to learn a few important lessons from a tomato...","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G4Q1X8HEEAB2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1595551220#wasThisHelpful","R3G4Q1X8HEEAB2","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I consider Gary Thomas' ""Sacred Marriage"" to be the finest, by far, of the several dozen marriage books that I've read, as I greatly appreciate that he offers a somewhat radical and deeply profound concept of marriage as a spiritual discipline through which God primarily desires to make us holy.  I am happy to recommend that book to anyone and everyone who is married, was married, will be married, might be getting married, or knows people who are married.  It's that good.And it is because of how deeply I appreciate ""Sacred Marriage"" that I withheld a five-star review from Thomas' follow-up, ""The Joy of a Sacred Marriage.""  This slimmed down, excerpted, soundbite-based edition of ""Sacred Marriage"" was specifically created and published to be a wedding gift, presumably the sort of thing that married couples could read together on their honeymoon or over the first several weeks or months of marriage.  And there's a lot of good stuff packed in there.  But, much to my disappointment, for the sake of creating a little ""gift book"" (and probably with the unspoken motivation of offering a marriage book short enough that more men might actually read it, a necessity that ought to shame my gender), the profundity of the original ""Sacred Marriage"" is sliced and diced and fragmented into almost unrecognizable form.  Yes, the main thesis of ""Sacred Marriage"" still permeates this gift book, and it surely includes some great stuff, but it's simply not as great as in its original form.So, if this excerpted, piecemealed booklet is the only way that a couple might engage with the main ideas of ""Sacred Marriage,"" then go for it.  It would still be tremendously challenging and helpful.  But I'd much more emphatically recommend that folks just read ""Sacred Marriage"" instead, to dig into the significance of what Thomas has to offer.

"My wife read Shaunti Feldhahn's ""For Women Only"" several years ago and found it to be an utterly fascinating discussion of several of the main ways that men are fundamentally different from women, several of which surprised my wife greatly.  What followed was much discussion, as we analyzed the categories in which I mirrored Feldhahn's conclusions and the categories in which I defied the norms.  And I found those discussions to be sufficiently engaging that I decided to listen to the audiobook version of ""For Women Only"" a few years down the road, to hear the material for myself.Obviously, the book has struck a chord with readers in all directions, positive and negative.  Some describe how this book has finally helped them to understand men.  Others decry that it is filled with stereotypes and over-generalizations and doesn't do justice to the complexity and diversity of men.  And having now seen what the fuss is all about, I fully understand both perspectives.Yes, the book is full of stereotypes and over-generalizations, and I see them most obviously when Feldhahn is painting a picture of men that doesn't even remotely resemble me.  But stereotypes and generalizations exist because they are generally true, and I'm sufficiently self-aware to realize that I don't define the entirety of manhood.  If we're not able to speak in generalities about how most people in a particular group tend to often, usually act and think, then we can say nothing at all.What Feldhahn has offered is a thoroughly researched summary of some of the primary ways that men tend to think about several important categories like work, sex, play, and other such things.  Her research probably wouldn't qualify her for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, but she spoke with hundreds of men, which seems to qualify her to draw some conclusions.  Our job as readers is to sort through the generalizations to find the points of resonate and dissonance with the reality of our own experiences.To be sure, I didn't think the book was perfect.  Frankly, Feldhahn's reading voice was a bit too sing-songy for my taste in the audiobook format.  And I did think that she spoke unnecessarily dogmatically at times, when a little less absolutism and certainty might have served her well.  But I think she has done us all a great favor in starting a conversation that many of us were long overdue to have.  The divide between genders is unnecessarily wide, and Feldhahn has offered a useful tool to begin to establish a clearer understanding of how we men function, why we do what we say, and how our women might love us well.  For that, I'm certainly grateful, and I'm happy to recommend the book to those who are able to take some of the dogmatism with a grain of salt while welcoming the considerable insight that Feldhahn's research has to offer us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BWVSCI0DBOG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590525744#wasThisHelpful","R2BWVSCI0DBOG3","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used the StrengthsFinder assessment at a previous job and have always found it to be a helpful tool to understand my own strengths and those of my colleagues.  And I have always marveled at how well the assessment painted an accurate picture of me.  So, I was pleased when my new employer decided that our entire staff would utilize this ""Strengths Based Leadership"" book as a means for learning about our unique leadership strengths and how we might more effectively leverage them together as a cohesive unit.Though I had done it before, I took the assessment again, and four of the five strength themes were identical to the last time I had done it, further validating those original results.  It was great to reflect on those strength themes again, to consider how I've developed and leveraged them over the years and how I've sometimes allowed them to languish and atrophy at other times.  Like any personality test or assessment, StrengthsFinder ideas can be abused to box people into particular designations.  But, rightly used, it's a wonderful tool to discover who I am and who others are and how we might work together most effectively.  We had a fascinating discussion among our staff, as we calculated which strength themes were most common and which were not reflected at all amongst our team and what that might mean for the productivity of our team.The one primary idea which seemed to be new in this 2.0 version of the assessment was the delineation of four domains of leadership strength, four general categories into which each of the 34 strength themes were divided.  Each of those domains was further explained through the example of a highly successful leader whose StrengthThemes were strongly represented within each of the four domains.  I found this structure to be really helpful to provide some clarity and simplification, in contrast to simply stumbling around as I had before, trying to understand and thoughtfully organize the original and sometimes overwhelming list of 34 themes.  And this structure of four domains provide significant clarity to our staff conversation, as we considered the domains that were most prevalent and most absent from our team.The bulk of the book is actually a description of each of the 34 strength themes, and though this was organized around the premise of leading from those strengths, much of this material could be found in many of the other StrengthsFinder resources.  Ultimately, ""Strengths Based Leadership"" did not provide a significant quantity of new material beyond that which is available elsewhere.  But there was certainly some value in the new stuff presented here.  For those with an interest in applying the StrengthsFinder ideas within the specific context of leadership, the book is certainly helpful, if not earth-shattering.

"For reasons I can't even fully articulate or understand, I really can't tell you how much I want to dislike Donald Miller.  Maybe it's the sort of people who originally flocked to his books that put me off to his writing, good folks but just not my type.  Maybe it's the way that those people acted as if Miller had received a new burst of inspired Scripture to offer this generation.  Maybe it's the fact that ""Blue Like Jazz"" sounds like a ridiculously nonsensical title for a book.  For whatever reason, I want to dislike him.But, over the years, every time I've read his stuff or heard him speak, I'm forced to reckon with the fact that I really actually like Donald Miller.  I think I would like to be his friend.  Of course, I don't know if he would be my friend, since I don't smoke cigars or drink beer at apparently every possible opportunity like he and his friends do.  But I think he would be a great guy to know.  I think he would have a lot of stuff to say to me that would make me both irritated and intrigued, and ultimately, I think he would say stuff to me that I need to hear that nobody else would have the courage to say or even know how to say.And that's the beauty of Miller's ""Blue Like Jazz,"" which I finally read over ten years after its publication.  Miller's writing style is simple and easy and comfortable.  He comes off as a rather normal guy, as opposed to the sort of superhuman demigods who seem to most often write Christian books.  But as normal as he is, he clearly loves Jesus and wants others to know that same love.  And as he tells the story of his life, interspersed by a fascinating set of supporting characters, I couldn't help but be inspired and challenged by much of what he wrote.To be clear, I'm not entirely on board with all of Miller's theological assumptions.  And I can't say that I align with many of his lifestyle decisions.  But I deeply appreciate his spirit and tone and writing style, through which God has clearly spoken to millions of people over the years.  So, less begrudgingly than before, I suspect that I'll continue to stumble upon Miller's other books, hoping that he'll continue to say what nobody else has the courage to say, and trust that God might want to use Miller's unique gifts to say some meaningful things to me.  (Ugh, I can't believe I've become a Donald Miller fan...)[As a quick point of clarification, I actually listened to the abridged audiobook version of ""Blue Like Jazz,"" which was read by Miller himself.  And as a gifted storyteller, it's no surprise that he turned out to be a fabulous audiobook reader.  Though I wouldn't say this with many other authors, I may continue to try to engage with Miller's work through audiobooks, as his style and delivery seems uniquely well-aligned to that format.]","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PA720BT115VG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=078521626X#wasThisHelpful","R1PA720BT115VG","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read and deeply appreciated Dallas Willard's ""The Divine Conspiracy"" over 12 years ago, I decided to dive into his ""Knowing Christ Today"" shortly after his death, hoping that I might be similarly intrigued and captivated by the depth and profundity of his writing.  And, to be sure, ""Knowing Christ Today"" is a deeply challenging and intellectually stimulating book to read.  To his credit, Willard acknowledges in the beginning that it will be difficult and slow to comprehend what he is trying to say in this book, and he certainly delivered on that promise.  And though there are some rewards for wading through this beast, it wasn't nearly what I had hoped it would be.In short, the purpose of the book is to demonstrate and ultimately prove (herein lying Willard's mistake, I think) that those who seek to know about Christ and know Christ can do so with confidence and certainty that their assessment of reality truly and accurately reflects the nature of true reality.  Of course, this sentence alone belies the tricky nature of the entire discussion, as we need to clearly define such complex terms as ""know,"" ""reality,"" and ""truth.""  In fact, Willard spends considerable time defining what it means to ""know"" something, as opposed to simply ""believe"" something or ""profess"" something or ""commit"" to something.  And in the midst of this discussion, I found his distinctions among these terms to be much less clear-cut than he fancied them to be.  And I especially found his conclusions to be lacking regarding the tragic flaw in ""merely"" believing or professing or committing to certain ideas, rather than truly, absolutely knowing these ultimate things, the only landing place which seemed to carry any value in Willard's mind.  Basically, I felt like the entire premise of the argument undervalued the biblical call for the followers of Jesus to certainly know but also to believe, profess, and commit.But I soldiered on, hoping that Willard would convince me that certain knowledge of all of the central ideas of the Christian faith was not only absolutely essential but utterly accessible for us.  And I was not convinced.  In fact, my primary and prevailing critique of the book is that the arguments posited by Willard were not nearly as air-tight as he supposed that they were.  Time and again, he would refer to a point that he had just made, suggesting that the point had been ""proven"" or ""clearly established"" or other such definitive terms.  And I found myself disagreeing that he had proven anything.  And, just to be clear, I can't be a more favorable audience for where he wanted to go.  I'm a lifelong Christian and long-time pastor, and I agree with all of the primary spiritual points that he was making.  I just didn't agree that he had successfully ""proven"" the points or that I now felt like I was able to claim absolute and certain knowledge of those ideas.In that light, I feel like the book was largely a failure for this reader.  Of particular curiosity, I found Chapter Seven, ""Knowledge of Christ and Christian Pluralism,"" to be the absolute highlight of the book and, frankly, felt as if it were written by a different author.  The entire tone of the chapter, one of winsome humility, was in stark contrast to the rather unbending and even arrogant posture that emerged throughout the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, the dominant tone of the book returned for the concluding chapter, during which Willard essentially lambasted my pastoral ministry as a weak, deceitful facade because of my disinterest in speaking as if I have exclusive access to a full and certain knowledge of all of the central questions of life.  Because I am satisfied to simply profess things that I firmly believe to be true without claiming to know these things with absolute certainty, then I am merely an imposter and a disgrace of a pastor, in Willard's view.Ultimately, this book offered some challenging thoughts for me to consider.  But I found the overall tone of the book and the author's definition and conclusions about the nature of spiritual knowledge to be disappointing, unconvincing, and uncompelling.  I hope to continue to dig into some of Willard's other work, much of which I have appreciated, but ""Knowing Christ Today"" is not one that I'll widely recommend.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NQYWHXPFQZWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060882441#wasThisHelpful","R2NQYWHXPFQZWS","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his ""Pure Pleasure,"" Gary Thomas has the courage to buck the conventional wisdom of so many churches and Christians by stating that pleasure is a good thing, a God thing, when rightly understood.  And in so doing, he provides an invaluable guide for any of us who might struggle under the oppressive sense that we should at least be wary and hesitant to pursue anything which we fully enjoy and probably ought to flatly turn away from any such pleasures.  Thomas suggests another way, a better way.Thankfully, this book is so much more than a Christian defense of the ""if it feels good, do it"" philosophy that governs much of contemporary American life.  Instead, Thomas delves deeply into the profound spiritual implications of how God created humanity to experience pleasure as part of His grand plan.  Thomas spends much time addressing the ways that pleasure can inappropriately become an idol that we pursue without restraint.  He doesn't avoid the necessary conversation about how this obsession with pleasure can lead to sin.  But he refuses to make the easy conclusion that the possibility of sin should warrant our avoidance of pleasure altogether.Instead, Thomas paints a compelling and exciting picture of human life as it was designed by God for us to experience, filled with the many pleasures that were specifically created for us to enjoy.  He paints that picture with a broad stroke, refusing to pigeon-hole a specific definition of what those pleasures should be.  He certainly describes those created pleasures in his own life through engaging stories, but he does the hard intellectual work of distinguishing his main conclusions from his own experiences, giving the reader the necessary freedom to fill in the blanks for their lives, for their unique pleasures.  And as Thomas always does, the book is filled with relevant verses of Scripture and fascinating quotes from Christian thinkers throughout the ages.There is no question that some will read this book as a license to sin.  But that is no fault of Thomas, as he goes to great lengths to provide caution and nuance and disclaimers to avoid that pitfall.  I am convinced that the thoughtful reader can embrace the main thesis and the particular implications of that thesis as an opportunity to pursue the life that God intends for us to live.  Even over the weeks since I began reading the book, there have been numerous occasions when I've experienced pleasure and specifically used the ideas from this book to reflect on the value (and, to be sure, the danger) of that pleasure.  I can say without hesitation that I have a newly inspired and informed commitment to receiving God's gift of pure pleasure in my life, and I strongly recommend this book as an opportunity for others to journey down that exciting, freeing, delight-filled pathway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36K27HTF9ZDA3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310290805#wasThisHelpful","R36K27HTF9ZDA3","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In his ""The Way of the Lord,"" N.T. Wright writes with his characteristic style that is paradoxically not only intellectually profound but also fully accessible to the reader.  He uses the general idea of pilgrimage to the Holy Land as the context for taking the readers through a series of journeys, more theological and philosophical than physical.  In fact, I found this to be the greatest disappointment of the book.  Though Wright frames the book around the idea of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he very intentionally writes with readers in mind who are not actually traveling there.  And, in so doing, I found that it became unhelpfully vague and esoteric.  I bought this book in preparation for a trip to Israel, and I thought that Wright would help to provide some significant spiritual substance to the trip.  Though this substance was not entirely absent, his attempt to make the book inclusive to non-travelers made it less specific and applicable than I would have preferred.Having acknowledged my disappointment in the broad approach, the greatest asset of the book is Wright's ability to make a compelling case for the deep and profound spiritual significance of pilgrimage, of visiting holy places and sacred spaces.  Of course, the point is not that God's presence is affixed within or confined to particular earthly locations but that we have unique opportunities to learn about God and His work, to pray in new and powerful ways, and to ultimately grow in our relationship with God as an act of discipleship if we rightly understand what pilgrimage can and should be.  For this broad and important idea that framed the entirety of our trip, I am deeply grateful.  I read the entire book on the flight from Newark to Tel Aviv, and it was a great way to clarify what we were doing and seeing in our visit to the Holy Land.Ultimately, I would say that this book was less powerful and meaningful to me than the other works of Wright that I've previously read, given its unfortunately broad and sometimes generic approach.  But for those who might wonder whether traveling to Israel has any real value for the Christian or for those who have decided to make the trip but want to orient their intentions and goals rightly, I am happy to recommend this book as a helpful contribution to that conversation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TABZVN3G6NCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802846491#wasThisHelpful","R2TABZVN3G6NCQ","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Holy Land Travel Diary"" was one of several books we snagged before a recent trip to Israel, and it turned out to be a useful guide that, frankly, I wish we had utilized more extensively, as it's so tiny that we basically forgot that we had it for the first several days.  It includes a five-page summary of the history of Israel in the front and four pages of general travel information in the back.  The rest of the book consists of about 25 two-page entries related to various towns or sites around the Holy Land, including Capernaum, Nazareth, Megiddo, Caesarea, Jericho, Bethlehem, the Mount of Olives, the Wailing Wall, the Garden of Gethsemane, the Garden Tomb, and many others.  Each of those entries includes a few sentences of introductory information, the actual text of an entire passage of Scripture, several references to other Bible verses where the location is mentioned in Scripture, some blank lines for note-taking, and a color picture of that site.To be clear, this book is largely informational.  If you're looking for a devotional guide, Wallace's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" functions in that capacity.  But in terms of a simple, informative guide to some of the key sites in Israel, the ""Holy Land Travel Diary"" is a nice tool.  I have no idea why a Table of Contents is not included.  And I would have preferred a bit more content, rather than the blanks spaces, as I'm not sure why anyone would scribble a few notes in a hard-bound book like this.  And, of course, there are many sites and locations that could have been additionally included, as this book is far from comprehensive.  But it's small, thin, and light, which serves a weary Holy Land pilgrim well.  If we ever head back to Israel, I'm sure we'll toss this little book in our bag and try to use it for all it's worth.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VZJB92XXO00Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0856484830#wasThisHelpful","R3VZJB92XXO00Q","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before heading on our first trip to Israel, I picked up a few books that I hoped would add some spiritual depth and Scriptural connections for the various sites that we would see, particularly because we were not going with a tour group with a guide who could make those connections for us.  When ""Pilgrim's Progress"" arrived in the mail, I was surprised by how small it was and was initially disappointed that it wasn't more substantive.  But, in the end, I came to appreciate what this book was and how it helped to serve us on the trip.Ultimately, ""Pilgrim's Progress"" is a collection of about 40 two-page devotionals on a host of different sites from all of Israel.  Each entry includes a recommendation to read an accompanying passage from the Bible, two pages worth of devotional thoughts from the authors, and a concluding prayer.  There is an understandable concentration of entries in Jerusalem (i.e. Mount of Olives, Via Dolorosa, Garden Tomb, Western Wall, etc.), but a number of other important locations (i.e. Masada, Caesarea, Megiddo, Capernaum, etc.) are also included.Because the devotionals were relatively short, I wouldn't say that they were especially profound.  But they certainly helped to ground us in understanding the spiritual relevance of whatever it was that we were observing.  And it was helpful to have a particular passage of Scripture pre-selected for us to read and consider.  Reading those Bible verses was sometimes the most helpful part of the book.  I found most of the prayers to be rather trite and even theologically thin, so we would often just pray on our own in a more personal way.  A final asset of this book is its compact size, which originally disappointed me.  Frankly, we didn't need to be hefting around a twenty-pound book in our bag as we trekked all over Israel, a fact that became increasingly evident as the trip and physical exertion continued throughout the trip.In summary, this book probably isn't going to radically transform anybody's life.  But it's a helpful supplement to the amazing sites that are all over the Holy Land, and if we ever return to Israel, I'm sure we'll tuck this little guide in our bag again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CALMS9FU3LEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0664501273#wasThisHelpful","R3CALMS9FU3LEF","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Just what we need, right?  Another book about how we should read the Bible.  Please feel free to yawn with me.  Evangelicals certainly do love the Bible, yet it's so hard to understand and interpret, so it seems as if there are a few books released every year to help us figure out how to read the Bible ""correctly.""  What could Scott McKnight offer that hasn't already been said a million times before?Well, thankfully, McKnight's ""The Blue Parakeet"" offers much that I think many of us in the evangelical community need to hear.  First and foremost, he lays out a framework for understanding the Bible as story, rather than law book, a collection of blessings and promises, a puzzle to be solved, or any number of other ways that we can view the Bible.  Though I'm not sure that the descriptor of story captures the essence of the Bible entirely (I think that the Bible is too complex and God-sized to be so constrained to any one category or description), I appreciate McKnight's case that engaging with the Bible primarily as a story may be the best and most robust approach.Next, I commend McKnight for acknowledging, in clear and unapologetic terms, that each and every one of us picks and chooses what parts of the Bible we think are applicable for today and what parts were only relevant in another cultural or historical context.  Of course, some will dispute this notion on the grounds of respecting the entirety of Scripture, but McKnight calls their bluff, specifically and insightfully.  And he then proceeds to spend the rest of the book offering us a template for how we should do our picking and choosing in line with God's design and intentions, rather than operating under the common but false premise that we would simply never do such a thing.Finally, I appreciate McKnight's courage to dive into the murky waters of sorting out an appropriate understanding of women in church leadership.  He tackles this issue because it's one in which we need to answer the very real and very hard question of which Scriptures about women in leadership are applicable to us and which Scriptures about women in leadership were culturally and historically specific.  Or, more appropriately, McKnight walks us through the imprecise and uncomfortable process of engaging with the whole Bible as the story of God and how we might use that biblical lens to draw appropriate conclusions about how we might view gender and leadership in our day, in our culture, in our world, in our time.  I'm not ready to concede that I agree with all of McKnight's conclusions on this topic (or any other, for that matter), but his willingness to be specific and clear and definitive was most helpful and quite refreshing.To be sure, I didn't think the book was all that it might have been.  I thought a few of McKnight's points were slightly under-developed or strangely unclear.  And I felt like his tone was unnecessarily harsh as he described people who disagree with his methodology or conclusions.  But I'm very happy that I finally read this book, and I've already given copies to a few folks in my church who I hope will be challenged, as I was, to reconsider how we approach the great blessing of the Word of God and what we're supposed to do with it.  McKnight's contribution to the conversation is helpful, encouraging, and inspiring.  I'm grateful to add this book to my library and expect to return to it often.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R195C0I0MD6594/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310331668#wasThisHelpful","R195C0I0MD6594","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In preparation for an upcoming trip to Israel, I snagged Donald Zeigler's ""Israel,"" a primer in a series called Modern World Nations intended for middle school students.  And though the book was understandably simplistic and dry, this was to be expected for a textbook for teens.  Nonetheless, it was still quite helpful to me, an admitted ignoramus about Middle Eastern politics and history who needed some help understanding some basic facts before I find myself walking around that part of the world.Of particular value in this book was its rather comprehensive approach.  Though only scratching the surface, the author managed to cover a lot of ground, discussing the history and present status of religion, governance, geography, and economics in the fascinating nation of modern Israel.  And to his credit, I thought he did a remarkable job of remaining impartial and even-handed in his descriptions of the obvious tensions that exist between various religious and cultural communities that co-exist very contentiously in the Holy Land.  Of course, another reviewer thought otherwise, and any readers who have a firm commitment that one of the warring parties is the rightful owner of the land of Israel and should have priority and authority over the other will surely be disappointed that the author does not align with their allegiance.  But I commend Zeigler for dispassionately analyzing the reality of Middle East tensions without bowing to the twin dangers of either ignoring the situation altogether or making the book a stump-speech for one particular side.  I found his approach to be tempered and responsible.Of course, there is much more that could have been included.  I would have loved some more serious and thorough engagement with the religious undertones of the historical and present-day tensions.  I think some more maps would have been helpful.  And some further discussion of the more significant historical and sacred sites throughout Israel would have been interesting.  But I need to remember that I'm looking at the book as a prospective tourist, so my interests certainly vary from a middle school student.  Ultimately, I think that this book is a helpful guide for understanding what and who the nation of Israel is in the early part of the 21st-century, and I'm happy to recommend it to other folks like myself who are starting at ground zero and want to build a basic foundation of understanding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K6L1D0BAZA7C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0791092100#wasThisHelpful","R2K6L1D0BAZA7C","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I became a father a few years ago, I've read a handful of books for dads, including Dave Meurer's ""Stark Raving Dad!""  Like others who write in this genre, Meurer attempts to offer a humorous take on the many serious and meaningful aspects of fatherhood.  And though Meurer thankfully avoids the crass and juvenile humor that seems to be prevalent among other comparable books, I did not find ""Stark Raving Dad!"" to be very funny, insightful, or helpful.  Most of the attempted jokes just fell flat to me.  The advice seemed overly simplistic.  And the stories were not especially endearing or compelling.To be sure, I cracked a few smiles, and a few of Meurer's reflections were warmly charming.  I have no doubt that Meurer is a good Christian man and a great father, and this book was certainly written with the best of intentions.  But I didn't find it to be sufficiently engaging in any way that would allow me to wholeheartedly endorse or recommend it.  The funniest and most inspiring books on fatherhood that I've read are Paul Reiser's ""Babyhood"" and ""Familyhood,"" and I'd encourage readers to check out Reiser, who remains my favorite entry into the ""sentimental fatherly humorist"" category.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G9OPJEMMRTRN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0764225464#wasThisHelpful","R1G9OPJEMMRTRN","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a new pastor in campus ministry, Michael Gleason's ""When God Walked on Campus"" was given to me as a sweet gift from a dear friend, and I was excited to read this ""brief history of evangelical awakenings at American colleges and universities,"" to help me to acclimate to the new mission field to which I've been called.  On one level, the book accomplishes its perceived purposes.  After briefly setting the stage, Gleason walks through four distinct, historical eras in American history when God breathed a fresh movement of His Spirit on numerous college campuses all across the country.  And each historical snapshot is followed by the written text of a contemporary preacher from that era who was somehow involved in the work of God during those respective revivals.  Gleason concludes the book with a synopsis of the governing principles that seemed to consistently run through all of four major campus awakenings.To be sure, Gleason's research seems rather comprehensive, as he lists example after example, all with appropriate citations, of the particular revivals that broke out during each era of spiritual awakening.  But this is where the book fell far short of my hopeful expectations.  Rather than telling stories and offering engaging anecdotes and corresponding reflections, the main text of the book really did feel like little more than an elaborate list of events.  ""This happened here.  Then this happened there.  Then this happened here again.""  Though I have every reason to expect that the content is accurate, and the sheer volume of examples is impressive and inspiring, the book failed to really grab my heart in any substantive way.  The amazing work of God throughout history which Gleason was considering in this book seemed ripe for leveraging the power of story, but instead fell rather flat as little more than a fancy list.  And, as a final kicker, the sermons that he included at the end of each chapter were not especially compelling to me.  They were certainly biblically faithful and theologically solid, but they didn't really seem to connect in obvious ways with the unique nature of campus revivals.  Ultimately, they almost felt like filler to me, rather than meaningful additions to the narrative.I suppose this review may seem unfairly harsh.  Ultimately, I'm glad that I read this book, as I now have a clearer and more specific sense of the work that God has done at American colleges over the past several centuries, as I pray towards that same work to happen on our campus and through our ministry.  But the lack of accessibility and engagement makes it difficult for me to recommend this book to others.  For those who want some historical perspective, ""When God Walked on Campus"" offers that.  And the final chapter, in which Gleason summarizes the points of continuity throughout history and offers us principles and patterns of campus revival that we might pursue today, is certainly informative.  But for those, like me, who want to hear powerful and riveting stories of what God has done when He walked on campus, this simply isn't it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DTKTBLHIFSDP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=189440016X#wasThisHelpful","R3DTKTBLHIFSDP","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've known about this book for many years, but after transitioning into a new pastoral role in campus ministry and asking some seasoned campus ministers what books I should read, several of them suggested Robert Coleman's ""The Master Plan of Evangelism.""  So, I dug into this abridged second edition, and I'm certainly glad that I did.The strengths of the book are many.  It is very well-organized and easy to follow.  Coleman basically just looks at the evangelistic strategy of Jesus, breaks it down into eight steps (Selection, Association, Consecration, Impartation, Demonstration, Delegation, Supervision, and Reproduction), and explains how we should follow that example.  The ideas are clear and accessible.  The justification is thoroughly biblical.  And the implications are powerful.  If Jesus decided that investing wholeheartedly in a gang of twelve unpolished newbies was an adequate approach to spreading the gospel and the result was the historical growth of the church over the entire earth throughout the following centuries, then Coleman makes a compelling case that we don't need to invent a fancier model for our ministry to thrive.  I applaud the simplicity and power of this message and look forward to using this framework to shape my leadership for the coming years and decades.My disappointments with the book were few and secondary.  Yes, some of the language and general tone of the book is clearly from another era.  The KJV quotations are clunky.  The writing style is somewhat dry.  But the power and simplicity of Coleman's book remain strong.  I'm glad to have finally read this classic and will happily recommend it to others who are looking for a structure to shape and drive their evangelistic endeavors.  And I hope to continually fine-tune my ability to more closely align my ministry with the world-changing model that Jesus showed us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PNME7APPE014/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0800788087#wasThisHelpful","R2PNME7APPE014","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've served for a number of years at a church where words like ""choice"" and ""options"" are sacrosanct.  The default setting is to assume that more options on the menu will serve more people, thereby furthering God's mission in our community.  And certainly the heart of this philosophy of ministry is pure and gospel-centered.  But I have found that this style of church life leads to fragmentation, disorientation, confusion, waste, and frustration for so many people.  And the ordinary people on the ground, charged with executing the ever-expanding ideas of the visionary leaders, are caught in a pattern of never-ending assignments to support the huge machinery of unfocused ministry.  Having been one of those people and married to another one, it is utterly exhausting, unsustainable, and ultimately counterproductive.So, I am excited for any model of church ministry that points in the direction of focus, consolidation, stream-lining, and clarity.  These ideals just seem like good stewardship to me and offer a church an opportunity to be more effective for the Kingdom of God.  This is where I had hoped that Browning's ""Deliberate Simplicity"" might deliver.  And on one level, ""Deliberate Simplicity"" does describe a very different approach to ministry than what I've personally experienced and observed in so many other overly busy churches.  Browning does describe a laser focus that emphasizes high amounts of energy in only a few directions, rather than a shrapnel-like smattering of energy in a hundred different directions.  And this involves the hard leadership work of saying ""no"" to some very good things so that a church might correspondingly say ""yes"" to very few but even better things.  This overall approach seems much more manageable and sustainable to me, something that I deeply desire in my ongoing ministry in the church.But Browning started to lose me when he elaborated on his ideas of velocity and scalability.  Frankly, at the end of the day, the model that he described seems to offer just another methodology to ensure exhaustion.  Rather than bouncing back and forth from one ministry endeavor to another, Browning seems to assume a willingness to keep grinding out reproductions of the original model, over and over again with increasing speed and franticness.  As I look at his description, I again say, ""No, thanks.""  I got tired just reading about it.I won't pretend to fully understand my own theoretical solution to these complex issues.  I do generally prefer Browning's fundamental simplicity over the ever-expanding smorgasbord that is most familiar to me.  But having watched numerous people faithfully and passionately engage in ministry only to feel like they've been run over by a truck, I'm not satisfied if Browning merely offers an alternative method to grind people into the ground.  I am convinced that there must be ways to do church ministry that aren't primarily defined by exhaustion, and ""Deliberate Simplicity"" did not offer the alternative that I had hoped to find.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L1A4DMWV3862/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310285674#wasThisHelpful","R2L1A4DMWV3862","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up in a household and a church deeply informed by the parenting principles of Dr. James Dobson.  I watched some of his teachings for young people during my teen years.  And I even attended the Focus on the Family Institute, a one-semester study program for college students and recent graduates, at his FOTF headquarters in Colorado Springs.Though I have grown to disagree with some of his teachings and especially his increasing focus on politics instead of the parenting and family issues that gave him his prominent and influential platform, I still think highly of Dr. Dobson.  But ""Love for a Lifetime"" is actually the first of his books that I've ever read.  And, in short, I would summarize that it fell rather squarely within the expectations that I had for it.  The entire book is informed by Dr. Dobson's biblical worldview, and his commitment to his understanding of biblical instruction and godly wisdom shapes each chapter, paragraph, and sentence.  I applaud his consistency and passion, and there is much that married couples in 21st-century America, both young and old, would do well to consider and apply.Having said that, I will admit that this book is showing its age, and that's not necessarily a good thing.  Frankly speaking, Dr. Dobson is an icon of a bygone era, and much of what he thinks and writes will surely seem foreign and even offensive to many readers, including many evangelical Christians.  He has very traditional views of gender roles and rather rigid understandings of gender characteristics.  I think that much of it is generally true and reflects a historical interpretation of Scripture.  But I would suggest that one of Dr. Dobson's points of disconnect with the younger generation of listeners is his inability or refusal to speak about gender issues winsomely and gracefully and humbly.  A generation (or four) ago, this book would have been pure gold.  Right now, I'm sure it will still hit home for some folks, but I'm just as sure that some folks will want to spit and curse.Dr. Dobson apologists will love this book.  Dr. Dobson haters will loathe this book.  I would simply encourage readers to understand what they are getting and adjust expectations accordingly.  There is some great stuff in ""Love for a Lifetime,"" and if you're looking for a relatively short, readable book containing some basic truths about Christian marriage from a very traditional perspective, this will do the trick.  But if you really want to dig in, I'd recommend Gary Thomas' ""Sacred Marriage"" instead, the most insightful and challenging of the many marriage books that I've read and my first recommendation for newlyweds and long-time married folks with a willingness to ponder the depths of God's intention for marriage.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QG9G2PLATX83/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1576737705#wasThisHelpful","R3QG9G2PLATX83","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This collection of three discs contains live recordings of the very best barbershop quartets from 1990-1996.  And if you enjoy barbershop quartet singing, then these tracks will surely be a delight for you.  Most of the songs are classic barbershop arrangements, delivered with vocal excellence, blend, charisma, panache and a bit of humor.  There were a few quartets that get a bit pitchy, which is the great limitation of live recordings.  And there were a few other quartets who were apparently especially enamored with themselves and decided to turn every single note of their songs into an extended fermata, which may be charming to some folks but seemed a bit pompous and unnecessary to me.  But with those few exceptions, this collection contains three discs of barbershop virtuosity.  I have loved listening to it over the years and recommend it to anyone with an appreciation or even just a curiosity about barbershop singing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM7FPGXBSACW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000BH9#wasThisHelpful","R2BM7FPGXBSACW","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a church planter and have no intention of becoming one, but a friend of mine recommended Ben Arment's ""Church in the Making,"" so I decided to give it a read.  And even though I've never planted a church, I've had a front-row seat to watch several failed and struggling plants in our local church community, so I've gathered a few scattered and rather disconnected opinions about that unique corner of churchdom.  Right away, I was thrilled to read Arment's analysis of church planting that put words to my observations and offered the sort of straight-shooting honesty that seems to be sorely missing from so many plants.  He suggests that some church plants should be allowed to die much sooner than they do.  He states that many (or most) church plants are launched far too quickly.  And he even goes so far (as his primary thesis) as to declare that the best church plants are the ones that result from someone being asked to do it within a community where existing relationships have already prepared the ground to bear much fruit (as opposed to random parachute plants by strangers from afar with no understanding of their community context, no relationships to leverage, and no patience to wait for the right time to launch).  And Arment's experience as not only a former church planter himself but also an observer and consultant for numerous plants offers him some personal credibility to make such vital but unexpected assertions.  His honesty and vulnerability about his own struggles and failures as a planter make his ideas ring especially true.I agree with another reviewer that the end of the book moved further into prescriptive details that could be found in any number of standard church leadership books, as he seemed to lose some of the originality that made the opening chapters so compelling to me.  And maybe this is nothing beyond my own natural cynicism, but I couldn't help but periodically wonder if Arment's youth and relative inexperience (as far as I could tell, he planted one slightly successful church before transitioning into other ministry endeavors) offers him sufficient experience to write with such certainty about the complex and diverse world of church planting.  But none of that changes the fact that Arment has some important stuff to say to any would-be, has-been, or current church planter, to help make more sense of the remarkable failure rate for church planting in 21st-century American evangelicalism.  He and I agree that it doesn't need to be so, and several of his reenvisioned notions of what drives church planting might help to improve those sobering statistics.  Whenever I encounter someone considering the brave leap into the risky world of church planting, this is the first book that I'll recommend as a great place to consider some healthy perspectives to offer the best chance for getting a new church off the ground and into the Kingdom mix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QM2KYU2BB9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805464735#wasThisHelpful","R1QM2KYU2BB9X","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was intrigued by the premise of this book, an analysis of the remarkable success stories of five preacher celebrities of the American contemporary evangelical church world of various theological inclinations: Joel Osteen, T.D. Jakes, Brian McLaren, Paula White, and Rick Warren.  And the authors quickly acknowledge that they will be focusing on the marketplace factors that have allowed each of these five preachers to grow large churches and amass international followings and much acclaim (and corresponding disdain).  This marketplace focus derives from the authors' academic fields of sociology and history.  They specifically state that the book does not cover theological terrain and does not critique the spiritual nature of the five subjects because the authors are not theologians.  And from that perspective, what follows is a simple discussion of each of these Holy Mavericks and the various innovations and unorthodox approaches to ministry that has allowed them to thrive.  The authors are careful not to be critical but simply state the facts of what these five pastors have been doing and how those methodologies have led to such outwardly success.  The discussion all falls within the framework of this analytical model (p. 160):  ""The theory of religious economy views churches as firms, pastors are marketers and producers, and church members as consumers whose tastes and preferences shape the goods and services ministers and firms offer.""And that direct quote very succinctly explains the limitations inherent in this approach to analyzing pastoral ministry.  The authors (and their academic predecessors who birthed the theory of religious economy) certainly did not create the notion that there is value in considering logistical and sociological reasons why people are drawn to certain religious approaches, methodologies, and techniques while they are repelled by others.  This idea goes back at least as far as Charles Finney and his honest and practical reflections on the best way to organize his 19th-century revivals.  But there is a point at which this sort of analysis is inadequate or even completely contrary to the gospel.  The church is first and foremost the body of Christ, not a firm.  Pastors are first and foremost shepherds, not marketers and producers.  And church members are first and foremost part of the body of Christ, not consumers.  Just because a spiritual leader makes methodological innovations that draw more people to follow and participate in their church, that does not mean that the innovations are aligned with the Gospel.  In fact, certain innovations of these five prominent church leaders are worthy of careful reflection, criticism and possibly even downright dismissal, but this book never enters that territory.To be clear, I am fine with the decision of the authors to stay within their fields of expertise and training.  I am quite certain that this book has the potential to offer interesting insight into the sociology of religion that academics may more fully appreciate than I did.  And I certainly learned some interesting information about the backgrounds, stories, and leadership innovations of the five featured preachers, some of which may someday inform my own pastoral ministry (both in terms of what I want to mimic and what I want to avoid).  But for those outside the relevant academic circles, I would only recommend reading this book in tandem with Skye Jethani's ""The Divine Commodity,"" which offers a helpful corrective to some of the basic assumptions of the theory of religious economy that run directly in contrast to the gospel of Jesus Christ, which should be the nexus of the innovative leadership of all servant leaders of Christ but far too often holds only a peripheral place.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16P9974O353N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0814752357#wasThisHelpful","R16P9974O353N2","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I consider C.S. Lewis to be the finest author of the 20th century, and I think that several of his books are genuine, timeless classics.  So, I'm always interested in reading anything that I can find that he's written.  And there is a thriving publishing industry of collections of snippets from Lewis, some of which are fabulous and others which are mostly forgettable.  ""C.S. Lewis on Love"" falls primarily in the latter, though it is not entirely without commendation.This book is a compilation of a few dozen blurbs from Lewis about love, related to various sub-themes (marriage, sex, friendship, forgiveness, etc.)  But some problems with this format tamper my enthusiasm for this project.  First, Lewis writes with such depth and complexity that he is not easily excerpted.  And as the editor acknowledges in the preface, love is not a topic on which Lewis necessarily wrote with great focus and frequency, at least not in excerpt-able form.  To be sure, love is integrated within most of his writing, but in a way that requires greater space and depth than what can be pulled out in a paragraph or two.  Lewis offered reflections about love in a much more organic way than what can be readily sliced and diced into a ""greatest quotes"" collection.The two major places where he wrote about love are the books ""The Four Loves"" and ""Mere Christianity,"" and not surprisingly, those sources offer the vast majority of quotes in this book.  And the quotes that emerge from those two books are wonderful, several of which I cite with regularity in my preaching and even general conversation.  But, as is always the case with excerpts, the power of those quotes is somewhat mitigated by their removal from context.  Frankly, I'd encourage anyone to read the original books.  ""Mere Christianity"" is one of the finest books that I've ever read, and ""The Four Loves,"" though decidedly less remarkable, offers many helpful contributions to my understanding of love. Beyond the excerpts from those two books, many of the other snippets are really quite forgettable, further validating that love simply was not a theme about which Lewis spent much focused and isolated attention.Having offered my critique, there is no doubt that Lewis' unique and brilliant way of articulating godly and helpful insight about so many topics is not lost in this book.  Lewis has some great stuff to say about love.  So, if you need a quick entry point into Lewis, this isn't a terrible place to start.  And if you want a coffee table book or a book to place in a waiting room or a bathroom for short bursts of reading, this offers some fabulous soundbites of Lewis' profundity.  But if you really want to dig into C.S. Lewis, you really ought to start with ""Mere Christianity,"" then move on to ""The Screwtape Letters,"" ""The Great Divorce,"" and any of his other classic works.  Time spent with the words of C.S. Lewis is always time well spent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WDEK6F7PNLZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0785270981#wasThisHelpful","R1WDEK6F7PNLZH","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge fan of Bill Cosby.  I grew up with ""The Cosby Show"" and still consider it one of television's best sitcoms.  I later discovered his stand-up comedy work, have gone to several of his shows, and was very favorably impressed.  But I'd never read any of his books before my wife gave me a copy of his ""Fatherhood.""  And I was genuinely excited to enter this new medium to experience the unique combination of warmth and humor that Cosby provides in his inimitable way.  Ultimately, the book was fine but largely unremarkable.In trying to figure out why I didn't enjoy this book more, I've decided that the problem is the transmission of Cosby's style of humor into the written word.  It seems to me that Cosby's genius is his facial expressions and vocal patterns.  Though he's certainly an intelligent man, I wouldn't describe him as a wordsmith.  So, many of his jokes in this book just didn't work in this medium.  Of course, some of the material came straight from his stand-up routines or from The Cosby Show, and as I could imagine Cosby delivering the lines, they elicited some chuckles.  But, in general, his written humor felt a bit flat to me.And the introduction and afterword by a professional psychiatrist, I suppose intended to provide some more intellectual heft to a book that was mostly silly and hyperbolic, was odd and disconnected from Cosby's stuff.  The good doctor's advice was dry and pedantic and just plain boring.  Given Cosby's commitment to education and families, I imagine that he envisioned this additional content to be a way to help inject a slice of serious parenting advice into the minds of readers who will readily read a book by a comedian but might not otherwise read a book about fatherhood.  I appreciate the sentiment but thought it was poorly executed.To be sure, Bill Cosby is Bill Cosby, so there is some funny stuff in this book.  And it was even funny to read anecdotes or punchlines that I've already heard from his stand-up or television work.  But in the category of funny books about family written by comedians, I'd much more readily recommend Paul Reiser's ""Couplehood,"" ""Babyhood,"" and ""Familyhood,"" as Reiser's humor translates much more effectively to the written word.  I still appreciate Cosby and might even give another one of his books a try, but ""Fatherhood"" didn't do much for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TNF24T2L7VIL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006G840EW#wasThisHelpful","R1TNF24T2L7VIL","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors, and I consider his ""Mere Christianity"" and ""The Screwtape Letters"" to be two of the finest books written in the 20th century.  But I must admit that some of his stuff is rather grueling to read.  ""The Abolition of Man"" was one of the more laborious that I've read, and though not to that same extent, I would categorize ""The Four Loves"" similarly.To be sure, ""The Four Loves"" offers some fascinating insight into the four different types of love that Lewis describes: affection (family love), friendship, eros (romantic love), and charity.  His analysis of these different loves helps to explain how and why we can profoundly love different people in substantially distinct ways.  I especially appreciated some of his critique of how modern assumptions about romantic love have created vastly dysfunctional and destructive patterns of relationships.  I was able to borrow a few quotes from the ""Friendship"" chapter for a sermon that I recently preached about relationships.  And Lewis is always Lewis, finding clever ways to explain very profound ideas and putting words to things that we've all felt in the past but have previously been unable to articulate.However, ""The Four Loves"" was definitely more laborious for me to read than most of Lewis' other work that I've read.  Several of his main themes (the distinctions between ""need-love"" and ""gift-love,"" for instance) were so abstract that I really struggled to follow his reasoning.  And even when I was able to decipher what he was saying, I struggled to understand how his ideas even mattered.  Lewis' gift as an author is taking high-minded, intellectual stuff and bringing it down to earth, to make it accessible to normal folks like me.  I just never felt like ""The Four Loves"" ever really landed, but instead stayed in the philosophical stratosphere.  It's a fine and decent book which offers some interesting food for thought about the nature of love.  And there are definitely some sound bites that provide great quotes to share in various contexts.  But I'd easily recommend a dozen other book by Lewis before I'd point someone in this direction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28HVJX1VFRY21/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0156329301#wasThisHelpful","R28HVJX1VFRY21","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard Randy Frazee speak at a conference years ago about much of the content contained in his book, ""Making Room for Life,"" and have always remembered and even taught and preached about some of his ideas over the years.  Having been rather captivated by what I remembered, I finally read the book to reiterate and clarify some of his ideas, and it was definitely time well spent.Frazee begins the book by describing the lifestyle that a significant number of middle-class, suburban Americans experience throughout their lifetimes.  This crowded loneliness, in which we scurry about from day to day, frantically trying to keep our heads above water, as we pass hundreds of strangers while meaningfully interacting with no one, including our family members.  Many of us have at least some familiarity with the mess that he describes, and it's distasteful at best and utterly disheartening at worst.  For the rest of the book, Frazee proposes a completely radical solution to the problem.Frazee's radical solution requires a complete shift in priorities, focus, and thinking.  He advocates the Hebrew Day planner, an ancient daily schedule that allows for work from 6:00am to 6:00pm, relational time from 6:00pm to 10:00pm, and sleep from 10:00pm to 6:00am on six days a week and a true, fully practiced weekly Sabbath rest.  He advocates finding employment that allows the work day to end no later than 6:00pm, every day.  He advocates living close to work, to minimize wasted time in commutes.  He advocates minimizing organized children's activities, to curb more commuting and allow for more natural kids' play.  He advocates a consolidation of relationships around proximity, where the neighborhood becomes the nexus for adult friendships, kid friendships, church friendships (i.e. small groups), evangelism, service, and virtually everything else.  He advocates simple living in smaller houses with less stuff, supported by smaller incomes (preferably one).In short, Frazee advocates the abandonment of the mutilated version of the American Dream to which many of us are still clinging, even though we know full well that it is disfigured and dying.  We are a people driving ourselves into the ground, trying to be filled with activity and flurry and accumulation and leisure, while all the while knowing that much of what we pursue is gross.  Frazee offers an alternative.Critics suggest that Frazee's model for life is idealistic, unrealistic, and archaic.  If we hope to cling onto any significant portion of the trappings of 21st-century American suburban madness, then this claim is probably true.  But Frazee isn't suggesting that we tweak the system to try to make things a little bit better.  Instead, he offers a comprehensive paradigm shift, an opportunity to start over and get it right.I credit Frazee with shooting straight with us, with calling out the ridiculousness of our lives, made all the more absurd because we know we hate so much of it.  Yet, what he advocates is so radical, so outside the box, that I'm not sure what to do with it.  Frankly, I'm not sure that I want to go as far as he has gone, not sure that I want to give up all that he suggests.  I am challenged by his book, and I am motivated to change.  But I'm not sure that I'm willing to go where he calls me to go.One of my biggest points of dissonance with the book is its remarkable specificity.  If you want to design your life in imitation of an ideal, Frazee basically offers the complete template.  But I'm left pondering if some of the big ideas of this new way of life are attainable with some shifts and adjustments.  For instance, Frazee is dogmatic about the precise time-frames (6am to 6pm for work, 6pm to 10pm for relationships, 10pm to 6am for sleep).  Is there any reason why I couldn't shift the whole thing two hours later, since I'm pretty sure that all alarm clocks in Satan's domain are set for 6:00am?  Of course, I can try it and see how it goes, but I just wish that the general tone of Frazee's book was a bit more descriptive and a little less prescriptive.To be sure, ""Making Room for Life"" is provocative in all of the best ways.  This is a book that I know will surely impact my thinking for years to come, and I do hope to read it with others to foster some really good conversation.  I share Frazee's frustration of so many ills of modern American life, and I appreciate his general diagnosis of the problem.  The extent to which I resonate with all of his solutions remains to be seen, but I admire his commitment to doing something, to changing something, to taking some steps to do life differently.  I doubt that I'll ever commit full-scale to his plan, but there is much wisdom to be gleaned from a different way to think, work, love, and live.  I'm grateful to Frazee for this contribution and happy to recommend this book to anyone willing to consider if there might be a different way, a better way, to make room for more of the life that God intends for us to live.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIDMM2IQIGXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310250161#wasThisHelpful","R2AIDMM2IQIGXG","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a pastor, I read a fair number of books, many on Christian living and church leadership.  I like some, I loathe a few, and I find many to be fine but unremarkable.  Without a doubt, Mark Buchanan's ""The Rest of God"" falls in the former category.  In fact, I've been telling friends that this is one of the best books that I've read in years, and further reflection affirms that assessment.  I've been wanting to read this book, and I'm so glad that I finally did.The strengths of ""The Rest of God"" are both in its content and its style.  Buchanan's writing is both intellectually stimulating but also fully accessible.  It is an engaging book to read, but not at all laborious to finish.  It is thoroughly biblical but completely practical.  It is very specific without being legalistic and overly regimented.  It is completely convicting while also offering hope and encouragement.I won't attempt to summarize the substance of the book in this review, as that would only short-change Buchanan's commendable book.  I will simply acknowledge that ""The Rest of God"" has changed my thinking and affected my life.  When I finish most books, at best I'm usually able to say that it was interesting or challenging, but I'm rarely changed in significant ways.  When I finished ""The Rest of God,"" I immediately changed my weekly rhythms of rest.  Thanks to Buchanan's challenge, I am thoroughly convinced that I have never really experienced Sabbath rest as God intends, and I want to live differently.  Even for the most skeptical of readers, I happily recommend ""The Rest of God,"" without hesitation, as a remarkable journey into the life that God desires for all of us to experience.  I know that I have been changed, and I suspect that this book will shape my life for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20WRPFHTEGUCQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0849918480#wasThisHelpful","R20WRPFHTEGUCQ","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Other than the snippets from his long-running TV show, I'd never seen Jerry Seinfeld's stand-up comedy, which means that I'd never seen his act for more than 30- or 45-second sound bites.  But having enjoyed the shows and those snippets, I was excited to see this collection of old jokes when it was released years ago, as he was supposedly retiring all of his old material.  And this became an instant favorite in our house.The opening sequence, a fake funeral where his old jokes are buried in a casket surrounded by a bunch of famous comedians, was cheesy and unnecessary.  But once Seinfeld got on stage, he's laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish.  One sure sign of good comedy is its ability to elicit laughter even when the audience knows the punch lines before they are spoken.  Having watched this show many times, I remember most of the jokes in advance.  Yet, I laugh constantly.  His writing is brilliant.  His delivery is perfect.  It never stoops to low-brow, sophomoric junk.  It's classic stuff.Whenever we are inspired to rewatch this disc, it never disappoints.

"In preparation for preaching a sermon about Sabbath rest, I stumbled upon Dan Allender's book ""Sabbath"" and plowed through it in a few days.  Having previously read a marriage book by Allender and not being overly impressed, I was hoping that a vastly different topic would bring out his strengths as an author.  Though the book certainly wasn't a total loss, I was generally disappointed.The greatest strength of ""Sabbath"" was Allender's repainting the Sabbath canvas in terms of what we should pursue, rather than merely the avoidance of work.  He went to great lengths to articulate his vision for Sabbath that primarily centers around joy and delight as the ultimate goals.  He offered a number of specific examples, especially from his own life, that helped to make those potentially abstract ideas a bit more concrete, and I was quite compelled and inspired by much of what he shared to pursue comparable ideals for my own Sabbath rhythms.But as much as I grabbed hold of the notion that Sabbath rest should be about joy and delight, I struggled throughout the book to track with Allender's style.  His writing is so poetic, so abstract, and so meandering that I often found myself thoroughly perplexed about where he was going.  His language is so creative that it often just doesn't make sense.  I've heard from folks who I know who thought this book was utterly fabulous, so I suppose that my disconnect was probably more about stylistic preference than about the actual content of the book.  I didn't disagree with him or think he was out-of-line.  I just struggled far too often to track with his points.As someone with a lousy personal Sabbath history, I was glad to read this book to get me inspired to think differently, or even to just think at all, about what God might intend for Sabbath.  And I really did appreciate the inspiration to pursue joy and delight in my future Sabbath commitments.  But as other reviewers have suggested, I'd recommend Mark Buchanan's ""The Rest of God"" as a more comprehensive, more accessible, more tangible, clearer guide to challenge and motivate us to wholeheartedly receive God's gift of Sabbath.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HHQ5G1FN5U5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030EG0ZW#wasThisHelpful","R36HHQ5G1FN5U5","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I heard Bill Hybels speak about his ""Holy Discontent"" idea at the Leadership Summit several years ago, shortly before this book was published, so I was introduced to the idea at that time.  And several others at our church have read the book and listened to his talk, so the phrase ""holy discontent"" has been part of our shared vocabulary for awhile.  But I finally actually read the book and learned more about what I've been contemplating and discussing all this time.As I had hoped, Hybels offers an inspirational charge in ""Holy Discontent.""  He suggests that each of us has a gnawing, perturbing, irritating frustration with something that we observe in the world around us, and when that frustration aligns with the concerns of the heart of God, we have available to us the most holy form of motivation to get out there and do something to right that wrong.  It's a simple but very compelling concept, especially when illustrated with a dozen or more stories of the work that God's people have done and are doing all over the world when their energies have been catalyzed by the fire of the Holy Spirit to do His work.And having read many of Hybels' books before, this one followed suit as extremely readable and totally accessible, not some sort of high-minded, theologically-dense tome.  I read this over the course of a few days and could probably have read it in one sitting if so inclined.  And, as such, this brings me to my primary critique of the book.  It felt a bit thin to me, rather lacking in substance in some places where I wanted to hear more.  What do I do if I sometimes feel like I have a dozen holy discontents?  Is it possible for some people to have one life-long holy discontent while others experience a series of shifting holy discontents throughout their lives?  These sorts of questions were barely addressed, but I would have appreciated more reflection along those lines.Frankly, Hybels covered this material extremely well in his Summit talk.  If you've heard him talk about it, the book doesn't add a lot of additional material.  But if you're unfamiliar with the concept, unable to access any of his talks on the topic, or simply prefer to read rather than listen/watch, I'm happy to recommend ""Holy Discontent"" as a solid, helpful, and challenging book.  The world would be better off, the church would be more effective, and God would be more glorified if we were all willing to listen to the stirring within our hearts and minds and responded accordingly to pursue the holy discontent that God has placed within each one of us.Update:  I recently ""reread"" the book via the audiobook version, and my impressions were similar to the first time.  ""Holy Discontent"" is a book filled with an interesting and helpful idea, though it's less thorough than I would have preferred.  If you've never encountered Hybels' thesis before, it's well worth your time to investigate this small book.  But once you've heard the basic explanation, other resources are definitely necessary to fully unpack what it means to pursue the passion borne out of frustration that God has given to many of us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QB28QKZ6X9UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0310272289#wasThisHelpful","R1QB28QKZ6X9UL","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year, I stumbled upon Paul Reiser's ""Couplehood"" and ""Babyhood"" and absolutely devoured them.  They were very easy to read and simply hysterical, with many parts that I simply had to read out-loud to my wife after chuckling so much that she needed to know what was so funny.  So, when I saw that Reiser recently released ""Familyhood,"" I couldn't wait to read it.  I was thrilled when my wife purchased it for my birthday, and I read it in bed over the course of just a few nights.Like Reiser's previous books, this one is extremely easy to read.  His writing style is accessible, pleasant, and informal, and it feels as much like a conversation as an actual book.  But it seemed to me as if the overall tone of this book is different from its two predecessors.  The first two seemed to be primarily comedic, with a few drops of poignancy and seriousness interspersed throughout the jokes.  But ""Familyhood"" was much more serious in overall tone, with a few drops of comedy interspersed throughout the poignant anecdotes.  And the funny stuff in this one elicited more wry smiles than outright belly laughs.But let me be clear in stating that this is not a bad thing.  Amazingly (and contrary to his renowned career in comedy), Reiser handles the serious stuff with aplomb.  Maybe this change in tone reflects his maturation through life or the difficulties in raising a son with significant physical disabilities.  In any case, the shift was not uncomfortable or inappropriate.  Though it didn't quite fit my expectations, based on the first two books, ""Familyhood"" is still a book worth reading for anyone interested in hearing one man's honest reflections on the joys and sorrows, the victories and trials, that family life brings to all of us.  Frankly, whenever Reiser produces ""Emptynesthood"" or ""Retirementhood"" or ""Oldhood,"" I'll anxiously await the opportunity to read it.  This funnyman familyman has quickly become one of my favorite authors.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZQZMWKWVZJZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401324320#wasThisHelpful","RZQZMWKWVZJZ8","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My aunt passed along her copy of ""F in Exams"" and recommended that I read it, and I'm glad that I did.  It's really simple book, easily read in 15-20 minutes.  And the silly and/or ridiculous answers offered by students to these exam questions were truly priceless.  Mostly, I read the book with a wry smile on my face, and I actually laughed out-loud several times.  As a former student who frequently tried to have some fun when I was thoroughly stumped by a test question, I genuinely appreciated the futile attempts throughout this book.  No, this is not a great work of literature.  And, yes, it's hard to imagine that some of these answers were actually written on actual tests by actual students.  But it's a lot of fun, a quick read, and a great way to pass some time and enjoy a few chuckles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VMYSJYZZCS5R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0811878317#wasThisHelpful","R3VMYSJYZZCS5R","A3SHA4Y9DHEK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SHA4Y9DHEK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"4.5/5Honestly I felt this book was even better than #1.  Sebastian was so much easier to accept and had a greater depth than I was expecting.  I sympathized with him and also loved Kaderin as she wasn’t like other heroines.  She took hard to get to a whole new level and not because she was playing games.  The internal battle she fought with herself and the difficult choice she had to make at the end made her character such a vibrant and fun one to read.So the break down is thus, Kaderin can’t feel anymore, a gift from a god of some sort after the death of her sisters because normally Valkyrie dye from sorrow but she was so strong she wasn’t but she was effecting the other Valkyrie with her sorrow.  So one day she wakes up and all emotion is gone and that includes the even sexual ones.  She walks around this way for as long as anyone can remember earning her the name Kaderin the Cold Hearted.  She mercilessly hunts and kills Vampires and one such vampire lives in an abandoned castle and she is asked to dispatch him. She arrives, he gives her his neck willingly only she hesitates. . .the first time since becoming emotionless.  Things explode from there as the pull between them becomes evident.  Sebastian realizes right away what she is to him and Kaderin FEELS and it scares the crap out of her not to mention she hates vampires.Thus begins the chase, only this time it is a vampire hunting Kaderin and not for her death.  This allowed for some fun interactions and some great comedic moments.  I love Ms. Cole’s writing and this story is no different.  I was swept away on a fun adventure  and the movement of the story is brought about by the use of a race between immortals like the Amazing Race only immortal style.I always am checking on books in the series to see when some go on sale and trying to grab them even if out of order because I know I will be reading this entire series.And I dare to say that I am enjoying this series more than JR Wards Black Dagger Brotherhood.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394756WWCMJK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MGATUI#wasThisHelpful","R394756WWCMJK8","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5/5I was captivated and really intrigued once I started reading this book and was really eager to find where things would go.  I found the character likable and related to them as living breathing people who do interesting and sometimes silly things.  The story while emotionally compelling was lighthearted and even at times funny.  I found myself smiling many times at some of the situations Mili finds her in, or things that Samir did.  This really had the trappings of a rom com movie in my head.  I kept playing scenes from Bend it Like Beckham too (the only movie I can think of with Indian themes similar to this that had the music and dancing that I could thus picture so vividly).One funny quote from Mili that I loved was:“No, it’s raining, but only on my face.”Overall this was a fun read that took me just a few days to get through.  While I did enjoy it overall there were a few issues I had with it that kept me from feeling like it was a home run.The book was a little drawn out for me.  It was great that the relationship between Mili and Samir was given the time and attention it needed to build and establish an actual connection rather than the insta loves we love to hate and hate to love and bitch and moan about.  That said I still felt like it dragged a bit and needed either more momentum or something left out.This next part is less with the story and more the set up of the book.  It switched between Mili and her life and Samir and his life without anything to signal it.  One paragraph I am reading about Mili, the next one Samir and several times in the beginning I would have to stop and reread it several times before realizing what happened.  I am use to some sort of break to signify a change, such as *** between the paragraphs that gives the reader a heads up and says “Hey! Something changes here.”  This is just a pet peeve of mine though so don’t take too much from it and just use it as a forewarning so you can expect it.She has sex for the first time up against a tree and then several more times that night.  This is her first time and while the author describes her crying out in pain when her hymen is torn it just felt a little unbelievable.  Especially considering how rough the guy takes her:“He slammed into her, mindless frantic thrusts until he exploded, and exploded and exploded without end.”Uhh.. . great for a story but not if you want to be true to life because any guy doing that to a virgin the first time will most likely have a woman in serious pain. (Yes I realize some people have had glorious first times, kudos to you.  You probably orgasm on command too).There is also a part in the story where Mili tells Samir that his story isn’t a decent story because the main character shouldn’t loose something he loves but instead the story should almost take it away and also only take away something he thinks he might love.  It is very similar to how this story felt and I am not sure if that was a good thing.  Great emotional depth can come from a character loosing something he loves and  yes it doesn’t always need to happen but this story while very well written and enjoyable almost seemed superficial, like it had yet to really scratch the surface of what it could have.  This resulted in me satisfied but also vaguely left wanting.Overall a very enjoyable, lighthearted read and I had fun with Mili and Samir.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NV9I5YFAUEE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVW6GQ0#wasThisHelpful","R3NV9I5YFAUEE4","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5/5So I am in my local walmart (hahah, local, it is 1 hour away from me but it is the nearest one to me) and it was one of “those” days there which meant waiting in line an hour to check out (I kid you not).  So the husband and I took turns going off to do something other than stare at the persons back that was in front of us.  I of course found my way to the books, saw The Martian and just had been hearing some friends online talking about the awesomeness that was the book.  So I grabbed it and went back to the waiting line of forever and started reading it.Firstly, I wasn’t expecting it to be so freaking witty!  Here we have a book that the majority of the story is a guy alone and with such little interaction with another person you wouldn’t think you would be able to laugh and smile as much as I did while reading it.  The character was amazing.  He was sarcastic and upbeat and cracked jokes in the face of such adversity it was beyond amazing.  Mark Watney was instantly a guy you wanted to be friends with in real life.  He was a well developed and interesting character and I was eager to see how he would manage the next situation he found himself in.So for the record: I LOVED THIS BOOK. READ IT.  it was amazing, a page turner, one I talked with my husband about and while my husband isn’t a reader he was interested in this book so hung on my every words as I gave him the break down.  Needless to say he will happily see the movie when we can rent it.So that all said, I had one issue with this book.  It is kind of spoiler like but not really but kind of.  It is based off information we are given early on (in the sample even) and while it doesn’t make me take away from the rating it gnaws upon my brain and is driving me crazy.  So if you want to know what I had issue with check out my original review on my blog and I will say this much: antibiotics.Of note, the last quarter of the book started to drag for me, it might have been all the science being repeated, and Watney repeating some of the things he said earlier so I started skimming.  I didn’t need to be reminded of those things told before and by this point I didn’t care much about all the science, I just wanted to know what happened to Watney! I still loved it.Loved the book, save my one issue with that early part and I guess the last quarter.  This book was very technical and scientific but it was explained in a great way by the ever charismatic Watney so that it doesn’t matter if you have a science mind or not you would enjoy the read. I am blown away that this is Andy Weir’s first book, he hit it out of the park.  If you have been considering reading this one I say go for, grab it!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RGMM5HI6AE67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EMXBDMA#wasThisHelpful","R2RGMM5HI6AE67","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5/5I really enjoyed the first book int he Searching For series, Searching for Someday, and  had a good time reading this one as well.  It is a contemporary romance with humor and a hint, like just a hint, so much a hint I don't know why I even mention it, of magic.  Watching Kennedy and Nate get to know each other was enjoyable and kept me interest through out the read.The plot is predictable, the story not so knew but still the read was fun and endearing.  Ken sees a challenge in helping Nate find his forever wife.  There is the reference to how he is her Eliza from my fair lady in how she wishes to help transform his exterior so people will stop and give his interior a chance. I think for me this was a little bit of a sticking point for me, the whole emphasis on personal appearance and changing his.  Granted her work wasn't just in appearance but making him think before he speaks so he doesn't insult women anymore with his very straight to the point attitude.This book while emphasizing outward appearance also dives into body issues, eating disorders and bullying to help bring balance.  We get to see a depth to each character that is more than just scratching the surface but still would have enjoyed a bit more.I am actually quite enchanted with this series and want to read the next two in the series, especially because the side characters they bring in our intriguing and captivating enough that you want to learn more about them.  I honestly kind of feel that Jennifer Probst with this series especially is one I would read when I want a Penny Reid or Daisy Prescott'esque read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR9L3VJROUSYS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSBVIHE#wasThisHelpful","RR9L3VJROUSYS","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2.5/5This book was free and looked cute so I grabbed it up to hold for a day when it fit my mood.  A couple months later I finally opened it up and what I got was a bit surprising.  Basically I was disappointed.  Xavier is an a$$.  I have read many books with guys who are asses, it is fine when they have redeeming qualities but I really could find none in Xavier.  Further more his character did not seem well established.  One minute he is one way and the next another resulting in mental whiplash.  It almost seemed like his character had not been fully fleshed out.  There were times when I was liking him but again the mental whiplash would occur when his a$$hole tendency reared it's ugly head in a way so unneeded and unattractive that I found no inherent desire for this character in anyway.Then there is Lola, a strong independent young woman who seems to have a back bone and no fear but at the same time is annoyingly naive.  Why, WHY would you go work for him?  I felt like I was getting to know her character well enough by the time she made this decision that she would have told him to eff off and turned the offer down but instead becomes this big pile of stupid and does it anyways.I have read many books where the female lead is attracted to the male a$$hat and is conflicted by their desire and their dislike of the guy but 1) usually the guy has one redeeming quality that you latch onto because it results in endearing him to you, the reader, and the female lead 2)They at least seem to have a bit of a back bone and must be somewhat seduced or placed into needing to do something they don't want to because of extraneous circumstances.Overall just a let down and not a series I feel compelled to continue reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTNZKWIAQKG1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K31DCD8#wasThisHelpful","RTNZKWIAQKG1I","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"4.5/5I decided to grab this book because I had heard from several people they were enjoying it and had even heard mentioned that it was giving a Love Hacked vibe and we all know how much I love Penny Reid.The first few chapters in were a bit Rocky for me.  The Characters of Kate and Ian were first introduced but the introduction wasn't grabbing me.  I hung on and I am glad I did because the story and the characters felt like they solidified and was better at grabbing me after the initial few chapters.The story was fun and light hearted and warmed the heart.  You cheer for the characters and feel invested in them.There were some cons I had and I have a feeling this is in part to my going in being told about the Love Hacked vibe and because of that I want to say don't go in thinking you are getting a book exactly like Love Hacked, it isn't and personally to me they don't compare even with the premise and qwerky parts.Cons:Weak side characters.  The story really only built up Kate and Ian.  Towards the end you got more of other characters but you didn't feel invested in them, I didn't feel like I wanted to know more about them.  I like having strong side characters that make the story feel bigger rather than a small tiny bubble and for most of the story you lived in a tiny bubble with the characters.  This is fine for certain stories (such as this authors first book I read, On the Island, because well they lived on a freaking island by themselves ;) ) but I think this book could have benefited more from better side characters.Furthermore there were no surprises in the book, and it felt rather predictable.  I like a little mystery to the story, things that I wouldn't expect even if small are nice.Again for me the weak start.  I already elaborated on that though.There was good to this story of course I wouldn't be rating it as I have.  I did feel like it was teaching me a little bit about things in life(hacking and how it affects my day to day life) and the characters both served a greater purpose.  What I mean is the characters had depth and wanted to do more for others which helped make them likable, fun and enjoyable to read. You really rooted for them.The story is full and complete leaving me satisfied at the end and once I got past the rocky for me beginning I was captivated and engaged and wanted to read on.An enjoyable read for when you are looking for something fun, modern, filled with qwerkiness and humor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNE1Z3M6GPY2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCUGPXK#wasThisHelpful","RNE1Z3M6GPY2C","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5/5I had been hearing from some that this series was a good one and when I saw that the box set was free I decided to grab it.  I quickly ate it up and enjoyed it enough to know I will be getting book #4 sometime in the future.The stories where simple yet captivating and provided that alpha male read I was craving.  The gals are a bit of the damsels in distress but it worked out okay for the type of read I was expecting.The stories didn't feel like anything greatly unique but were different enough that they kept my interest and I enjoyed my read.I wasn't sure how I was going to feel going in, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The Russian aspect was worked in nicely as to these stories taking place in the US, Texas to be more specific. The women for each book were unique and strong in their own way.  The men are very similar but yet has his own story that brings out their unique moments.  I am really intrigued to find out more about Nikolai as his story and Vivian's screams of past and turmoil.Underlying themes in the books are drugs, theft, corruption, mobs, gangs, all things I don't read a lot of but the stories were done well enough that they didn't bother me and I kept wanting to read more.Overall I am glad I read them and will at some point check out the other books in the series. So why 3.5?  The stories were predictable, they didn't feel like something completely fresh and new.  They lacked a depth I would have liked especially in the men (though I am thinking book #4 might actually give me that depth).  Very much a simple Alpha male with eyes only for her read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NTLVTSWVP1OE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAZA9AC#wasThisHelpful","R1NTLVTSWVP1OE","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved Sweet Filthy Boy which was the first book in the series and couldn’t help but be excited to read Finn and Harlow’s story.  I will admit the beginning while captivating and engaging felt a little bland for me.  It was a good story, kept my interest but it was sitting for a while feeling like just another story of boy and girl fight attraction with some kinky rope play.  HOWEVER, the last 25% really turned my view around.  I became emotionally invested in the character’s relationship at this point because this book pulled out the feels. Not only that but I felt like it was here there was some uniqueness to the story helping it be set apart by the way Finn reacted to events that took place and his choice in response.  I don’t want to give anything away but at this point my heart broke and I thought “a**hole!” and yeah I couldn’t wait to see what Harlow did next, or him.  I didn’t expect some things to end up how they did and I enjoyed that so definitely the last quarter changed my mind on this read.

"A fun, endearing, bittersweet, romantic comedy that had me glued to my kindle staying up until midnight trying to cram as much time in as possible.  I loved Honey, name and all and Hal was one I had to warm up to but he had me in the end.  This story was so very sweet and had a full house of great supporting side characters to help propel the story, engage me and make me laugh.  I could see this book playing out perfectly on the screen and Honey was the reason for it.  Sometimes naive and very stubborn she had a way about her you couldn't help but admire.  Of course the constant knock downs by Hal made it hard for me to accept the attraction she felt for a little bit but she had the proper internal push and pull going on that allowed me to accept and understand.  The side stories of the home, Millie and Lucille's life and Nell and Simon brought not only great variety, but depth and intrigue.  Even in moments that should be slow there was enough going on not to drag it down.  Sadly the end as great as it was did not have an epilogue and I fear I have become quite addicted to those and getting a short quick glance into the lives of the characters I have grown to love down the road.

"This story was captivating enough that I read it within 24 hours and enjoyed my time spent reading it.  However, I am not sure I have the drive at this exact time to read book #2 in the series yet because I don’t feel personally invested in the characters in such a way that I MUST KNOW what happens next.  Heath Lawson was a desirable enough male lead that I respected him and rooted for him.  The way he helped Allie in the beginning, in a very unexpected way for me, was what endeared me to him from the start not just the fact that he is some attractive fighter.  His quick turn around from manwhore to one woman man was a little cliched for me without a bit more interaction/time and perhaps back story or desire in their history.Allie frustrated me a bit.  I liked her strong character, you could tell she was a fighter even being so young, she just turned 18,  and in unimaginable circumstances.  Still I wish I felt from her conviction about her break up with Ryker more.  I felt if that had been stronger from the start, especially her anger I would have enjoyed the evolving relationship between her and Heath much more. I realize that might have been done to give reason for more of her back and forth, fighting the attraction, etc.  Still a little more developing of her feelings in this area was needed in my opinion.For the most part the characters felt more 1 dimensional than I would have liked for a story that had the possibility of having some characters with great depth and intrigue.  More on Allie and school and her drive with that would have made her pop more.  Or more of her interactions outside of the apartment with Heath would have allowed me to see more sides to her. The story was also lacking in depth and felt rather basic at times but still had the intrigue I needed to remain involved.Ryker is an interesting character who becomes such right at the end when we are given a back history of his side of things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CN454FM6FYBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P46P3XY#wasThisHelpful","R1CN454FM6FYBN","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a very sweet story that centers on Corey Callahan and her first year of college a year after an accident that leave her paralyzed from the waist down.  From the start I loved Corey because of her strength and resolve to continue on with her life though it meant morning the loss of a life she thought she would have.  Adam Hartley is a charismatic and good heart guy who is a bit lost at times.  I wanted to give him a good shake down but the maturity Corey displayed helped soften the frustration for me.  We get a taste of college life experienced by someone who can't live it as the average college student would.  I wanted to know what happened next, I loved the blossoming relationship between Hartley and Callahan.  That said there was a depth in each character that I felt was missing as well as in the story.  They were not as three dimensional as i would have liked to help bump this story to the next level. I think it felt like such a snap shot into them and I wanted a bigger picture.  Still a great sweet read that I enjoyed","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D17RXADD1D5L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J50YNE0#wasThisHelpful","R2D17RXADD1D5L","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I heard from several ladies I am in a group with how they loved this book and so I decided it would be good to grab and try out.  I was happy I did.  This book has a different premise than I am use to reading, though the idea is the same as many romance books.Dominique is that brooding dark alpha like male only with a soft and sweet side.  Similar to other books? Sure but the difference here is this man is a creator of the most sinfully delicious chocolates.  He goes for the exotic, new, never thought possible flavor combinations that makes him the bad boy of the chocolate world.  So let me get this straight, we have a handsome, damaged, boy at heart, all man, alpha hero who also makes chocolate.  Yup you are right it is the ultimate fantasy.Then there is Jaime.  When introduced to her we find a frail delicate woman who savors life. . . and chocolate.  She catches Dominique’s eye in his store without even knowing it and he is captivated by this woman who does nothing but enjoy each bite of his chocolate, of him.  What is nice about Jaime? She is definitely anything but frail and delicate.  She is fierce and she is a fighter. She had a set back in life, a moment in time that has made her afraid when she otherwise wouldn’t be but that hasn’t broken her spirit.When the two finally meet it is a tantalizing chemistry and kept me reading more and more.  I loved the interaction between the two, the growth and the exploration of self.  They both are very aware of themselves, but unaware of each other’s thoughts and that is were the tension lies.Bits of french are scattered throughout providing an education in another language for those of us not familiar with it.  A bit predictable in story line but definitely fun and had me grinning with the funny moments and the very sweet ones indeed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDI3T6PV3GKZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPYGP0O#wasThisHelpful","RDI3T6PV3GKZT","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Kristen Ashley books.  She is my escape into a different world.  I often binge on her books when I just need some fun and then go off to read other books for a while before returning.  She has built an alpha man set of books that feel the need of many readers to excess.  She does it well and consistently.That said, this book, Sweet Dreams,  frustrated me.  For many this is an all time favorite book. Had I read this one first I might have enjoyed it more and rated it higher than I did.  But I didn’t, I read and loved The Gamble first and the result is I had a bit of a bad taste in my mouth as I read this one.  This one by the way like most KA books gives you your monies worth with over 200K in words.My problem lies in the similarities between the stories.  Now I realize for most of Kristen Ashley’s books she has a character formula she sticks to (especially for the men) and it works for her and us readers.  Though admittedly it has started to not work as well on me of late.  Anyways, she has the formula she plops it into the setting and the story and off she goes.  We read, we enjoy having gotten our fill of a read we need.Sidenote:  Some people watch t.v., what they watch varies based on taste but many people have their guilty pleasure shows.  You know, those reality t.v. ones that are all the same but different settings but still the same contrived story with built in drama and what not.  Well when I read I have my guilty pleasure books too that for some people make no sense and for others they completely get me.  In large part Kristen Ashley books are my guilty pleasure reads.  They are predictable yes but still they are fun, allow me to escape, minimal angst, I know what will happen and I tune in every time.This story had so many similarities to The Gamble it was pretty upsetting for me.  I will list some but hide them because there are spoilers so look if you don’t want to know:(spoilers removed, original list can be found on original review)I get it that too and extent books will have similarities and it is even something I often enjoy with Kristen Ashley books, like I just know there will be an amazing cast of side characters that will love the female.  There will be little antics and the female will often be quickly loved by all.  I enjoy that and expect it.  However, what I don’t like is when many of the story elements feel the same.  This perturbed me to say the least.  I still read it and enjoyed it.  I still want to read more Kristen Ashley books and would most likely right now dive into another because I am just in the mood.  That all said I was just a bit disappointed in this one.Another things I was disappointed in, I often feel like the men, who are JERKS often are way too jerky.  Their behavior would not fly in every day life.  I mean hell I try and transpose myself into the situation and I know it would not go down as it did.  I am stubborn like most of these women but so many cave so quickly to these men and change their ways but the guys never seem to change theirs.  They apologize but often it is “this is me, do it my why and take me as I am.  No go learn to be a biker babe who can handle me”  Yeah no.  I think this is why I loved the Rock Chick Series more so.  While those alpha men were very much the same, there was a connection between the men and women and i felt like often where the men came from in their actions where less stalker/asshole.Okay, I will stop there because I said what I needed to say in regards to this book. Again, love me some Kristen Ashley (not every book will be a winner for me and not every book of hers has been) and will be reading more of her. Just let down by the overt use of story details (minor alterations of course) from the book right before this one in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J7RB3X9N3QYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHFJAB8#wasThisHelpful","R1J7RB3X9N3QYB","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A story with lots of bite, yup I just went there.  Okay so I had been hearing about this series for a while and it is one of those long ones, like 14 or 15 books in it so far.  I found the first three books on sale so grabbed the first (this is technically book 1 I think, with a novella happening before this).  This is the book that made me realized that the reason I love paranormal is because before I start I go in suspending reality and can accept the unacceptable.  Such as a large growling man that kidnaps a woman (albeit a vampire woman) and forces her to take off her clothes and join him in the shower.  Normally all that would have me running away going “no, no way not going to listen to a romance that starts this way” but I could hold off judgment long enough and soon accept it and found as the story progress I really enjoyed it and got into it. I am eager to find out where this whole series goes but I really liked the start.The female lead starts off weak, but grows into this amazing strong woman who does the unimaginable.  She is feisty and has bite herself.  Lachlain is . . he is just his own person.  Once you get past the beginning which I was able accept his behavior because he is part animal and was locked up and tortured for over 150 years straight.  When you get out of a situation like that while part animal you are going to be a little crazy like and rough around the edges.Definitely a series I will dive into more by an author of another favorite series of mine, The Arcana Chronicles.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA0KYWGKWP8G8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GCFCXW#wasThisHelpful","RA0KYWGKWP8G8","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had been eyeing this book for a while, seeing lots of great praise for it and finely treated myself to it because I love Samantha Young.  I found myself quickly immersing myself into the story and wanting to find out what happened next.  Granted I couldn’t help but feel that the story just didn’t stand out enough on it’s own to be remarkable to me.  It had great characters, and had I read it a year ago my rating would most definitely be higher.  However, I just felt like it had already been done.  Now yes, lots of books have similar plots/characters and they are amazing books, but there is usually something in the story that makes it stand out, makes it unique.  I just did not feel that was the case with this book even though I enjoyed my read.Here is what I am talking about:HOT Male lead that has money, runs a major business and is closed off, overbearing, and doesn’t want anything serious.Male lead is damaged from something in his childhoodAttractive female that hasn’t had sex in forever, intelligent but so overly attracted to the male lead she can’t help herself.female lead has a connection to something in the male leads tragedy.They must heal each other.Now, it did have a nice suspense/mystery aspect to it that was introduced towards the end that I liked because it rejuvenated my interested in the story and kept it fresh so my interest was held.I liked the book, I liked the characters, especially Caine’s next door neighbor.  It was just missing something to set it apart for me and make it more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R376IGP15HYYUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF77S#wasThisHelpful","R376IGP15HYYUI","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not sure how I feel about this book, and that is rather frustrating. The book was, as always with Jessica Park, a well written story with great side characters and development of emotion. My problem is not with it being a genre bending paranormal because I love paranormal and I read across genres all the time. So the best I can do is explain each thing that comes to mind when I think back on this book and hope it gets across what I need it to.First and for most I need to state that I am giving this book a 4 because while she very clearly states it is a stand alone I am beside myself with hope that she really means: it can be read as a stand alone but there will be more to come to help explain that which was left unsaid. If not, then my rating is really a 3.5 and not a 4 and I will explain why.From the start of reading this story I was grasping to understand the “feel” I was getting from the world being created for me. I knew I was going to be reading a paranormal but unsure what type exactly. We are first introduced to a situation that seems very normal, very contemporary with a side of girl your momma is f'ed up. This continues on until a main side character is introduced to us for the first time, Costa. At this point things go insane and my brain kept going whaaaa?! How the. . but what. . okayyy.Things get all paranormal and I start going along for the ride but the entire time I am riddled with questions and this is why I need there to be more because if this is the ONLY book on this story then way way way too much is left vague and unanswered. If this is truly the only book to be written on Death Trippers then I am left with tons of I don’t knows. Perhaps that is Jessica Parks intent, to write a story filled with mystery, intrigue and frustration because I know I am seriously frustrated. I need to know about the Dad, I need to know about the “under” I have questions of things that just don’t make sense and at least when I normally read paranormal the author tries to give some answers. Here with this book we are left with the characters saying they don’t know the answers either so you don’t get to know basically and it frustrates me too much to be able to enjoy the book fully.For a list of my questions see original reviewThen there is Costa himself. He is a freaking *bleep bleep*. There I said it. I know I was suppose to find redemption in him in the end and have sympathy for him and what was thrust upon him but seriously after what he did to Stella, nope. Again the explanation for him being the way he is doesn’t work so well for me because Sam had it thrust upon him in an even worse way in my opinion and the guy handled it.Not going to lie, this book was a bit twisted with the number of ways death is done. I found myself squirming at times especially with how death and sex played side by side sometimes. Again, I just didn’t know how to feel about this book, it pushed so many boundaries.The story was a good one and I really liked Stella & Sam but I am left wanting and needing more resolution. If there is no other book for the rest of the series, then the explanation that there is no explanation (for at least SOME of the unanswered questions) isn’t good enough in my opinion and feels like an easy way out of having to figure out some tough questions. When it comes to paranormal for me, the ones I truly love have perfected the building of the world and with Clear I am left without any understanding of the world I am living in as I read it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNDSO10PGH7ZA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TOLRLEO#wasThisHelpful","RNDSO10PGH7ZA","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Do you enjoy a good physiological who dun it?  Need that fix of the dark and suspenseful?  Don’t mind some seriously messed up people?  This book is for you.  I started it is and found that after 20% I couldn’t put it down, I wanted to know what was happening.This book tells the story of a woman gone missing from the POV of three women who as time goes on it becomes quite clear are more than they seem.I found myself disappointed in the characters multiple time through out the story but the author was crafty enough to take the disappointment and disgust and mellow it out and make you want to read more, learn more about them.  I found myself thinking constantly after 50% “What is wrong with these people!??!”Rachel is the first woman we are introduced to and we see through her POV that she has crafted lives and personalities for the man and woman she sees each morning on the train to London.  She names them and stories for them, a rather innocuous thing that many of us make a game out of when we are people watching.  This takes a horrible turn into the sad and pathetic realm when a devastating revelation comes about that has Rachel wanting to immerse herself more into their lives.I did not see the ending coming early on, I was just as perplexed as several characters in the book. As the story unfolds and the clues get placed before you and the reality becomes clear you soon learn that some people are just messed the eff up in the head.A must read if you like a good psychological thriller and this one focuses the story around the women involved.  In fact I was reading this when I watched Gone Girl for the first time (never read the book) and it gave me that same people are messed up and omg feel.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQYP0M21PHEX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9B7IKE#wasThisHelpful","R1MQYP0M21PHEX","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cyborgs, Androids, Plague, a Lunar race that has “magic”.  Sci-fi meets Grimm’s fairy tales. . .hell yeah!  I loved it.  I was captivated from the start.  Loved the marriage of a fairytale we know and love with a futuristic world.  Cinder is not a damsel in distress but a strong fighter of a girl who has been through a lot in her young life.  With no true fairy godmother though she has to find her own pumpkin to transform into a carriage.The story was compelling and grabbed my attention from the start when we meet Cinder, a mechanic.  Her world is a less than glamorous one but she fights and works to do what is right despite the prejudice against her.The world building was done well, allowing me to become completely immersed in New Beijing and Cinder’s life. I could see this story playing out as a movie easily the visuals were so clear. Everything came alive and my emotions for her were real.  I was hopeful, scared, sad and disappointed along with her as the story unfolded.I did find myself glossing over parts towards the end, feeling some descriptions just weren’t needed to progress through the story.  I don’t mind detail, they add to the image in my mind, but sometimes I just didn’t feel it was warranted for me to enjoy and again, skimmed.I am eager and interested in finding where this goes and will pick up the next book soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KUBW2OSMW0MH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005KJJ4F8#wasThisHelpful","R1KUBW2OSMW0MH","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I know this is a well loved book and has won Pulizter Prize but I was left with a feeling of wanting and basically a bit let down.  I expected to read a book with a main focus on Callie and being born a hermaphrodite with supporting histories spanning the 8 decades the synopsis speaks of.  However, what I got was something that felt much more like two separate books.The first 50% of the book is background story of Callie/Cal’s heritage.  Who he came from, where he came from why he came to be before he ever came to be.  Some of the details seemed unimportant to that aspect unless in fact the main point of the story was the history of this family.  So I diligently read the first 50% with Cal interjecting from time to time and narrating in an omnipresent way that rather baffled me.  Still I wonder how he supposedly knew all he did.  For me it would have been much better narrated by an unknown all seeing person that would allow me to explain away how I was be informed about stuff that Cal would have never known.After 50% we start getting into more of Cal’s childhood, his life and being him.  But unlike the first part of the book where he seems to know everything, talking about himself instead seems rather difficult.  It is as if he is not comfortable describing his life and giving much details and this felt rather frustrating.  Even if it is a device or perhaps a way to emphasize how he feels about himself it was rather annoying after the time I spent getting to know his family when what i wanted was the exploration and insite into Cal.It was not until 80% when I finally got what I was looking for when I started this journey of a novel.  For me this is what I thought the focus would be and it is where I finally became engrossed again in the story.  Truth is between 60 & 80% of the book I contemplated putting it down and walking away I was so frustrated.  I am glad I stuck it out but still it was not enough of an ending to make up for the blah of the middle.  For me it felt like two separate books and I would have happily read the book on the family history as a separate story all together and then one on Cal/Callie if only the depth of exploration in to Cal’s life was further explored.A very informative read that I found enlightening in many ways and am glad I read but not sure I will ever explore it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R204T13LP19LW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HHPVPS#wasThisHelpful","R204T13LP19LW4","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a fun historical romance that had me smiling and interested the whole time.  With a heroine like Genevieve who is smart, intelligent and very clever I never felt like I wanted to hit her over the head.  She called things as she saw them and often saw straight through the actions of another, namely the Duke.  Though blind to some things she quickly figures them out and corrects any errors she made.  I really enjoyed reading a heroine that wasn’t easily duped or played dumb.The Duke is a quintessential alpha male intent on receiving his revenge.  When his plan is foiled, so to speak, he starts at another objective to “help” Genevieve.  Through the days of the house party we watch the romance blossom.  Barbs and innuendo are thrown back and forth which I delighted in.There is not much else that occurs during the course of the story besides the interactions between the Duke and Genevieve which made the story feel light.  Not much depth to the story either but still plenty of wittiness and “cleverness” to delight me and make me want to know what will happen next.I really enjoyed this one and am happy I read it as it seemed to help pull me out of a funk I had the week prior.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TW5PAIDV4TNN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0049B1VMC#wasThisHelpful","R1TW5PAIDV4TNN","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Talk about a book that just takes you away.  I remember reading  review for this book that just made me itch for it so I purchased it right away to have for when the mood striked me.  I don’t buy 9.99 books lightly and have been exceptionally lucky with the ones I have of late.  This book was just absolutely amazing for me.  So let me state, it is YA, there is no romance.

The story is filled with mystery and suspense for this young girl who never asked for a gift that has hung over her head her entire life (quite literally).Maddie can see the date you are suppose to die hovering over your head.  Due to the circumstances in her life she does readings for people, informing them of their death date. She doesn’t enjoy these readings but does what is asked of her.  As far as she knows she has never been wrong.  What  would you do? Would you want to know?  Me? No.  I wouldn’t be able to live life knowing the date it would all be over.  Maybe I would come to some acceptance and make the most out of my time but I think I would rather not know.Alas, this story is not about me and my wants but about Maddie.  Like I said this is a mystery/suspense YA read and I loved every second.  See, someone is killing people, and somehow Maddie is getting thrown into the mix.  It isn’t just about her though because her best friend suddenly finds himself in a place he never imagined. It keeps you guessing, wondering who could be doing it.  I had my suspicions and while I wasn’t 100% correct I still enjoyed the journey of feeling involved in figuring out who it was.The story took me on a roller coaster ride and a guessing game.  I couldn’t put it down and wanted to shove it into others hands when I finished (I might have forcibly loaned it to Darci “YOU MUST READ”).  This was the perfect read for when I just wanted a good story and no romance (well maybe a little dabble of a crush but you know what I mean). Some action, intrigue, great plot development and had me wrapped up in the story completely.I would say this was a total win for me and definitely recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14W8P9WF5XKUF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJZYI2S#wasThisHelpful","R14W8P9WF5XKUF","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A great escape read that had my cheeks burning and the pages turning.  I really enjoyed this one and am intrigued to continue on with the series.  Each book focuses on a different brother but the story continues one in such a way that you want to know how a particular story line ends.I enjoyed Teagan because she was tough.  Life threw her a tough curveball but she grabbed life by the balls and wasn't going to let it get her down.  However, at the end of the book she acted out of character in my opinion.  She became weak and wanted to avoid issues at hand which just didn't fit.Rebel talks very little in the beginning but makes his desires known quickly.  I really liked his character and wanted more time with him and Teagan as a couple.There where only a couple steamy scenes but for me they were so well written that they had me panting because I was visualizing so much that I was her and in her shoes. . . and oh how nice it was. I actually got flushed from reading them.A quick fun read that I say go for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KY86N7AQRRDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GBIYX8A#wasThisHelpful","R3KY86N7AQRRDD","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was recommend this book by two separate people and for some reason dragged my feet.  Then I started reading and found myself intrigued by the mysterious start as we watch this man work in the library by using someone else.  I wasn't sure how the feel of the book was yet and so kept reading.  I was hooked!  Gio and Beatrice captivated me and I couldn't put this books down.  I read 1-3 in the series over the course of 3-4 days before I finally took a break because otherwise I would get in completes on assignments that were waiting for my attention.The world building in this series is phenomenal.  This is our world reimagined with magic and creatures already familiar to us but presented in a new and unique way.  The detail was superb and the storyline enthralling.Beatrice is a strong female lead and she did not annoy me.  I enjoyed becoming her and living the story as her (we all do it don't we? lol).  Gio, oh Gio.  A wonderful strong brooding male lead with dimension and a great air of mystery.  These characters and all the supporting characters were written with such depth that they came to life.  I believed their actions, I understood them and I felt for them.There were parts in here that in my opinion related to another well known story and the use of that made me laugh and smile, loved it so much.The scene that grabbed me the hardest and still stands out from the first book is the elevator scene.  You will know it when you read it.I HIGHLY recommend this series.  In fact I suggest buying the 4 book bundle but the first book in the series is FREE so you can grab it and see if you get as hooked as I did.The Pros:-Strong female (kick some butt type of strong) and male leads that had depth and didn't annoy.-Characters that evolve and grow with the story.-Well thought out story that wraps up nicely after 4 books but welcomes the continuation of the world through other books an characters.-Really well done world building, based off of our current one.-Well completed story arcs.-Great romantic chemistry and a couple you can fall in love with.-Surprised me greatly, so not just a typical story format.-A supporting cast that is just as well written with just as much depth leaving you wanting more of them.-You can completely immerse yourself in the books.Cons:I really can't remember any at this time, lol.This series really captured my attention and I know I will be plunging into the spin offs from it because I can't stand leaving them just yet and I want to get to know the other characters just as much as I know Beatrice and Gio.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AIJ5BAGUN381/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HMEYAC6#wasThisHelpful","R2AIJ5BAGUN381","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My daughter loved these and the price (under $5) was perfect.  I made this be a stocking stuffer but would be a great inexpensive gift for a 4-5 year old girl.  Fun arts and crafts project with minimal mess.  The stickers held on well to the bracelets (which are reversible) and the bracelets fit well on my girls arm.

Unfortunately the clear hard plastic that holds the cubes in place behind the closed door can get lost easily if you have a younger child that likes taking things apart.

"For the price this was a great purchase.  I had a difficult time finding inexpensive party favor toys for my 5 year old's party and this was by far the best that I got.  24 in a box for just over $10 made them cost effective and perfect for a party with unknown number of children.

"A hidden gem of a Kristen Ashley book.  It does contain a slight, very slight paranormal aspect in the way of ghost.  However they play such a small part (though at the same time a very integral part) that I don't think people put off by paranormal will be put off by this book.  I absolutely loved this story and it is now one of my fav Kristen Ashley books.Douglas and Julia have great chemistry together and I loved the perfect tension and push and pull these two display.  Douglas comes across cold and unfeeling in the beginning by way of how he is described but soon you come to realize he is just really controlled but that he cares very deeply.  I also loved that once he makes up his mind on something he sticks with it and isn't deterred (a common trait amongst KA male protagonists).I became deeply envolved into the story not just about Douglas and Julia but also about the children.  It is hard for me to put into words what I loved about this story because it all just felt like it flowed perfectly.  For me while Douglas is very much a KA male lead, he also felt a bit different from the ones I had been reading in her more recent and well known books which I think lent to some of what I loved about this story.  The hint of the super natural added an element I needed and a depth that I enjoyed.This takes place in England, with well off characters, drama, shenanigans and again some wonderful chemistry.  I am so happy I found this KA book and highly recommend it to others.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYXOK3Q1M30AD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056ZAJSC#wasThisHelpful","RYXOK3Q1M30AD","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I loved the taboo, but not so taboo aspect of this book.  The relationship that built was fun to watch and believable for me to a degree.  The sexual tension built wonderfully but it was more than that it was also the chemistry between Elec and Greta.  As the synopsis states this ends up being more the possibility of a second chance between these two and you want it.  Do you ever want that second chance.  Your heart however will dip and twist as it looks like it might not be.  There was one part in this book the resulted in it not be a home run.  There is a section of the book that is a retelling of earlier scenes from the other point of view almost verbatim except with the other character’s thoughts interjected so you can know what he was thinking.  This resulted in me skimming like 8% of the book and that frustrated me because I felt it could have been done in a different way to give the same effect.  That jarred me out of the read and disconnected me a bit and annoyed me a bit too.  Other than that it was a fantastic read that I really enjoyed and could hardly put down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M9IV31TBQQ22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVY6JPC#wasThisHelpful","R1M9IV31TBQQ22","A1I12P53XRMJP0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1I12P53XRMJP0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Or maybe Sonia wants to break off with Jeremy and he wants no part of that.  Olivia has filed suit against Sonia's company with the Labor Relation Board.  Could have gotten tired of waiting for the suit to be resolved.Another well written and exciting story from Mary Kennedy.  The book has an interesting cast of characters.  The members of the Dream Club are all very interesting and have different views on what they might mean.  Some may disagree with the rationale of other members, but overall the respect each others opinion. The Harper sisters, Minerva and Rose, who live down the street are a real joy and I have to chuckle at their remarks sometimes.Instead of dreaming about this book, get one from your favorite bookstore and read it.Looking forward to the next book in this insightful series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUHDORIDADAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425268063#wasThisHelpful","R2QUHDORIDADAG","A23YNZ6LKVNK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23YNZ6LKVNK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Murder In The Paperback Parlor is the second book in the A Book Retreat Mystery series.Another wonderful story from Ellery Adams to add to her growing list of great books.Valentine's Day is coming up and in celebration, Jane Steward is planning a Romancing the Reader program at Storyton.  Jane has invited of the top Regency period writers to come and discuss their genre with their readers.  Roseamund York, a best selling romance author has irritated almost everyone from the time that she stepped out of the car that brought her to Storyton Hall.  So when her body is found early one morning, hardly a tear was shed, but Jane, always ready for a challenge begins her own investigation and uses the resources of her security staff to help the police find the murderer.There are plenty of suspects for Jane to consider as the killer.  Georgia Dupree, close in popularity to readers as was York, has had run-ins in the past with York.  Now that York is out of the picture, Dupree is very interested in taking over York series.  But is she interested enough to cause the demise of York.  Nigel Poindexter, a freelance journalist, seems to be about the only York is on friendly terms with, but then when they have a very vocal argument at lunch, he is drawn into the list of suspects.  Maria Stone, a women's advocate, was there in support of York's strong female character.  But when she read an advanced readers copy of York's new series, in which the male character is the person has control over the women in the book, Jane needs to learn if this was enough to cause Maria to off the “deep end” so to speak.  Jane is also taking a look at Taylor Birch, York's publicist.  York has gone through a number of publicists recently and Taylor seems to be going out of her way to obtain publicity for her employer.  Jane needs to figure out if the stress of the job has taken it toll on Taylor and something happened to cause her to snap and take it out on York.Besides the wonderful mystery that Adams provides the reader, the thing that I love about the series are the supporting staff at the Storyton Hall, Jane's family and the residents of village of Storyton.  They're all wonderful and believable characters and all so willing to give Jane what ever help she might need.  Two other items that I thought was a nice added touch, is that Adams has provided the reader with a map of the Village of Storyton and a list of the Hall's staff and a list of the village shops and owners.As with all of Ellery Adams' books, I am anxiously awaiting the next one.Murder In The Paperback Parlor is the second book in the A Book Retreat Mystery series.Another wonderful story from Ellery Adams to add to her growing list of great books.Valentine's Day is coming up and in celebration, Jane Steward is planning a Romancing the Reader program at Storyton.

So when her body is found early one morning, hardly a tear was shed, but Jane, always ready for a challenge begins her own investigation and uses the resources of her security staff to help the police find the murderer.There are plenty of suspects for Jane to consider as the killer.  Georgia Dupree, close in popularity to readers as was York, has had run-ins in the past with York.  Now that York is out of the picture, Dupree is very interested in taking over York series.  But is she interested enough to cause the demise of York.  Nigel Poindexter, a freelance journalist, seems to be about the only York is on friendly terms with, but then when they have a very vocal argument at lunch, he is drawn into the list of suspects.  Maria Stone, a women's advocate, was there in support of York's strong female character.  But when she read an advanced readers copy of York's new series, in which the male character is the person has control over the women in the book, Jane needs to learn if this was enough to cause Maria to off the “deep end” so to speak.  Jane is also taking a look at Taylor Birch, York's publicist.  York has gone through a number of publicists recently and Taylor seems to be going out of her way to obtain publicity for her employer.  Jane needs to figure out if the stress of the job has taken it toll on Taylor and something happened to cause her to snap and take it out on York.Besides the wonderful mystery that Adams provides the reader, the thing that I love about the series are the supporting staff at the Storyton Hall, Jane's family and the residents of village of Storyton.  They're all wonderful and believable characters and all so willing to give Jane what ever help she might need.  Two other items that I thought was a nice added touch, is that Adams has provided the reader with a map of the Village of Storyton and a list of the Hall's staff and a list of the village shops and owners.As with all of Ellery Adams' books, I am anxiously awaiting the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37IBAJ5ATT0DL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QH832AO#wasThisHelpful","R37IBAJ5ATT0DL","A23YNZ6LKVNK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23YNZ6LKVNK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Berried Secrets is the first book in the A Cranberry Cove Mystery.A wonderful beginning to a new series from Peg Cochran.Since Monica Albertson has closed her cafe, she has moved to Cranberry Cove to help her half-brother, Jeff on his cranberry farm. Harvesting time is quickly approaching and Jeff is hoping for a good harvest, since the farm is barely holding on. As Monica is getting a feel for the business, she feels certain the Sam Culbert, who Jeff bought the farm from, has been skimming money from the farm while Jeff was in Afghanistan.Early in the harvesting, as they are about to gather the berries in the next bog, the body of Culbert rises to the surface. Just as the police are coming down the road, Mauricio, one of Jeff's workers flees the scene. As Detective Tammy Stevens begins her investigation and of course Jeff becomes a person of interest. Monica doesn't believe that her brother murdered Culbert and with a war injury to an arm, she is sure that he wouldn't have been able to get the body in the bog.Shortly after the discovery of the body, Jeff's mother, Gina, arrives in town. But Monica is able to put aside her bad feeling for her stepmother and is surprised to find her to be a very helpful ally in her investigation.The book has a wonderful cast of characters. The Van Velsen sister who runs Gumdrops, a candy store, have lived in Cranberry Cove all their lives and are a great source of information. Jeff is an interesting character in that, he is having to learn to deal with his disability. I see Jeff becoming a stronger person and will become more open with his sister and others around him. For me, Gina was the most enjoyable character of all and am looking forward to seeing more of her. In the beginning I thought she would be one that I would love to hate, but by the end of the book she's making me chuckle with her antics. Gina drives a fine car and wears the finest of clothes, but soon becomes a “hands on” person. She may continue to pretentious in future books, but I think she will be one of the more interesting characters.Definitely can't wait for the next book in this delightful new series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF7UTYEWG14VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425274500#wasThisHelpful","RF7UTYEWG14VP","A23YNZ6LKVNK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23YNZ6LKVNK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mr. Monk And The New Lieutenant is the fourth book Monk series by HyConrad.This series' books are quick reads.The book consisted, of what seemed to me, short stories of three or 4 quick cases for Monk and Natalie to resolve and one major case. That case centers around the recent death of Judge Oberlin and the attempts on the life of Captain Stottlemeyer. As the title suggests, Lt. Amy Devlin is on a leave of absence and she has been replaced by Lt. A. J. Thurman. Thurman is the most competent policeman on the force and certainly lack the social skills that Monk would expect. Monk and Natalie are paying their respect at funeral of Oberlin, when Monk states that the Oberlin was poisoned and not by a disease he picked up on a visit to Thailand. Soon Capt. Stottlemeyer begins to have similar symptoms that Oberlin had. Since the doctors knew what to look for, they were able to treat him get him on the road to recovery. But then there are a couple more attempts on the Captain's life. A note is soon found that alleges that the death and death threats are the tied to case that was tried before Olerlin and was investigated by Stottlemeyer. Monk and Natalie need to find the murderer before another murder if committed.Conrad states in the authors notes at the beginning of the book that he will no longer be writing any more books in this series, but stopped short of saying that the series is over.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X83NJOEVB7XS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWG9OEK#wasThisHelpful","R1X83NJOEVB7XS","A23YNZ6LKVNK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23YNZ6LKVNK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One Foot in the Grape is the first book in the A Cypress Cove Mystery series.A wonderful new series, full of mystery and also giving the reader an insight to the wine industry.Penny Lively, after losing her job as a photojournalist has to decided to come back to Cypress Cove to take ownership of the winery she has inherited from her Aunt Monique. The winery has been running under the capable direction of her winery manager, Connor and her niece, Haley. About six months after Penny arrived, the owner of the neighboring winery, Antonia Martinelli pays a visit. Antonia feels that someone is trying to damage the winery's reputation and asks Penny for her help in finding who is doing the sabotage. Antonia feels that it might be someone within the family or her manager. Penny is reluctant at first, knowing how demanding a person Antonia can be, but feels she owes her for having been such a good neighbor to her aunt in her final days.When Todd Ryan, who works in the Martinelli's wine tasting room, comes to ask Penny to take photos at is upcoming wedding, Penny takes the opportunity to ask how things are at the winery. He begins to say how great it is to work there, but then seems hesitant to say much more. That evening, Penny, Haley and Connor go the Martinelli's for a Wine Growers Association meeting. While there she sees the eldest of the children, Francesca, can be as strong and as unnerving as her mother and is upset with her mother who has given her brother control of winery. There is doubt that he is capable of handling the job, even though his mother says he has come up with some great improvements to the winery. Then there is Chantal who hasn't met a man she doesn't want to love and Penny feels she is paying too much attention to Connor. As Penny is getting ready to leave the meeting, where she was elected vice-president, much to chagrin of Francesca, she hears a scream coming from the fermentation building. Upon entering the building she can hear one of the crusher running and when she looks into the crusher she finds the body of Todd. With Haley being the last person, other than the killer to see Todd alive, Penny begins to look into Todd's death to see if it might be related to sabotaging that Antonia feels is going on.With the help of the “town gossips”, Ross Sterling owner/chef of Sterling and Thomas who owns the gift shop, Beauty and Bean, next door, is off to try and learn who and what is behind the attempt to discredit Martinelli Winery.Penny soon learns of Francesca's shading land dealing, the philandering of Francesca's husband Brice and gambling problems of winery manager Marvin Karp, and is Stephen really as talented as people say he is at running the winery. Penny needs to sort through the facts and find the killer so see can see the next grape harvest.I really enjoyed this new series, a wonderful cast of characters, and just the right amount of looking into a winery's operation. Looking forward to the next book to see what is up next in the wine country and if Penny and Connor will be willing to admit that there might be mutual feelings for each other.

"The Book Stops Here is eight book in the A Bibliophile Mystery series.I love this series and this was a very enjoyable addition and maybe the best so far, in my opinion.Ian McCullough has suggested Brooklyn Wainwright name to the TV program This Old Attic, as a book appraiser. Brooklyn is excited to get the job, but at the same time being a little nervous at being on the air. But everyone on the set goes out of the way to make her feel at home. Brooklyn's first guest is Vera Stoddard who has a first edition of The Secret Garden that she claims to have bought at a garage sale. Brooklyn appraises it at from $20,000 to $25,000 and with a few minor repairs would add $3-4,000 more. Quite naturally Vera is amazed and ends up having the extra work done by Brooklyn. A couple days later heads for the flower shop that Vera's runs to pick up a check for the and extra work and finds the body of Vera, dead, stabbed with a pair of scissors. When she arrives back at the studio she is accosted in the parking lot by a burly brute who demands that he wants The Secret Garden, as it is book. Also about this time Randolph, the show's host mentions to Brooklyn that he is being stalked. Those with the show believe that Randolph is just trying to extra attention. Because of the attack on Brooklyn her boyfriend Derek Stone, a security expert has been accompanying Brooklyn to the studio. Brooklyn has another close call caused be falling scenery, but it is not clear whether this is an attack on Brooklyn or if in fact there is a stalking Randolph. Then when Brooklyn goes to deliver the invoice for the rework to restore some of the pages, she finds Vera, stabbed with a pair scissors in the flower shop that she runs. Someone is serious about getting the book back and Brooklyn and Derek will have their hands full to make sure who is trying to get the book back before the final chapter is written about Brooklyn life.Not many of the character from previous books are back in this one, but there is one new character introduced who I hope will be back in future books. Alexandra “Alex” Monroe who is sub-leasing the loft next door to Brooklyn. Alex is a well dressed professional woman who also bakes some delectable cupcakes. But she also has a past that could come in handy for saving Brooklyn's life at some time.Definitely will be watching for the next book in this exciting story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SWE8S8YS5SLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3L6M0C#wasThisHelpful","R3SWE8S8YS5SLQ","A23YNZ6LKVNK39","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23YNZ6LKVNK39?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This blue corn meal has great flavor and cooks up nicely. It has a more complex and deeper flavor than yellow corn meal. As others have mentioned, the grind is a bit on the coarse side. I have a grain grinder (vitamix) so I can easily create a finer grind, and you might be able to do the same in a food processor or coffee grinder if you want a finer texture.This product cost me less online than in the grocery store, which prices it like a high-end gourmet product.The side of the package has recipes for blue corn pancakes and blue corn bread. I haven't tried those yet, but they look delicious.So far I've made polenta, gluten free corn pizza crust, and a corn meal-based sauce out of this. All came out well. I love the blue-ish purple color, and I love that this corn meal is full of antioxidants like anthocyanins. Other nutritional benefits (from Wikipedia): ""blue corn has several nutritional advantages over standard yellow or white corn varieties. It contains 20% more protein and has a lower glycemic index than white corn. When used to make tortillas, blue corn produces a sweeter, nuttier taste than yellow or white corn, and is a more complete protein source. A certain technique is used to grind the blue maize and make it release niacin.""As an interesting note, if you add lemon juice or other acids to your blue corn when cooking, it will turn pink.Highly recommended and I will buy it regularly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GKUPN7ZFQCZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VLV6FW#wasThisHelpful","R3GKUPN7ZFQCZH","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a fabulous book. It's well organized, thoughtfully presented, and, most importantly chock full of amazingly delicious recipes.The book is organized in chapters that include crust, sauce, and cheese-like toppings (the best part!), then whole pizza ideas, and appendices about plant-based eating, fats and oils, why he doesn't use pre-made plant-based cheeses, and cooking legumes and grains. There are also general and recipe indices.Each chapter has an introduction with tips and techniques. The book would be worth it for the recipes alone, but the tips and techniques are a fabulous bonus. Sutton doesn't just give you a recipe and leave you to your devices, he explains why ingredients taste and work the way they do, how to make things work properly, useful information about important ingredients, and techniques to ensure perfect results. The combination of winning recipes and invaluable tips, tricks, and information, make this book suitable for both the person who only follows a recipe, and others who may like to experiment, create their own concoctions, or troubleshoot something that doesn't taste quite the way they want it to.The sauces are so good you will not just want to use them on pizza. The possibilities are endless.The recipes include lots of gluten free options, tomato (nightshade) free options), soy-free options, and nut-free options, and an incredibly diverse palette of tastes and textures. The recipes are rich and satisfying without being heavy or laden with unhealthy ingredients.On top of all that, the recipes are easy to follow and taste unbelievably good. Most of these recipes are perfectly suitable for guests who eat a variety of diets. Even though these pizzas might not taste like the ones that are full of fat and animal products, the flavors are definitely good enough to serve to mixed-diet company.This book is so full of great recipes and possibilities for pizza combinations that I may never get through them all. But I will try with a smile on my face and a happy belly.Highly recommended. This is a good one to move to the top of your wish list.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZAE8E62P8AM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1469981386#wasThisHelpful","R2ZAE8E62P8AM6","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a cabinet full of low-fat, plant-based, whole foods cookbooks and I know this one will be the most used of all of them.I cannot state emphatically enough how amazing it is that this book brings to the reader traditional comfort food in an EASY and healthy package. You will find many of your old favorites reborn into healthy dishes. I am amazed at how Ms. Campbell was able to accomplish this with such simplicity of both ingredients and preparation.This book is beautifully presented. It is professionally designed and laid out with professional color photographs for nearly every dish. I'm not sure what it is that makes it easier to select a recipe if there's a great picture, but the author and publisher were smart enough to realize this and I appreciate that. Everything looks delicious, and the recipes are all so simple and reasonable to make, but at the same time come out so good. Healthy has never been so easy or so tasty.The book begins with a short introduction that manages to stuff a lot of good information into a small space without rehashing everything else done by all of the other cookbooks for this audience. It gives sound advice for those transitioning to a plant-based diet.The book is then divided into Breads & Muffins, Breakfast Dishes, Appetizers & Salads, Soups, Sandwiches, Entrees,Side Dishes, and Desserts. Appendices include metric conversions and an index.New family favorites from this book include Fiesta Corn Bread, Apple Turnovers, Lemon Tahini Quinoa Salad, Sesame Noodle Salad, Tomato Tortilla Soup, Thai Wraps, Asparagus Crepes, Seasoned Mushroom Soup, Macaroni Squash, Moroccan Eggplant. The Coconut Mango Pudding is to die for!No added oil in the recipes. A very small number of recipes include a very light handed use of nuts/seeds. This book does have a number of recipes with wheat ingredients, so if you are gluten free and not an old hand at substituting ingredients you may have to pass on some of the better recipes.The author uses sucanat as a sweetener, but you can obviously substitute another sweetener of your choice. There is an occasional use of tofu or non-dairy milk. Recipes use reasonable convenience foods, like whole wheat tortillas or canned tomatoes. If you are a purist, you can use fresh ingredients instead.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28TZKC9RDMN73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937856755#wasThisHelpful","R28TZKC9RDMN73","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grow scarlet runners every year. They are a beautiful, easy to grow low maintenance vine, the hummingbirds love them, and the beans are absolutely delicious.These are the best scarlet runner seeds I've used yet. They are very big and I experienced 100% germination from them. I soaked them the day before I planted, but you don't have to do that to have success. My plants are really healthy and grew faster than I expected. They will trellis on anything nearby and are vigorous but don't get out of control.The beans can be eaten with the whole pods (like a string bean) when young or as shelled beans when they mature a bit more. Personally, I don't like them as a whole pod because they are a little fuzzy and the texture just doesn't appeal to me. The beans can get pretty big, but are best when not fully mature as they are more tender. The mature beans can get close to an inch per bean, but I like to eat them when they are between 1/2 and 3/1 inches per bean. The beans are a really pretty pink mottled with a brownish purple when raw, and cook to a browner color. Picking the pods enhances new pod growth. They will rebloom and produce beans all summer if you keep picking the beans.Definitely pretty enough to be part of an ornamental garden, with the added benefit of being a great food producer. You'll be sorry if you hide these on a back fence or behind other plants in your garden--give them a featured spot.I've placed a picture of the raw beans in a bowl the photos for this product so you can see how pretty they are.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1EWFI1XS9LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0032RJFKO#wasThisHelpful","R1Z1EWFI1XS9LM","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These bags do what they say they do. They definitely keep things like my delicate greens for about twice as long as they would last in a regular plastic bag. They work about as well as other brands I've tried.My biggest complaint is the color of these bags. The other brands I've used were colored either green or pink, so it's easy to tell that they are not the disposable grocery store bags. These bags are clear like the grocery store bags, so it's harder to tell that they are not disposable. That's not a problem for me since I think about those things and know what's in the reusable bags, but for family members and guests it's not obvious that these are reusable and they have been inadvertently thrown out.UPDATE 13 August 2013These bags don't hold up over time.

"I'm Hungarian and paprika is a national pastime in Hungary. While this isn't a Hungarian paprika, it is an excellent addition to any spice cabinet. The taste is bold, rich, and smokey (obviously), but with very little bitterness compared to most other paprikas. The smokiness overpowers the sweet, so it's not as sweet as an unsmoked sweet paprika. This isn't a spicy paprika. It has excellent dark red color and great aroma. It blends well into liquids.It can be used alone as a more subtle seasoning, or if you want to really up the effect, mix it with just a little liquid smoke and/or toasted sesame oil to enhance the smokiness and add more complexity of flavor.The canister is a bit difficult to open. You'll need to use a knife to pry it off, and if goes back on tightly so you will have to do that every time, not just on the first opening.

"This is a good book. I'm not all raw but eat mostly raw foods. I eat mostly salads, so I am always looking for variety. This book gives a nice variety of salads that are easy to prepare using normal ingredients. Lots of variety of both taste and ingredients. I have tried several recipes in the book and have enjoyed them all so far. They aren't just your typical lettuce and dressing, and very little use of nuts and seeds.The book is divided into two sections: dressings and salads, with an appendix on raw basics and an alphabetic recipe list. Dressings include Cayenne Tahini, Easy Garlic Avocado, Tomato Extravaganza, Cinnamon Thyme, and Latin American Fiesta Vinaigrette. Salads include Jicama Soul Slaw, Carrot and Orange (a family favorite in my house), Asian Sesame Cucumbers, Garlic Grapefruit, Tomato Corn Salsa.I like that the raw basics are put in an appendix and not the focus of the book. The basics are basic recipes, not basic how-tos. Too many cookbooks these days include the how-to basics in all of them in detail, so I end up with a shelf full of basics books with some recipes almost as an afterthought. I don't need to read 20 books on how to julienne carrots. The focus in this book is on the recipes.My biggest complaint about the book is that it includes the use of oils. Oils are a fractionated food, not a whole food, and therefore, in my opinion, not a suitable part of a whole foods diet. Easy enough to substitute out.Based on how happy I am with the food that I make from this book I plan to order a couple of others of hers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21L3W3GOD0FK4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981755666#wasThisHelpful","R21L3W3GOD0FK4","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, this isn't a diet book. If you are looking for recipes or a specific menu plan, this book does not contain any.It's mostly a reflective piece on the journey Patenaude has gone through to become increasingly dietarily rigid to a point where he no longer has any ""rules,"" with some dietary suggestions that you can choose from. Patenaude talks about the physical and emotional problems of a purely raw diet, and how he worked through those issues to find a solution that works for him. He's not suggesting his specific solution to his readers, but informing them of what problems exist with a raw diet balanced with what problems exist with the standard American diet (SAD), and how we can each find our own sweet spot somewhere in the reasonable middle ground.I eat a diet with a lot of raw foods and have been all raw. My doctor supports both approaches. As a scientist myself, while I have found and reaped the benefits of such a way of eating, I have been horrified by the pseudoscience claimed by many raw foodists about the benefits of eating raw. Patenaude covers all of those myths and discusses why they are incorrect, which I very much appreciated. I think a diet high in raw foods is healthy for a number of reasons, but I would like to see valid science used to support such a way of eating, not wives tales that make the general public unnecessarily skeptical of the raw or high raw lifestyle and that make us look like a bunch of uneducated kooks.I also appreciated Patenaude's discussion of raw lifestyles as well as the variety of lower fat vegan diets (McDougall, Esselstyn, Fuhrman) as well as the comparison.If you've read Esselstyn, you know he believes that ""moderation kills."" McDougall has a similar philosophy. That is, most people in developed nations aren't able to eat a healthy diet with occasional splurges--we are too gluttonous and can't just have one cupcake once in a while. This is true for some people. This is also true for people who have already developed serious diseases of excess, such as heart disease, diabetes, or serious chronic inflammatory diseases. This is also more true for the older population who are suffering from the results of a lifetime of excess. But it is not necessarily true for those who have not yet eaten themselves to the edge of the grave or for those who are younger and have not yet reaped the punishments of decades of such self abuse. This book is for the healthier and/or younger folk who have not yet found a happy, healthy middle ground. This book is NOT for those with heart disease, diabetes, etc. If you are in that category, you would be better served by the suggestions of McDougall or Esselstyn and probably do need a strict and more restrictive way of eating.I also agree with Patenaude's discussion of the amount of fat we should have in our diets. He basically does not take the once size fits all approach of 80-10-10 or Esselstyn or McDougall. The 10% fat approach is appropriate for some, but not all. I maintain a total cholesterol in the 130s with 12-17%. That works for me, and is where I feel best. My mother is older and needs a lot less fat in her diet, more in the 5-10% range. An endurance athlete may need more like 20%. Patenaude has a sensible discussion of this, and also a discussion of what happens on a diet too high in fat, particularly a raw diet too high in fat. I found this a useful section.Patenaude's book is also only for those who have overcome their food addictions and don't suffer from binging issues. He has some suggestions for those who do have cravings and who binge, so those may be valuable to you, but be aware you may just be one of those people who can't have one french fry and walk away. That's something you will have to evaluate for yourself. If Patenaude's book is anything, it's an homage to the discovery of moderation through a lifetime of deprivation. Which is good for those able to be moderate. Unfortunately, that's just not all of us.If I had to select an overarching theme for the book, it's self tolerance and self forgiveness of not achieving dietary perfection, and finding that sweet spot for you where you are free to eat whatever you want at times (within reason) and yet remain healthy.I find most of the dietary suggestions firmly grounded in science, with the exception of the suggestion for a calcium supplements. (The science I have read does not support the use supplemental calcium). The book provides a very practical approach to diet, with a dual focus on health and reducing/eliminating ""rules"" that restrict your life through your diet. While the emotional and psychological approach in the book is relatively unique, the actual dietary suggestions didn't seem too different to me than what Joel Fuhrman suggests or what you might deduce about diet from reading the China Study.This book is useful for anyone who has or is exploring a raw or cooked plant-based diet. I am not sure it is relevant to those just starting out on a healthy path or those on SAD who don't understand the subcultures of the plant-based world. But for those of us who do, I think it's a healthy, important discussion of topics relevant to our lifestyles, whether we agree with all points or not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GTUKIJRYRG36/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484043227#wasThisHelpful","R3GTUKIJRYRG36","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I owe a debt of gratitude to the author. This book gave me the tools I needed to solve the puzzle that is (was!) my CFS/ME.The book discusses all available treatments, including diet, supplements, medications, and lifestyle. All of the material is supported by the best available data and the book is full of relevant citations.Anyone who has this condition knows it's a huge mystery. What causes it, how to live with it, and how to treat it. The author realizes that the condition isn't the same for each individual, and therefore, neither is the treatment. So she presents an incredibly comprehensive look at pretty much every legitimate treatment out there. That's the good news. The bad news is that each of us with this life-stealing syndrome will need to do the work to figure out which treatment protocol, or which combination of protocols, will work for her or him.Prior to this book, I discovered that a mostly raw, low-fat whole foods vegan diet free of gluten helped somewhat, but didn't completely eliminate my CFS. I am one of those who has a high oxidative burden and therefore needs a high level of antioxidants in my diet.I did numerous painstaking elimination diets with the hope that I could rid myself of a trigger food or two (or even ten) and be cured. What I was missing in my personal CFS puzzle was the supplements. As the author states, some people need a diet like mine, and others need a lot of meat. We are all so different.But after adding a selection of supplements suggested in the book I experienced my first REAL 100% remission and became my old self that I missed so much. I worked hard, gardened and did hours and hours of yardwork a day, and felt GREAT. I had a relapse the last couple of days because I tried to add some wheat to see if I could do this on supplements alone, but it is clearing from my system and I will now do some more tweaking of my diet to see if there is still work to be done in that area.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book to anyone who has CFS/ME or even fibro or who cares about someone who has it. But you will have to do some of your own detective work to figure out which protocol or combinations you need. Be methodical, and be persistent, and stay strong. If there's an answer for you, there's a good chance it's somewhere in this book. You must be willing to be your own advocate and detective, but don't give up! If I can beat this, you can too!Even though the answer is different for all of us, I will post my own plan that put me in remission in case someone finds it helpful:PUZZLE PIECE 1: DIETI am one of those who has a high oxidative burden and therefore need a high level of antioxidants in my diet. I also have a few trigger foods, particularly wheat. I can tolerate a small amount of a trigger on occasion, but more than just a taste will set me back.I eat a whole foods, low-fat, vegan, gluten-free diet. Dairy, meat, and wheat fatigue me physically, and wheat also adds brain fog. I don't eat fractionated foods. That means no added oil, even olive oil. Oil is a fraction of its source. So are things like refined grains, table sugar, etc. Basically, if I can't easily separate something from its whole source in my own kitchen (example: squeezing lime juice from a lime), then I don't eat it.I eat a small amount of fatty whole food with each meal to help ensure uptake of fat-soluble vitamins (like pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, and avocado), but I keep my overall percentage of fat from calories below 15% per day. I eat as much of my food raw as possible, about 75%, but do eat some cooked food with dinner most days, as cooking makes available some nutrients that aren't as available in the raw food (for example: lycopene in tomatoes or beta carotene in carrots or sweet potatoes). I have a whole foods, gluten free starch with most meals (quinoa, sweet potato, red potato, banana/plantain, etc) for slow release but sustained energy. Processed starches, such as white sugar or rice flour or most processed foods have just the opposite effect and cause problems with insulin and sugar spikes--a big no-no.The dietary changes also eliminated my muscle soreness and headaches (migraine quality). Completely.I also have white tea every morning as it has virtually no caffeine and a very high antioxidant level. I avoid stimulants of all kinds, particularly caffeine and chocolate.As an aside, my diet has improved other aspects of my health, including reducing my cholesterol from well over 200 to 134, reducing my BP, and reducing the inflammation in my body to the point where things I considered part of aging (like gum disease) just went away.PUZZLE PIECE 2: HORMONESI have had thyroid disease for decades, so I need supplementation. I am also peri-menopausal and on recent testing have found I have virtually no progesterone in m body. So I need to supplement progesterone. Inadequate supplementation of either thyroid hormone or progesterone result in a small increase of fatigue and a giant increase in my brain fog. My mental clarity is entirely dependent on both of these hormones. I recommend all women, regardless of age, with severe brain fog should be tested for their hormonal status, both thyroid and sex hormones. I support my family through a very cognitive job, so I need to keep the brain fog at bay to keep my home and feed my family.PUZZLE PIECE 3: SLEEP/RESTProgesterone supplementation significantly helped my sleep, especially since it eliminated night sweats. Also, I make sure I get a sufficient amount of sleep to the extent that I try most days to sleep until I wake naturally, not until an alarm goes off. Oddly, this is one of the harder things to adhere to given the way we live in our society. On the days when I do need to wake using an alarm, I use one that monitors my sleep cycles so that I wake during light sleep, not deep sleep. This is REALLY important for me otherwise my sleep is not restful. I use an app on my phone for this called Sleep Cycle-- it does not require any additional hardware.I'm not a napper, but there are days when I know I need to just stop and rest for a little while, so I try to pay attention to that as I've learned that a short rest can prevent a complete relapse.PUZZLE PIECE 4: EXERCISEI LOVE to exercise and be physical. This was a huge element of life I lost to CFS. Staying active when I'm in remission is important, and light activity when I'm in a relapse is also important, although due to my love of physical activity I have a hard time with the concept of ""light"" activity and on days when I could drag myself outside I always did too much when I was in a relapse.PUZZLE PIECE 5: SUPPLEMENTSThis was my final puzzle piece. The doctor who diagnosed me with CFS/ME told me she thought mine was due to a mitochondrial disorder. Basically, this means that my body was getting energy from my diet, but not really burning it in my cells (which happens in the mitochondria). Kind of like a car having a tank full of gas, but not getting enough gas to the engine to burn so that it will run properly.I took this to heart as I believed her to be correct due to my specific symptoms, and when I read this book I focused on the protocols that treated mitochondrial dysfunction. So my supplement regime includes: ribose, NADH, acetyl-carnitine, co-Q10, magnesium, B-12, selenium, and lysine.Prior to adding the supplements, I had partial remission and occasional glimpses of full remission. A hour or afternoon or once in a long while a good day. But never consistent remission to the point where I was my old energizer bunny self. The supplements, when combined with all of the other lifestyle changes, was the final key for me. And I don't think I would have found that piece without this book.PUZZLE PIECE 6: DRUGSThat same doctor prescribed ritalin for me to help with the fatigue. It was useful for days when I absolutely HAD to be functional and was in a bad relapse, but the doctor recommended it daily and used like that over time the ritalin ended up draining me more. It made me be active on all days when I just didn't have the energy (which was just about every day), and that's not a good thing as it ended up draining me more. I now avoid the ritalin for all but an emergency situation.A doctor prior to that tried to put me on anti-depressants. I don't know why most doctors can't understand that while CFS/ME has symptoms in common with depression, and there are a select number of patients who have both CFS/ME and depression, for most of us it is NOT depression and anti-depressants don't work. In fact, for me it made things worse as I was still fatigued and the meds made me feel even less normal.So that's my new life. Most people around me think it's a crazy, restrictive lifestyle, but for me it's freedom. It's freedom from the insanely debilitating fatigue and brain fog that left me alive but not really living. It's the freedom to now have CONTROL over how I feel and how much I can do. And it's the freedom of being myself again. It's a choice I gladly make every day.Again, I thank Erica Verrillo for contributing to my solution and for writing such a comprehensive and excellent book. I couldn't have done it without her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13OCLNDXU6UT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009B9X36Y#wasThisHelpful","R13OCLNDXU6UT","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have chronic fatigue syndrome. I do a lot of things to fight it, nutrition, sleep/rest, moderate exercise, and supplements.Nutrition/sleep are the most beneficial, but after that, this supplement contributes most to helping me fight the fatigue. It's the only supplement that gives me a definite, distinct, and nearly immediate benefit in terms of combating fatigue.My doctor tells me my fatigue is the result of a mitochondrial disorder, so it makes sense that this will work because it gives my mitochondria one of the building blocks it needs to help produce ATP, which fuels my body.If you are dealing with fatigue, I'd recommend trying this. I mix mine in with a smoothie in the morning, and just mix a little in a glass of water if I need a boost in the afternoon. Since ribose is a type of sugar, it's sweet tasting, but not the same neutral sweet as white table sugar. If you are sensitive to taste, you may need to mix this in with a smoothie, juice, coffee, tea, or your oatmeal. If not, just mix a little with in a glass of water and shoot it down.I purchased the Now Foods brand once and it had such a horrible chemical smell that even from a couple of feet away I felt like I was being exposed to a harsh, nasty chemical. No way I could get near it, let alone eat it. I've never had any problems with any Source Naturals supplement, and recommend this specific brand and product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34FD960XVAKU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019LYY7O#wasThisHelpful","R34FD960XVAKU3","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used these while on  a commercial growing project, and now use them at home to start seeds. Nothing works better.I like the larger ones because my plantlets can grow a little larger before I transplant them. Easy to seed as well. The divot in the top allows for better seed placement and fewer wayward seeds, especially with smaller one.These pots also make it possible to start indoors plants that normally are hard to transplant since they significantly reduce transplant shock.These are great for most seeds, but a little small for larger seeds, such as pumpkin, squash, or beans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OV7T78ICD7Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EHJN7K#wasThisHelpful","R2OV7T78ICD7Z2","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These have turned an unpleasant stuffing of pills down my dog's throat into something he enjoys. My dog needs to be medicated with two pills twice a day. Not very fun with the old-fashioned stuff-it-down-his-throat method, but with the pill pockets he gets treat time twice a day instead.In fact, I use it as a training opportunity. Since he knows this is part of his schedule and anticipates it, it's easy to add some training to pill time, which means I get free training twice a day. I ask him to sit, down, do a trick, whatever, and he does it happily and it reinforces things for him.For the pills he is using, I am able to break off 1/3 of a pill pocket, flatten it out, put both pills on the flat piece, then fold it over and roll it into a ball.

"You get TWO pieces of hardware in each box, enough for one saw horse. If you need one sawhorse, order one of these. If you need two saw horses, order two of these.These sawhorse brackets make it quick and easy to make your horses.Cut your top piece to the width of your table. You can use a 2x4 or a 2x6. Drill a hole in each end of the top piece to attach it to the hardware.For the legs, cut (4) 2x4s. There's a paper jig in case you want to cut them on a beveled angle for a more stable horse.Slip the legs into the hardware, then tighten down the wing nut on the bolt. A few cuts, two holes, and some twisting. Pretty easy.The only criticism I have of this is the actual hardware they give you to tighten down the apparatus. If you use the wing nut, you will never get a stable saw horse. Even if you have hands of steel and are able to get it wrench tight by turning the wing nut, it will open on its own eventually and your horse can wobble or just fall apart.I solved this by exchanging the wing nut for a locking washer and nut and used a deep socket ratchet to tighten it. (You could use a wrench, but there's not a lot of room to turn it because of the positioning of the legs, and you'll need a deep socket because of the length of the bolt). I understand the manufacturer wanted something easy to use and open, but since it doesn't provide the most stable end product, they should at least include something like the option I used for mine, so I took off a star in my review for that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2TRWD1DJFDT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GAS8LW#wasThisHelpful","R3I2TRWD1DJFDT","AESUXU5AHWEFP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESUXU5AHWEFP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I think of menstrual cramps, I think of pain, agony and feeling like I'm being tortured from the inside. I have tried heating pads, medicines and the like. Nothing has helped.

No need to worry about having an outlet nearby simply because these pads heat up via an air activated heating patch. MenstruHeat uses a gradual warming technique that heats up within 5-10 minutes of use, so that your body can get accustomed to the heat for most effective relief.These pads can be taken with you anywhere and they last up to 12 hours. I just lay on the couch or in bed with mine and let the MenstruHeat pad work it's magic. When I say ""oh sweet relief"" I truly mean it. Heating pads just cannot do what these pads do.

"When I first heard about Zipper Sheets, I wasn't too sure about them. I kinda figured they were just another one of those products out there on the market that promise you something so great only to end up fooling you once you received it. I was totally wrong in that assumption.I headed to my oldest daughters room and immediately went to work on getting the Zipper Sheets placed correctly. It was pretty simple. I had her lay in them, zip them up and tell me how comfortable she felt. She said she felt cozy and warm. I showed her how the zipper on the side of the sheets works and she got the hang of it pretty quickly. I explained to her that these sheets were designed so that there wouldn't be a big fuss in her making her own bed. I got an instant eye roll. Haha.I recommend washing sheets before you use them. The Zipper Sheets are no exception. I know not all people do this as certain products bring excitement but it's best to take precautions by washing and not risk any rashes, etc.The only thing I personally wish is that there were more color options available. I went with the grey because everything shows up on white. I really wish they carried pink or purple. I also wish they made these for bigger sized beds. My husband and I share a Queen size bed and I know we'd both benefit from them especially during the colder months.All in all, I think the Zipper Sheets can be a great addition to any kids room.

"I am a huge lover of cheese. I enjoy buying a block of cheese whenever I get the chance to nibble on as a snack here and there. One thing I do not like is having to use a knife to cut it and ending up cutting myself instead. No one wants blood on their cheese. Lol. Also, it takes a very long time cutting it with a knife. My hands are hurting not even halfway through. Mind you, I am only in my late 20's. This cheese slicer has been nothing short of a miracle to me.

"I can honestly say I was pretty excited when I received this product to review. I am always looking for ways to make being on my laptop more comfortable and this is definitely a good one. With every product comes a list of pros and cons. So let's get to those.Pros:*Space is big enough to hold laptop, mouse, cup and pen.*You can use the table in several different ways.*Legs extend up and down for perfect height for use.*Cooling fans built in underneath table.*USB cable is included and it extends to length needed to plug in.*Easy to put together and put away.*You can use the supports to place laptop however you need to on the table. I normally use mine in a flat position.Cons:*Table doesn't seem too sturdy. It wobbles while I type or during general use.*I personally would not put a drink on this table. I'd be scared of it falling over (due to wobbliness) onto my laptop and shorting everything out.I have every intention of using this table. However, I would not use it while my kids are around me playing. Even with the locks in place, the table still wobbles. I do not like this. With my luck, the laptop would probably somehow end up flying off and I'd be without one. Then I wouldn't be one very happy blogger.Do I think it's worth the money? Honestly, that depends. If you want something simple and not flashy with features, I'd recommend this.

"As a mom, I like to make sure that I take precautions when it comes to my children. This includes bath time. Sometimes I tend to make the water a little too warm and have to add cooler water to make it safe for my little one. Since using the Turtlemeter, it has made it a lot easier on me knowing when the water is too cold, just right or too hot. Not only does this Turtlemeter work as a thermometer but it's also been an instant hit with my daughter. She loves cuddling and playing with it. It still lights up at the bottom when she plays with it which she thinks is awesome. She and I both think the turtle is adorable and not scary at all.

"My youngest daughter absolutely loves this toy. After watching several reviews on Youtube for the VTech Go! Go! toys, I knew instantly when I had the opportunity to review this that it would be a hit in our household. The track is so easy to put together that my daughter did that part all on her own. The rest of it took a little time though. She enjoys playing with cars and anything that involves a track. With this set, she gets to listen to different sounds that certain pieces make. She has had a ball playing with this set. It's become a big favorite of hers and I foresee us buying something else from the Go! Go! line for Christmas. It takes five AAA batteries which can be a nuisance but rechargeable's will come in handy for that purpose. As always, VTech provides their customers with quality toys that kids are sure to love.

"This Flower LED Solar Powered Light is nothing short of amazing to me. It's pretty simple to use AND it's beautiful when it's lit up at night.

So we let her carry it around the house, with adult supervision of course. We both love how pretty it looks. It's a beautiful shade of pink and white.

"My family of 4 enjoys going outside in the snow and having snowball fights. With a little one around, we can't get too carried away, so we try to make balls that are very light. That way if one happens to hit her it doesn't hurt her.When I saw that there was something called indoor snowballs, I just had to jump at the opportunity to review them. How awesome is that? Snow balls without the snow and cold. Such an awesome product that kids young and old can play all year round.We received this awesome package full of them. At first glance, you think they are just any regular ball. When you look up close though, they have the same texture that a snowball would. They just happen to be more squishy in the middle. My kids, my husband and I all put them to the test and we had a ton of fun. They didn't hurt and we were all mesmerized at how they really do feel like an actual snowball. It was nice being able to have that kind of fun without the cold feeling in our hand and wearing extra layers.The only thing that we didn't like is how easy stuff collects on them. Dust, dirt, hair and the like. It also doesn't come off too easily. We don't let that spoil all of the fun though.My family and I can play with these for hours on end and have tons of fun.

"This Shower Bouquet set is awesome. At first glance, I had already mentally claimed the yellow and pink one. My husband uses them too so he claimed the purple and blue. Normally the poufs are rough and need to be broken in some to use them. This wasn’t the case with these.These bath poufs are different from the ones I am used to using. These contain lace AND mesh. The ones I usually use are just mesh and very rough. The first time I used the yellow one I was amazed. Not only did it lather my bar soap very well but it felt good against my skin without all the roughness. My husband wasn’t much of a fan of them. Hey, more for me to use, right? Hehe.The extra largeness of them is awesome as they are easier to hold. I’ve never before seen a bath pouf that contains lace, so I was intrigued by the idea. These are also very easy to rinse off and hang beings they come with a ribbon handle.My only complaint is 1 of the 4 didn’t contain a hanging ribbon. Plus, these won’t be for everyone. My husband was excited to try them out because of the extra largeness to them but he wasn’t a fan of how they feel. So what may work for you may not work for someone else in your family.

If the music sounds great on these, I can only imagine that using them for talking purposes does too.Overall, I am happy with these headphones and I look forward to using them as much as possible. They went into my tower easily along with my tablet. I love that they come with 3 different sized ear gels, just in case my husband or kids would like to use them. The cable is another perk to these headphones. Normally, I get caught up in them which is a big reason I don't use them. Not with these. The cable stays out of the way.

"With having a child who is in elementary school, lice combs are a lifesaver to have on hand. Combs and the like just don't get the job done.

"I love winter and the colder weather. I love being able to dress warmly in the house if it happens to get a little cool. With wanting to dress warmer, you need appropriate clothes to do so. Socks are no exception. These socks are absolutely adorable AND I love the design. They give you that wintery feel while still looking cute. They are snug but not so snug that they are uncomfortable. More like toasty warm snug. They can be worn any time but I'd prefer to wear them around home with a nice, comfy pair of PJs. I also love that they aren't too thick.

"When I was chosen for this review, I immediately got excited. From a little girl who had it every summer, I hadn't had it in so long that I forgot what it tasted like. Thanks to eTaffy that all changed.I received a 3 lb. bag for my review. I was so overwhelmed by all of the flavors that were offered. I believe I went with a pink one at first and man was it yummy. My husband claimed the orange and white ones. My kids didn't really care which ones they chose, just as long as they were able to have some.Each taffy comes individually wrapped. This makes it great because you don't have to worry about flavors mixing together and turning into something yucky. Speaking of flavors, you get 10 in this bag. They are as follows: Blue Raspberry, Peach, Huckleberry, Cinnamon, Chocolate, Neapolitan, Orange/Vanilla, Peppermint, Pear and Banana.Having some of this taffy brought me back to my childhood. No, it didn't make me feel as if I were at the beach while eating one but it did remind me of how good taffy really is. I missed having it so much. Who knew something such as this would make me feel little again. Haha. I also remember watching the people make the taffy in their shop. I thought it was one of the coolest things in the world. Oh, the memories.Beings this is such a huge bag, it'd be great for parties and other types of get togethers. For the price, you can't go wrong either. I remember the taffy at the beach being rather costly. Now that I know there's an option to order online, I will have to do so in the future once this bag is all gone.eTaffy allowed me to try flavors of taffy that I have never tried before. Some flavors I loved, others not so much. For $15.99, I totally recommend this product. What are you waiting for? Order some now. I guarantee you will love it and you won't regret it.*I received this product for review purposes.

"When I told my daughter I had a surprise coming for her, of course she was all excited. She didn't know what it was or what it even pertained to. When this Toy Sand Shovel and Water Wheel Bundle got here, she immediately wanted to head over to her grandparents and play. After a few days of waiting, we finally did.Turns out her Grandma had taken all of the old sand out of the box and put in a fresh new layer. Grandma heard that Miss Lily had a new sand toy to play with and wanted to surprise her too. Outside to the sand box we went with new sand toy in tow.At one point, my husband was in the sand box playing with this product too. Yes, sand definitely brings out the kid in adults. Haha. He also wanted to make sure the toy did everything it should.Although the toy is meant to be a water wheel, you can easily put sand in it and still have some fun. I partially didn't want to add water to it because one, it would be messy and two, because of what my daughter was wearing that day. If what the sand itself was doing was any indication of what the water would do, that part works just fine. The big shovel that comes with this set was a hit with both my husband and daughter too. It's way bigger than the average sized shovels that come with most sets.Overall, I am happy with this sand toy and so is my daughter. I foresee many future times where she'll go over there, run to her sand box and play with this particular item. Who knows.

"I am not a fan of the smell at all. If anything, it makes me not want to use it. Or if I do, I have to hold my nose. To each their own, I suppose.I went ahead and tried it anyway. I chose an area of my leg that is known to be dry. I took a before picture just to make sure I saw a difference afterwards.As you can see, it did make a slight difference. It's a little on the thick side, so it takes some extra rubbing in to get the product into the skin. After the product dried, I felt a difference and even noticed a difference. After it completely dried, my skin felt really smooth in this area.I'd like to mention that this product CAN be used for both a face cream or a body cream. Because I am funny about what products I put on my face, I went with the choice of using it as a body cream for my review.Overall, it was an alright product. If it didn't smell bad to me, I'd consider using it more often. I am funny about the smell of products and usually that will determine if I continue to use it or not.

"My daughter is a HUGE fan of Minnie Mouse. Since the day she first learned of who Minnie Mouse was, it's been nothing but ever since. I'm not complaining at all because I actually am fond of Minnie Mouse. She's not annoying like some other characters are that some kids tend to like.On to the review of this amazing product. When I was chosen to review it, obviously my daughter came to mind. Although this is geared more towards a baby and a nursery setting, trust me, my 3 year old was over the moon when the package it was in got to us. Speaking of the package, I must say that it got to us super quick and the product was all wrapped up in bubble wrap. So to whoever packed that box, THANK YOU! Minnie got to us all safe and sound.As a mom, I love how soft this product is. Soft enough for a baby to hold and play with but also snuggly enough to cuddle with. My little one has been doing just that. She has to have it with her every night when she goes to bed. The blanket that comes with it has to be with her at all times too. She enjoys seeing me swaddle Minnie in the blanket.This product will fit perfectly into a Minnie Mouse themed nursery but also with the Minnie Mouse toddler bed because of the purple and pink colors.

"This pink camo ring is absolutely beautiful. I normally wear a size 5 but with certain materials, my finger can swell up during the summer especially if it's hot outside. So I went with a 6.5. It was PERFECT! Even though my finger swelled up, I was still able to pull it off right away without any fuss.I wear this ring out now more than any other ring. I have gotten several compliments on it and that makes me very happy. All I say to those who ask where it came from is ""AntlerRings.com!"". As a woman, I prefer wearing something more feminine over something neutral or masculine. Don't get me wrong! I love everything camo. The design itself fits perfectly for a woman. It's camo but with a floral like essence.This would make a great wedding ring for that future camo wedding you may have OR it's a great ring to purchase just because. I have dinged it against a couple things and it still looks like it did the day I first received it.

"When they say no two flat irons are alike, they truly mean it. I have reviewed several but this one definitely takes priority to all of the rest. It just does the best on my hair. With the others, it feels like my hair is just being fried mostly rather than straightened. With this flat iron, my hair feels really nice once it's straightened.

"Pros:Amazing sound: The combo of the 7.1 Surround Sound and the Enhanced Bass Vibration makes for an epic gaming experience.Very Comfortable: When I first saw them I thought they were going to put pressure on my ears but that's not the case at all. I can wear them for hours at a time and not feel any discomfort at all. The headphone padding is so cushy that I hardly feel them.Very Well Built: I love the way that they adjust to fit my head. There is no pulling them to get them to fit just right. You sit them on your head and the strap has cables that automatically adjust. They are very well built. The box looks like it took a beating on the journey to my home but the headphones are solid and no problems at all.Looks awesome: These headphones seriously look awesome. The light up logo just puts the icing on the cake!Cons:The only con I can see is that sometimes when I move my head from side to side, I can hear a clicking sound. Its not constant, only when I move my head. I figured it out that it was the cables that adjust the size of the headphones. You just center the strap on your head and problem solved.Overall, these are a very solid and awesome headset for gamers!

"After doing some research online, I found out that tea tree oil is good to help get rid of cherry angiomas. So I of course wanted to test this method out. After doing the whole heating up the tip of a paper clip and placing it directly in the middle of the angioma, I finished it off with this product and the cherry angioma has diminished dramatically. For reference, it was on the left side of my forehead area. This has made me feel insecure about my face for over 3 years now. I wanted to take matters into my own hands before going to a dr and putting out hundreds if not thousands of dollars to get rid of them. The fact that something as natural as tea tree oil can do the job tells me that I definitely need to continue to look for more natural methods like this one in the future. Great essential oil and hopefully someone else finds success from the method of removing cherry angiomas like I did. :)*I received this product in exchange for an honest review.

"I started taking this mainly because of hair loss. My body is coming off of hormonal birth control and the amount of hair I have lost has been a big mess.

"My daughter is going into the 4th grade and she wants a bookbag that caters more for a kid her age. She's pretty much out of the whole cartoony bookbag phase. To me, this is great as you are only paying for the brand when it comes to those anyway. Beings she's getting older and in a higher grade, she needs something that is spacious and that will last her for longer than a year. With this bookbag, I feel she's definitely getting the space she needs and from what I see, it is very durable and will hopefully last her at least a couple years. The color combo is beautiful and she loves it too. So much so that she looks forward to her first day of school in a couple of weeks. This bookbag is not too over the top and you get a great bookbag for a decent price. To me it's just as good, if not better than, the pricey bookbags you see a lot of kids with. If this bookbag lasts her a couple of years, I know where I will be purchasing another in the years ahead. A couple things I'd like to mention is it's waterproof. Whether you use it for school, traveling, what have you, I love knowing that nothing inside will be damaged. It can take a beating and still withstand whatever comes at it. Any kid or even adult will be sure to love this bag. I know I do.

"My DVD shelf has become way too cluttered and overun by DVDs. Most of them I don't even watch anymore. They just sit there and collect dust. So what better way than to just go ahead and put them in storage bags designed specifically for DVDs? I didn't even know such a thing existed until I was able to do a review on these particular bags. They fit all but 5 DVDs that we don't watch. Keep in mind that some of these are thicker than normal cases, which could be why. The bags themselves have handles which makes for easier carrying around. Once the DVDs are in both bags, you can easily stack them on top of eachother to take up less space wherever you end up storing them. The outer portion of the bags are clear so that you can easily find the DVD you are looking for. These bags are overall pretty great and I am so glad that they exist.

"When it comes to a butterfly/fairy themed party, the possibilities are endless. A lot of parents like to put time and thought into what they will give to the kids who plan on attending in their party packs. What better way to complete the theme than with a butterfly/fairy wings, wand and headband set?With this particular set, you get 6 party packs of wings, wands and headbands. This is perfect as each little girl (or boy) who attends the party will be able to wear their own. No having to stop kids fighting over who gets what.However, something like this would also be good for a kid who just likes to play dress up. For me, I like having extras around, so that if something gets broken, it can be easily replaced with an item from one of the other packs.My daughter was pretty darn excited when we opened up the box and showed her what we got for her to help me review. She was eager to put on the wings, the headband and to hold the wand for pictures. She kept telling me how much she loved them and how they are beautiful, sparkly and pretty. After this, she made it a point to dance around the house like a little butterfly/fairy and pretending she could fly. She even granted a few pretend wishes for me. Let's not forget to mention how she pranced around talking about how the headbands are shaped like butterfly antennae.Something so simple as this can bring out so much happiness in a child. They are only little for so long, so make it a point to let their little minds imagine as much as they can. As a mom, I have very much enjoyed these beautiful butterfly/fairy sets. They are well made, not flimsy like what you would find at your local dollar store or store in general and they bring a smile to any child's face.*Received for review purposes.

"I have loved Elizabeth Strout's writing ever since I read--and reread--""Olive Kitteridge,"" so I leapt at the chance to review her new book, ""My Name is Lucy Barton.""  This latest of her books is shorter than the previous two, and I think it is more personal as well, though I have no way of knowing how much of the action, if any, comes from real life.As the book opens, Lucy Barton, a successful writer, is in the hospital with a mysterious complication of surgery that is never fully explained.  She remains in the hospital for nine weeks, largely isolated from the outside world--her husband hates hospitals and rarely visits, and her two daughters are too young to come on their own.  Suddenly, Lucy's mother, whom she has not seen in several years, shows up and stays with her in the hospital for five days.  During this time, the action alternates between the present and Lucy's past, her childhood and young adulthood, and the reader gradually comes to an understanding of both Lucy and her mother.  The two reminisce about various events and persons from the past, and in particular, they discuss the marriages of various friends and relatives.  As the book develops, the reader sees that all this talk of other people's marriages is a way for both Lucy and her mother to avoid the elephant in the room, their own marriages and relationships.Lucy's mother's visit is not all sunshine and roses.  In chapters alternating between past and present, we see the truly terrifying past that Lucy has overcome, and her mother's limited awareness of the damage she has done to her daughters and son.  Lucy's brother and sister are mentioned in small but important glimpses into the past, and the reader sees the childhood of poverty and abuse that is her heritage.  Despite all this, however, Lucy loves her mother and desperately wants her approval.  She slowly comes to a realization of who she is--the time in the hospital could be compared to an extended retreat, without the religious element--and we see the results of her epiphany in the last part of the book.I loved the way this book was written.  There is very little action; most of what happens is conversation and memory and conversation about memory.  The point of the book is the development of a self, an identity, an awareness of who you really are--thus the title:  ""My Name is Lucy Barton.""  The book reads very quickly--it has fewer than 200 pages--but it will stay with you long after you have read it.  I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys contemporary literary women's fiction.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148GYZZHRHWGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400067693#wasThisHelpful","R148GYZZHRHWGI","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always reluctant to spend money on good freezer bags, and I alway pay the price in other ways.  I do a lot of quantity cooking and then freeze individual portions in plastic bags for later use.  These bags are superb for that purpose.  Though they are a little more expensive than regular bags (with a twist tie for closing them) or zip lock (the original kind with the seal you have to work at to make it seal properly), they are definitely worth the extra money.  The slider is sturdier than most I have seen, and the bag itself holds a great deal.  I tend to reuse bags if they are not dirty, and these hold up well.

"Battleship is one of those classic games that seems to have been around forever.  I remember my brother (now in his 60s) playing it as a kid.  I was intrigued by this new version, and as my nephew is a great Star Wars fan, I decided to field test it on him and his friends, who are all 11 or 12 years old.  They all know and like the original game.The directions to the game are easy to understand.  The point of the game is to destroy the other player's fleet of ships.  There is no difference between the Star Wars version and the original version except that some of the pieces are characters or ships from Star Wars.  You could enjoy this game even if you had no previous knowledge of Star Wars, but it would appeal to you more if you were a SW fan.I always wonder about the educational value of games, but this one, according to my nephew, has no educational value.  There is some strategy involved, so maybe you could say that it sharpens a player's thinking skills.  It is scaled quite small, and I am not sure it is worth the price.  Still, if you like Star Wars, you would definitely have fun with this version of Battleship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JQWJNP2BQ3VJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJGCL6#wasThisHelpful","R1JQWJNP2BQ3VJ","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a charming little ABC book for preschoolers.  It is subtitled ""A Natural Alphabet,"" and I found that it was true to that in many ways.  First, the animals and other items named in the book are somewhat unexpected.  For example, E is for egret, and Y is for yellow-bellied sapsucker.  I can imagine kids having fun with the language of the book.  Second, the illustrations are lovely.  They have the look and feel of woodcuts, though actually they are paper art.  Finally, the colors are subtle and beautiful.  There are grays, yellows, blues, browns, pinks--but nothing bright or garish.  (If you want bright colors and cute animals doing human things like washing dishes or cooking, this is not the book for you.)  This book would be a lovely and inexpensive shower gift.

"I ordered this shaver for my husband, who is used to the Norelco brand but wanted to see what else was out there.  First of all, the user manual for this shaver is almost overwhelming, but don't be intimidated.  You don't have to use every aspect of the shaver, such as the self-cleaning/auto clean aspect.  For my husband, manual cleaning is fine.  Just figure out how to turn the thing on and you are good to go.This shaver gives a very close shave, somewhat closer than the Norelco, which was not bad either.  However, it is just a little noisier (but not all that noisy), and to get that close shave, you have to hold the shaver at an angle.  If you are used to the Noreco, which angles the shaving apparatus for you, this may be a little awkward at first, but you will appreciate the closer shave.All in all, this is a great shaver.  It is a little pricy, but it does a very good job and does not irritate your skin.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOT59BXHSNWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SIJSNUY#wasThisHelpful","R3FOT59BXHSNWC","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was a little skeptical when I ordered this Black and Decker iron to review.  B&D makes products at all price points, and most of my experience has been with their less expensive brands.  However, I took a chance with this iron and I am so glad I did.  This is by far the best iron I have ever had.  The directions are intuitive and easy to follow.  The iron is clearly marked with five different heat settings and three steam settings.  It is easy to fill and seems to be extremely well-made.Of course, none of this makes any difference if it doesn't iron well.  I am thrilled to say that I have never had better performance out of an iron.  It easily gets the wrinkles out of both sides of trouser legs or knit tops.  I would recommend this iron to anyone who is looking for great performance at a fairly reasonable price.The only caveat I have about this iron is that it is quite heavy.  Three years ago I injured my wrist and had to get a lighter-weight iron.  Today I can manage the weight of this iron pretty easily, but I still notice the weight.  If you have arthritis or other issues with strength in your hands, this may not be the iron for you.  Otherwise, buy it with confidence.  You won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SXC8D07QINOI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5ILE2W#wasThisHelpful","R3SXC8D07QINOI","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love this enormous Boss Office chair.  It arrived earlier than I expected, by freight truck, not UPS or FedEx.  The driver brought it into my foyer, and my husband and I opened it immediately.  It was packed perfectly, with no loose ends.The chair came in five parts, not counting the screws. At  first we were delighted to see that there were only five parts, as we thought that meant that assembling it would be a piece of cake.  However, we were quickly disabused of this idea.The assembly instructions are located on one sheet of paper, and except for two sentences, they are all pictorial.  After we finally got the chair together, the instructions made sense, but trying to figure out exactly how to make everything fit was problematic.  There is an 800 number on the assembly sheet to call for help, but after several minutes on hold, I gave up.  Fortunately, my brother is skilled at figuring out how to put things together, and he came over that evening.I highly recommend that when you assemble this chair, you enlist the help of at least one and preferably two other persons--you need the third at the end, which I will explain below.  Brother Tom, the expert, said that while it would be possible for one person to assemble it, it is far easier with two.  He figured out how the parts went together and from that point on, we easily matched the screws with their appropriate holes.  The company provides an Allen wrench for your convenience, but you will also need your own Phillips-head screwdriver.  After the chair itself is assembled, you have to drop it onto the base, which is where you need the third person, two to hold the chair and one to guide it onto the base.The chair itself is beautifully made of high quality leather.  It is extremely comfortable with superb lumbar support.  It is meant to accommodate persons weighing up to 350 pounds; thus its heaviness.  The wheels are already attached to the base and roll smoothly over even our deep carpet.  I have been using it a few hours a day since we assembled it, and I love it.  If you are sitting in the chair, it is easy to adjust the height downward; to go up, I had to get out of the chair.  This is almost certainly my own issue, something I have not quite figured out about how to go up while sitting in the chair, but it is not a problem for me because I am the only one who uses this chair, and I do not change the height.I am delighted with this chair, and I highly recommend it.  Save yourself time and frustration; enlist a helper to assemble the chair.  From that point on, I bet you will be delighted, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHMUR71MIPCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T4NAREI#wasThisHelpful","R2NHMUR71MIPCN","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My husband and I enjoyed all six flavors of coffee in the Java Factory Variety Pack.  By far our favorite was Choconut, a blend of chocolate and coconut, but we also liked all the other varieties.  The only other flavored coffee was a French vanilla; the others were normal coffee flavor of varying strengths. All were smooth, with no bitter taste or post-coffee stomach upset.  We have used about half the box, and all have worked perfectly in our basic Keurig (NOT the Keruig 2.0).  My only issue is that the flavors are not evenly alloted; there are more of the ""regular"" coffee and fewer of the flavored coffees.  In fact, our favorite, Choconut, had the fewest of all.

We are still enjoying the coffee and recommend it without reservation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22YNTI110IPT1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HHMPF86#wasThisHelpful","R22YNTI110IPT1","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted to this product by the Delta brand and reputation and the water temperature sensor.  The shower head itself is very lightweight and easy to handle in the shower.  I love the temperature sensor and so does my husband.Installation was easy except for one thing.  The instructions (which are very easy to follow) indicate that a washer was needed.  At first we could not find the washer, so we tried to install without it and the shower head leaked badly.  So we searched the packaging for the washer.  Be advised that the washer is located in the wrap-around packaging at either end of the ""cord"" part of the faucet.  It occurred to me that this might be the case; we checked, and there it was. I had discarded this material at first, so be aware that the washer is kind of hidden in the packaging.  Other than this, installation was no problem at all.One reason I decided to get this shower head is that my husband's shower stall is extremely small, and the old shower head ""cord"" stuck out and took up room he didn't have when he showered.  This cord seemed more flexible, and it is, slightly.  But it still is an issue in a tiny shower stall.  This is definitely not the fault of Delta or the product itself, but it is something to keep in mind if you have a very small shower stall.In my opinion, the price is a bit high, probably because of the sensor technology.  However, the product is excellent, and I recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11XDOLRWDAIJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPPQ8O0#wasThisHelpful","R11XDOLRWDAIJR","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was attracted by the colorful complexity of this toy when I volunteered to review it for Amazon.  A good friend has a six-year-old grandson, so I asked her to ""field test"" this product.  While it is rated for ages six and above, there is no way a six year old could put this toy together.  To be fair, this fact is clearly stated upfront, but at the same time, a toy that requires this much adult intervention is challenging at best and frustrating at worst.The many (100) tiny plastic pieces are brightly colored; they are individually numbered to correspond with the pictures and diagrams in the instruction booklet.  Assembly took two hours, partly because the pieces were extremely hard to snap together.I can see that this toy has the potential to be a great deal of fun for a young child.  However, for this to occur, all the parts would have to remain secure and the marbles wold have to move through the chute effectively.  This did not happen.  The gear handle that operates the toy fell off repeatedly, and the marbles had trouble moving through the spiral tube.A child of 12 or older might be able to assemble this toy, but would he or she have the patience to do it?  I tend to think not.  It would be nice if this toy were capable of being redesigned or repurposed for more creative play, but it is not.  Once assembled, it does not have enough flexibility to hold the interest of a child.I cannot in good conscience recommend this toy.  If I had purchased it, I think I would have returned it.

"""All Dogs Go to Kevin,"" a clear reference to ""All Dogs Go to Heaven,"" is a delightful book that will be loved and appreciated by anyone who loves dogs and has ever had a dog share his or her life.  Jessica Vogelsang, the author, details her own coming of age and her relationships with the three dogs she has owned:  Taffy, Emmett, and Kekoa.  She begins the journey in middle school and takes us on an emotional journey through high school, college, veterinary school, and marriage.The book is engaging and very easy to read; even kids in upper elementary grades would be able to manage it.  However, the part I found most compelling was the role that dogs play in the lives of, as the author puts it in her dedication, ""the misfits, the miscreants, the misunderstood, the freaks and geeks and socially inept, and the dogs who love them.""  It is clear from the outset that the author sees herself as one of these ""misfits"" who found salvation in the love of a dog.  She write with grace and compassion of her relationship with both animals and people, and she clearly does not write off anyone, no matter what issues they may have.Some reviewers have compared the book favorably to James Herriot's ""All Creatures Great and Small.""  I do not share this view.  I found Herriot's books far more charming and compelling and have read each one several times.  This book is just not in that category.  However, that is not meant to dismiss the many virtues of this book.  Almost any lover of dogs would enjoy and identify with the characters in the book, especially the author.  I recommend it highly, and if you are not expecting Herriot, you will enjoy this book exactly for what it is.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U8JO34O3Z5VA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554936#wasThisHelpful","R1U8JO34O3Z5VA","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love cookbooks and have far too many, even after having donated several dozen to our local library booksale.  My favorite kind of cookbook is one that you can read like a real book; one that has comments about each recipe and personal stories to accompany them.  ""Goldie's Kitchen Cookbook"" is exactly the sort of cookbook I love.  Written (or collected) by a writer of mysteries whose work I have never read, this cook book connects each recipe with one of the author's works.  Each has an introduction detailing the connection with the book, the personal experience of the author with the recipe, and any caveats about challenges you may encounter as you prepare the recipe.The recipes themselves are not the ""simple and easy"" kind, but they are not overly complicated, either.  The author often urges the cook to use the best and freshest ingredients available, which is a great suggestion no matter what you are preparing.  Some recipes are ultra simple, such as Green Beans Amandine, which is exactly what you would expect, a simple preparation with salt, pepper, and butter to add flavor.  Others are longer and more complex, such as Shuttlecock Shrimp Curry, but none are truly complicated.  I look forward to reading and re-reading this book and to trying out a great many of the recipes.  Anyone who loves both cooking and commentary would love and appreciate this book.

"As a retired English teacher, I am always looking for interesting and amusing ways to teach language concepts.  The title of this book, ""My Teacher Is an Idiom,"" suggests that it will introduce young children to the concept of idioms, and indeed it does.  It describes what an idiom is, gives many examples, and even investigates the idea that different languages have different idiomatic expressions.Where it falls down, however, is in the ""interesting and amusing"" category.  Perhaps second graders will be captivated by the borderline cruel Patrick and his hapless victim Richard, but that may be too much to hope for.  The third main character, Sophie, a transfer student from France, is better, but only somewhat.  The two boys run afoul of school rules and are required to do a presentation about good manners.  If this does not sound particularly interesting or amusing to you, that is because it is not.  I have a feeling kids will be bored with this book and set it aside about a third of the way through.That said, it is easy to read, written on a very basic reading level.

"""The Year She Left Us"" by Kathryn Ma is the story of a multi-generational Chinese American family told from multiple points of view.  At the center of the story is the youngest member, Ari (short for Ariadne), a very young adult who is trying to come to terms with having been abandoned as an infant on the steps of a Chinese department store and adopted by a single parent, Charlie (short for Charlotte), a Chinese American public defender with more than a touch of social worker in her.  The other major narrative voices are those of Charlie's sister, Les (short for Lesley), a lawyer/judge, and their mother (and Ari's grandmother), Gran.  Each of these women is complex and interesting, each strong in her own ways.As the book opens, Ari has graduated from high school and is on her way to her grandmother's alma mater, Bryn Mawr.  She decides to visit China with her closest friend, A.J., who is also a Chinese adoptee, to see the orphanage she was adopted from and to determine whether her birth parents ever regretted their decision to give her up and tried to retrieve her.  The reader realizes that this is futile, but it is important to Ari, who is suffering from many of the issues that beset adopted children, especially those of abandonment and the fantasy of ""what might have been.""  In China, Ari suffers what can only be called a breakdown and does something irrevocable to herself, a highly symbolic act that I will not reveal.Meanwhile, at home in San Francisco, Charlie is living in major denial that anything is wrong with Ari.  She wants her to come home in time to get ready for college; she has no clue as to Ari's true state of mind.  Charlie has a secret of her own, one that is not revealed until midway through the book, but it has a major impact on all the characters.  Les's importance as a character increases as the book proceeds; despite being sisters, Les and Charlie  are very different personalities with diametrically opposed approaches to life.  Gran has the strongest personality of all.  She and her sister left China after World War II, leaving their entire family behind to deal with the horrors of the Communist regime.  Gran has more secrets than anyone else, and some are revealed only in the final chapters of the book when she herself returns to China for a visit.Most reviewers would classify this book as a coming of age story, and indeed it is, but it is also a family saga, a cautionary tale about the corrosive power of the past and its secrets, and the dangers of not dealing with reality.  Frustrating as all of these characters are, they are also endearing; the reader cannot help but feel affection and sympathy for each one of them.  The writing is superb; if I have any issues, it would be with the pacing of the book about a third of the way through, when it seems just a bit sluggish.  The second half, however, is riveting; it was hard to put the book down.I know personally some young adult adoptees, and the issues Ari is dealing with seem authentic and well defined.  I hope to share this book with my young adoptee friends, as well as with their parents and others who are trying to help them deal with their issues of abandonment and identity. I give this book my highest recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CNTT5KPVPR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062273345#wasThisHelpful","R2CNTT5KPVPR3","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very heavy and sturdy pie plate.  I not only made a chicken pot pie very successfully, I also used this pie plate as a weight for a crust I wanted to pre-bake briefly.  It worked perfectly.  The only problem is that you cannot see how brown the crust is (the way you can in a Pyrex or other glass pan).  Despite this,  I like the pan; the crust browns evenly, and if you have a recipe you trust and accurate oven temperature, you should be fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVGW96M8CHSL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M547LJW#wasThisHelpful","RHVGW96M8CHSL","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""We Are the Goldens"" is very fast paced and easy to read.  Written in the form of a long message from the younger sister, Nell, to her adored older sister, Layla, the book covers nearly one school year, a year in which Layla begins to lead a secret life and involves Nell in keeping this secret from their divorced parents.  The specific nature of the secret is not revealed until about midway through the book, but the perceptive reader will have guessed it long before that point.  Much of the conflict in the book centers around Nell's discomfort with Layla's refusal to share what is going on with their parents, and the fact that she has to bear the burden of Layla's deception alone.As their name suggests, the lives led by Nell and Layla are privileged:  They are from upper middle class families, go to private schools, and are endowed by nature with physical beauty, athletic, artisitic and literary ability, and keen intelligence.  However, the ""gold"" of their lives is not all it seems.  There is a cancer beneath the surface that goes unnoticed amid all the distracting glitter.  One authentic bright spot, however, is Nell's relationship with long time ""friend who happens to be a boy"" (as opposed to boyfriend), Felix, who is (as much as he can be at his age) the moral center of the book.  Nell is also testing the waters of her own first sexual relationship, with less than stellar (though not disastrous) results.  And for those who like a bit of the supernatural in their YA novels, Nell also gets advice from the ""ghosts"" of two brothers, friends from the neighborhood who died in separate incidents the previous year. These brothers visit her at various crisis points throughout the novel, offering perceptive advice and perspective.  The parents in this family are essentially good people, upper middle class, divorced, each loving in their own ways--but they are largely excluded from the emotional lives of their daughters.I would classify this book (just in time for summer) as a beach read for young teens.  There are some good points made about the corrosive power of secrecy and the burden it places on those who share our secrets.  In addition, the book has a strong message about  appropriate sexuality and the ways young teens explore their sexuality.  (However, there is very little explicit sex in the book; most of this exploration is by way of recollection and consequences.)  Though I liked this book, I do not think it is great literature.  It is enjoyable, however, and I do recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G55XNV2NL1WX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385742576#wasThisHelpful","R3G55XNV2NL1WX","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Close Your Eyes, Hold Hands"" is a book you will not soon forget.  Set in the present (or possibly near future) in Vermont, it concerns a meltdown at a nuclear plant (think Japan's Fukushima Dai-ichi in 2011) that has a predictably searing effect on the main character, 16-year-old Emily Shepard, whose parents are implicated in the accident and are both killed.  As the book opens, Emily is homeless, living in an igloo she has constructed of trash bags and wet leaves with a nine-year-old companion, Cameron.  How she got here is the subject of the book, and it is a coming of age tale for the ages.I will not spoil the book by revealing too much, but you should know that Emily goes through the tortures of the damned in so many ways:  physically, psychologically, spiritually.  Imagine months of life on the streets of Burlington for a homeless teenage girl, and you will not be far off the mark.  Emily is a marvel, however.  She is by turns and all at once insightful, childlike, hopeful, cynical, intelligent, honest, deceitful, passionate, caring, lost, and found.  She quotes Emily Dickinson at length and often, and shows uncanny insight.  The author, Chris Bohjalian, has a pitch-perfect ear for the bright but disillusioned teenage girl voice, and this is evident from page one.  (To be fair, he credits his young adult daughter for her help in achieving this.  Still, it is amazing.)If this book interests you, I recommend that you listen to the NPR interview with the author conducted by Diane Rehm in July of 2014.  (You can find it on the Diane Rehm website and listen to the entire thing or read a transcript.  I recommend listening.)  In that interview, I was surprised to learn that the author did not envision this as a YA novel.  Although much of the subject matter is very adult, this is not unusual for today's YA literary scene, and I thought from the first that this book would be the next new thing in YA literature.  That said, I can see it as an adult novel as well, one that adults and teens might profitably discuss together.Hats off to Chris Bohjalian for creating Emily and letting her tell her story.  This is a novel you won't want to miss.  Highly recommended for everyone from mature teens to adults.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S2C2S5QRZXMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385534833#wasThisHelpful","R2S2C2S5QRZXMY","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are looking for a great gift for someone who loves dogs, you could not do better than Ace Collins's ""Man's Best Hero.""  Collins is obviously a dog-lover himself, and this affection shows in every page.  Whether he is recounting the exploits of dogs on the battlefield or showing how the relationship with a dog can transform a hardened criminal, Collins makes each dog a unique ""personality.""  The book is short and very easy to read, and since there is no continuing story line, it lends itself to short reads when you have only a few minutes.

"I got this shaver for my husband to try.  He has been a committed Norelco man for as long as we have been married (38 years), and I was wondering if he could be charmed by another brand.  In addition, I liked the idea of a charging station that could be used as we travel, since in foreign countries you cannot always count on being able to use your own electric gadgets without an adapter.  I am pleased to say that he is very enthusiastic about the shaver.  It has the same basic design as the Norelco (three floating heads) and gives a very close and smooth shave.  It is easy to clean and the charging station is easy to set up, though directions could be a little more clear in this respect.  Once you figure it out, however, it is a piece of cake.One thing I cannot evaluate yet is how long the heads will keep giving this close shave, and this is important as replacement heads are not cheap.  This is one downfall of the Norelco brand--sometimes it is just easier to buy a new shaver than to buy replacement heads because of the price.  I am hoping that the Remington will last a long time and continue giving a great shave.My husband did not test the shaver in the shower, but other reviewers did, and you can read their remarks.

"The Fisher Price Dora and Friends Cafe is a charming toy, and it is appropriate for toddlers as well as preschoolers, as long as you keep a watchful eye for small parts.  The cafe is easily put together except for the staircase, which took several tries before it was secure. It is nice that batteries are included, and  the toy has a lot of potential for imaginative play.  There are two caveats, however:  the toy includes only one figure, Dora; it would be nice if there were at least a couple more figures included.  The preschooler I tested this toy on used his imagination and cut out the figures on the packaging to use as extras.  In addition, I am not sure the price is appropriate.  While there is a sound/spoken word aspect to this toy, the rest of it is basically plastic.  At this price, I would expect at least two additional figures to play with, so I am not sure I can completely recommend the toy.  Still, both Brandon (5.5 years old) and little brother Joey (2 years old) found ways to enjoy this toy, so I do like it.

"I ordered this book because my husband is a railroad enthusiast, and I knew that he would be able to help me review it honestly.  In addition, the is a DK book, and for those unfamiliar with DK travel books, they are a delight.  Although other books may provide more text, DK books offer a wealth of photos, maps, and drawings.This book, ""The Iron Road"" by Christian Wolmar, has exceptional drawings, photos, maps, and graphics, but in addition, it provides a superb and detailed text.  The book is divided into five sections, each dealing with an aspect of railroads around the world in chronological order.  Many books have examined the engineering of railroads, but this one also deals with the human aspect of railroad construction, especially the intrigue and greed that form the backdrop of many railroads.  Most readers, unless they are well acquainted with railroad history, are unaware of the human cost of rail expansion, not only in the United States but around the world.  Wolmar recounts this human cost with compassion and insight, never over-dramatizing it, but making sure the reader does not dismiss it.In Australia, for example, rather than standardize the track width, 22 track widths were used, a case study in how not to create a railroad network.  Why did this happen?  Every rail baron wanted to be first to get his piece of the railroad action.  This greed precluded cooperation and set Australia's rail system back decades.The transformative effect of railroads on society cannot be overestimated.  In addition to travel, industry,  and commerce, the impact of railroads on war, especially the American Civil War and in Europe, World War II, is covered in detail.  The role of rail transport in the mass deportation of entire populations to prison and extermination camps in Germany, France, Poland, and China is recounted.  Railroads in Asia and Russia are significant, too.  This book reads more like an adventure story than a history; indeed, if history were taught this way in schools, many more of us would know it and learn from it.I recommend this highly readable book to anyone who is looking for a good general history of railroads around the world.  An expert will likely know most of what is in this book, but the general reader will not.  This is a perfect book for the general reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D0MU4SJ34Q0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465419535#wasThisHelpful","R1D0MU4SJ34Q0X","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am stunned that this is Celeste Ng's first novel.  I was instantly drawn into this book, with its beautifully drawn characters and superb writing.  On its surface, the story is a mystery:  What led to the death of Lydia Lee, a sixteen-year-old honor student with (supposedly) everything to live for?  In reality, the mystery goes far deeper, into the lives of each member of the family.  By the end of the book, the reader is fully in sympathy with each character.The novel, which takes place in the late 70s,  begins with Lydia's death.  Was it murder?  Was it suicide?  Or was it something else?  The reader spends most of the novel thinking one thing, only to be surprised at the end with the truth.  The author delves into the lives of each family member:  James, the father, who never felt really at home in any situation; Marilyn, the mother, whose dreams were shelved by the demands of marriage, family, and the times; Nathan, the older brother, whose brilliance is overlooked; Lydia, the golden child burdened with all the frustrated aspirations of her parents; and Hannah, the overlooked afterthought of a child, a silent but keen observer of everyone in her family.  (I was torn between imagining the author as Lydia or as Hannah; I suspect she is an amalgam of both.)Many chapters in this novel focus on just one character, telling the story from his or her point of view.  The reader is led to an understanding of just how profoundly even the best intentions can go terribly awry.  Once again, we see people living out their own frustrated dreams through their children, who may or may not be on board.  The term ""helicopter parent"" comes to mind, though this idea was not in vogue until the 90s.  In addition, issues of race in America  and women's roles are explored through the parents, James and Marilyn, who came of age in the 60s and early 70s at the height of the sexual and civil rights revolutions.  Even gay identity comes into play, and remember that this novel is set in 1977, not 2014.I am compelled to praise the writing of this book.  Both psychologically astute and poetic, it draws the reader into the story and evokes sympathy and awe.  We see the devastating grief that overtakes each member of the family as he or she tries to see why Lydia died and what he or she may have done to prevent it.  I also loved the way the author treated memory, that old deceiver, who smoothes out that which we cannot bear to recall.I do not think this book is marketed as a YA novel, but it is certainly a book that parents and teenagers may profitably read and discuss together.  The issues  are fresh and relevant, and I can imagine that meaningful discussions and insights may result.  Highly recommended for all readers 14 and above.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ5GLAVWYUNUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420571X#wasThisHelpful","RZ5GLAVWYUNUT","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Katherine Howe's ""Conversion"" is an exploration of two parallel stories: the Salem, Massachusetts witch trials of the late 17th century, and the appearance of a mysterious ""illness,"" or symptoms that come suddenly upon the (mostly) senior girls attending an exclusive Catholic prep school, loosely based on the Le Roy Mystery Illness of 2012 in New York.Most of us know, or think we know, the story of the Salem trails, in which adolescent and pre-adolescent girls claimed to be possessed by Satan as the result of having been cursed by one or another of the women in the town.  Sixteen women were convicted of witchcraft and put to death, and only fifteen years later did one of the accusers, Ann Putnam, confess that the girls had been either faking or deluded.  Her confession is included in the book, but it does not totally resolve the mystery of what went on in Salem.Fast forward to 2012.  We find ourselves in Danvers, Massachusetts, at St. Joan's Prep School, where girls are under extreme academic, social, and emotional pressure.  Suddenly, three of them begin to exhibit unusual symptoms for which no physical explanation can be found.  Enter a round of media attention, self-proclaimed experts, conspiracy theories, and panic.  As more and more girls exhibit stranger and stranger symptoms, few adults are able to remain rational.  Bizarre theories are floated to explain the symptoms, and none proves definitive.The book is structured so that most of the chapters are set in the present and told from the point of view of one of the most rational of the girls, Colleen Rowley, although even she falls victim to whatever is happening eventually.  Every two or three chapters, we go back to Salem, where Ann Putnam, now in her late 20s or early 30s, is confessing what really happened back then to her minister, the Reverend Green.  In both instances, the symptoms make the girls celebrities of sorts in their communities, and it is strongly suggested that the desire to be noticed, to be paid attention to, is a major part of whatever is happening--not consciously, in every case, but on some level.  Malevolence is not ruled out as well, especially in Salem, and especially with one of the girls.A major theme of this book is that everyone involved, both in Salem and at St. Joan's, hijacked the crisis and made it fit their own agenda.  The author does this very skillfully in both instances, though I think young readers will naturally find it easier to relate to the modern story and see more clearly how adults manipulate events for their own reasons, consciously or not.  Especially odious in this regard are an obnoxious parent and a self-aggrandizing celebrity with a new theory as to the cause of the illness.I liked this book very much.  The parallels between the two events are skillfully drawn, and the characters are mostly relatable and attractive.  Readers who think they know about the Salem witch trials because they are familiar with Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" will be in for a surprise--I liked this part of the book especially, as it reinforced the theme that no matter what historical event a person writes about, he or she will do so with a particular point of view, and will therefore select some events and omit others to reinforce that point of view.I am eager to hear what younger readers have to say about this book, and I will be lending it to my nieces to get their opinions.  This would make an interesting summer reading assignment for high school students, especially those in honors or AP tracks who may be facing the same pressures as the girls at St. Joan's.  Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTJH6LT8Q1IL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399167773#wasThisHelpful","R2RTJH6LT8Q1IL","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Count me among those who were immediately involved in E. Lockhart's ""We Were Liars.""  Readers both young and old will be captivated by the characters and the superb writing, which combines everyday life with a hint of magical realism.As other reviewers have noted, the plot revolves around the Sinclair family.  When you imagine this family, think of a cross between the Kennedy clan and a Ralph Lauren print ad in an upscale magazine.  This is an old money family, with more than its share of secrets, prejudices, rituals, and customs.  The patriarch of the family owns an island off the coast of Massachusetts, to which his three daughters and their families come each summer for a golden idyll in a magical place.  At least, this is the way it is supposed to be, but that is a lie, and it is just the beginning of lies.Now think of King Lear, and you will have an idea of the sort of father this patriarch is.  The daughters are not exact parallels to Lear's daughters, but there are enough resemblances to keep the reader interested.  The focus of the book is on the next generation, the children of the three daughters (and their friend, a contrast both in culture and social status).I hope no one reviewing this book has revealed the plot in too much detail.  You will have to trust me when I say you will not see the final plot twist coming, though when you re-read the book (as you will feel compelled to do), you will see all manner of foreshadowing and hints.  This book is an examination of the lies we tell ourselves and each other to live harmoniously on the surface of our world, and the price those lies exact.  I am recommending this book to all my reader friends, and I will be sharing it with my nieces, who I am confident will love it.A final note on style:  You will occasionally encounter a disconcerting narration that seems at first literal, but is in fact magical realism.  For example, when Cady Sinclair Eastman, the 15-year-old narrator of the book, is recounting her parents' divorce, she describes her father packing his things into his Mercedes.  Then you read this:  ""Then he pulled out a handgun and shot me in the chest.  I was standing on the lawn and I fell.  The bullet hole opened wide and my heart rolled out of my rib cage and down into a flower bed.  Blood gushed rhythmically from my open wound,then from my eyes,my ears,my mouth.It tasted like salt and failure.  The bright red shame of being unloved soaked the grass in front of our house, the bricks of the path, the steps to the porch.  My heart spasmed among the peonies like a trout.Mummy snapped.  She said to get hold of myself.""My first thought upon reading this was that Cady's father had lost control and actually shot her.  The mother's comment makes clear, however, that this passage is a poetic description of how devastated Cady was at her parents' separation.  This sort of thing happens throughout the book, and I came to enjoy the poetic imagery.  Just don't take these passages literally.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y75FILDQ9UH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038574126X#wasThisHelpful","R35Y75FILDQ9UH","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In a recent purge of our bookshelves, my husband, a retired math teacher, donated his copy of this book to our local library.  Of course, six months later he wanted it back, and we were fortunate to find this copy on Amazon.  It has no bells and whistles, no colorful pictures or cutesy approaches, just clear, direct explanations of all aspects of analytic geometry.  He is tutoring students in high school geometry, and although much of the material in this text is beyond the scope of most high school curricula, he is finding it helpful to review some of the principles in this book.  This text is a classic, and it is particularly good in its approach to matrices and trigonometric functions.  It emphasizes the use of matrices in solving equations.  Though this text was written nearly sixty years ago, it is still relevant.

"I like canned tuna a great deal and always buy solid white, usually packed in water.  I decided to get this tuna and I was so happy with it that I ordered four more cans.  The tuna is packed in oil, and it looks great in the can--perfectly solid with no little flakes.  I decided to try it on greens with just a little fresh lemon and a few extra veggies, and a tiny bit of Hellman's mayo.  It was excellent.  I was going to make a regular tuna salad with onion and celery, salt, pepper, and mayo, but I decided I like the tuna flavor ""straight.""  I am delighted with this tuna and recommend it to anyone.  I will be buying this from now on, even though it is a bit more expensive than supermarket brands.  The quality is well worth the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T5OCEL97B8PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G6A7UU6#wasThisHelpful","R3T5OCEL97B8PL","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent gift for any parent (or other interested adult) who wants to encourage in kids an interest in science in an engaging and fun way.  The ""experiments"" are not difficult, and they do not require too much parental involvement, though you may want to get in on the fun.  They do not require any special equipment that you would not be likely to have around the house, though you will need a number of common household items.  I actually think this is a plus, as you can do the experiments again and again if your child shows interest.  Many kids younger than eight would be interested in these activities, though they may need help reading the instructions.  We are having a hard winter here in northern Ohio, and I think many parents would love this science kit to help keep their children entertained and learning in a fun way on the many ""snow/calamity days"" we have been having.  Directions for the experiments are clear.

"I was looking for a coffee maker that would allow me to use my own coffee rather than the very expensive single-serve cups.  The Hamilton Beach fits the bill really well, and you will be satisfied as long as you do not expect it to do things it was not designed to do.  For example, it will not keep your coffee warm, as there is no warming plate.  I like the size of the coffee maker and the stainless  steel finish, and I find that it is easy to keep clean.  There is a little splashing as the coffee is being dripped into the cup, but it is easy to clean afterward.  On the recommendation of other reviewers, I purchased the replacement filters for Aeropress, and I find that they catch most (but not all) of the coffee grounds.  There is a backup filter, so it catches any grounds that escape before they get into your coffee cup.

"""No Book but the World"" is a a very thoughtful, philosophical novel that is on its surface a family saga/crime story, but is in reality a meditation on the limits of human freedom and the existence of free will.  The main characters, all adults, are brother and sister Ava and Fred, and their childhood friends Kitty and Dennis (who by the time of the novel is married to Ava).  The principal narrator is Ava, who has always felt a combination of responsibility and resentment for Fred, who is impaired in some way that is never fully defined.  Ava and Fred's parents were followers of the philosophy of Jean Jacques Rousseau, especially with respect to his views on education.  They founded a free school based on Rousseau's principles, and Ava and Fred were brought up there in relative isolation from the real world.  This is important because of the interplay of imagination, freedom, and reality that is a constant motif in the book.  Kitty and Dennis are brought up much more conventionally, but they remain close friends.As the book opens, Ava is trying to find out what is going on with her brother, who has been accused of a murder.  There are long sequences of memory and description, and if the reader is looking for a fast-paced, plot-driven narrative, he or she will be very frustrated.  There is little dialogue, and what dialogue exists is only a springboard to more memories and philosophical musings.  The book is divided into five sections, with Fred, Kitty, and Dennis each narrating one, and Ava bookending them with the first and last.  The reader learns about the unusual relationship between the parents and the children, and all the linkages between the past and present.  The events of the present, with all their legal ramifications, are also explored.The theme of this book is most aptly summed up in the frontpiece, a quotation from ""Promenade"" by Maria Irene Fornes:  ""I know everything.  Half of it I really know.  The rest I make up.  The rest I make up.""  This quotation gets to the heart of the book:  What do we really know?  How accurate are our memories?  How do we frame the story of our life so that it makes sense?  How much of what we think we know is really wishful thinking or imagination?  All of these questions are explored in great detail through the narrative.This book is not for everyone.  It is extraordinarily well-written, but the long ruminative passages will be off-putting to some.  However, if you know what to expect and you are interested in a reflection on memory, imagination, and freedom set within an unusual family, you will find this book ultimately rewarding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DS6FWKWJN3QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594486034#wasThisHelpful","R3DS6FWKWJN3QK","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave the Alpha Explorer to my cousin to evaluate with her five-year-old son Brandon.  Brandon was ecstatic when he saw the toy, saying, ""I always wanted a space ship, and no one ever got me one!""  He loved playing with it from the start, and he told his mom he wanted an entire galaxy in his living room.  So Laura blew up balloons of different sizes and hung them around the living room, creating our solar system for Brandon and his space ship.  Brandon was in heaven.This toy is durable, and it makes several sounds, both words and ""spacey"" noises, and this brings me to my one issue.  When the toy was delivered, it was making a beeping noise (which I am sure was delightful to the UPS driver).  We opened the box immediately and fiddled with the batteries, but we could not make the noise stop until we changed the batteries.  We read in the instructions that this sort of event is an indication that the batteries are nearly spent.  The new batteries worked fine, except that now the toy is very sensitive, and even a slight jostle will set it off, making some sort of noise.  This is startling and disconcerting unless you are expecting it, and I advise that when you are not actually using the toy, you store it where it cannot be moved.Still, that is my only caution.  Your preschooler will get hours of imaginative play out of this toy, so I do recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NZ8U137ZOQ4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6N0MGI#wasThisHelpful","R1NZ8U137ZOQ4A","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Doing Harm"" is Kelly Parsons first novel, and it is the best novel I have read since ""Defending Jacob.""Steve Mitchell is a chief resident in surgery and is the supervisor of a group of medical students at Boston University Hospital, a teaching hospital associated with BU.  Steve, who is in charge of making these students into doctors, is married to Sally, a stay-at-home mom who used to be a high-ranking assistant to the head of Human Resources at the hospital, where the two met.Sally and Steve go to Dr. Collier's annual cocktail party.  Collier is Steve's boss and chairman of Steve's department. Sally wants Steve to become a member of the faculty of the medical school, which would be an enormous advancement for him.  She hints at this to Dr. Collier, with whom Steve is scheduled to meet in the next week.  At the meeting, it seems that Steve will get his promotion, but then things become a little crazy at the hospital.Two of Steve's new students are Luis, a very serious and conscientious student, and Gigi (which stands for Golden Girl), a very bright student who is perhaps a little too smart for her own good.  After Steve is promised the promotion, very bad things begin to happen.  Medicine is not given in the proper dosage, patients go into comas, and some do not ever come out.  All of these events are blamed on Steve and his students, and soon, even Steve's favorite mentor will not allow Steve near him in the operating room.Does Steve get to the bottom of these mysterious events?  Is he destroyed mentally and professionally in the process?  Read this superb novel and find out.This is a very well written novel.  The characters were very realistic, and it is easy to see that the author has first-hand experience in a hospital.

"In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that when I ordered this SteelSeries 9H Gaming Headset, I thought it would be appropriate for my husband to use.  He enjoys flying on the Microsoft FlightSimulator, and I thought he would use and enjoy this headset.  However, we soon discovered that the headset is meant for other sorts of games.  As neither he nor I is a gamer, I asked my nephew to field test this headset, and he and his son (who is nine) have been using it for about two weeks.  Here is his evaluation:The first impression of the SteelSeries 9H Gaming Headset is the feeling of quality you get when you take it out of the box.  The headset itself is sturdily made, and the included cables have a woven sheath around them that seems far better constructed than plain vinyl cords.  The included 2-meter extension cable is also a welcome addition to help prevent the headset from being ripped off when the player accidentally gets up without taking it off (as I often do when I am engrossed in my game!).But quality reaches an entirely new level when you put this headset on.  The over-the-ear design provides comfort and excellent isolation from ambient noise, and at the same time it delivers unbelievably crisp audio, from the lowest growl of monsters to the highest note of your favorite diva belting out the latest top-40 hit.  Another excellent feature is the included connectors which allow the headset to be used on virtually any device, from PCs, to Macs, to laptops and mobile devices.  For those who do not own high-end sound/graphics cards, the SteelSeries 9H Gaming Headset includes a USB sound card to provide the ultimate in sound experience--including Dolby support!  You can also customize the settings (equalizers, mic noise reduction, and compression, among others) for your headset using the available software.  The on-cable controls for mic-mute and volume are also handy.Overall, the SteelSeries 9H Gaming Headset is an excellent piece of sound technology.  With all of the connection options, software features, customization possibilities, and Dolby support, it will easily meet all of your gaming communication needs.  From directing your squad to flanking enemy monsters or starships, this headset will give you the edge you need to dominate!It sounds to me as if this is an excellent headset for the money.  I highly recommend it for avid gamers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R271UHSFD67W09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO6HAXA#wasThisHelpful","R271UHSFD67W09","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of pearl earrings and single pearl necklace is very lovely.  The pearls themselves are medium size--neither tiny nor large and imposing.  They are cultured pearls, but I do not have the impression that they are ultra-expensive--that is, they lack the luster of very expensive pearls.  The backing on the earrings and the chain on the necklace is gold, fairly thin, so that does not look expensive, either.  The chain is just under 18 inches long.  This set would make a very nice gift for a teenage girl getting her first ""real"" pearls--not cheap and fake, but not so expensive that it would be a disaster if she lost them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHK5NM7JBL3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FKB7BHO#wasThisHelpful","R2GHK5NM7JBL3V","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I gave this game to my teenage nephew, who played it with several family members and friends.  They found the instructions not really hard, but very long and involved, and it took awhile for them to figure out how to play the game.  They tried to follow the rules, but ended up playing the game according to their own ""house rules.""The game comes with a timer, which makes a very loud noise.  They eventually stopped using the timer because the noise was so annoying.  One player even thought that the timer might have been broken.  The timer went off completely on its own, making that obnoxious noise.  Another player, an adult woman, did not enjoy the game at all, but the teens enjoyed the aspect of the game that required you to draw or to describe a product or the logo or symbol for a product.  The game seems to be a combination of Pictionary and Charades and Trivial Pursuit.  The kids thought this was a good, creative game, with a combination of old and new products.  This aspect of the game made it good for mixed age groups.  As other reviewers have said, this game is best played in teams.  I have the feeling that this experiment may have gone better if at least one player had really understood how to play the game so that so much time would not have been consumed in trying to understand the rules.The teens are willing to give this game another try.  I am going to edit this review after they do to see if they enjoyed the game more.

"I have been a huge fan of Lonely Planet guidebooks ever since I first ordered one on Rome with kids as the target audience.  I like the adult Lonely Planet guides, too, but when it comes to children, no one does it better than Lonely Planet.  So when I had the chance to review this book, I jumped at it, and I was not disappointed.""Lonely Planet Not for Parents  Real Wonders of the World"" has as its subtitle ""Amazing Stuff to Know about the Coolest Places on Earth,"" and that just about sums up this book.  The book is divided into eight major sections, each having seven to nine topics.  Some of the major sections are Stupendous Structures; High Tech; Cultural Wonders; Hidden Places; Thrills, Spills, and Games; and Fright Night.  Each sub-topic is composed of two pages loaded with a collage of photos and graphics, and while there is some text, it is not overwhelming.  The topics are wide-ranging, from Barrow, Alaska, to Pompeii, to the catacombs, to outer space.  While the guide is aimed at children (about age 8 and up, I would say), I am convinced that most adults would learn a thing or two from this book.The book is oversize, so it is not a conventional travel book.  Rather, it is a great ""Let's find something interesting to read"" book, one that I can see kids returning to again and again.  It is well made with heavy paper and a sturdy hard cover, so it should last through several children.

The bones are made of rubber, not plastic, and the dog dishes are sturdy cardboard (which may or may not hold up, given that many pre-schoolers are hard on games and toys.  However, the game is designed to teach counting and simple math skills, and it does this quite well.  Since the dog steals bones from other dishes, the children learn to do simple addition and subtraction.  At the end, children count the number of bones Shelby has stolen, practicing their counting skills in a fun way.

I like the upscale look of the oven, but even more, I like the way it works.  The controls are easy to understand and change.  The toasting function, which is the one we use most, is effective for both bread and bagels or muffins.  The first toasting cycle takes a bit longer, as the oven is starting cold, but after that, the bread toasts fairly quickly, and you can adjust the degree of ""toastiness"" that you prefer.

"I ordered this guidebook, Lonely Planet Hawaii, because my husband and I took an all-too-short trip to Hawaii earlier this year, and we are both eager to go back and experience our 50th state in a little more depth than we did the first time around.  I was hoping that this guidebook would help, and I was not disappointed.Hawaii is a beautiful and complex state, and this guide covers just about every aspect of it:  people, culture, history, natural resources, ecology, and cuisine, to name just a few.  The book helps the reader plan a trip based on his or her individual interests, whether they are artistic, historical, or nature-oriented.  There are the usual ""Where to Stay"" and ""Where to Eat"" features, as well as some ""Don't Miss This"" features as well.  If you are traveling with children, this book includes several child-friendly attractions to help you plan a trip that the entire family can enjoy.  The book includes an up-to-date driving map that includes each island, helping in the planning of an itinerary.  It should be noted that the maps are not street maps; rather, they give an overview of each island.  If you want a street map, you will need to go elsewhere.  (I suggest the Auto Club, which has superb maps that alone are worth the price of membership if you travel a great deal.)In our previous travels, we have relied on Eyewitness Travel Guides, and if I were forced to select only one guide, I would prefer Eyewitness.  I do not know if they have one on Hawaii, but I suspect they do.  The advantage of the Eyewitness guides is the superb photography that accompanies many of the cultural and geographic entries.  Eyewitness claims to be ""The Guides That Show You What Others Only Tell You,"" and we have found this to be true.However, this is not to denigrate the Lonely Planet Guide.  It too has photographs, though far fewer than an Eyewitness Guide.  It includes a wealth of information about Hawaii, so much so that I am convinced that even a native Hawaiian would learn a great deal about his state by surveying this guide.  A tourist will find it extremely helpful and informative.

"I ordered this toy for my cousin's toddler, who is just a bit over 16 months old.  Joey adored the toy from the very beginning.  He quickly caught on, with the help of older brother Brandon (who is nearly five), how to keep the puppy reading and singing by turning the pages of the book.  In fact, it was Brandon who figured out the toy and taught Joey how to use it completely, a testament to the user-friendliness and age-appropriateness of this toy.  I thought the price might be a little high, but I must say it had provided hours of fun and laughter, as well as a good learning experience for Joey.  I would guess that this would make a good ""from the grandparents"" toy, simply because of the price.  I definitely recommend it--and the batteries are included, something I wish would become industry standard.Update:  After speaking with people who are more accustomed to purchasing toys than I am, I am going to change my opinion of the price.  One person I spoke with said, ""Thirty five bucks?  For a puppy that sings and reads and moves?  That is really reasonable.""

"I purchased this sink to use in our newly renovated bathroom and I am very happy with it.

I am used to this now, but I would recommend it for a bath that is going to be used by adults--I think kids might waste a lot of water by not controlling the flow very well.As this is our first vessel sink, I also wondered about water splashing onto the counter, but this has not been a problem at all unless you turn the flow to super high.  I also thought it might be difficult to keep spotless, but I find that it dries really well.

"I write here as one who has never read a book by Allison Leotta, but ""Speak of the Devil"" has made me want to read everything she has written.  The main character in ""Speak of the Devil"" is Anna Curtis, a sex crimes prosecutor in Washington DC, who has just become engaged to Jack Bailey, chief of the DC homicide unit.  Jack has a six-year-old daughter, Olivia, and his late wife, Nina Flores, had been killed four years earlier by one of the street gangs of Washington DC.  Most investigators believe that that the crime was committed by MS-13, a notoriously violent and ruthless DC gang.  The leader of this gang is Diablo, accurately named ""the Devil.""  Diablo's skin is completely covered in tattooed hieroglyphs.  His nose is two sunken holes; he has long black hair and two fleshy horns protruding from his forehead.  Indeed, he is aptly named.Diablo and his gang appear throughout the book as Anna Curtis and Jack Flores attempt to solve various gruesome crimes occurring in the DC area.  There are many twists and turns, and a huge red herring that comes as a total surprise to the reader in the last third of the book.  I really enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes true-life crime fiction.  The author's experience as a sex-crimes prosecutor for 12 years in Washington DC is evident on every page, and she is a superb writer.  If I could give the book more than five stars, I would.

"""The Radical Practice of Loving Everyone"" is a charming and light-hearted book about Mollie, a golden retriever, and her human companion, who learns all sorts of life lessons from her.  The author is on a journey toward enlightenment, and it is clear that he uses all sorts of events in his life to reflect on ultimate questions of truth and meaning.  Some of his reflections are excellent, such as taking the roads less traveled and being open to new experiences and eager to learn from them.  Some may strike the reader as ridiculous, such as taking hours to remove earthworms from a path so that no one steps on them as an expression that all life is sacred.The book is a very easy read, and it would make an excellent gift for a young person, especially one who loves dogs.  As an exploration into Buddhism, however, it is very lightweight.  A serious student might be charmed, but he or she would get little in depth from this book.  Still, that does not mean it is worthless or should be avoided.  Most people are not serious students of Buddhism; they are simply trying to make sense of life as they find it.  This book gives the reader fresh perspective, and if some of the lessons are a bit obvious, well, so what?  Readers will enjoy the dog/human connection.  And one could do worse than to learn from a dog, especially one as lovable as Mollie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11EBH8BGRF1RA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401942024#wasThisHelpful","R11EBH8BGRF1RA","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I should never have selected this novel.  Young adults in an isolated cabin during a blizzard attacked by nameless monsters--is this not the most ridiculous plot you ever heard?  And yet you have to endure this exercise in horror for 300-plus pages.  You will not like any of the characters, and you will not understand the monsters because they are never fully explained or developed.  Are they even real, or is this a psychological mystery?I suppose if you like ""Return of the Living Dead"" and TV shows like this, you may like this book.  It is fast-paced, and it is not at all hard to read, except that it is so ridiculous you can hardly stand it.  I would not have finished it if I did not have to review it for Vine.

"I have to admit that I did not like this product at all.  I followed the directions exactly, and found that I was rinsing the conditioner out of my hair for at least seven minutes.  This to me is far too long.  Despite this, it never seemed to come completely out.  My hair took a long time to dry and was still a little greasy.  Thinking I had made a mistake, I tried it three more times, to no better luck.My hair is chin-length, so maybe if you have long hair this conditioner may work for you.  But I cannot honestly recommend it.  It is called Milk conditioner, and it does have the consistency of skim milk.  The ingredients include shea butter, soy milk, and honey, so these would be enough to make it hard to rinse out.Truthfully, it did not even make my hair soft.  It was hard to style and frustrating.

"This is the third novel in the Vanessa Michael Munroe series.  I have read only ""The Innocent,"" which I loved.  I felt that the main character, Michael as she is called, was a superwoman in ""The Innocent,"" but in ""The Doll"" she is somewhat lacking.  Her physical and mental strength is much less in this latest novel.The villain in ""The Doll"" is ""The Dollmaker"" along with his goons, who kidnap girls who are either movie stars or just extraordinarily beautiful.  These girls are procured at the behest of ""The Dollmaker's"" wealthy clients (think Donald Trump), who pay him to get a young woman to their exact specifications.Michael is also kidnapped, but for a different reason.  She is to escort ""Neeva"", a rock star wanted by one of the Dollmaker's customers, to his location so she can be made into his sex slave.  Michael is coerced into doing this because the Dollmaker has threatened her loved ones with death.  Neeva does not go without a fight.Meanwhile, Michael's love interest, Bradford, is trying to rescue her brother, who has also been kidnapped in the attempt to coerce Michael.  Bradford succeeds, but at great cost.This book has many twists and turns, and it keeps the reader interested.  However, it is a hard book to read because it is so dark.  It portrays the worst side of human nature and the only redemption is survival.  (Not that everyone survives.)I did like this book, but not as much as ""The Innocent.""  Michael's personality was toned down so much that she seemed almost like a different person.  The ending is also weird.  Sometimes, even in a thriller, I want the good guys in a book to conquer the bad guys and live happily ever after.  This is not that book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MU9BPRQW8FMU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307888789#wasThisHelpful","R1MU9BPRQW8FMU","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an excellent geometry text for honors and advanced  placement students.  It is extremely challenging and provides in-depth learning for students who enjoy the challenge of math or who have access to a teacher or tutor on a regular basis.  It is far too difficult, however, for the typical high school geometry student.  It is very proof-oriented, and the difficulty may discourage the student who may like math but does not want a career that is dependent on it.  For the budding engineer or scientist, this book is  a great choice, but it is not for everyone.That said, I want to point out one aspect of the book that is great.  Each chapter has three levels of practice problems, labeled A, B, and C.  The A problem set is for everyone, and B and C levels are for those who want a greater challenge.  I wanted this book to use for a geometry course for home schooled students, who meet with me only once a week.  This is not nearly often enough, given the difficulty of this book.  However, in a school, where students and teacher meet five days a week, the levels of problems provide the teacher with great flexibility.  I could see the book being used at several levels.In short, this is a great book, but it is not the best choice for me.  However, if may be a good choice for you.  I suggest that you buy a used copy so that you can judge for yourself before you  invest in the entire course.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QA0TDQ7LN94S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0395977274#wasThisHelpful","R3QA0TDQ7LN94S","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I selected this faucet for our newly remodeled kitchen with the help of a plumber, who had some excellent advice for people who like this type of faucet.  His advice was to always select a faucet with a magnetized head.  If you do not, your faucet will look great for about two months, but then gravity will exert its force, leaving the head of the faucet hanging limply from the base.  A magnet solves this problem, and the head retracts easily into the faucet base.I also selected this faucet because I did not want more than one hole in our granite countertop.  With our previous sinks, we had three holes:  for the faucet, for the water control, and for the soap dispenser.  I fought to keep these areas clean and free of hard water stains.  With this faucet, you have one hole.  The water control is attached to the faucet and works well.  For soap, we have an attractive free-standing dispenser.  This is a matter of taste, of course, but if you like clean lines, this may be the faucet for you.  I could not be more pleased.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OR3ACBIDYXX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A39FSAK#wasThisHelpful","R1OR3ACBIDYXX8","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this support for my husband when he was having some back problems.  He had worn similar supports in the past, all far more expensive.  Based on other reviews, I decided to try this one, and he is very happy with it.  It provides excellent support and he was able to resume almost all his normal activities.  The only thing I would caution purchasers about is size.  My husband is not a large man, and we thought the medium would be an appropriate size.  In reality, the large would have been better--the support is very tight.  Of course, it has to be somewhat tight in order to give support, but there is almost no ""give"" in the brace.

"While I am not a scientific expert on shampoos, I am something of an amateur expert.  I can honestly say without exaggeration that I have used a few hundred different shampoos in my lifetime.

On the advice of my hairdresser, I never used the same shampoo twice in a row.

"""Chocolate for Two"" is the fourth book in the Waverly Bryson series by Maria Mumane.  I have read only this one, so take that into consideration when assessing my review.As tis book opens, our heroine, Waverly, Is recovering from having been almost literally left at the altar by a cad who appeared on her doorstep two weeks before the wedding and proclaimed he did not love her.  A popular young woman with many love interests,  Waverly is a well regarded talk show host who also owns her own very successful business, Waverly's Honey Shop.  Despite all this, her self esteem is shaky until she meets Jake McIntyre, a wealthy scion of an upper class family.Naturally, they fall in love.  We seem to be headed for a story book ending, but wait--we need some drama.  Enter Jake's parents, specifically his mother, who is controlling and insufferable, in the nicest possible way (ahem).  She hopes to take control of the wedding and make it a huge expensive affair in Florida.  Waverly and Jake, meanwhile, want a small intimate wedding in New York.  Jake is besotted with Waverly and pretty much defers to her on every issue, but at the same time he does not help much in dealing with his overbearing mother.The novel is a fun beach read, good for a rainy day on the porch.  There is humor and emotion, as well as many sidebars with Waverly's career and business.  Eventually, Waverly finds a retailer who somehow makes her see everything, both professional and personal, in perspective, and the ending is light and satisfying.  You probably will not remember this book too long after you read it, but you will be entertained as you read, especially if you are a fan.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9H61HPHXODYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099110#wasThisHelpful","R9H61HPHXODYN","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this sink for our new kitchen based on the recommendation of our designer, who has one in her own home.  It is a beautiful sink, and I am sure I will love it.  However, there are two things you need to know.First, the sink is fragile.  This may sound bizarre as it is a granite sink, but the first sink I ordered was canceled by the manufacturer as it was too damaged to be delivered, and the second, which was delivered on time and apparently intact based on the outer packaging, in fact had two cracks, and the installer (quite rightly) refused to install it.  He got an identical sink from his supplier and installed that one instead.Second, be aware that the color may be misleading.  I ordered the sink in ""Truffle,"" as the color on the Amazon website looked like a cafe au lait brown.  So I was shocked when we opened the box and saw that the sink was more gray than brown.  If gray is what you want, you will be delighted, but we wanted brown, and we opted for ""Cafe Brown,"" a darker, richer, deeper  brown.Finally, do not be put off by these cautions--but take them into consideration when you are ordering.  We are returning the second sink, and Amazon has been great about assisting us in that.  The sink itself is wonderful--but you may want to get it directly from a supplier or local store so you can assess the appropriateness of the color for yourself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O1U4S03FKPO2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QLAXHO#wasThisHelpful","R3O1U4S03FKPO2","A2PM5Z249OVPEN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2PM5Z249OVPEN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in the fictional town of Red Paint Bay, a typical small town where everyone knows everyone else and nothing is kept secret for long, this book deals with a long-buried secret that is about to re-emerge and haunt many, especially one family.This family is headed by Simon Howe, who was born and raised in Red Paint and is now the editor of the town paper.  He is married to Amy, a psychotherapist,  who runs the family with an iron hand.  Their son, Davey, is a more or less typical teen, but he gets into trouble and is grounded regularly for some pretty bizarre behavior, such as throwing knives at his best friend.  Simon and his staff are always trying to think of events to fill their small-town paper.  It has been said that when the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers, and this is true in spades with Simon.  His 25th high school reunion is approaching, and in this town, that qualifies as front page news.  It is here that the excitement and horror begin.Simon has been getting a number of unsigned postcards, the content of which ranges from mundane (Will you meet me for dinner?) to threatening.  He decides to meet  with the postcard-sender, and though he is instructed to come alone, Amy insists on coming with him.  Davey is left alone with strict orders to stay in the house.  (Never a good idea in a mystery book.)  The mysterious writer is a no-show, and when Simon and Amy return home, they find that Davey has disappeared.  The police are called, and Davey is found safe in a treehouse.  But how did he get there?  There is, of course, a connection with the mysterious postcard-writer.The story gets better with every page--I challenge you not to finish this book.  Many interesting and typical small town characters have their roles to play, and the mystery deepens with each chapter.  If you enjoy mysteries with a small town flavor and fast pace, you will like this book.

"I gave the Colorama game to my cousin for her four-year-old, and I am happy to say that he loves this game and asks repeatedly to play it.  Essentially, this game is designed to teach a young child shapes and colors, and it has several levels of play, from very basic to a bit more complex.  You can play by concentrating on shapes only, on colors only, or on a combination of the two.  The game is fun for kids, and if Brandon is any example, they will like it even if they already have a good grasp of shapes and colors.  Brandon has a younger brother, Joey, who  at 10 months is too young for the game,  but I can see this as a game the two could play together in about a year, with Brandon ""teaching"" Joey all the ins and outs of shapes and colors.

Smith's prose is mature and often hits on deeply emotional and philosophical points (without trying to be too bloody serious, of course).I'm a huge fan of Bud Smith's work, and I would rank this near the top of what he's done. I don't know if I like it quite as much as Tollbooth, but it's a fantastic novel and worth reading by anyone who likes music, trucks, beer, or words.

"I've been waiting almost two decades for this, and I couldn't be happier with the final product. When Failure toured in 2014, I considered myself pretty darn lucky to see them. I never really expected new music though. But the boys came through, and they did it in big fashion.This album could very much be viewed as an immediate follow-up to Fantastic Planet. The production is a bit more polished, but much of the songwriting comes off in a similar vein. But it's certainly not a copycat album or even some attempt to recapture old magic. No, the magic here comes naturally. It's an album that is epic in scope and unravels beautifully throughout.Throughout the album, the band shows maturity while occasionally giving a nod to their old (or should I say young) selves. The Segues are beautiful and show the band could easily become a post-rock powerhouse if they wanted. But there's plenty of that old space rock here too, such as ""Hot Traveler.""Surprisingly, I've heard some negative criticism about ""Mulholland Dr,"" which is one of my favorite tracks on the album. It's a bit classic rock, but it also reminds me of ""The Nurse Who Loved Me"" and a few other songs from Fantastic Planet. It's a magnificent piece of songwriting that fits well on this album.I'm certainly not ready to proclaim this better than Fantastic Planet, but it definitely is a worthy successor. I think it's much better than any of us could have really expected after this long. 2015 has already been a great year for the comeback album, and Failure has made it even more of a success!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AN7DZI2G8ADY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WXFTS3U#wasThisHelpful","R3AN7DZI2G8ADY","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a relatively new fan of Refused, I think I can bring an unbiased approach to this review. It seems that every die hard Refused fan either says this is awesome just because it is new music from Refused or that it's terrible just because it's new music from Refused. Same reason, different perspective, right?When Refused last put out music, I was in high school and listening mostly to classic rock. It wasn't until almost a decade later that I discovered The Shape of Punk to Come, an album that instantly had an impact on my musical tastes.While I didn't necessarily crave new music from Refused, I was certainly excited when the announcement of a new album was made. I was lucky enough to snag one of the limited edition vinyl copies from the Refused preorder (before they announced about a dozen variants of the vinyl). Based on the strength of lead single ""Elektra,"" I had high hopes for the album (even if it did sound a little like Dave Grohl trying to make a hardcore punk album).The album doesn't disappoint, but it certainly isn't perfect. There are some really rough moments (like the ""murder, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill"" nonsense in Franafrique). The music is powerful, but it occasionally feels like the band is trying too hard to make another Shape of Punk to Come. It's a worthy follow up, but it will never have the same impact. However, it will continue to bring new fans to quality punk and hardcore music.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VVNPK2GG0C11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRR5Y0K#wasThisHelpful","R3VVNPK2GG0C11","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start by saying that I didn't discover MewithoutYou until a year after ""Brother, Sister"" was released. So I'm not a diehard fan who can say I've been there since the beginning. I do enjoy the band's entire discography, but I tend to listen to ""Brother, Sister"" and ""Ten Stories"" the most.Now let's talk about ""Pale Horses."" Honestly, I was a bit skeptical about this album when I first heard the single ""Red Cow."" I thought the song was just okay and didn't think this album was going to stand much of a chance compared to the band's previous work. I even put off ordering it until I heard the stream. I didn't even get halfway through the album before I found myself ordering one of the last few copies of the deluxe edition vinyl.""Pale Horses"" is a masterpiece and possibly my favorite MewithoutYou album as a whole. While there aren't necessarily any songs that can necessarily live up to ""In a Sweater Poorly Knit"" or ""January 1979,"" this is a beautiful and powerful album from start to finish. The band is in top form here, delivering an epic album that's overflowing with emotion.My favorite songs so far are ""Watermelon Ascot,"" ""Mexican War Streets,"" and ""Rainbow Signs,"" but every song is great and has a place on this album. I even find myself enjoying ""Red Cow"" a lot more in the context of the album than I did before the release.""Pale Horses"" should delight MewithoutYou fans regardless of when you started listening to the band. This is a work that's representative of everything they've done. If you like any of MewithoutYou's previous records, you will probably enjoy this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQTMYTVMVTWSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGEA940#wasThisHelpful","RQTMYTVMVTWSS","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a longtime fan of Muse, I’ve been disappointed by the band’s recent output. It’s not that the past couple albums are bad per se, but they haven’t resonated as much with me as Absolution, Origin of Symmetry, or Showbiz. I’ve come to terms with the fact that they will never release another Origin of Symmetry, which is fine by me. After all, we already have that album and don’t really need another version.This was one of my most anticipated albums of the year. Early reports about “Drones” indicated it was going to be “back to basics.” I really enjoyed the singles (other than the silly drill sergeant bit from “Psycho”). Listening to this album, it’s obviously a long way from Origin of Symmetry or Absolution, but those albums were far from basic.On the surface, there’s plenty about this album that’s laughable. From the awful cover art to the ridiculous Drill Sergeant track to the autotune to the cheesey drone theme that’s overplayed throughout the album. It’s clearly a concept album, and I’m not sure the concept is compelling enough in this presentation. The lyrics are far from subtle, and the “message” feels a bit like juvenile politics. But somehow, this album works.Musically, there’s no doubt this is the best the band has done since Absolution (or at least since Black Holes). There are big riffs and bold sounds, and it’s obvious that Muse was pulling from some of that old magic when writing and recording these songs. Some fans might be a bit turned off by the seemingly excessive falsetto on the album, but it actually plays well with the music.I didn’t really expect to love this album, but it’s grown on me rather quickly. I’d put it just above Black Holes and Revelations. It’s not a perfect album by any means, but it’s the best Muse has done in quite some time. I suspect that fans will be torn on this record. If you’ve been disappointed by the last couple, there’s at least a decent chance you’ll like this one. If you love everything Muse has done, you'll definitely love this album. But if all you want is another Origin of Symmetry, then why not just listen to the copy you already have and be content?","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5P0XL2JI84BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UHQ73NO#wasThisHelpful","R5P0XL2JI84BM","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a huge fan of The xx (including their underrated sophomore album ""Coexist""), it's taken me awhile to warm up to Jamie xx. I wasn't a big fan of the remix collaboration he did with Gil Scott-Heron, and some of his other post-xx work hasn't really stuck with me. However, ""In Colour"" has me sold on Jamie xx as a solo artist.This is a strong album with a little bit for every music fan. There's dance, rave, EDM, minimalist, electronic, pop, rap, jazz, and every other sub-genre in between. On this album, Jamie xx proves himself a master of blending genres without overdoing anything. He even gives some nods to The xx on a few tracks, which will surely excite fans of the band.The album flows well together, whether the songs are big and bold or intimate and chill. It's the type of album that comes full circle and works great on repeat. It's probably an album best listened to on headphones, and you'd probably enjoy it more with the lights off. But you could also play it at a party and keep people on the dance floor.The highlights of the album include ""Gosh,"" ""Loud Places,"" ""SeeSaw,"" and ""I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)."" But there really aren't any duds on here. At times it may feel like Jamie xx is playing it too safe, but that's only to the untrained ear that isn't looking for the subtlety in this music. These songs are rich and have plenty to offer on repeat listens. There's plenty here that's catchy, and the album as a whole moves the soul.Jamie xx has proven himself as a solo artist, not just a producer or remix artist. This is a colossal achievement for his proper debut, and I look forward to more Jamie xx in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JB0ANG8PO3B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V9MQZRU#wasThisHelpful","R3JB0ANG8PO3B","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been a big fan of Daniel Johns and Silverchair since Frogstomp came out 20 years ago. It's been fun watching Daniel Johns grow from an angst-filled teenager into the mature and brilliant musician he is today. Although I was disappointed by the news a couple years ago that Silverchair was calling it quits, this album more than fills that void.Let's make something very clear: ""Talk"" is not a Silverchair album. Not every Silverchair fan will enjoy this album. ""Talk"" is not a guitar album, and it doesn't have the anger of Johns's early work. It's a beautiful blend of electronic, rock, pop, and dance, with a bunch of other stuff mixed in as well.Although the album seems vastly different from Johns's other work, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone who has followed his career. Just look at the progression from Frogstomp and Freakshow to Neon Ballroom and Diorama. Johns has gradually been getting more ambitious and more orchestral with his music, and ""Talk"" sees that vision become something new in a way that grows on his previous songwriting experience.Nothing on here really sounds like a Silverchair song, but Daniel Johns's vocals occasionally recall those earlier days. On ""New York,"" for example, it almost feels like Silverchair doing an electro-pop song. There are other moments where Daniel Johns sounds a lot like the Daniel Johns we are all familiar with, but not in a way that makes us pine for something this record isn't. No, this album stands on its own as something special.Some of the best songs on ""Talk"" also appeared on Johns's ""Aeriel Love EP"" from earlier this year. ""Preach,"" which might just be one of the best songs Johns has ever created, is one of the songs that spills over. But it feels much more at place here than at the beginning of the ""Aeriel Love EP."" While the EP was good, ""Talk"" is a more complete vision of what felt like experimentation and finding a new voice. Johns doesn't feel like he's searching for anything on this album. It's clear throughout ""Talk"" that he knows exactly what he's doing--and he does it quite well.This is a phenomenal album that will surely grow on anyone who gives it a chance. Whether you're a fan of rock, electronic, dance, or pop, this is a true gem of a record worthy of repeat listens.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25RWESO9YG6YU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDWMUHM#wasThisHelpful","R25RWESO9YG6YU","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I purchased these Pioneer bookshelf speakers to accompany my Pro-Ject Debut Carbon. For the money, I don't think you can get a better set of speakers. The sound quality, range, and volume are all excellent. This is a 5-star product all around.After trying several other models of similar size and price, I've come to the conclusion that these Pioneer speakers deliver big for the buck. They easily fill my large basement room to provide a quality listening experience whether I'm sitting close or relaxing on the other side of the room.These speakers have a wide range and sound great right out of the box. I've had them for about a year now and have listened to hundreds of hours of music. Records that only sounded okay with my previous set of speakers now have a fuller sound thanks to these. Naturally, not everything sounds great on these speakers. A really bad recording can actually sound a bit worse on here. But who wants to listen to bad recordings anyway?Besides the great sound, another huge advantage of these speakers is their size. They are fairly compact and fit nicely on my Expedit shelves. For the size and money, you won't get a better listening experience.I won't lie and say these are the best speakers I've ever heard. My friend's set of $1000 Klipsch floorstanding speakers sound significantly better. But it's ridiculous to compare systems in such a different price category.If you're looking for great speakers on a budget, you can end your search right now. I highly recommend these speakers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SL05O6YKJER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008NCD2LG#wasThisHelpful","R1SL05O6YKJER","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For the price, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better oil drain pan that isn't an open design.This 10 quart oil drain pan will easily hold all the oil from two cars, which is perfect because it allows me to do both cars at once before transporting the oil for recycling.When transporting, you have to be very careful. This isn't exactly the most sturdy design, but it seals well enough as long as it isn't flying around your trunk. I haven't had any issues with oil spilling out, but based on the material, I could see that as an issue.The major design flaw is the size of the mouth for catching the oil. The diameter of the mouth isn't wide enough to catch the stream of oil that shoots out at an angle (which is the bulk of the oil) AND the oil that drips straight down at the same time. Some spilling is inevitable, so you need to be sure to have plenty of cardboard or newspaper down on the garage floor. You have to constantly reposition the pan in order to minimize spills.Honestly, I wish I had thrown out a few more bucks and bought a better pan.

"So we all know that this is a classic 90s alternative album. But how does it translate on the new remastered vinyl? The answer: outstanding. Sixteen Stone has never sounded this good before. The remastered vinyl is crisp and perfectly balanced. The records are free of noise, and the music isn't simply remastered by ""turning up the volume."" This is an example of remastering done the right way. The sound is much richer and clearer than the original CD release, but it still has that edgy grunge vibe to it.If you are thinking about getting this album on vinyl, this is a must buy. The packaging is fantastic: gatefold jacket, sturdy sleeves, and plenty of artwork. Oh, and don't forget the 2 X LP on thick clear wax.

"""Why Make Sense?"" is Hot Chip's 6th album and the band's best since ""One Life Stand."" Okay, so there was only one album in between ""One Life Stand"" and ""Why Make Sense?"", but it feels like it's been a long time. ""One Life Stand"" was an instant classic and the album that really made me fall in love with this band. Unfortunately, ""In Our Heads"" didn't quite live up to the band's previous efforts. But ""Why Make Sense?"" stands strong in the band's catalog.This album is filled with all the things that make Hot Chip great. Jammed with groovy beats accompanied by R&B, Hip-Hop, Electronic, and Dance influences, this is an album that will make you get up and move. The production is smooth and doesn't get in the way of the band's diverse sound.Album highlights include ""Huarache Lights,"" ""Dark Night,"" and ""Easy To Get,"" but the entire album is consistently strong. That isn't to say that the album is consistent in sound. While the songs do flow together, this is an album that blends genres and pushes boundaries. Whether you're listening to the more subdued tracks like ""White Wine and Fried Checking"" or the dancey ""Need You Now,"" this album delivers again and again.With ""Why Make Sense?"", Hot Chip is back. So get those dance shoes out of the closet and dust them off.

"Soil starts off as a very promising Southern noir novel with all the makings of a classic. Jay Mize is a fantastic character, and the premise seems like a brilliant balance of the absurd and the terrifying.Kornegay does an excellent job building into the tale, creating a rich setting that shows as much care as farmer Mize gives to his soil. The way Kornegay subtly works environmental issues into the plot is skillful without being overdone or preachy. Truthfully, Kornegay doesn't seem to infuse any of his own opinion on the subject, leaving it all as part of the nature of the world. The author shows a deep knowledge (or at least adequate research) of farming, composting, and growing.The book really hits strides as the paranoid Mize begins his work at hiding the body he discovers on his property. The plot here shows the struggle that all humans face with guilt and the need to provide and live a decent life, which is certainly enough of a theme to carry what's otherwise a rather flimsy plot.Unfortunately, the book takes some turns for the worse before we get too far in. ""Deputy"" Danny Shoals is a dreadful cliche of a playboy that gets way too much attention (especially in the second half of the book). Every aspect of this character is pulled straight from the proverbial book of typical country cop with a powerful uncle. In general, Kornegay treats every character as either a male or female stereotype, and it's especially disappointing the way the author characterizes Sandy Mize. Still, the novel isn't ruined by these shortcomings.The worst thing about this book by far is the ending. It's an overly contrived, cliche, predictable bit of nonsense that undercuts almost the entire reader journey in an attempt to drive home a ridiculous metaphor that wasn't really there. I won't spoil it for you, but you can surely guess what happens.Overall, this novel shows a lot of promise for Kornegay as a writer. Although it's far from perfect (and probably 100 pages or so too long), I look forward to reading more of this author's work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GAW1C1B9G54I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD1OTF2#wasThisHelpful","R3GAW1C1B9G54I","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s been 18 years since we’ve had new music from Faith No More. Finally, Mike Patton and the boys are back (and it’s the first time the band has kept the same lineup on two consecutive albums since The Real Thing and Angel Dust). From the very first moments of Sol Invictus, we know it was worth the wait.The album immediately explodes to life with a jazzy track that has Mike Patton channeling his inner folk hero. We know right away that this is still Faith No More, but it’s not a band just trying to recapture what they were. Over the course of the 10 tracks on the album, the band creates a confident and compelling record that demonstrates a group of musicians coming together for the purpose of music rather than reunion.The two lead singles, “Superhero” and “Motherfu**er” are two of the strongest tracks here, both showing that Faith No More is still capable of creating that innovative and driving music that pushes the boundaries of what songwriting can do. FNM was not about to settle on this album, and they prove that on every track.“From the Dead” is the perfect closer to this album, perhaps a symbolic nod to Faith No More’s comeback after all these years. Other songs, like “Separation Anxiety,” also allude to their time apart, but not in a way that makes this some cheesy concept album. No, Sol Invictus remains a strong and diverse rock album that expresses everything great about this band.Yes, it’s been 18 years in the making, but this is no nostalgic trip. This is a triumph in every sense of the word. The band has grown and matured but still manages to deliver a unique sound that plenty can try to imitate but no one can match. This is an album that will thrill old fans and create new fans.Faith No More is alive and unconquered.

However, it quickly retreats from there, failing to explore any new territory. This is a safe album, lacking the urgency and uniqueness of Astro Coast and the catchy power of Pythons. It's pleasant enough, but it doesn't show any growth in a band that's already released two solid albums. Instead, it's a wishy-washy in-between ground. Nothing here is bad, but it's not a very memorable album either. If you're a Surfer Blood fan, it's worth a listen. If you haven't heard Surfer Blood before, I wouldn't recommend starting with this album.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UMX39ET3FH87/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQESBEI#wasThisHelpful","R1UMX39ET3FH87","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine if two massively talented and creative bands joined forces on one album. That's exactly what you get with Pfarmers debut Gunnera. This collaboration between members of The National and Menomena works well on so many levels. It feels a bit more like a Menomena album than a National album (which is expected whenever you get a singer from one band but not the other). However, the National's influence definitely shines through at times on the instrumentation.This is a strong album, although it does take a bit to get going. Opening track ""Benthos"" is an ambient horn piece that feels a bit like a throwaway track until it blends perfectly into ""You Shall Know the Spirit"" and you realize they were just getting you in the mood. ""Benthos"" probably could've been a bit shorter without losing much effect, but it doesn't take away from the experience of the rest of the album.As good as this album is, it probably doesn't stack up next to anything that either band has released before. It's important to look at this collaboration as a separate project. If you go into it expecting the next Friend and Foe or Boxer, you'll be wholly disappointed. If you go into it looking to hear fantastic music from brilliant musicians, you'll be rewarded greatly.If you're a fan of The National, Menomena, or just great music in general, you need to grab a copy of this now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUUC0MDDUTFB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TTLS6AM#wasThisHelpful","R2KUUC0MDDUTFB","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a year for David Duchovny. A novel, an album, and the return of The X-Files! Holy cow, could one man be more talented?Okay, so we all know that David Duchovny is the most talented man alive (and he's pretty darn handsome, too). So what about this album? Is it any good?Of course it is! Duchovny's deep and melodic voice conjures all the greatest American singers of all time (most notably, Tom Petty). Musically and thematically, this album just feels like classic Americana. It's everything you'd expect from such a talented human being. And the fact that almost every song references water shows Duchovny's brilliant mind at work. This might just be the greatest American concept album of all time.Seriously, this album rocks. ""Unsaid Undone"" contains one of the best searing guitar solos in American alt-rock history. Make all the jokes you want about an actor trying to sing and play music, but Duchovny is the real deal.Too bad The X-Files reboot isn't coming out until January 2016. Otherwise, Duchovny might be winning a Grammy and an Emmy in the same year!

"Sprinter is a diverse album that’s rich, dark, and a tad bit catchy. The instrumentation is fantastic and diverse, with influences of folk, electronic, rock, shoegaze, and more.Torres, aka Mackenzie Scott, has a bold and beautiful voice with a raw power that works well on both loud rock songs and soft/folksy ballads. Her voice is a bit reminiscent of other great female vocalists like Sharon Van Etten and Fiona Apple, but she definitely stands alone with her own unique sound.The highlights here are “Strange Hellos,” “Sprinter,” and “New Skin.” All of the songs are strong (except for maybe ""Son, You Are No Island"" which tends to drag a bit). In general, Torres is at her best when she's rocking. This definitely ranks as one of the best female rock/singer-songwriter albums of the year.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24HZBH0M5OKCP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UKO5EKW#wasThisHelpful","R24HZBH0M5OKCP","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Imagine Shakespeare without his pen. Or Picasso without his paintbrush. Or even Hubble without his telescope.Now, imagine Mumford & Sons sans banjos.Okay, now that's being a bit dramatic, but we've come to identify with this band based on their unique use of instruments and their passion, both of which are almost completely absent from this album.Now, this isn't a bad album by any means. Anyone giving it a 1-star review is likely acting based on some knee-jerk reaction. ""OMG, they changed their sound. Sellouts! I hate them!""No, that's not what happened here. You can't fault the band for pursuing a new sound. What band has remained the same throughout their entire career? Mumford & Sons needed to try something new. The problem here is that their ""new"" is the same old thing that tons of bands have been doing for years. This is a generic pop/rock album. It's like they've taken a Coldplay formula but stripped out everything that's unique.There are enjoyable songs on here. Actually, there's not really a bad track. But nothing stands out as memorable either. It's just another album that will be filed away as utterly forgettable. Had this been Mumford & Sons first album, no one would have even cared about it.This album deserves three stars because it is about as mediocre and middle-of-the-road as music can be.

"The Waterfall didn’t really grab me on first listen, much like every My Morning Jacket album since Z. Honestly, after the first time through The Waterfall, I was ready to give up and declare it the worst MMJ album yet. As a huge fan since I first heard At Dawn almost 15 years ago, the vibe on The Waterfall felt too far removed from what MMJ can do.Fortunately, I decided to come back to this album rather than writing it off, and I’m definitely glad I did. This is an ambitious and bold album that shows a band still progressing and trying new things after two decades. Sure, MMJ could release more alt country stuff that everyone would love, but this is a band that wants to grow. And they’re definitely growing here on The Waterfall.There seem to be many reviewers and fans out there who still want to refer to MMJ as an alt country band, but let’s be honest: they haven’t alt country since Z. They aren’t going back (although there are always reminders embedded in the music), and The Waterfall is another step forward, not a step in the wrong direction.At times, the album feels too ambitious (but not in the same way as songs like “Highly Superstitious”). For example, the chorus of opening track ""Believe"" feels a bit cheesy coming from Jim James. But, on the whole, this album works quite well. The guitar work is incredible throughout, especially on songs like “Tropics.” “In Its Infancy (The Waterfall)” is one of the catchiest and most epic MMJ songs to date. And the singing continues to show off James’s impressive range and influence.It’s not my favorite MMJ album at this moment in time. Not by a longshot. But it’s a grower, and it is slowly moving up the ranks.The Waterfall as a whole might not immediately grab all MMJ fans (although quite a few people seem to be saying it's their favorite MMJ release already). Like I said, it took a few listens for me to really appreciate it. But once it finally clicked, I realized this was a fantastic piece of art from a band that delivers again and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN9JY07RAAQ5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6QJT7S#wasThisHelpful","RN9JY07RAAQ5K","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 2015, one might ask whether a new Everclear album is really necessary. The honest truth is probably not. However, for those willing to give this a listen, it's a high quality rock album with plenty of punch. The guitars are heavy, the vocals are spot-on, and the lyrics are (thankfully) not as cheesy as the title. It's actually the band's most consistent record in a long time.If you are an Everclear fan, you will like this album. If you are an alternative rock or modern rock fan, you will like this album. If you are nostalgic for Everclear, you will like this album. Heck, even if you like to make fun of 90s alternative bands that are still making music, you will probably like this.Even if it's been a while since you listened to Everclear, give this a spin.

"Without even listening to a single track on The Magic Whip, it's obvious this is the best thing Blur has released in over a decade. All kidding aside, it's great to finally have some new Blur. This album does not disappoint. While it doesn't sound like the most Blur-ish thing the band has ever done, it isn't a radical departure either. Sure, there's a bit more Damon Albarn than usual (some of his more current projects do crossover a bit here), but when all is said and done, this is a Blur album at heart. Musically and lyrically, you can feel the Blur come to life throughout the pleasurable listening experience that is The Magic Whip.There's plenty to enjoy here, although the album does feel maybe a bit too mellow at times. Still, the strong guitar tones keep this from falling into a funk. The album really feels like a logical progression from 13. which is certainly not a bad thing at all. On the whole, it's ambitious and draws from diverse influences. It's a bit poppy, a bit psychedelic, a bit electronic, and all good.This is a solid record and a great return for a band we weren't quite sure had any returning to do. And it sounds like there is still plenty of creativity left in these guys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21L4ZGUDIB6LV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00THHH9W4#wasThisHelpful","R21L4ZGUDIB6LV","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you're like me, you weren't there to see Ryan Adams perform at Carnegie Hall. Thankfully, this recording exists to capture two outstanding shows from one of the best performers in music today.This career-spanning set is a complete delight for both hardcore and casual Ryan Adams fans (Bryan Adams fans, however, will be disappointed by the lack of ""Summer of '69""). The album feels intimate and captures the magic of witnessing the real thing. You not only get 42 fantastic songs, but you also get the true concert experience through Ryan Adams's banter and improv, including a hilarious on-the-spot track that conjures the likes of Michael McDonald.Ryan Adams is in great spirits for these two gigs, but that doesn't make the music less beautiful or less heartbreaking. He flat-out kills these performances, and you can feel it through the recording. Whether or not your favorite Ryan Adams songs appear on this album, you will be blown away by the performance. I must admit, I was disappointed at first by the tracklisting. Many of my favorite Ryan Adams songs are MIA. But listening to this, I didn't care at all. I forgot all about my favorite Ryan Adams songs and found myself lost in the performance, not caring what he played next (just as long as he kept playing).This is one of the best live recordings released in a long time (both from a sound and performance standpoint) and a must for any Ryan Adams fan. If you've never seen him live, listening to this almost takes you there. It's a divine listening experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLDOCL40T9DF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UC9CJY4#wasThisHelpful","R1CLDOCL40T9DF","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Untethered Moon is a fantastic return for Built to Spill. This album is an instant classic filled with everything that makes Built to Spill a great band. The scorching guitar riffs and solo in opening track “All Our Songs” represent some of the best musicianship the band has ever laid down on a studio album. Fortunately, the album doesn’t peak with this incredible first song.Untethered Moon is a strong effort throughout, rivaling some of the best work in Built to Spill’s catalog. “All Our Songs,” “C.R.E.B,” and “When I’m Blind” are some of the strongest tracks, but the entire album is outstanding. This is a guitar-driven album with blaring riffs that will rip through your speakers. It’s not necessarily groundbreaking in that it doesn’t explore too much new territory for the band, but there are still plenty of fresh sounds that will make you glad Built to Spill is still making music. I think it’s their best work since Keep It Like a Secret. Let’s hope it doesn’t take so long to get the next one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SBLU8U8MI9PI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TZ0ATOI#wasThisHelpful","R3SBLU8U8MI9PI","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great concept for young kids just learning how to spell. However, the game is very cheaply made. The board does not have the traditional letter spaces to hold the tiles neatly in position. I know it would be difficult to incorporate that feature on the full-size board, but it is sorely missed here. The tiles don't stay neatly on the board at all. This is forgivable, but the board itself is ridiculously flimsy. The board snapped in half when my 4 year old daughter picked it up. She wasn't even being rough with it. We only had the game for two weeks before it broke. For almost 20 bucks, I expect much better. I guess what they say is true.

"The Poser, Jacob Rubin’s debut novel, has a unique premise and ambitious goals. Unfortunately, much like Giovanni (the book’s main character and narrator), this book falls short of meeting those.It starts as an engaging and quick read with a delightful (although not necessarily likeable) cast of characters. Once Max enters the picture, we are treated to fine humor without expense of the plot. When Giovanni begins his career as an impressionist under Max’s watch, we start to see the big ambition of this book. It becomes a tale of finding oneself, of really learning who we are, but without the usual triteness and overdone tropes (other than the mother-son issues).Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite make it there.Another reviewer commented that s/he became bored with the story and only cared about Rubin’s prose, to the point s/he no longer cared what happened to Giovanni. I can’t fully agree with this. While the story did begin to drag, by the third part of the book I found myself caring only about what happened to Giovanni (as in I just wanted to skip ahead to the ending). The language had ceased to entertain, and the premise had faded into something thin and tired. Whereas the story and writing had fully engaged early on, the latter part of the book all but loses the reader completely.I won’t spoil anything (not that there’s much to be spoiled about the ending), but the last few dozen pages or so feel cliche, forced, and rushed. Rather than learning anything about the human condition, we are forced into sentimentality and reflection. There’s also a new character that frustratingly serves as a pseudo deus ex machina. It’s a shame the book had to end this way after starting with so much promise. I will say this (very small spoiler alert): did we really need another story narrated from a mental hospital?Overall, it’s a promising debut that comes up a little short. It’s worth a read if you’re really looking for something new.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178EYSSTXRGY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016764#wasThisHelpful","R178EYSSTXRGY4","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hey, Killer is Local H's first album with new drummer Ryan Harding, and it's a great one. Although Brian St. Clair is missed after an amazing 13-year run with the band, Harding fills in nicely with aggressive and pounding drum beats that match the Local H sound perfectly.The album starts off with a wall of feedback and then launches into the instant classic that is ""The Last Picture Show in Zion."" The album hammers on from there, never missing a beat (although it does slow down for a track or two in the middle). Scott Lucas shows little signs of aging here. His vocal delivery is strong with a nice texture of maturity that gives these hard rockers even more power. ""City of Knives"" has the best yelling of Scott Lucas's career. The music is loud and at times angry (see especially ""Freshly F*cked"" and ""The Misanthrope""), oozing with everything there is to love about Local H. Lyrically, it probably packs the most punch of anything the band releases.In a way, this is a logical follow-up to Hallelujah, I'm a Bum. However, it's a much more focused effort. There's no filler here, and the music is louder and stronger. It's easily the best album the band has released since P.J. Soles, and possibly even better than that.If you're a Local H fan (even if you've been disappointed by their recent albums), this album will kill you - in the best way possible. If you've never listened to Local H before, this album actually serves as a great introduction for any fans of rock, punk, or grunge. Do yourself a favor and support this band. Go buy this album.

"From the opening riff of Modzilla, it's clear that Blaster is a solid rock album. Scott's vocals are strong throughout, and the music hits hard with classic rock influences and a modern twist. The band is pretty tight with some excellent guitar work. While the music doesn't quite mesh the same way as STP, this is a quality musical experience all around.In a way, this feels like the next logical step after STP's self-titled album. On the whole though, I think this is a stronger effort. In terms of Scott's career, I'd rank this ahead of Scott's solo album Happy in Galoshes, STP self-titled, and Velvet Revolver's Contraband. It's a little weak lyrically at times (Way She Moves, Beach Pop), but there aren't any bad songs on here.In terms of the quality of the vinyl pressing: I purchased the clear orange vinyl through the PledgeMusic campaign prior to the album release. It's a good looking record in a quality sleeve with a nice insert (and the bonus sleeve with Scott's autograph was a nice bonus). The pressing itself sounds good for the most part, but there isn't enough dead wax on Side B, so closing track ""Circles"" sounds a bit muddled.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUC34MPHAGUN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SAHLWI4#wasThisHelpful","R1AUC34MPHAGUN","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I first heard that the new Sufjan album would be a return to his folk roots, I was a little disappointed. While I have long enjoyed Sufjan’s folkier albums, The Age of Adz is one of my all-time favorite records. I couldn’t help but hope we’d get something similar to that.Fortunately, Carrie & Lowell does not disappoint in any way. From the opening guitar on “Death with Dignity,” it’s obvious that this is one of the most beautiful albums in recent memory--and perhaps ever. Sufjan is at the top of his game musically, lyrically, and vocally. The album flows together perfectly, drawing the listener into a deep and heartfelt experience. However, each track also can stand alone as a great song.“Death with Dignity” and “Fourth of July” might be the highlights, but this is really an album that works so well together that it’s almost criminal to break it up. The entire album is perfect. I’d list the best songs or do a track-by-track analysis, but there’s no need. This is simply flawless. The musicianship is so rich and gorgeously layered. As much as I love The Age of Adz, Michigan, and Seven Swans, this is Sufjan’s true masterpiece.Because it is such a quiet album, some listeners may treat it as background music, but this is an album that really begs for complete immersion. It’s criminal not to give it your full attention and really listen to the rich music, beautiful lyrics, and minimal production. When you spin Carrie & Lowell, do yourself a favor and give your undivided attention to Sufjan. This is a record that rewards the listener again and again. An instant classic of profound and elegant musical beauty. Sufjan Stevens has really set himself apart from all other singer-songwriters of our generation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REZ7BIODAT54G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S24RT3C#wasThisHelpful","REZ7BIODAT54G","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After reading a story by Eric Bosse in an online literary magazine, I immediately sought out his full-length collection of fiction. I was not disappointed. This is a smart and powerful collection from the hand of a skilled writer who isn't afraid to take risks. Bosse's stories touch on many deep issues, but he achieves this without being overly reflective or forcing it upon the reader. These stories are at once developed and succinct, with rich characters and rewarding scenes. In each story, Bosse pulls the reader into the lives of the characters, making us feel their mistakes, heartbreaks, and confusions. The stories aren't necessarily connected, but they flow fluidly together, and the collection definitely works as a whole. It's a collection filled with emotion, humor, and just the right amount of bizarreness. It's hard to pick a favorite, but I'd probably go with ""The Master of Submission."" I eagerly await more from this author.

"Are you tired the mountains of BS from the media, politicians, and everyone on your Facebook feed? Then Debunk It! is the perfect book for you.Debunk It! serves a twofold purpose: 1. To teach you how not to fall for BS in a world filled with BS, and 2. To dispel some of the biggest BS out there today. It accomplishes both of these pretty well, but it isn't going to arm you with high quality arguments for debunking all the BS out there. Rather, it gives you the tools to learn how to do it yourself. By touching on BS topics like anti-vaccination, anti-evolution, and a wide range of other nonsense, Grant teaches readers of any age all the tricks of the BSers. While he does dismantle these BS topics quickly, this book won't actually help you argue against them. You'll still have to do your own research.The writing is very accessible. It's written for teens, but it can be appreciated by anyone. Parents should probably be warned that there is mild profanity (bullsh!t is used dozens of times), but it's all in good fun. Grant certainly isn't obscene.Overall, a fun and informative read that anyone can enjoy (except maybe extreme liberals and extreme conservatives who are too brainwashed by their own BS).","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RG4T2Q07L5AO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936976684#wasThisHelpful","R1RG4T2Q07L5AO","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This started off very strong for me, with a captivating voice and great scene work. Unfortunately, the storytelling started to spiral out of control about halfway through. Much of the characterization felt forced, the narrative voice became too reflective, and the chronology of events felt stifling. The book lost its momentum and failed to deliver suspense at the expense of trying too hard to come up with grand realization after grand realization. Overall, it's a pretty good YA book, but it doesn't hold up for the whole thing.

"I’ll be the first to admit that I was quite nervous when I heard Twin Shadow’s next album would be on a major label and was going to be even poppier than Confess. While I enjoyed Confess on the whole, I was hoping for a sound a little more similar to the amazing debut album, Forget.It took only about 10 seconds of “Flatliners” before I shed that nervousness and jumped out of my seat, dancing and thinking to myself, “Yes! This is pop musical genius!” I didn’t expect this reaction at all, especially after being a little disappointed when I first heard this album's singles.Eclipse is an incredibly catchy album from start to finish, and it’s radically different from George Lewis Jr’s previous efforts. And that’s perfectly okay with me. There is so much growth here. Yes, it’s “poppier,” but in a mature way, not in some contrived I-wanna-be-on-the-radio way. It’s immediately clear that this is the album George Lewis Jr really wanted to make, and I commend him for following his grand musical vision.Tracks like “Turn Me Up” and “I’m Ready” show just how strong Lewis’s songwriting is on this album. At heart, these may be pop songs, but they contain strong rock and experimental elements that prove Lewis has something bold up the sleeves of his leather jacket.“Flatliners,” “Turn Me Up,” and “To the Top” (the last of which I actually didn’t like at first) are the standout tracks for me, but the whole album is solid and filled with surprises. The guitar work on “Watch Me Go” is especially incredible. I won’t be surprised at all if a few of these tracks get a bit of radio play, which would be fantastic. The world needs to hear more Twin Shadow! I don’t love this album quite as much as Forget, but I think it's better than Confess and I have a feeling this is going to grow more and more with each listen. These songs get in my head and stay for days. Unlike most of today’s pop songs, I welcome George Lewis Jr. in my head.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GY6LVWWT2P8C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SM3LWKO#wasThisHelpful","R2GY6LVWWT2P8C","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After 8 years, Modest Mouse is finally back, and this album should not disappoint you, as long as you give it a fair chance. Let’s start by stating the obvious: this is not Lonesome Crowded West. Nor is it The Moon and Antarctica. However, it’s still a solid body of work with some standout Modest Mouse tracks.The album starts off strong, building from the slow “Strangers to Ourselves” into the driving “Lampshades On Fire” and “Sh*t in Your Cut,” all three of which are very good songs. Then, we have the unfortunate thing that is track 4: on first listen, “Pistol” might seem like one of the worst songs ever. However, it grows on you, reminiscent of My Morning Jacket’s “Highly Suspicious,” a song that seems so bad until you realize it’s actually embarrassingly good (but still in a bad way).It doesn’t take long for the band to recover. Track 6, “The Ground Walks, with Time in a Box,” is an instant classic, the type of energetic, fist-pumping, foot-pounding song that makes Modest Mouse so great.From there, the album remains pretty solid until the complete throwaway track “God is an Indian…” Why they decided to include this on the album is beyond me. After 8 years, I guess anything goes. But a lousy 1-minute track isn’t enough to ruin a good album.Overall, there’s plenty of good stuff on this record. Yes, it feels a little bloated at times, and it’s by no means their best. Some of these riffs feel recycled, and it doesn’t cover much new territory. But this is still one mighty mouse that packs a lot of punch.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQ7XA8692GXE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXRNCEK#wasThisHelpful","RIQ7XA8692GXE","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fast read with some amazing dino-on-human action that will get your heart racing and craving a little dino lovin' of your own. However, I'm very confused about two important points:1. Just how did this dinosaur become a billionaire? I need a lot more backstory here. The character development is a little shabby at times (although I can really picture the dinosaur's huge member).2. How exactly did the dino turn him gay? I don't know if I'm reading this too literally, but I got the feeling he was gay all along.

"If you're looking for first-rate literature, turn back now before the Shatzilla gets you. But if you want a fun, riotous adventure of low-brow literature and high-octane chuckles, then you won't find much better. This quest to save William Shatner is witty and engaging, taking almost enough creative license to land this author in the slammer for blatant copyright infringement. Yeah, that's what Jeff Burk risked to write this glorious book for you. You owe it to him to pick up a copy.Never seen Star Trek? Doesn't matter. I've never seen an episode in my life. Not into nerdy gamer stuff? Doesn't matter. I've never been to a nerd convention or played any nerdy magic card games in my life. This book is still hilarious. It at once parodies, mocks, and ridicules these things while also showing how awesome they probably are for the people into them. Bottom line: whether you are a gamer nerd, Trek nerd, some other nerd, or not a nerd at all, you will love this book and laugh along.Also, I hear this is a sequel (or more like a follow-up). I didn't read the first one, but now I want to. I don't think I lost anything at all because I read this first. Shatnerquest doesn't seem to require much prior knowledge. Of anything. At all.

"If you’re expecting any Arcade Fire on this album, then I have good news for you. Will Butler, brother of Arcade Fire frontman Win Butler, certainly draws from his own experience with the powerhouse indie outfit. But this definitely isn’t an Arcade Fire album, nor is it simply an offshoot or a footnote. This is a strong and diverse album that offers up foot-stomping blues, piano-driven ballads, and good old-fashioned rock music.There are definitely songs (like “Son of God” and “What I Want” and “Witness”) that sound straight from an Arcade Fire record (or maybe more like Arcade Fire B-Sides), which should be enough to please the diehard AF fans. But for those listeners looking for more or even for a slight departure, you will get it. This is not a wholly unique album, and it does feel a bit derivative at times, but it also stands on its own and stays strong throughout. It’s a diverse album, possibly the workings of an artist who doesn’t quite know the direction he wants to take, but that makes it all the more rewarding in this case.The biggest complaint is how short it is. At just 27 minutes, it can hardly even be called an album. Still, the music is good, and standout tracks like ""Anna,"" ""Take My Side,"" and ""Sing to Me"" certainly make this worthwhile.Will Butler may not be the star of the Arcade Fire, but he shines brightly here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38HZAVQF0OC9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PRL16L4#wasThisHelpful","R38HZAVQF0OC9V","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Acclaimed author Neil Gaiman introduces this collection by confessing it doesn't stand up to his own test: that a collection should consist of works meant to go together, not just a hodgepodge of writing. Mr. Gaiman more than sells himself short with this confession. Yes, it's true that the first piece is seemingly a throwaway prose poem about writing. A foolish reader would stop here and deem the book an unworthy read. However, Gaiman quickly redeems himself with the (of course unrelated) combination of ""Lunar Labyrinth"" and ""The Thing About Cassandra."" It's immediately apparent that Gaiman was telling the truth in that introduction. We aren't going to see a common theme in this book (other than great writing, of course). Rather, we're going to get a little bit of everything, and it's a huge reward.Gaiman shows in this collection that he's capable of it all. From humor to the absurd to the utterly fantastic to the downright traditional, Gaiman churns out story after story of engaging plots and characters, yanking the reader along for a satisfying (if not confusing) ride.At times, this reads like a collection of demos or outtakes. Some of these pieces will have you thinking, ""How could such a great writer produce this?"" However, the amount of fluff and filler you have to sift through to get to the good stuff is far from a monumental task. Gaiman provides plenty of hits in this collection (although some stories do feel like false starts).My personal favorites are ""The Thing About Cassandra,"" ""Click-Clack the Rattlebag,"" ""The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury,"" and ""And Weep, Like Alexander,"" the last of which is surely one of the most amusing and thought-provoking stories of this century. Sure, not everything in here is a gem, but it's a fine hodgepodge of writing. Don't say Mr. Gaiman didn't warn you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2021HHWKE24XF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062330268#wasThisHelpful","R2021HHWKE24XF","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first heard this album, I listened to it at least 5 times in a row. It was one of those rare, ""Holy crap, this is what I've been waiting for"" moments. This is music that forces its way in your ears, slams into your brain, and stays in your head for weeks at a time. It can get you again at any time. You'll be listening to something else, and this thing in your head will scream, ""Put on Guilty of Everything and turn it up LOUD!"" And you can't resist, because this beautiful, soaring, pulsing music is an addictive earworm that must be heard again and again. As cliche as it is to call something ""soaring"" in a music review, this truly qualifies. Heck, this might be the one album that justifies that term ever having been used to talk about music.Go ahead and insert the My Bloody Valentine comparison here, but this deserves so much more than that label.

"Nervous is Siskiyou's third album and first in four years. It's also their best one yet. Nervous has a more mature, richer sound than the first two efforts (both of which were also very good).Opening track ""Deserter"" is a fantastic effort and possibly the best on an album full of great songs. The folk-horn freakout in the second half of the song makes it clear that Siskiyou is trying new things on this album--and doing those things very well. That's not to say that Nervous is a drastic departure from the first two albums. At the core, this is still Siskiyou, just stronger and more adventurous.This is a fantastic effort that will reward the listener again and again. Siskiyou has really found their sound.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G8FVWSQ3C510/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PKXPCUK#wasThisHelpful","R3G8FVWSQ3C510","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kelly Link is an innovative writer, and these stories show off her diverse range. The first story, ""The Summer People,"" is by far the best. It's a mysterious, playful, and dark story that captivates the reader for all 38 or so pages. Unfortunately, like much of the collection, it rushes to conclude after developing such brilliant tension. It's almost as if Link just decided it was time to start a new story. Honestly, I'd rather see a novel-worth of ""The Summer People"" than read any of the other stories in this collection. Each one felt a little weaker than the last, and Link's ""experiments"" with language sometimes grew quite tiresome. The second story in the collection has great characters (the demon lover is fascinating), but it is told in such a scatterbrained way that it loses most of its power. Everything after that is hit or miss, including closer ""Light,"" which is so close to being a very good story. Still there's a good amount worth reading here, and Link does have a strong contemporary voice. I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GX544W8WLYFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179689#wasThisHelpful","R2GX544W8WLYFX","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It really feels like a cohesive album as opposed to a mishmash of old songs slapped together for a buck. No, this is the real deal. Even though it's not a ""proper"" album, it's the best thing Sam Beam has released since The Shepherd's Dog (and maybe even better than that). Songs like ""Two Hungry Blackbirds,"" ""Your Sly Smile,"" and ""Slow Black River"" stand up to anything else Sam Beam has done. This is a perfect reminder of the great music he is capable of making, and I'd love to see him return to this sound one day.

"For the price, this garbage can seems a bit underwhelming at first. Let's be realistic. $50 for a plastic bin that holds your trash before you put it in another plastic bin...that seems a bit steep. However, even though this thing is far from stylish, it's $50 well spent.Sure, you can buy a $10-$20 garbage can at your local discount store, but you won't have the reliability of this product. Simplehuman stands behind its quality. This trash can comes with a 5-year warranty, which might sound ridiculous because why wouldn't a trash can last for 5 years?

A normal human foot is plenty to cause damage to this thing.Luckily, Simplehuman sent us a brand new foot pedal, no questions asked. We didn't even have to prove our purchase.

"This is not an easy book. Rather, this is a book that provides great rewards to patient and diligent readers. It begins so cryptically that it is almost impossible to follow and enjoy. Midway through the second chapter, almost any reader who has made it that from will be completely hooked. I read the entire book in one day simply because I had to. John Darnielle's brilliant prose and bold non-linear structure made me unable to put this down. The novel unravels like a deep maze, revealing our greatest fears along the way.

Although the stories aren't strongly connected to each other, Ramey's pacing and prose makes this book addictive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K51HBY57MJRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O11WCVE#wasThisHelpful","R1K51HBY57MJRJ","A35OZD7M5FJLTQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35OZD7M5FJLTQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These truly do work. I live in an apartment and noticed one windy day that our sockets were whistling. This surprised me since this is a newer construction, but alas, it was happening. We spoke to the management and they said they'd look into it but a month passed to no avail. I saw on the forecast that we were getting some below zero temps and decided to remedy the drafty things in the meantime. There were just enough of the outlet and switch covers to do our whole apartment (3 bdrm, 2 bath). I noticed a huge difference in the amount of cold air coming from them on the outer walls pretty much immediately. There was still a bit of cold coming from the outlet holes themselves where things weren't plugged in and this was solved with the use of  closed faced socket protectors which can be found in the baby section of just about any store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K0LEKGTE00JA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040JH21W#wasThisHelpful","R1K0LEKGTE00JA","A2N4HN48AQDG6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N4HN48AQDG6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought three playhut tents for christmas this year, and so far so good. This Planes one was actually to replace a Mickey Mouse tent (Plastic poles) that lasted about 12 hours and was broken immediately. I did a review on it, and I recommend you seek it out  so you know what style of bed tent to avoid so you don't waste your money like we did. The Playhuts, are pop up tents and seem thus far very durable and have a great material. We have this one, a Spiderman one, and a Frozen one and all of them are doing well. They fit perfectly on twin beds and are held in place with elastic straps, they don't interfere too much with making the beds eighter if you just tuck one end of the blankets under the mattress and put the elastic over that. The one downside is despite following the photo instructions, I cannot get them folded back up to store when the kids don't want them on their beds. I can get them ""close enough"" and shove them under the couch, so all is well :P","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14S7SJE2QMG98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KTDZ472#wasThisHelpful","R14S7SJE2QMG98","A2N4HN48AQDG6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N4HN48AQDG6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I typically turn to Amazon for most shoe purchases as I can almost always find good prices on name brand shoes for my children. New Balance is particular favorite of mine for them as they just seem to have the best durability because they usually look close to new even after several months of play and abuse. My kids have never complained about discomfort as they have with Saucony, Nike, and other store brands (I gave up on the store brands after the ""toddler"" stage because the soles would literally fall apart within weeks). My son flipped when we were looking on here for a new pair of shoes because they have yellow on them, and I did because the price was amazing! I think he's been wearing them for a few months now and aside from a little dirt on the bottom, they look as good as they did coming out of the box.

"First and foremost I want to say that EasyUps are the BEST training pants out there. My only complaint is that they don't have the tear-away sides to make ""diaper"" changes simple and quick. Which in their defense isn't the point of trainers most times, but pull-ups and other brands have them on theirs, and that feature would make them my all time go to.  My son is a larger boy (why we NEED trainers) for his age and also has some cog/dev delays and potty training has been on going for two years now because of this. I've found that pull-ups tend to leak or ""seep"" through, especially at night, requiring that I either buy Goodnights, or change him in the middle of  the night. I do however buy them for his preschool and our diaper bag, so that they/we  don't have to take his pants and shoes off (he is in a boots only phase, so it can be a real chore in a hurry) when he does need changed. This is why I'd love if Easy ups had that option for changing because then I'd only buy them. With easy ups, they are more than sufficient for day and night both so I only need to keep the one kind on hand. I should also mention that with diapers and wipes, Amazon Prime/Mom and subscribe and save, you actually get more diapers for right around what you will pay in a big box store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5C79PG8WUYHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005U9Y3A4#wasThisHelpful","R5C79PG8WUYHO","A2N4HN48AQDG6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N4HN48AQDG6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I stumbled across this series just browsing the options and figured I would check it out. I was impressed and satisfied with it and had a hard time putting it down. If you did NOT like 50 Shades of Grey bc of how repetitive and poorly written it was, give this series a shot. It's much better quality and only mildly repetitive as there are only so many descriptive words that can be used during steamy scenes. In regard to those I didn't feel as if the author had just copied and pasted them throughout the books. I will say my only real complaint is that the majority seems to happen over just a span of a few weeks but in my mind most of these things would develop over the span of a few months realistically. That's truly a minor detail though and doesn't impact my opinion negatively enough to effect my rating.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L6TW54W4BLFR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX9UTLU#wasThisHelpful","R2L6TW54W4BLFR","A2N4HN48AQDG6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N4HN48AQDG6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought a ten pack of these for my boys to wear with their new boots as they only had ankle socks up till then.  One boy wears a 12 and the other a size 1, so I figured this would suit them both nicely. They fit the 12 perfectly, but were a little small on the 1, but were passable. In the end I bought him the next size up because I wanted to be sure he was completely comfortable.

"I have obviously been trying to find relief for my feet. I stumbled upon these at the store trying to locate the Dr. Scholls machine and figured ""Why not get both, these are cheap."" I must say I was hesitant because I have longer feet at a size 12-ish and wish I had listened to that initial instinct to pass them by bc they are one-size. Most certainly not the case! While the heel cup is fine, the arch support just falls short of where it should be. Obviously, someone in a 6-7-8 or even 9 will have an arch that falls into a place slightly different than each other, but especially from those in a 10 and up. I must say, the advice on the insert was VERY helpful though, and has made a huge difference in the level of pain. My only other complaint is they seem to raise you up a good bit in the shoe when place in over top of the factory insole that comes inside the shoe. I felt like I was walking in a low heel. Kind of awkward feeling. I may try the Men's insert if I find myself on the market again soon. I do suggest trying the Dr. Scholls custom fitting thing. That insert feels about spot on size wise, but still a bit high heel-ish as well. And if anything you can learn a little info on your feet, which is helpful when trying to find good shoes. Which ultimately is what we all need with plantar fascia issues.

"I recently mosied into a locally owned shoe store that specializes in custom fitting because I do HIIT training and workout daily and just couldn't find a shoe that didn't hurt my feet in some way, shape, or form. The very first pair the owner suggested was these when I explained my predicament and new-ish foot pain. He measured my feet and low and behold... I was wearing the wrong size shoes. Turns out I need a size SKI aka 12 2A. I took these guys home and immediately put them to use (Indoors only of course). My arch pain was almost immediately gone! However, they stunk for my workouts because they are just a bit to deep in the toe box for me and the ball of my foot moved within the shoe when pivoting and twisting and I personally didn't care for that. But as a runner (what they are built for) and for walking they are amazing and SUPER cushy. If I had not needed a shoe for working out (haahaa except now I need shoes for everything since ALL my shoes are at LEAST two sizes to small :P) I would have kept them. I do have SKINNY feet according to my shoe guy, so the problem I had with depth may not be an issue for you.

"This is a cute tool kit, but I concur with other reviews about the ""screwdriver"" sucking. Make sure you invest in a decent set of those if you buy this kit. There is no non-electric one in this, which is unfortunate because the screwdrivers are pretty essential and turning the giant thing is very awkward. Also it should be noted for things that have screws down in a deep hole (i.e. vacuums, carpet cleaners, some childrens toys) this one wouldn't work because the part you put the desired screw tip into is too short or too fat. I have used all the other tools in the kit a good bit though. they need to re-release this with normal screw drivers and it would be a HUGE success.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYXH15L0U8G15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GUTJRY#wasThisHelpful","RYXH15L0U8G15","A2N4HN48AQDG6E","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2N4HN48AQDG6E?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really love these heavy duty, extra long nitrile exam gloves.  I like the powder free type as I never cared for the residue left by the powdered ones.  These slip on and off easily anyway so I see no need for the powder.  I ordered medium and they fit my 7-7 1/2 hand well, snug, but not too tight.The 12 inch length is so nice for working in damp locations, for cleaning, or if reaching into areas.  If working in fluids, I don't have to be as careful not to flood my glove accidentally.These are ruggedly made at 8 mil thickness and hold up to a lot of abuse.  They are exam gloves however, and while they are a quality biological barrier, are not meant for prolonged use in harsh chemicals as industrial grade gloves are. Yes, there are only half as many as the lighter gloves but you can feel the greater quality and protection.  Order what you need for the job you expect to be doing.  I like having a choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V3KL1TFFX6NA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0058I2872#wasThisHelpful","R2V3KL1TFFX6NA","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these Xtreme Nitrile gloves in large and I'm happy with the fit.  I could wear a medium if I wanted them tighter but this size allows a less confining fit and I don't feel that they are stretched excessively so that they tear as easily.  My hand fits about a 7-7 1/2 surgical glove.I like these a lot.  They are quite durable for the cleaning, gardening, and shop tasks I need them for and I'm pleased with the wear-time I get before needing to replace them.

"These are nice nitrile gloves for use around the house, in the garage, and garden.  I wear them either alone or under my cotton gloves when transplanting things in my pots or planters.  I also use them for cleaning in the kitchen or bathrooms when using cleaning products that might damage my skin.  Even using them part of the time saves my hands from getting dry during the winter months.I ordered the extra large, thinking my husband might also use them, and am surprised that I can wear them pretty comfortably.

"I had tried and enjoyed the FSTG black bean multigrain and sweet potato chips in recent months so thought I'd give these a try.  None of these chips are as greasy, salty, or heavy as regular potato, Dorito, or Sunchips and have more redeeming ingredients than the aforementioned too.  Along with this, they are all natural and cholesterol, trans fat, GMO, gluten, and preservative free.  When I eat these, I feel like I'm putting a better quality food in my body and I think these taste good too.  I'm glad that I do because I ordered a case!These are very crunchy chips, which I like, and so far I haven't had any more breakage in the bags I've eaten than I would in a bag I picked up at the store, if I could find these locally.  These aren't heavily seasoned chips and most of the taste I noticed came from the sesame and other seeds and the sea salt as the pinto beans just don't have a lot of flavor themselves.  They are very satisfying to me by themselves but they work well with guacamole or salsa too.  The 5.5 ounce bag is about 5 servings so the 12 bag case shouldn't last longer than the expiration date at my house, especially with the holidays coming.I didn't detect a burnt taste in these like some reviewers mentioned, however, I did get that a little in the sweet potato chips when I first ate them.As with any food, the enjoyment or lack of it is completely subjective.  I'd try a bag of these if you can find them locally before I'd order a case as I did.I like them a lot and give them 4 and a half stars.

"I love having a kitchen tool that can do double (or triple) duty as this one does.  It works as a stirrer and a scraper, being flexible enough to get into tight corners, and yet is sturdy enough to stir relatively thick sauces and lighter batters, and you can serve with it too!  It fell only slightly short for me at scraping can corners as well as my trusty small spatula, but beyond that small shortfall,  I'm very happy with it's performance.  It is a handy length and size for me, feels good in my hand, and is a pretty too!.I see myself grabbing it most often for stirring soups and sauces while they cook, scraping the bottom of the pan with the straight edge of the spoon.  Whisks often allow things to catch and wooden spoons do as well, besides requiring hand washing.  You can pop this in the dishwasher if you can manage without it for that long.  You may want to order two!I love the red color as it hasn't shown any stains, is bright and fun to use, and is pretty enough to serve with.  I'm happy I found this new spoonula and look forward to many years of cooking with it.  I feel that it's reasonably priced for the quality too.

"Like so many now days, we have a number of televisions around our home.  Most are Sony, the largest being a 5 year old Bravia, which has worked very well and has a wonderful picture.  I'm comparing this Hisense to our Sony.Besides it's great picture, the most impressive functions of the Hisense are it's ""smart"" capabilities.  The menu is user friendly, the 19 preloaded apps are easily accessed, and the ones I've used so far worked as they should.  I really enjoy the media sharing capabilities and look forward to using it more to view and share pictures and videos over the holidays.  There are also USB and HDMI ports for connecting and sharing through other devices, as well as the standard component connections. Though I'm still investigating and learning the plethora of functions that this TV has I am impressed so far!The picture is brilliant and clear, as good or better than our Sony.  The blacks are black and the colors are vibrant.  Motion is well defined and  without shadowing or lag.  The screen area fills the full face with only the small black frame around it and the picture is well defined to the edges. The sound quality is quite good too, thankfully, as I don't have external speakers to hook up in it's location.We mounted our TV on a wall though it does come with two stands.  After it was mounted it was easy to set up and program the remote.  The included batteries were a pleasant surprise.  I'm glad that the manufacturer makes that little extra effort to avoid the buyer's frustration of not having any when they get to that point.A quick start guide and warranty information are included in the box.  There is a lot more info available on the web and a complete user manual  available on their website.  I had to enter 55H6B model to get the manual but it is the same, I believe.  Their FAQ page is very helpful as well.Considering we paid 3 or 4 times as much as the current cost of this Hisense for our comparably equipped Sony, I am very impressed with it.  I will update my review as time passes and we use it more.  If you would like to view a Hisense TV before you buy, I've seen them in department and home appliance stores locally where I live.  I'm pretty comfortable that you could find them as well in most locations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q0YZ8N3UHHJA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141BV1F6#wasThisHelpful","R3Q0YZ8N3UHHJA","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I chose this pretty, unique ring because I liked that it was two-toned, yellow gold plated and silver, and it looked like it had a lot of sparkle, which it is and does.  I was a little concerned about the size of the stones and overall ring but was willing to take that chance to see it.  After having it for a few days and trying it on, I'm a little disappointed due to the way it looks and fits on my hand.First of all, it's a large ring so really needs a larger person and finger larger than mine to look it's best.  I'm not tiny or extremely petite but about average at 5' 5"" and a size 12 in most clothes.  For me, if the stones were 50 to 70 percent of the size they are, it would fit my hand much better.  As it is, whether I wear it on my middle or ring finger, it looks and feels too broad.  The top is so wide that the sides of my fingers hit the stones which causes me to want to take it off very soon.  It feels like brass knuckles might feel, (though I've never owned any), and would undoubtedly make a pretty effective weapon in a pinch.The stones appear to be set well, are clear, and sparkle a lot.  The metals are smooth and shiny.  The size seems accurate.  I just need a smaller ring to fit my hand.  I give it three and a half stars, mostly due to personal preference than lack of quality.  If you are a larger person than I, it may be perfect.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YVKB89NG8OF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JC0AXTW#wasThisHelpful","R24YVKB89NG8OF","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased these lovely, blue and white, Swarovski element earrings recently on a lightning deal and really couldn't be happier with them.  I love this color of blue CZs and have a few pieces in my jewelry collection.  These are the best of both worlds as they will coordinate with both clear and blue colors as I choose.They appear to be made well.  The hinged posts work smoothly and the click top backs fasten securely.  I still use a plastic ear nut over the post after passing it through my ear for extra security.  Too easily do these types of earrings accidentally come loose and fall out before you even realize it.  Just a suggestion from one that's lost a few. . .I like the ""swirl pattern of these that is somewhat unique and different from a regular hoop.  The size is perfect for me, being large enough to be noticed yet lightweight and comfortable to wear all day.  You have the option to wear them either with the clear stone bottoms toward your neck or on the other side of the blue if you like just by reversing earrings.I've included some pictures to try to give another idea of their size.

"These are heavy, well-made dish cloths.

I use them for both duties, and they work well for me, but many (like my 92 year old mother) would consider them too large and heavy for a dish washing cloth.They wash up well on regular cycle, dry in the dryer, and come out like new.

"These Zak Designs sippy cups are wonderful for my 22 month old granddaughter.  She is becoming more independent daily and likes to do things for herself.  These colorful cups allow her that while keeping Grandma's house safe from most spills, keeping everyone happier!  She likes to name all the different animals, letters, and numbers.She has been using different brands of ""sippy cups"" for quite a few months now but hasn't had any like these.  It took her a few, somewhat frustrating, tries before she was successful at getting a satisfactory drink out of the cup, but then it was easy.  I began at a medium setting but moved it up quickly.  We weren't running around the house with it though so it wasn't too risky for spills.  The glasses contain most leaks or spills unless they're dropped hard or shaken upside down.  Then, it's just drips and sprinkles.Being double walled is nice for keeping drinks cold longer so that they are safe and refreshing.  These 8.7 oz. glasses are a handy size both for little hands to hold, to fit in a drink holder in your bag, and for capacity, and they are BPA freee, of course!We're all happy at Grandma's house!

"Having had the matching earrings for almost four months now, I recently picked up this necklace on a lightning deal and absolutely love the set!  I've included a picture to show them together.  It doesn't do them justice, as they shine and sparkle amazingly, but it's really difficult to get a photo that shows that without so much glare that you can't see the pieces.To me, it looks like all the stones are the same size, about 5/16 inch or 7.5 mm.  I think the pendant appears a bit larger but don't believe it actually is. . . could be the extending bale that makes it appear larger.  I've had 3 carat cubic zirconia earrings in a different ""square"" cut that were so large that I sent them back.  The Asscher cut is a ""thicker"" stone so it doesn't appear as large.  It gives great depth and sparkle to the stones though and I love the shape as well.  The platinum plated setting is extra shiny and elegant looking.The included chain is dainty and 18 inches long with two round links to wear it at 16 and 17 inches if desired.  Mine arrived slightly tangled but they were carefully and easily removed.  It fastens with a spring-ring clasp.I have quite a few pieces of cubic zirconia jewelry and have never had any of them dull or loose their shine.  Some of the cheaper plated settings may change but the stones remain shiny and clear. I take care of them and clean them carefully per instructions.  My Swarovski Zirconias are even more consistently manufactured, cut, and beautiful!I trust that I will enjoy wearing this set for many, many years.

"These Flax heavy-duty industrial disposable towels are thicker than most, are a very handy size, and are sturdy and absorbent. The ones I have measured even a bit larger than the stated 9"" x 16.5"". My experience has been that they hold up well to wiping and scrubbing so outlast regular paper towels by many, many times.  Though they seem pricey, in a shop or industrial setting, the cost could be comparable to the expense of laundering along with the increased cost of cloth towels.  Being the chief laundry officer, I definitely prefer these in our own farm shop as well as for some cleaning jobs around the house.I was pleasantly surprised at the generous size and durability of these towels.

"This is a wonderful sunless self-tanning gel that doesn't have the yucky scent that the less expensive ones do.  Xen-Tan's light cucumber melon scented gel is pleasant and leaves a medium to medium dark tan depending on your skin tone and how long you leave it on.The first time I tried it I applied it with a plastic-gloved hand and the separately available mitt on the larger, smoother areas of my body (legs, arms, chest).  I just used the gloved hand for my face and it turned out nice and even thanks to the tinted color of the gel.  I left it on for about 3 hours as I wanted to see how dark I would get in this time.  After showering, I had a nice, even color that looked like I'd laid out, without the dkin cancer risk or the red burn!  It was a bit sticky for awhile after applying, about 45 minutes before I felt comfortable putting on loose fitting clothes but it was worth it.  It was hard to wait the rest of the time to see the results but it is the price you must pay, unfortunately, and it is a lot less annoying than the self-tanners with the weird odor.My husband was surprised to see a suntanned me when he got home from work and thought I'd been outside all afternoon. Thank you Xen-Tan!With Fall here and Winter on the way, it's nice to know I don't have to be pasty white, go on vacation, or wait until Spring to have a natural looking tan.  This is a bit pricey but not if compared to the cost of a spray tan and you can get at least 3 or 4 body tans from one tube, and more if you don't do your whole body. This is depending on your size, of course.I had a nice, natural color for the week with daily showers.  I didn't have stained clothing or bedding.

Each pliers has 6 different jaw settings to grip many sizes of nuts, bolts, or materials you are working with.

They aren't the most expensive either, but are very good quality for the cost.  Function is more important in my book.They are a bit stiff operating now but I assume will loosen and become more smooth with use.

"This is very nice, effective self tanning gel.  It goes on easily and evenly and gives an instant color that gradually darkens over the course of a few hours.  One of my favorite qualities is the lack of the ""odor"" that many self tanners have as they work.  This has a nice scent that I would describe as a mild coconut, which I found pleasant while not being very noticeable or overpowering.I find this ""Moroccan Tan"" to be just a little dark for me.  Even though I applied it quite sparingly, I feel it looks too dark, too brown, to be realistic on me.  I have a medium to light complexion and don't think I've ever looked like this with a natural tan, even before sunscreens were recommended.  I suggest trying the lighter XEN-TAN product initially for those with similar natural coloring, unless you really want to look like you're using fake tanner.  It IS NOT orangey, just too brown for me.I used thin gloves to apply this and had no problems either with application or stained hands.  I suggest to go easy with it on your first application as it blends more easily, it dries faster, and you can always add more.  It just doesn't take that much to achieve a decent color.I showered after about three hours and it's worn well.  It's lasted me most of a week with daily showers and hasn't looked blotchy or uneven.  I probably shouldn't subtract a star for the color as it is mostly personal need and preference.  I'd say four and a half stars just because of that, not the product quality.Be sure to exfoliate well before using and the mitt is very helpful if you get it.  It's pricey but cheaper than a salon spray tan and should last at least a few applications.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VD3VVR0UK459/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIQALAC#wasThisHelpful","R2VD3VVR0UK459","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a wonderful room heater for a nursery or other medium sized space but for a couple of small issues.  I love the remote crib sensor, the numerous safety features, the hidden power cord storage, and it's relatively quiet and efficient heating.The first issue I had was when I tried to use it.  It wouldn't start.  After a bit of deducing, I realized that it would not run on our short, plush carpet as the safety ""tip-over"" button on the bottom was not depressed enough.  I have another Vornado room heater that I use in the same spot very frequently which has never had this problem so it puzzled me.  I resolved it by placing the Vornadobaby heater on a magazine and it started right away.  Yes, I realize you shouldn't have an electric heater sitting on paper or anything easily burnable but, that said, this unit not operating on short carpet is a problem!  I'm including a picture comparing the buttons on both heaters to show the design difference.  It is easily resolved if you know about it or non existent if you have hard floors.The second issue that is the cycling noise it makes turning on and off to control the room temperature.  It isn't extremely loud, really is unavoidable, but is noticeable.  My concern is that it may wake a baby or whomever may be sleeping in the room.  Beyond this small concern, the heater does a wonderful job at maintaining the temperature of the room.The remote is easy to link up and operate.  I had it set near my chair and the heater turned off and on, rather frequently, to keep fluctuations to a minimum.  I didn't have any problems with it overheating or tripping breakers and our desktop computer and a small light are on the same circuit.  It is a 1200 watt heater, drawing up to 10 amps of current.Included in the box is an informative manual with helpful drawings of how to safely use and clean your Vornadobaby heater.  There is a 5 year ""Happy Parent Guarantee"" of customer satisfaction, a toll free number, a website, and a support email address.I like this heater a lot and recommend it with acknowledgement of the two mentioned concerns.  Four and a half stars.Edit- I have been using this almost daily, sometimes with the remote thermostat, sometimes not.  It seems to be a more effective heater than the other, standard room heater I've pictured with it, as it either has a larger fan or somehow throws more heat.  It has functioned without a problem so far, but for the safety button aforementioned.  Love it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVQBCG9QMAMAG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXH6PFY#wasThisHelpful","RVQBCG9QMAMAG","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had a different brand of drying mat for over 4 years that's a waffle weave beige color microfiber but I like the decorative look of this one.  It's nice that there are different colors to coordinate with your kitchen better, or just to make the task of washing dishes a bit more enjoyable.  Though I have a dish washer for most of our dishes I often wash my pots and pans by hand as well as some things that aren't dishwasher recommended.This is a decent size mat for smaller drying needs.  It's soft and pretty and folds neatly to store when not in use.  The plastic snaps are a great idea to keep it folded for storage. There is a decorative kitchen pattern on one side and a solid color on the other.  More about that later.This Now Designs drying mat soaks up water fast and dries pretty quickly too if you allow air to circulate around it.  I washed it in warm water before using it the first time and there was no fading or shrinkage.  All the stitching remained intact.I'm happy with this mat but wish that they made it with sports motif patterns so that, possibly, I'd get help washing dishes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OJL5PKP4ED34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B18Q7AM#wasThisHelpful","R3OJL5PKP4ED34","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When my True Glow Sonic Pedicure Kit arrived I plugged it in to charge as advised.  The instructions were for a 16 hour charge but the little light was glowing green within 6 so it must have been partially charged at the factory.  I don't have a lot of areas on my feet that are calloused or overly dry as I try to take care of them.  There are a couple of problem areas, however, and I went to work with this on them once it was ready.  I snapped in the coarse softener and started out on high setting.  I was pretty underwhelmed with the results.  I continued for about a minute longer on that area and, still seeing little change, I then hit my heel, where it appeared to have more of an effect.  My overall reaction was to be less than impressed.To earn space on my bathroom counter and a plug, a device needs to be indispensable, which this is not.  I have an epilator set that includes a rotating stone callous head that is much more quickly effective than this tool that's designed specifically for foot care.  This Conair Pedicure Kit is gentler, and with continued use will eventually do the job, but with much more time and effort on my part.  The brush feels nice and cleans my feet but, again, isn't so wonderful that I feel I need this appliance.I love my sonic toothbrush but this pedicure kit, not so much.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KKL533CBCR2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CE2JVC#wasThisHelpful","R3KKL533CBCR2X","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just received this Ravenna patio furniture cover and put it on our table and chair set.  It fits well and covers all pieces nicely.  I love the corner hold down straps and the elastic bungeee cord on both ends that tighten to fit the cover to our set.  It was a little breezy when I put it on and it held securely once I fastened everything down.  The test will be when we get heavier winds throughout the fall and winter months.  Hopefully, the baffles will release enough air to not take it all airborne, as the wind has pushed the rather heavy chairs around in the past.This is a very nice looking, large cover that has good provisions for fitting and holding onto various sized table and chair sets. It is has a 4 year limited warranty against defects in materials and construction.  I like it a lot but will reserve one star until I see how it performs.  I'll update my review after some months have passed.11-15  We've had some 40 mph winds over the last month and my patio set has moved across the deck but the cover remains in place.  Rain pools in the center, as would be expected, but it drains over the course of 24 hours or so, if not dumped manually.  I'm expecting good things by my recent experiences but my rating would only go up at this point.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JV1EA7NGMWKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MTZFCG#wasThisHelpful","R2JV1EA7NGMWKG","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This 100% cotton oven mitt and pocket-potholder set is pretty and bright.  It washes well per directions, without fading, and offers good protection for standard cooking tasks.  Instructions are to wash before use.  The material thickens and fluffs up after washing and drying.  It also seemed to shrink a bit but it does stretch out again with use.  They are made well and I'd say the mitt fits most women's hands and small to medium men's hands.  It is long enough to protect over half of my forearm as well, which is nice.  The mitt is usable on either hand as it's padded the same on both sides.  The potholder is padded more heavily on the large side but the outer pocket has one layer of padded cloth on it too.Being all cotton, you do need to be aware that it will scorch or burn if close to flames or excessive and consistent high heat.  Silicone or Kevlar are better selections for high heat or grilling types of uses but they require some sort of additional padding inside to protect your skin too.  I've done some research on oven mitts recently while looking for a gift for my son and found that you will pay much more for high heat protective oven/grill mitts, but that's worth the investment for safety in those applications.  These work well for standard, around the kitchen type use, and there are many color selections to coordinate with your decor!They are made in India.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RIZRIJXAZYNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WRI8I0#wasThisHelpful","R2RIZRIJXAZYNY","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, wow!  These chips are addictive!  I love the black bean and sesame flavors, the little bit of salt, and the amazing crunch!The chips are a generous size and arrived in better shape than many of the other types of chips I get at the local store. They are all natural, cholesterol, gluten, and trans fat free, and made without MSG or artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.  With 10 chips as a serving size, you'd think that you wouldn't be satisfied but, surprisingly, they are quite filling and I was!I love the flavor enough to be happy eating them by themselves but suggested dips are hummus, white bean, and spinach artichoke, which all sound pretty yummy.  I think they'd be great with guacamole too.  Substituting these for a corn chip or other, less healthful-type chips would be a plus at any snack or mealtime.  The 4 grams of fiber and protein per serving are unexpected and welcome additions to your diet compared to most popular chips.

"This is a heavy duty and really useful convertible hand truck/utility cart.  We've owned it for a couple of months now and it's saved our backs, time, and strength numerous times.  We're doing some construction on our property so it was a practical purchase for us at this time but I anticipate it's usefulness and durability for the next few decades, at least.It is easily convertible from the hand truck to the cart and the smooth flatbed helps move loads securely as well as more conveniently.  The tires move over even uneven ground quite well.  I did not experience the extreme odor that many have mentioned, even when it was new.  After 2 months, I went to check on it in our garage again just to verify this and I could only smell the tires if I put my nose within a foot of them, and I am usually quite sensitive to odors.  Maybe ours was older stock but I never felt that the smell was unusual or off-putting.  I love the cart and highly recommend it if you're considering purchasing one.11-21-15 - We have used this numerous times since I wrote the initial review.  I'd guess we use it as a cart the most to move heavier things over distances that would be a strain to carry.  I've moved large trash cans in the shop, odd sized packages, and just the other day, my husband moved the metal guards from our combine for cleaning.  It's saved our backs over and over again.

"I purchased two pair of these as potential gifts as the price had been greatly discounted.  I've bought Myia Passiello jewelry in the past and have been very pleased with the quality.  These do not disappoint.They came individually wrapped in tissue paper, inside a small plastic bag, inside of the attractive and padded presentation box.  The stones are clear and sparkly and the gold plated metal is sturdy and lovely.  All of the four earrings were intact and lovely and I'm thrilled with them!  I hope the recipient will be as well.  They are a nice sized stone that looks believably like it could be a diamond, in my opinion.I would rate them 5 stars but will not until I know how they wear and their durability.

"This is a really lovely pendant.  I have the set and received the earrings first, before the pendant, and since receiving it, I truly love them more.The design is rich-looking and it is well made.  The 18 inch chain is dainty, yet strong enough to hold this good-sized pendant.  It's not really heavy, or too large.  I have heavier murano glass pendants that are just slightly larger so this is a comfortable pendant to wear.  It was easy to put on as well, unlike some tiny spring-ring clasps.  I wish that they would use a lobster claw clasp though, especially at this price point.  They are much easier to work with especially if you don't have someone handy to help.I'm including some pictures so you can see the set together.  The teardrops are all the same size.  At first I thought the earrings were slightly smaller but they are the same. The pendant just has an extra drop link.This looks great with a red and black print outfit that I have.

"This is a very good multi-size pencil sharpener for a classroom or home.  It's fast, relatively quiet, and stops when the pencil is sharp so you don't waste your pencils.  The shaving tray is large and empties easily and there are suction cups to hold it to a flat surface so that it doesn't walk away while sharpening.  It even has a soft, blue lighted rim around the pencil size selector that glows to indicate when your pencil is sharpened and, it also looks pretty cool.Fifty dollars seems a bit steep for an electric pencil sharpener but most of them don't accommodate six different sizes of pencils.  If you don't need this capability, or ever think you will, then you'll probably be happier with one that costs less. This will do the job it's designed for efficiently and quickly if you do.  It's ""tool-free removable cutter cartridge"" makes it easy to clean or replace, if needed, prolonging the life of the unit.I haven't used it on all the sizes of pencils yet but I am impressed with this sharpener as many times as I've used it.

"With all the good reviews, I was expecting this roll-on oil to at least have a discernible scent.  When it arrived, it was packaged well and had plastic tape around the cap so it didn't leak.  After I opened it, however, the oil leaked out the cap badly so it was not transportable in a purse or suitcase, if that is what you'd planned.  The scent was weak even before applying it and after 10-15 minutes, indiscernible on my forearm. I applied more but it just didn't last.  So, I pried off the roll top and added a few drops of my own essential oils so it's not a complete waste.Basically, I have a $10, ten milliliter bottle of fractionated coconut oil.

"My husband has had two pair of these shoes in the past three years and wears them once or twice a week to work, where he has a desk job.  He likes the fit and look of the shoe and it fits in with the dressy-casual expectation of his office.  I expected the Cole Haan product quality would be better than other, lesser priced, retail shoes that are available, which would justify the cost.  This has not been the case, however, and it took two pair to teach us this lesson.The problem is that the sole has worn through on both pair quite quickly, much faster than any other shoes that he owns, and he owns a lot of shoes.  If you look up on Cole Haan's website, they do offer a repair service, but it costs almost as much, or as much, as a new pair of shoes.

"Simple Oatmeal chocolate chip bars are pretty tasty.  The chocolate is very evident in the bar that is soft, chewy, and quite satisfying.  With 10 grams of protein per bar and gluten-free rolled oats, they have staying power to help you feel fuller for a longer time than many bars with less protein.I try to keep one in my purse to snack on if I'm out and unable to stop for lunch.  It keeps me from grabbing junk food or being famished by the time I do eat, causing me to overeat or make poor choices.  They are nice and handy to have between meals as well rather than donuts or candy bars.  Of course, fruit is always a good between meal snack too, but when you're craving chocolate, these are a reasonable and satisfying choice.With 8 grams of fat, (4 of these saturated), 10 grams of sugar, and only 1 gram of fiber, these can hardly be called health food, but with 180 calories per bar, they aren't a bad choice either.  Plus, they taste quite good!The only small issue I notice is that the texture is a little grainy, from the soy, I imagine.  It's not a deal breaker for me but I do notice it.

"This is my first George Foreman grill.  I've always thought that they would be a good appliance to own but just never purchased one.  I sort of figured that it would be another appliance to take up counter and/or storage space in my kitchen and wouldn't be worth it. I can say now that I've owned it for a few weeks, that I was wrong.  I love this thing!It heats up quite quickly and saves a lot of time cooking as well. The grill plate is large enough to hold 4 third pound burger patties, six slightly flattened boneless chicken breasts, or four breasts cut into tenders.  You need no extra fat or grease when cooking and the meats come out looking nice and brown with grill marks.  Fats and extra liquids drain into the included pan and there is little or no splattering as when you fry things in a skillet.  It cooks quickly and the meats retain moisture too.  It has earned it's spot on my counter top and I don't bother putting it away as I'm using so often.It's been easy to clean up too.  I leave it open to cool once the meat is done and it cools in 10 minutes or less. You push a button on the side of either the top or bottom to release the plate and I rinse them off before putting in the dishwasher or soak them a little while and wash them by hand.  Either way, they have been easy to clean.  They are very non-stick, which is nice when cooking as well.The cord is a minimally useful length but I've not had trouble with it.  I have a lot of convenient outlets in my kitchen, however, and can see how it could make it difficult if a kitchen didn't.  The slide temp control has been easy for me to use.  Most things I'm grilling I want on medium to high anyway and it's easy to slide up or down as needed.I've learned that the best thing to do is to have your meats seasoned and ready to go before you place them on the grill as, once you open it, you'll want to place the meat and close it as quickly as possible to retain the heat.  When I was cooking the tenders it took me quite a while to place them all on the grill and I did lose more heat than I wished.  It heats back up quite quickly but a little of the sear was initially lost from the top.  I was still happy with the results but I'm learning these things as I go.I'm excited to keep trying new things with this grill.  I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQKWJY02QYLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","R3CQKWJY02QYLA","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I'm a bass lover from way back and I felt that it was adequate and true. I suppose if you need more, you'll have to modify the track before you add it to your library.For the current price of this little gem, I feel it is fair and possibly the best in it's price range.

"I have a newer home with a central vac system that includes two ""electric dustpans"" that suck up residue that you sweep into it with your broom.  I have one in the kitchen and the other in the garage foyer/drop area.  I wish that I had one in the master bath as this area collects a lot of hair and dust and needs to be cleaned more often.  I love my central vac but it's a chore to pull out the vacuum head and it's long hose just to clean this area and a broom or dust mop doesn't get it as well.  Enter the ""Swiffer Sweep and Vac"", which works perfectly on this tile floor, is compact to store, and quick and easy to use.I've used it a few times now, after charging once, on that floor as well as the other hard surface floors in our home.  It's held it's charge and I've not had to recharge it yet!  The pad does get dirty but I run it over the carpet to dislodge the dust bunnies and then use the vac to clean afterwards.  This cleans the cloth somewhat and extends it's life.  When it gets completely soiled, I'll toss it and put in a new one.  The combination of the vac and dust pad is great at picking up dust, hair, and small debris quickly.It's very easy to empty the dust cup but the filter can be a pain.  You have to pick the dirt off and out of the many crevices if you really want it clean and the dust bunnies stick like lint on velcro!  There has to be an easier way.  I have used a cleaning toothbrush, which helps, so something like that would be nice to include with the kit.Other than that, I have only one major complaint.  The positioning of the on/off switch is aggravating!  I have inadvertently turned it off many times while vacuuming as it's placement is too close to where my hand holds the handle.  Maybe it's me, but I can't think that I am that unique.I like my new Swiffer Floor Vac a lot!  It has it's limitations but is certainly handy for quick clean ups between full blown vacuumings.  I hope it lasts and I will update with any issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJ5628PIAE8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YBP7CTW#wasThisHelpful","RZJ5628PIAE8M","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been admiring these these and a few other pieces of Asscher cut jewelry for awhile now.  I finally ordered these and received them today.  They are lovely!They are a bit on the larger side though, for a somewhat believable stone.  The information was confusing about their carat weight.  The page heading said 2 cttw, implying 1 carat each, and the specifications below stated they were 6 cttw, or 3 carats each, which I would say is correct.  I've gotten 3 ct cubic zirconias before in a princess cut and these do not look as big.  I assume this is due to the Asscher cut being a deeper stone than a princess cut one.  They measure about 5/16 square, a bit bigger than the 1/4 inch another reviewer mentioned.  That all considered, they are a beautifully cut stone and have a great deal of sparkle, especially when light is directed at them.The post is just slightly offset on the backs so they will drop below my earlobe in one position.  I have short lobes though and everyone may not have this happen.  The other issue is that they are heavy and tend to fall forward.  I replaced the backs with a silver bullet clutch with pad and this holds them more upright and tightly and improves the positioning immensely.  I recommend this for anyone that purchases these and have used the padded bullet clutches with other ""crown-type"" set earrings.  You can find them here, on Amazon, or in most department stores for only a few dollars.These earrings appear to be sturdily made and the platinum plated sterling silver setting is super shiny and won't tarnish.. I like them a lot!  Four and a half stars with a half star off for the puny backs.Time to shop for some other Asscher cut pieces to go with these!10-27-15-  I added a couple pictures to compare to the size of a dime and with the backs I suggested.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WR5RD7TNV0RN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRIJ8PI#wasThisHelpful","R2WR5RD7TNV0RN","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nature's Truth Eucalyptus essential oil is the first product I've had from this company so I decided to do a little research and visited their website. I found that their company has been in business for over 40 years and that their focus has been on high quality vitamins and supplements, until they recently expanded into a line of premium essential oils for aromatherapy. They state that they collect materials from around the world for their products and they are located in Ronkonkoma, NY..I've only begun to use essential oils in the past year so I have been reading lots of information about their production, product qualities, and uses. This oil is stated to be 100% pure and for external use only. It should be diluted prior to use on the skin, 5 drops oil to 10 ml base oil for massage. It has a wonderful aroma that clears my sinuses and invigorates me.I mixed it with lavender oil and a base oil to make an insect repellent that smells amazing to us but keeps the little pests at bay. Eucalyptus oil has so many wonderful uses as an antiseptic and respiratory aid as well!l am impressed with Natures Truth eucalyptus oil and look forward to trying some of their other oils when they are available. The company website states that they stand behind their products and guarantee customer satisfaction 100 percent. The information on the box states that it is gluten and paraben free.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RETIH38G68JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X47H14E#wasThisHelpful","R1RETIH38G68JK","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Women's Relaxed Fit Original All Day Pants are very comfortable and have classic style.  They fit at the waist and are a bit roomier through the thigh.  This is not the most flattering cut for me but may be for many women.  The material has a little stretch to it as well so they do remain comfortable all day, as the name states.They washed well and come out of the dryer wearable, though I would prefer to iron them for best looks.  The length was perfect for medium and the size possibly tending toward slightly small, though they do stretch out with movement.

"These are quite pretty, shiny,10k gold hoop earrings.  Mine are a generous 3/4 inch hoop and about 2mm wide (about 1/16 inch).  They are quite a narrow hoop, but they do make the most of their size with a lot of light-catching surfaces from the many diamond cuts.  They are very lightweight, so much so that you'll easily forget you're wearing them, but they appear to be made well and the post fastens firmly into the notch.  Because I've lost a few precious hoop earrings in the past, I still like to put a clear plastic ear back on behind the ear as extra security in case I accidentally catch one on something.The only reason I'm subtracting a half star is my personal preference for a more substantial gold hoop.  I find no fault with these earrings but can't say that I'd choose them over a wider surfaced one.  The diameter of these small hoops is fine at 3/4+ inch but I would like a more noticeable body, either in width or depth, something more visible.They were delivered in a bubble pack mailing bag with the cotton-padded cardboard presentation box taped shut. The earrings were in a plastic bag inside a little blue ""velvet"" pouch inside the taped box.  Even if they'd been smashed in transport, I think they would have come through okay, though it wasn't really an impressive box if giving as a gift.I could find no marks on these other than 10k stamp on the posts.If a delicate, lightweight, gold hoop with lots of sparkle is what you're looking for, I can recommend these.

"I purchased this for my 9 ear old granddaughter's 10 inch tablet for her birthday.  It was quickly shipped and arrived promptly, as expected.The artwork is bright and beautiful and the seams appear well done.  The softly padded case zips across the top where the handles meet.  There is plenty of room for her to put in her tablet comfortably with maybe 1/2 to an inch of space to spare around it.  The little pocket on the front is handy for ear-buds, a stylus, or her charger, though a bit shallow for anything too ""fat"".  She's attached the shoulder strap and carries it that way.  She loves it and I hope it will keep her tablet safe for a long time.It did have a rubbery scent on arrival but it wasn't horribly strong.

"I just received these today and I am so pleased with them!  I ordered the 18k gold plated, 2 cttw earrings and they truly do sparkle and shine!  At the current price of less than ten dollars, they have to be the steal of the day!  I would have been thrilled if I'd paid twice as much, and they've even gone down a bit since I ordered them.  The pictures don't do them justice.  The CZ stones are perfectly clear and the gold plating lovely.They are delicately made with the wire wrapping around the CZ stone to form the basket setting that holds it but seem solidly mounted just the same.  The posts are long enough and, though not the sturdiest I've ever had, seem strong enough if you use common care.  The 18k gold plating looks lovely.  I hope it lasts.Again, at under ten dollars, they are a steal!  They would make great little gifts that look like you paid much more!

"These 100% cotton dish towels by DII are attractive and decorative with extra attention given to cloth detail.  The design is quite elegant, the colors are rich, and they are finished nicely with a rolled hem.  The designs are all woven into the fabric rather than printed on so they will remain permanently.They come with ""special care"" instruction, however, which may make them impractical for daily use to many.  They are to be washed in cold water-gentle cycle, and may be tumble dried on low.  A low iron may be used as well, to remove the inevitable wrinkles of this type of cotton material.  I doubt many will take the time to use special care to clean their dish towels, and most would not care to iron them either.  I iron a lot, as my husband's work shirts usually require it and, as a rule, don't look for more things to iron.  I did iron these though, as I wanted to see how they responded after washing.  The few wrinkles remaining after drying came out well and the towels look beautiful, but they have shrunk to 26"" z 17 1/2"" even after ironing.  They certainly aren't the most absorbent towels you can find, either, but I would place at around average absorbency for this type of woven cotton fabric.  I hope the statement is true that they become more absorbent with additional washings.  The wrinkling often diminishes with more washings as well but time will tell.My determination is that these are lovely towels that you might likely use for special occasions or simply as decoration in your kitchen.  They are also absorbent but the special care instructions may discourage regular use.  They are currently reasonably priced at around four-plus dollars each so are quite affordable.I like them a lot, in spite of the extra-care effort required, and hope they hold up with continued use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EGX8KS7P45LI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DU6UMWM#wasThisHelpful","R2EGX8KS7P45LI","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Maidenform bra is very comfortable and attractive.  I love the black lace overlay over the beige cups.  The material for the back strap is soft and silky feeling and it gives a luxurious, sensual component to this supportive undergarment.

"This is a very comfortable bra, especially when wearing it with the straps straight.  It's almost feels like you don't have a bra on, which is also a problem in the support and discretion areas. With the straps crossed, it provides a little more support up front, but it is less comfortable and also causes back fat bulging.  What a choice to have to make!When I first put this bra on, I noticed that the sheer area caused yet another bulge where I didn't want it.  After washing and trying it again, it was less obvious but still is noticeable at times. A bra called, ""One Smooth U"" should be expected to give you a smooth look, but this falls short in that area as well as the more obvious one.  EVERYTHING shows!  Without adding petals or some kind of nipple covers, everyone will see you coming in all but the thickest of tops.This bra is made well, with three fastening hooks and three adjustments for fit.  I feel that it's generous in size for a 36.  The straps, though not padded, are very comfortable and the slides have stayed put for me so far.  It offers good overall coverage and the underwire comes up quite high on the sides which helps to hold you in, though it has poked me in certain positions.  I've never experienced that with my other underwired bras.To summarize, I love the comfort of this bra, even with the rare poke from the side underwire.  I need greater support, however, to feel that I look my best in public and in sheerer tops.  This is listed as ""ultra light"" so it gets a pass from me on that and delivers many great features in comfort and smoothing coverage when the straps are straight.  Just be aware that you'll need additional efforts to remain ""discrete"" unless you want that type of attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26BIF8C2U2FM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAC10A8#wasThisHelpful","R26BIF8C2U2FM9","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been using microfiber cloths for cleaning for probably a decade now and love them for their special characteristics of absorbancy and being lint and streak free.  They work great for dusting and are easily cleaned in the washer, ready to go again.  I've never used them for drying dishes, however, or for regular kitchen use.  These pretty, colorfully printed DII towels have broadened my scope of thinking as to their many more practical uses.I got the ""wine lattice"" 16 x 24 inch towels and love them.  At the risk of sounding like a commercial, they are so pretty that they make cleaning a little more fun.  They came through the wash without fading or shrinking and were put right to use drying dishes.  I've used mostly cotton towels up until now and didn't think anything could be better.  These towel suck up water and clean our granite counters fast, and dry quickly as well.  Remember not to use fabric softener to retain their absorbancy and, if possible, wash them with less-linty loads as they pick that up too.Currently, at about two dollars a towel, these are a deal.  With twelve in a package, you'll have enough to keep handy wherever you need them around the house.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23D70Z076HD6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRQ4S36#wasThisHelpful","R23D70Z076HD6C","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had the Fellowes 49C Cross Cut Paper Shredder now for about 2 weeks and have used it numerous times in our home office.  We've been without a shredder for a couple of years since our last one died.  Perhaps we needed to oil it more, as directed in the user instructions included with this unit, with each waste paper removal using a non-aerosol vegetable oil.  This helps to keep it running reliably, smoothly, and more quietly.  All appliances need proper maintenance to keep running at peak performance.  Live and learn. . .(sigh).This is a nice, compact, little unit that fits easily under a desk, table, or counter and, so far, has gobbled up everything I've thrown at it, quickly and with ease.  I've intentionally put numerous sheets of paper, multiple envelopes of junk mail, full and empty, plastic credit cards, and various thicknesses of paper through it without any slowing or jamming.  It's capabilities are listed as ""paper, credit cards, staples, and paper clips"".  ""It will not shred continuous forms, CD/DVDs, adhesive labels, transparencies, newspaper, cardboard, laminates, X-rays, or plastic other than as noted earlier"".  It is rated for ""medium"" use, suitable for home offices and a max of 8 sheets of paper at once.  The waste bin holds 4 gallons.This is a heavy-headed unit.  It may be difficult for weaker people to empty or move.  I wish that it had better handles or latches on the waste bin as it comes apart quite easily when lifting or moving.  This is good when you want to empty it but bad if you didn't intend to!  Other than that, I have no complaints about it yet.  I don't think the noise when operating is that bad.  It sounds like a shredder to me and doesn't last that long if you're not shredding a lot of stuff.  It's stated to shred for five minutes before shutting off to cool down.I like the feature of a safety lock as we do occasionally have children in our home, though not on a daily basis.  We just need to remember to lock it when we do!There is a on year warranty on this product with a three year warranty on the cutter.So far, I'm pleased with it's performance but will update my review if I have problems or more to add.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BEZRMLAVFLQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DLRLFSU#wasThisHelpful","R2BEZRMLAVFLQB","A26BU3ZU0R5IPF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26BU3ZU0R5IPF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I ordered these for my aging mother that has had some issues with incontinence.  She likes them a lot and says that they are quite comfortable.  They give her a feeling of security while not being bulky or difficult to deal with like some other products that use tape or glues to position.

They are low cut and didn't seem to fit right around the legs or crotch.  I think someone my size would need the larger size.My mother mentioned that she wished that they were a little higher in the back for when she wears them at night.

"Both the flutophone, and the songflute are very close brothers.They share the same volume body, same fingerholds, and same materials, and both are tuned to the key of C, and both are about as loud as the other volume wise.Both have extrusions on where the fingerholes for easier playing, and the same distance of the fingerholes from the soundhole.Both have 7 top holes and one bottom hole, although the flutophone has an eight hole right next to the low C, to play the C#.The differences are minute.While Selmer's songflute is more basic and cheaper made, it has better finger positions, curved with the hand. The Flutophone's holes are more straight (in line), like on a recorder flute.To play a low C# on the songflute, one has to halfway remove the pinky from the tonehole, which can be tricky, while the Flutophone has an extra hole there for the C#. This does not affect playability in any way, as it's just as hard to play the C# on either one of the flutes, and the extra hole isn't felt anyway.The Flutophone has a wider, but more narrow mouthpiece by a millimeter or two, resulting in slightly less airflow, but a more defined tone (like a recorder, bright, clear tone), while the Songflute has a higher airflow, resulting in more wind noises and more body, a bit more sounding like an occarina.The flutophone is longer, partly because the mouthpiece is longer, but also because it has an added bell on the bottom for projection of sound. I'm quite sure without this bell, the songflute would have been the louder flute.The Flutophone, though clearly the higher quality made instrument, surprisingly was off on the low D by as much as 25ct or more! The songflute pretty much was tuned correctly. This is a bit of a bummer for this more beautiful instrument to be off tonewise, although only on one note.Overall, I would say that the cheaper Songflute from Selmer is an easier instrument to play, and is correct tonal wise.The Flutophone is the nicer looking instrument, being dualtone color.Either one are great flutes to learn on, but the tonal error on the flutophone, and it's slightly higher price are reason for me to give one star off.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WM9DDI9J0QZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EEHFC8#wasThisHelpful","R2WM9DDI9J0QZH","A3N0P5AAMP6XD2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N0P5AAMP6XD2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not too fond of this spot light!1- it's actually only 3W. Not 5W at 110V. Perhaps at 220V it could come close to 5W, but they should mention that. Even at its brightest setting white, it's 3W.On the positive side, this nightlight can get really dim. At 0.5W, as measured by my killawatt meter, it's perfect even for light sensitive individuals as a nightlight!2- the colors aren't evenly distributed. White doesn't look white, but a mix of red, green and blue and turquoise on the ceiling/floor, depending on how you aim it.Overall it appears to be white, but when you look at it, it is just a mix of colors.The spot light has a very narrow beam, and isn't meant to be hung in a lampshade, since the lampshade won't light up.It just points a 1ft radius light over 5ft length roughly measured.I much would recommend the slightly more expensive bulb 'B007V1VOI8' (search amazon without the brackets), or, go for the standard/3W frosted bulb.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ETN4PVRXZNA4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009UZD81Y#wasThisHelpful","R3ETN4PVRXZNA4","A3N0P5AAMP6XD2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N0P5AAMP6XD2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the money it's a great buy!It uses between 0.9W on the darkest setting of red, to 1.1W on the darkest setting of green.When dialed up, it uses about 3W when mixing 2 colors, and 4W at its brightest white setting, all measured with a killawatt meter.I believe the 5W power rating is only for 220V settings.At it's lowest setting, it is a great night light for a bedroom.2 to 3 settings brighter, is great as ambiance light, to change the mood (aka for more romantic settings).4 of these evenly distributed in a master bedroom are amazing!At its brightest setting it might be good for a teenager/youth's basement or camp or so, as it is pretty bright to look at.Also excellent as camping light for trailers or tents with access to ac power!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8TNG74CJZWGA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007V1VOI8#wasThisHelpful","R8TNG74CJZWGA","A3N0P5AAMP6XD2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N0P5AAMP6XD2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have the A1s ABS, just like on the picture.Didn't order from Amazon.Sounds like a sax, just a little harsher, and more plasticky. Meaning, less bright or high frequencies, more high mid and mid frequencies, and less lows.Great for accoustic band play or orchestra. But this sax is less loud than most metal saxes I own (does not have resonators in the valves).I presume the silicone caps absorb some of the volume (about 20%).It's very lightweight, could be played without strap (thumb would get as tired as neck does with a strapped metal sax).Though you see romantic images of sax players in the ocean, this sax has metal springs and screws/bolts that could corrode, so no salty ocean water playing.Sounds great amplified in a band.The plastic mouthpiece is playable, but can be improved upon.I suggest your mouthpiece of choice.I also not suggest using a plastic reed on this when playing by yourself, as plastic reed on a plastic sax sounds too much of the high mid frequencies adding up on each other. It may actually sound better in some band play situations, but doesn't sound good by itself.Higher regions sound a bit flat, a quarter of a note, so you'd have to squeeze the reed hard, to get the tone right in the upper register.One star off for this.Great for beginners, and intermediates.I don't see pros using this live or in a studio, but it might be a great backup sax to own, or as travel instrument, or for the small gigs.Quality wise, $300-500 is a great price for this instrument!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KJ5WCG1LAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00772OULY#wasThisHelpful","R25KJ5WCG1LAZ","A3N0P5AAMP6XD2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N0P5AAMP6XD2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, I would give it a three and a half star. It has a small reflective sticker on the back, and reflective strips on the side.The boots fit great for people with wider feet, and still look like not overly big shoes.These boots are great for city riding, and urban riding, but I would not use them on the tracks.The boots are exactly as pictured, unlike another reviewer commented. On the picture there is a label in between both boots.Pros:About half the price of regular motorcycle bootsseem sturdyankle joint and shinbone protection, and the use of sturdy (tire-like) rubber soles and side fabrichas reflector strips on themWater (rain) proof (not ocean proof).In quality very similar to my $120 boots, but easier to get into.They have an extra leather patch where the gear shifter touches the boots.Aside from the shinbone fabric, I would give this a 4.5 star.The discomfort of the fabric brings it down 1 star.Cons:inside the boot there's a fabric pushing on my shinbone.

"The good:- Very crisp detail- works well in portrait mode as secondary monitor of my main 13"" 1280x800 monitor- Has brightness controls, that can set it to pretty dark, for dark places, and bright enough to read at full daylight (not in full sun)-Has a main stand that also acts as a screen protector when stowed away.- Plug and playable- Looks good, both the image quality, as the product.- Very portable, and looks good with a brix pc!Cons:- Too low resolution. Does not work well with modern operating systems as a primary monitor (Win Vista or beyond).- Driver doesn't have the option to increase display input resolution (eg: do 1024x600 on an 800x480pix screen, to make it useable under Windows.- I'm personally not too fond of the rubber flap on the back to insert the mini usb cable. It looks awkward.- The display only has 1 setting horizontal and vertical. It easily could have been given an extra angle in both landscape and portrait mode!Notes:When using it as a primary monitor, make sure the display setting is configured to output 800x480 pix, 16 or 32 bit, 60hz.

"It gets 2 stars, because I'm all for newer technology, newer materials, newer products and stuff, but it doesn't have to come with the con I experienced on this.First of all, the trumpet sounds really like a trumpet. A little more mellow, and a bit more mid tones, but that's perfectly fine with me.It can produce plenty of brights if you want it to!The plastic mouthpiece does give it more of a 'plasticky tone', easily remedied by replacing it with your mouthpiece of choice.Amazon sells sub $10 mouthpieces that will improve the sound a bit from the plastic ones, and sound really good.Lots of people mentioned the trumpet had sticking valves, I did not immediately experience it, but from time to time, the valve wouldn't go up completely. Allora guarantees that with use, this will go away, and looking at the instrument, I think I can trust them on that.The weight is very light weight.You can play it in icy cold, or scorching hot summer heat, with the instrument pretty much feeling and sounding the same.Allora has been upgrading their trumpets, and I have to say, unlike the Vibrato Sax, or the Pbone, this instrument can sound very close to the real thing!So why only 2 stars then?Well, upon investigation, I found that the valve caps and lids where very weak.Initially I was afraid for those who clean their instruments regularly, that they will wear out the valve cap seal, and that the plastic would get loose.practice however showed that one of the pins, holding the valvecaps in their place, broke off.And I think it's an engineering design error with this product!The valve caps aren't meant to be opened and closed frequently, or if it's up to me, not opened at all!The valve caps really needed to be made out of metal as well, or screwed on, with threads like a nut and bolt.Once a valve cap breaks off, the instrument is basically to be thrown away.Anything could be a cause, like the rubber gasket could get stuck there, too much force can easily be applied there, a small bump with an object, and the valve cap can break, and you can throw away the instrument, because it is non-replaceable (valves housing and valve cap holders are glued to the main body of the trumpet).If a valve cap breaks itself, I guess it's possible to get a replacement, but not for the lids that hold the valvecap.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CFZTNCMITS76/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q7049KY#wasThisHelpful","R1CFZTNCMITS76","A3N0P5AAMP6XD2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N0P5AAMP6XD2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Picked one of these up for my six year old yesterday and I was pretty impressed with the overall quality of this gun. It's small, for one. Sort of like a Derringer but not quite so tiny. You have to cock the mechanism (just a pull lever that clicks in to place at the bottom of the handle) for each of the three shots but this thing has got some serious range on it! I'm not talking one end of a football field to another but enough that you can get into some intense firefights from 40-50 feet away from each other. If you're looking for a simple dart gun that can get the job done, I cannot recommend this one enough.NOTE:-You may want to get the protective glasses for yourself or for any younger kids using this. Not only does this thing have range but the darts could probably cause some damage to someone if they take a dart to the eye at close range.

"I am completely geeking out over this thing. This Needler gun, a staple of the Halo games on Xbox since the very first release, is a scale model dart gun that's pretty spot on in terms of looks. It comes packaged with sixteen darts, eight of which get loaded on the top (and thanks to the built in lights on the gun itself, they actually glow) and the other eight get loaded into the cylinder where they fire from. It also comes with a sticky target for target practice.The gun doesn't work exactly like it does in the game where you hold the trigger down and out comes this steady stream of needles that stick to your target and then explode but I mean, that's pretty much a logistical impossibility. Still, the gun itself is pretty awesome and these darts have a decent range of flight once you start firing them. They also fire with enough force that you should definitely think twice before letting small children play with it.I think any Halo fan would appreciate this gun and the attention to detail that was applied to it.

"No complaints here whatsoever. Both films look spectacular and the DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio tracks are even better. Bad Boys 2 especially looks really good, finally making its long awaited debut on Blu. The audio is ridiculous, giving your surround sound system a proper workout. This is definitely one of the more active sound mixes I've heard for a film and with the amount of action these films have, you're sure to be pleased. Most of the extras are carry overs from the DVDs but there's a lot of stuff to pore through with the Bad Boys 2 disc having the more interesting selection. The discs come in their own individual cases housed in a flimsy slip cover but also come included with Ultraviolet codes for each film. Fans of the boys should be very happy with this presentation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JUB23WE04ATE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DFI7NI#wasThisHelpful","R1JUB23WE04ATE","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"UBISoft delivers with accurate recreations of four of Hasbro's most popular board games: Monopoly, Risk, Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble. The graphics and sound are terrific across the board and the animations employed across the four games make the boards seem almost like living environments. There's online functionality across all the games and customization options are pretty robust. All in all, this one makes for a great family friendly multiplayer game, especially in a gaming household. Only requires one controller in case that's all you have, which is a nice touch.

"DC Trip is an interesting book. It reads like a young adult novel intended for adults, with moments and dialogue that seem to be a perfect fit for a Mean Girls type of film and then all of a sudden, switches gears at intervals to make way for moments of explicit sexual details that make the read a bit jarring at times. It's kind of like Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great with sex and frank discussions about the subject thrown into it.Now don't get me wrong, I'm not some kind of prude and I love that kind of stuff but it almost feels out of place in the book due to the way the book reads for the majority of it. I'd be a fool to say that today's teens don't talk the way that the teens in this tale do (and even worse, I'm sure... I mean, I WAS a teen myself way back when) but if you're easily horrified at the idea of teens eating pot cookies or talking about sex in any way, shape or form, you may want to rethink this one.Now while I wouldn't necessarily say that the general subject matter of this book is the kind of thing that I gravitate towards, I found Ms. Benincasa's writing to be refreshing and above all, very honest. You get the feeling that a lot of what you're reading is coming direct from the author's heart and soul and as corny as that sounds, it made me feel more involved with what was happening and the characters themselves, who are all endearing in their own individual ways. I put this book down feeling like I had a good sense of what the author must be like in real life and judging from her Twitter account, I don't think I'm off the mark on that observation at all.If it sounds like I'm confused, I'll be honest with you and say that I am. I can truly say that I've never read a book quite like this one. It's quite frankly the most adult young adult novel I've ever read but again, Sara Benincasa's writing and the lighthearted, honest nature of the way the story flows made this a compelling book for me and one that kind of took me back to those days when things were a little more carefree and a class trip could lead to unexpected places and realizations. Give this one a shot, I think you might like it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BSZJ2WRHPHAE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0996066632#wasThisHelpful","R1BSZJ2WRHPHAE","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Epson Home Cinema 1040 delivers with stunning color and brightness wrapped up in a crystal clear 1080p picture. Two HDMI ports comes as a welcome addition, allowing you to hook up just about any device you can think of to it. I currently have this projector connected to my Denon receiver, which outputs a bunch of HD sources to it such as my Xbox One, PS3, cable and video cameras and every single one of them look fantastic up on the screen. Unfortunately, while this projector does have the capability to go wireless, you have to pick up a separate piece to do that so I was not able to test out this facet of the projector. In terms of size and weight, it's a little smaller than other projectors I've used and doesn't weigh as much. It's also very easy to mount up on a ceiling mount and gives you plenty of room in positioning the picture. It's actually pretty impressive how much leeway you have in getting the picture to where you want it.All in all, while not as impressive as the much higher end projectors I've used, this one is still worth every penny and comes with enough features and provides enough functionality where you'll be hard pressed to find any fault with it. And again, that picture is just phenomenal.

"My experience with third party controllers usually winds up with me being thoroughly disgusted with them, specifically the sub-par quality they tend to possess. They never seem to match the quality of their first party made counterparts and wind up breaking fairly easily. This Afterglow controller for the Xbox One is leaps and bounds beyond any other third party console controller I've ever used and transcends its somewhat gimmicky nature with a build that is at least the same quality of the controllers that come packaged with the console itself.For starters, the controller itself feels great and comfy in my hands. The sticks feel just as good as the regular first party controllers do and the various bumpers and buttons all feel well placed and responsive. This controller also has an additional two wheel buttons but I'll get into those in a moment.I prefer my controllers to be wireless but I understand why this particular controller has to be wired as the LED lighting would drain a regular set of batteries in minutes I'd presume. The cable is detachable and is pretty long, checking in at ten feet in length. The LED light setup is admittedly cool and is very easy to adjust to your preferences, with the left stick adjusting brightness and the right stick adjusting the color. You can also set up whether you want the controller to light up when it vibrates. The controller comes equipped with a 3.5mm headphone jack which is appreciated but what really makes this inclusion even better is the ability to set the volume levels, not to mention the chat mixer levels, via the controller's D-pad, which is now making me wonder why the standard Xbox One controllers can't do this as well. Negating the need to go to the Xbox One guide to adjust the volume is a pretty impressive little feat.The most interesting aspect of this controller is the inclusion of two wheel buttons on the rear that can be mapped to any button you wish, including joystick clicks. Each wheel can be rolled in two different directions, giving you four settings you can customize to your liking. They're positioned so that the tips of your index fingers rest right on them. So, for example, for Halo 5, I have it set up so that when I roll the right wheel up, I can sprint. Rolling the same wheel down reloads. It's already changed my play style in an unexpected way and it just feels much more intuitive to me. These wheel buttons are pretty cool and caught me completely off guard in regards to how much I'd enjoy using them.All in all, I couldn't find anything wrong with this controller and it went far beyond what I was expecting. The LED light adds kitsch value while the controller design as a whole is both thoughtful and well made in general, with smart additions and great functionality. At the time of this writing, the official Xbox Store app isn't available yet and is supposed to allow you to store custom settings for yourself and other profiles via the Xbox One. As soon as I get some time with that, I'll return to add an addendum to this review but as it stands, you can take this review as a full five star review with my highest recommendations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ANVUCKKOY9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZJRHSRW#wasThisHelpful","R19ANVUCKKOY9R","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of the most stressful yet enjoyable games ever, Operation is back the way you remember it and ready to give all players a stress induced coronary. The game itself is simple, try to remove the maladies inside Cavity Sam without touching the sides of the spaces where the maladies are. Once you touch a side, you're greeted by a loud buzz to inform you that you screwed up. Gives one the same feeling you get playing Jenga, where everyone gets quiet as you try to finesse your moves to get the job done. This one's a classic and rightfully so.

"Interesting overnight drawers set that is basically a pair of undies (they look like undies but feel much more like a pair of swim diapers) that you can insert an absorbent pad into.

"Here's what you need to know. Mad Max: Fury Road, one of the most insane films ever committed to film, comes home on a Blu-Ray that is probably one of the best, if not THE best presentations I've ever seen and this is coming from someone who has seen some gorgeous looking discs. The picture is pretty much flawless. There's a clarity to it that just needs to be seen to be believed. It's like looking at a beautiful hi-res desktop wallpaper that has motion. The sound is also fantastic. The disc comes in a 7.1 Dolby Atmos mix that unfortunately I wasn't able to try since I don't have an Atmos capable receiver. So, in the case of no Atmos capable receiver, the disc down mixes to a Dolby TrueHD lossless mix which is still a very active, thunderous sound mix that puts every speaker in your setup to work, especially your subwoofer. I'm not going to bother summing up the movie for you, other than to say that if you've seen it and you're eager to know how the Blu Ray sizes up, I can't imagine you'll be disappointed.The disc also contains an Ultraviolet (UV) code, a DVD copy and an assortment of production featurettes on the disc itself that are pretty informative. This is a stellar disc and again, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed with the quality of it. If ever a Blu Ray was worthy of being labeled as shiny and chrome, Mad Max: Fury Road is it. Highly. highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDDSFPB0Q2CZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQ13ZSO#wasThisHelpful","RDDSFPB0Q2CZ2","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Really surprised with the sound quality from this Bluetooth speaker considering its size, which really is about the size of a water bottle like the product details inform you. The size makes it perfect for transportation and the casing is made of a solid rubber which keeps it from sliding around and protects it from accidental falls. You can stand it up or lay it on its side. The dynamic light show and its various settings is an added bonus with enough variety to ensure that you'll find a particular display you'll like. Again, the sound on this thing is pretty impressive. There's enough bass that you can properly hear it, unlike many of these other wireless speakers on the market. Just don't expect anything room shattering, it's just enough to make its presence known. The Bluetooth functionality also allows you to answer phone calls from your cell with it, which is nice. Also included is a small tool to change the language setting for the speaker's voice prompts.Kind of disappointed that no AC adapter was included but it does get about ten hours of playtime after three hours of charging with the included USB cable. If you're looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker with decent sound and eye catching design, you'll be happy with this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YPCD8ESVCNM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZXTOJNW#wasThisHelpful","R1YPCD8ESVCNM7","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Gotta give it to Toshiba as this tablet is very nice. I had an issue or two with it but I'll get to that in a second. Also, please note that I received this tablet free for review purposes but rest assured that what you're reading is an honest, no bull review that I'm not being paid or compensated for. Take that as you will.First off, the display is absolutely gorgeous. Everything looks nice and sharp on it and if you really want to see how clear it is, download a nice hi-res photo/ background wallpaper and see for yourself. It's a good size tablet, not too big and not too small. It's a versatile piece of tech and the tablet pen is very responsive and intuitive. The TruNote app included works very well in tandem with it and makes note taking a fun, snazzy little way to stay organized. Battery life is fairly decent so long as you dim the screen brightness a bit and keep background processes running to a minimum. It really is a PC in tablet form so you can do just about anything with this that you can do with a regular PC in terms of performance. There is also a mini-USB port, mini-HDMI and Micro SD slot built in, with the mini USB acting as a charge port. An AC adapter is also included, as well as a wrist strap.The problems I noticed with the tablet were in two specific spots: wireless functionality and in updating to Windows 10. I found the Wi-Fi performance a little spotty. When it worked, it worked great but occasionally, the drivers would just crap out and render me without any internet. After doing a bit of research, this seems to be something of an issue with Toshiba's tablets. The Wi-Fi has been working fine now for the past few days as of this writing but again, I've seen it do some weird things here and again since first using this tablet. Even the IT guy here at my job was baffled by the behavior of it when I let him check it out but to be fair he was still pretty impressed with the tablet in general, so let's not make it seem like this thing is useless. The upgrade to Windows 10 also made the Wi-Fi network adapter drivers get a little wacky which made the transition process somewhat frustrating. Windows 10 is pretty nice (I'm a huge gamer and that Xbox app is very slick; I've been streaming my gameplay to the tablet and it's a really impressive feature) but like all new OS releases, this one seems to have some things it needs ironed out so be mindful of that when you agree to upgrade to 10 from the existing 8.1 setup.Even with its few quirks, I'd still recommend this tablet. It's a pretty cool piece of tech and packs a vast amount of functionality within.(UPDATE: 8/18/15- Turned on my tablet to find that the network adapter has gone all wonky again after a couple days of smooth sailing, rendering me without internet. It's the exact same scenario I had when I first started using the tablet and it's difficult to tell where the problem lies seeing as the drivers are fully up to date but this is starting to get a bit annoying.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MFOXF3WHTOWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2HRYJO#wasThisHelpful","R1MFOXF3WHTOWA","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This marks the third Lonely Planet travel guide I've reviewed and this one is just as impressive as the other two in terms of scale, detail, presentation and general usefulness. This one lays out a series of recommended road trips along the Pacific Coast, complete with all the information you'd need to pull them off with little to no problems. The trips are broken down into four separate jaunts:-Pacific Coast Highways-Northern Redwood Coast-Big Sur-Disneyland & Orange County BeachesEach road trip specified is detailed succinctly and thoroughly, covering everything from favored sights to recommended eating spots. The paper stock is good quality and the print job is fantastic, with clear pictures of everything referenced and all the icons and text very easy to make out and read respectively. There's plenty of useful advice regarding what to do in case your car breaks down and who to contact and a handy map that can be detached or the preferred option of mine, which is to open it up while still attached to the book.This is a VERY handy guide and I can't imagine anyone using this out there on the West Coast on one of these recommended road trips and coming away disappointed with it.

"Well crafted and adorable, this Thomas the Tank Engine wooden railway crossing has a Christmas theme to it, making it a perfect Christmas gift for the little Thomas fan in your life. It's primarily red and green with little tinges of snow and working lights and signals.

"What rating other than a full five stars can you give a product like this when it brings so much happiness to a child? My kids are both pretty big Thomas the Tank Engine fans and this playset made them just as happy as any other of the countless Thomas themed sets that I've gotten for them over the years. This set connects to any of the other Fisher Price sets (these things become even cooler when you start piecing them together and making huge connected track lines with a different scenario at every quadrant) and enough action to keep your kids entertained. The zipline makes for the best part as a zipline usually tends to be. There's little other to say other than the track is well made and requires little construction on your end before it's ready to go. If your child is a Thomas the Tank Engine fan, this comes easily recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUNSGB0VB1SKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKT89O#wasThisHelpful","RUNSGB0VB1SKP","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My kids loved this film and I can't get enough of it either. The story is ridiculous but its the characters that make this a laugh riot from beginning to end. Great voice work by Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich but naturally it's the titular penguins who are the stars of the show and they're both hilarious and adorable. Skipper's my personal favorite, in case you were wondering. There's a moment where they smack him in the butt during a round of 'high ones' that kills me every single time. Okay, I'm rambling a bit but seriously, Penguins of Madagascar is WAY better than its box office returns would have you believe. Even when it's corny it's still funny. The picture and sound are both crystal clear on this disc and overall, it's a movie that I think every family should have in their library. I can't even tell you how many times I've seen it with my boys by the time of this writing but you can put it on again for me right now and I'll have NO complaints whatsoever. HIGHLY recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30E297AOPFLVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWZIZTI#wasThisHelpful","R30E297AOPFLVL","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I would have given this TV stand a full five stars if it weren't for the vagueness of the instructions, so consider this a four and a half star review. They're not the worst instructions I've ever seen and they will get you through the build process but my advice is to keep the expected end result at the forefront of your mind and as you're building the frame, pay very close attention to how you're putting the pieces together. There are several points in the instruction where they tell you what pieces go where but don't tell you which side to attach to which. This lack of specificity led to one moment where I had to unscrew a couple of pieces after attaching them and another close call where the same thing almost happened. I'm a big fan of concise, detailed instructions and this was an undeniable disappointment that made things take a little longer than necessary. Even with this minor negative, it still winds up being a very easy stand to put together and the end result you get is an eye catching piece of A/V furniture that has plenty of space for all your equipment. Everything you need is included. I didn't need any tools although the instructions said I'd need a screwdriver; everything was able to be screwed in using the included Allen key. The stand feels very sturdy and the tinted tempered glass adds a nice touch to the overall design. It does a great job at keeping wires wrangled with the cutout holes in the wood supports in the rear and once your components are on the glass shelves, it all looks great and presentation worthy. I was able to build this by myself but I should warn you that the glass shelves themselves are heavy and almost make this a two man job on their own. I currently have an audio receiver, three game consoles, a cable box, three satellite speakers and a couple of other things populating the shelves and I still have substantial room to work with if I need to add anything else.Again, this would have easily gotten a perfect rating from me if the instructions were just a touch more refined. I'm incredibly happy with the end result but I could have done with those brief moments of annoyance that could have easily been addressed by literally a sentence or two of extra detail.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QOBLIDTDGBWI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9Q0DEK#wasThisHelpful","R2QOBLIDTDGBWI","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't know, after charging this thing to 100% (which didn't take particularly long) and putting it to use, I felt like this Swiffer/vacuum hybrid was kind of a waste. The Swiffer portion worked well enough but the vacuum left nearly everything in its wake untouched. It's really not strong enough to pick up much which defeats the whole purpose of this hybrid.

"It really doesn't get much better than this in terms of outdoor phone cases made for adventure and creative photography.

"This is a perfect example of what you see being exactly what you get. It's a very simple tablecloth that comes in a pleasant shade of brown, being neither too dark or too light. In terms of size, coverage and color, this tablecloth happens to go perfectly with the table I recently purchased, which is a dark brown wood table that seats six. The fabric is soft and well woven but not too soft where it feels like you're feeling up someone's leg while they're wearing a pair of ill-advised silk pants. It's hard to describe other than to say that it's not burlap.

"This Blu Ray edition of Tarsem's visually magnificent ""The Cell"" is pretty much the same as the original DVD release with one notable omission, namely the isolated score of Howard Shore. The picture is pretty good for the most part with a granier, more film like presentation than more recent digitally shot films. The picture seems to jump in overall quality though, when the action moves into the mind of the killer, which I'm sure viewers will notice almost immediately. The DTS-HD MA audio track is absolutely spectacular. It's both loud and extremely active. Shore's score benefits greatly from the sound mix, which complements the events on screen perfectly. The aforementioned extras are all interesting in their own right with the mini documentary 'Style as Substance' giving a better idea of why Tarsem's more visually driven film making style is how he chooses to go about translating the scripts he makes.""The Cell"" may not be an absolute masterpiece but there's no denying the imagination and creativity at play here, not to mention the genuinely disturbing elements peppered throughout. In fact, I find the movie even more disturbing now than I did when I first saw the film, having noticed many more things about it that seem to worm their way under your skin and wriggle there. The movie receives a very nice treatment on Blu Ray, which it wholly deserves.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUHX01EVTC4Z5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VH743L2#wasThisHelpful","RUHX01EVTC4Z5","A3K91X9X2ARDOK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3K91X9X2ARDOK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This rack is well made, but it strikes out on several fronts.  First, the instructions are terrible.  As others have mentioned some of the hardware is referenced incorrectly.  Also, the instructions are sparse and there are no illustrations for each step.Second, it took a lot of customizing to get this rack to fit properly a 700 bike.  The seat braces are too short  even at their longest position, putting the rack a few inches under the seat (even with the seat full forward).  And even on the lowest setting, the axle brace sits too high, which makes the rack sit 3-4"" above the tire and puts it out of level.  Shortening the brace doesn't solve the problem because the bottom mount is so wide that it interferes with the bike frame.Third, the hardware is sparse and doesn't quite work out of the box.  Some of the bolts are two narrow in diameter, while others ended up being a little short.Finally, mine was missing the reflector.In sum, a nice product with great potential if only they had paid more attention to the details.  Just making the braces slightly longer and providing a wider range of bolts would make it much easier to install and fit.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OOO47P9X0MV3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001454768#wasThisHelpful","R2OOO47P9X0MV3","A1LKZTTXTWD4M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKZTTXTWD4M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My expectation in buying this lock is that would provide at least equivalent security and greater convenience with features such as auto lock and unlock.  However, most of its features are unreliable, often resulting in an unsecured home.  This lock works like a development prototype, and is not suitable or convenient for safeguarding a home or business.  Among the major defects:* Sometimes the lock unlocks itself without any command from the user.  We ended up locking the door knob lock as a backup, but this negates the convenience of having this lock.* The lock sometimes powers off and will not appear in the August app on any device, requiring a key for entry.  Removing and reinserting the batteries restores power, but again this negates the convenience of a smart lock.* Auto-lock takes too long to engage (30 seconds minimum).  Given the lock's lack of reliability in other areas, I never felt secure enough to simply walk away and let the lock do its job.  Another problem with auto-lock is that this lock is not smart enough to know when the door is actually closed, resulting in the deadbolt slamming against the door frame several times a day.* It takes too long for the app to find and connect with the lock (minimum 10 seconds, but sometimes as long as 20-30 seconds).  Again this makes the lock less convenient that a traditional lock because one has to be proactive in firing up the app to get ready to leave.* The auto-unlock worked only 90% of the time, which is actually much better than other reviewers' experiences, which are as low as 25%.  However, auto-unlock uses position services in your phone and consumes a lot of battery.  My battery consumption was twice as high as without the August lock running in the background.* This is more of a manufacturer privacy issue, but August requires you to take pictures of your front door and yourself to use the app.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39M5VQ2BFQ8GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHY14CS#wasThisHelpful","R39M5VQ2BFQ8GW","A1LKZTTXTWD4M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKZTTXTWD4M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Buyer beware.  Intuit's business model is based on selling upgrades.  After 4-5 years, QuickBooks will require you to upgrade to continue using core features such as creating PDF invoices, accessing bank account online, and even accessing company accounts created with older versions.  If you don't, the version you paid a few hundred dollars for will be rendered an expensive check register.Another issue is setting up bank accounts.  I spent hours trying to set up my online account at one of the largest banks in the world, and all I got was error messages blaming the issue on my bank.  When I tried to connect to my bank account using a different accounting package, it connected instantly without any hassles.In 1998, when i first bought QuickBooks it was the only game in town.

"Great performance, and easy to install if you are familiar with networking.  Those who don't know what an IP address is will find it very frustrating because the instructions are terrible, and geared more towards IT people.  Some functions are not even documented in the manual, such as the repeater function.After a few days of internet research and fiddling with these units, I was able to extend a wireless network about 1,000' from the main router using two of them as WDS access points.  Note that the limitation in a wireless network is the client (smartphone, tablet, etc), which generally are limited in power due to FCC regs.  An iPhone will generally transmit up to 400' line of sight, and maybe 200' indoors, so while you may see full signal strength from the access point, the access point may not receive anything from the client.  Therefore, these work best if placed within 400' of each other so that the clients are never more than 200'.To install a WDS network using two or more of these units you will have to do the following for each unit:1. Disconnect your computer from your existing network2. Connect each Engenius unit to your computer and log in to the admin panel at 192.168.1.13. In IP Settings: (i) change the IP to one within your home network domain (if your router is 10.0.1.1, then pick 10.01.xxx), where xxx can't be the same as another device, and (ii) change the default gateway to the IP address of your router (usually ends in .1)4. In System Properties, set the mode to WDS > Access Point5. In Wireless Settings: (i) set the Channel HT Mode to 20 Mhz, (ii) set the Channel to a one that is not used or little used in your area (this channel must be the same on all access points).  The SSID does not have to be changed or be the same in both units.  I found it easier during testing to make them different to be able to tell which I was connecting to.6. In WDS Link Settings set the MAC Address to the WLAN MAC address written on the back of the OTHER unit7.  After you make all these changes, you have to click Save and Apply all changes in the Status menu, and wait for the unit to reboot.8. Repeat for the other Engenius unit(s)9. Connect your computer to your w-fi network, connect all Engenius units into your router, and try logging into each using the new IP addresses you assigned.10. If Step 9 works, disconnect one of the units from the router and attempt to connect to it using the SSID for that unit.11. If Step 9 or 10 don't work, do a hard reset on both units by pushing the rest button for at least 10 seconds, and try again.  These units are finicky and it took a few tries to get them to work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39DORJKMOGR2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BOVOLBS#wasThisHelpful","R39DORJKMOGR2I","A1LKZTTXTWD4M7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LKZTTXTWD4M7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I Love this system, however the bucket is just a plastic bucket, the mop is just a mop.  BUT, the water extractor is ingenious.  The reason I say this is because you can extract as much--or as little--water as you want.  Here's how I do it.  Get the mop well saturated and plop it into the wringer cup.  Turn it a little clockwise and press down.  Turn it a little again and press.  Keep doing this until it is as dry as you want.  And, your hands Never touch water.The mop head picks up everything.  I have 3 cats and always have plenty of hair--and litter-around.  It magically disappears.  And the head unscrews very easily for washing.  And the bucket and mop are very easy to carry around.

"I'll start by saying that I loved Big Little Lies, written by the same author.  Funny, sad, well-plotted.  Kept me entertained, and guessing to the end.  Because I liked that book so much, I read this one right after.  This one is not nearly the same quality.To begin, there just wasn't enough story to fill a full-length novel.  A short story, maybe, but not much else.  And there wasn't much of a real plot.  What a reader learns in the first few dozen pages comprises nearly the total substance of the story.  The rest of the book is mostly just a character study.  Because BLL had such unexpected plot twists, I kept expecting that something unexpected would happen in this one.  Nope.  Not really.  Just more of the same, chapter after chapter.  Moriarty attempts to create some uncertainty about the main male character, but that turned out to be smoke and mirrors.  None of that uncertainty panned out into anything.So skip this book, and go straight to BLL.

"This book works on some levels.  As a little slice of life story about a young, poor writer/poet attempting to find her way in the New York literary world, it was interesting.  As a glimpse into an old-school literary agency, it was also interesting.  But there are other aspects that are complete turnoffs regarding both the story and Rakoff herself.First, most obviously, she betrays Salinger.  A strong word, perhaps, but I think it is warranted.  Salinger was an extremely, drastically, notoriously private person.  Rakoff was employed by his literary agency, which worked very hard to protect his privacy.  Confidentiality certainly would have been expected.  For Rakoff, who worked within that realm of confidentiality, to now write a little tell-all book about her interactions with Salinger while she was working at the agency is truly unethical.  That is nearly akin to a paralegal writing a book about her interactions with a client of her law firm.  Rakoff really should be ashamed of herself.Second, Rakoff doesn't write about Salinger from some historic sense of adding to our understanding of the great writer.  No, she does so simply to inflate herself, to put herself in juxtaposition to Salinger in order to generate a little fame by glomming on to his.  How saleable would her book have been without his name attached?  Yeah, you get the picture.Third, her relationship with Don is nearly repulsive, and completely incomprehensible.  A reader never has any sense whatsoever of what she is doing with him.  Near the beginning, she mentions that they are attracted to each other.  So?  Any given person will meet many people to whom he/she is attracted.  That doesn't mean the person should jump into a long-term relationship based solely on that attraction.  And if there was more than physical attraction between Don and Rakoff, we never get the faintest hint of what it might have been.  The scenes between them cause a reader to cringe.Fourth, Rakoff, even as she gets older, apparently was and is very immature.  She dumps her college boyfriend, whom she claims to love, and shacks up with Don, while still claiming to be in love with the (ex) boyfriend.  She later marries a third guy and has two kids with him, and then she dumps him to reunite with the college boyfriend.  This last occurred when she was about 40 years old.  I feel sorry for the kids.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJ6PRPRUSMD2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6J7PP6#wasThisHelpful","R3HJ6PRPRUSMD2","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, I liked this book.  I'd never head of the Dyatlov deaths, and found the story and mystery to be interesting.  If you know little to nothing about the circumstances surrounding the deaths, then you likely will find the book worth at least a good skim.With regard to the conclusion that the author draws regarding what drove the experienced hikers out of their tent with no shoes and inadequate clothing into sub-zero degree weather, it is certainly plausible and rather fascinating.  A worthy possibility.  As a caveat, however, the conclusion is not definitive.  It is one logical option.  So if you are looking for proof positive, you won't get it.  But, again, an interesting hypothesis.The information about the deaths themselves is interesting, and perhaps worth 4 stars.  What detracted significantly from the book, however, were the every-other-chapters about the author himself and his investigation.  I am becoming more and more perplexed as to why non-fiction authors these days inject themselves into the stories they tell, as if they are at least equally as important as the main point of the book.  With very few exceptions, they aren't.  I found myself skimming past, or even skipping, the sections about the author Eichar.  Even the parts that were germane to the story, such as the interviews of the 10th member of the hiking party, who dropped out before the fateful night, didn't need to be partially about Eichar.  Simply convey the information that the 10th hiker provided, without making a big deal about journeying to meet the hiker, talking with the hiker, etc.  (It is as if Jill Lepore, who recently wrote the excellent Book of Ages, spent lots of page time talking about going to libraries to research Jane Franklin, who she met in the libraries, what her own experiences were.  What on earth would that have to do with telling Jane Franklin's story?)  Ahem.  Anyway.  Don't know if the reason for the author's focus on himself was due to ego, or simply a need to stretch the story into book-length, or both.  But if you can overlook this flaw, I would recommend that you give the book a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CW61A3G2P4TQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CUSQOA0#wasThisHelpful","R1CW61A3G2P4TQ","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not sure why this book was written.  Please, don't waste your time on its 500+ pages, as I unfortunately did.  Those are hours that I will never get back.  There are many things wrong with the book, but I will attempt to describe only some of them.  (Rack up the Not Helpful votes, but here goes.)First, the book doesn't add anything of interest to the vampire genre.  It is a highly derivative work.  And the few ""new"" details are unimaginative and add no further dimension.  And, really, the vampires in this book are some of the most uninteresting vampires about which I've ever read.Second, the book is poorly paced.  Very little actually happens, though scads of inert information are continually given.Third, for the most part, the climactic scenes towards the end occur off stage.  Seriously.  The scenes towards which the entire book is leading?  Off-stage.  For instance, during one crucial confrontation, someone is actually sitting on the roof, away from the action, imaging what might be going on downstairs where the confrontation is occurring. ???Fourth, the book needs some drastic editing.  It is far longer than it needs to be to tell the given story.  For instance, the entire first section of the book describes the childhood relationship between two of the characters, before the story itself actually starts.  There is no reason for this section.  It easily could have been summarized briefly in the body of the story.  And, oddly, though those are two of the main characters, there are quite a few other main characters for whom little or no back story is given.  So why give it for just those two?  Very odd.Fifth, due to the previous reasons, among others, the story is dull and tedious, a real slog to read through to the end.Sixth, the ending is silly.  The final last little twist on the last page is one of the most hackneyed, unimaginative, overused twists I've read in a very long time.Seventh, why?  That, really, is my main reaction to the story.  Why did the writer think that this was a good idea?  Why did she spend months, if not years, of her life writing it?  Why did a publisher spend the money to publish and distribute it?  And why has it gotten some good reviews?  Why?  Truly inexplicable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RVGT3Y17WILH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812993276#wasThisHelpful","R3RVGT3Y17WILH","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was expecting to like this book.  I had read good reviews in several respectable publications, and was especially interested in the assertion, by two different reviewers, that Jamison shows similarities in potential and intelligence to the great essayist Susan Sontag.  And, since essay writing seems to have been nearly forgotten as a popular literary form, it was very nice to see attention being given to the book.  Unfortunately, The Empathy Exams didn't come close to deserving the hype.To get to the heart of the problem, none of the essays seems in the least insightful.  Each essay takes as its topic one aspect of empathy. And, though Jamison relays some information, usually through the telling of a true story, she never pushes beyond the facts to explore the meaning, import, impact, or implications of empathy.  There is essentially no analysis, no exploration of greater significance, no rumination upon empathy as a fundamental quality of many human beings (or what that fundamental quality reveals about greater human nature).  Or, conversely, what a lack of empathy might mean.  The essays never expand beyond the specific stories.  Sadly, I learned nothing beyond the facts (which weren't very interesting).Another disappointment.  The writing was quite dull.  Good writing, non-fiction or otherwise, should be engaging.  It should draw a reader in, seize the intellect and/or imagination, and convey something new to the reader in a way that energizes him/her.  Perhaps Jamison just isn't a very good writer, or perhaps she mistakenly believes that ""intellectual"" writing must be arid and unenjoyable.  Too bad, either way.  I had to force myself to finish each essay.  And by the end of the volume, I was sadly forced to admit that they weren't worth the time spent.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8JBLFRT8KHL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1555976719#wasThisHelpful","R8JBLFRT8KHL8","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There certainly are some things to like about this book.  I am not sorry I read it.  A few of the discussions, sparked by books Rose read, are particularly interesting.  For instance, she discusses the belief that female writers aren't taken as seriously as male writers.  Surprisingly for me, I realized I hadn't really thought about that before, since I personally had never made any perceptual distinction between the two sexes as legitimate writers.  But once Rose started exploring the issue, it suddenly became obvious.  Thank you to Rose for that!  As another example, she discusses how books are weeded, that is, how books are permanently removed from library shelves to create shelf space for new acquisitions.  I suppose I must have known this happens, but how, why, the criteria used, etc, were all unknown to me.  More good information!  And her description of the book Gil Blas is a nicely dynamic piece of writing.One of my criticisms of the book is the subtitle: ""Adventures in Extreme Reading.""  I understand that in today's publishing world a book must capture a reader's attention, sometimes with such a gimmick.  But I find it off-putting.  Reading one shelf of books is hardly, by any stretch of the imagination, extreme.  An interesting little project, perhaps, but nothing more drastic than that.  As a result, the subtitle promises far more depth and drama than the book actually delivers.Another criticism.  I suppose the trend started with Julie Powell's Julia Project (cooking all recipes in Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year).  Since then, similar types of projects have sprouted like weeds for the purpose of then publishing a book about the project.  Do this for a year, do that for six months, try something different for 4 weeks.  Get some publicity, sign a publishing contract, and, voila, instant fame and success.  Very gimmicky.  This book falls somewhat within that category.  And the problem with such projects, why they seem a little unsavory, is that they often use serious work created by another person/people to cobble together a quick little project for the aforementioned publicity and publishing.  It is as if those project formulators can't create anything original and unique themselves, so they glom onto someone else's abilities and exploit them for personal gain.  I'm not saying that Rose is exactly like that.  She is very successful in her own right.  But this book has the strong whiff of that trend.Overall, the book is somewhat interesting.  It doesn't really comprise a coherent whole, but if the chapters are read as separate essays rather than as related chapters in a single book, the volume makes a little more sense.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELQ52KWRRA66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374261202#wasThisHelpful","RELQ52KWRRA66","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I'd never before read a book by someone who experienced the Cultural Revolution, and, while I knew generalities about it, was stunned by the stark and concise descriptions written by Anchee.  If you've ever wondered what the CR was like for the average Chinese person, this book will tell you, no holds barred.  You will feel yourself, alongside her, kneeling in the mud on horribly hot and humid days, planting rice plants amidst swamps with snakes and vermin slithering all around, all the while knowing that there is little chance that the plants will survive.  Excruciating lessons in futility.Some reviewers have complained about the graphic depiction of sex in the book.  First, it isn't very graphic, nor do those scenes dominate the book in any way.  While I find no use for gratuitous sex scenes, the ones in this book are far from it.  This is a coming of age story as much as it is a story about the CR.  During the CR, people were taught that love was a fake, bourgeois construct, and that sex outside of marriage was punishable by death in many cases.  Discussing the topic was utterly taboo.  What this book explores is how adolescents and young adults, with absolutely no framework into which to place their burgeoning desires, stumble and fumble in confusion while trying to figure it all out.  The sex scenes are placed within that context.  Not gratuitous at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37582FXZ7SD7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400096987#wasThisHelpful","R37582FXZ7SD7V","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this book.  Robbins picked a great style of memoir.  Rather than creating a narrative describing the beginning of his life to present, he chooses episodes- little vignettes and/or observations- that elucidate what was happening at a given point in his life.  These episodes tend to be amusing and unusual, while also managing to convey a greater impression of the man.The book moves along fairly chronologically, with digressions that don't perceptually interfere with that forward motion.  A reader receives a very good sense of how Robbins was living in any particular time frame.  Up until the publication of his second novel in the 1970's, that is.  From there, the memoir falls apart a little.  The chronology becomes somewhat unclear.  He chooses fewer and fewer episodes for a given amount of time.  And how he was living in the later decades, what his general circumstances were, are no longer really described.  Up until the 1970's, the progression of his life was clear.  After that, no so much.  But, still, I enjoyed the read.If you are a Robbins fan, the book is definitely worth the read.  He writes in his seamless, breezy style.  And it is fun to learn about his life, especially his childhood.  If you are neutral about Robbins, or don't really know of him, the book can still be fun, especially, again, the portions about his childhood.  Gives a good description of growing up poor in the South during the Depression (which is not nearly as depressing as it sounds).","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDTT0FAULN6HR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006226740X#wasThisHelpful","RDTT0FAULN6HR","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To begin, I must equate this book with the movie Seabiscuit.  Why, you might ask?  Because, while this is a non-fiction book/story, it isn't a straight, evenly presented, all facets explored kind of non-fiction.  Rather, it is non-fiction that has been shaped and perhaps somewhat manipulated into a rousing, emotion-evoking story.  Like Seabiscuit.  That being said, for what this book is, it is a good and fun read.I had never given a second (or even a first) thought to ultra-marathoning.  Ever.  Until I happened to pick up Eat & Run by Scott Jurek at the library recently, and liked it considerably.  That book led to this book.  And here we are.  The lesson being, you don't have to be a running aficianado to enjoy either book.  This book, like Jurek's, is a story of human endurance, of human possibility, of the amazing feats people can accomplish when true strength of mind overcomes any physical obstacle.  Rousing and emotion-evoking, yes, but elucidating fundamental truth.  Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QBJUX7ARQWQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307279189#wasThisHelpful","R1QBJUX7ARQWQK","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll preface my review by saying that I had never heard of Scott Jurek before picking up this book.  I don't follow running at all, and so came to his story with nary a preconceived notion.  But the inner jacket description sounded interesting, I like to read about unfamiliar things, so I gave it a shot.  Glad that I did.Other than one quibble, which I'll mention below, I very much enjoyed this book.  It was an easy and engaging read.  Scott (and his co-writer) write in a lucid manner.  Scott's own voice rang through loud and clear.  (That is unfortunately unusual in books these days.)  His experiences are truly impressive and fascinating.  Even as someone who has never followed the sport (though I used to run a little for exercise), I found real inspiration from Scott's accomplishments and attitude (both as a runner and as a person).A crucial aspect of the book: you don't have to care one whit about veganism to enjoy the book!!  I, myself, found that part very interesting, but it in no way overshadows the rest of Scott's story.  The vegan aspect is presented with a very light hand.  So don't let it deter you from reading the book!!The quibble.  Scott mentions here and there throughout the book that he has read philosophy since a teenager.  He says that this learning has impacted him greatly.  But other than a brief description of how the ideas behind bushido influenced him, he doesn't explain at all which philosophies impacted him and, more importantly, how they impacted him.  I very much would have liked more discussion about that.  I don't know if the reading didn't have as much of an impact as he says, or if he simply didn't know how to articulate the impact, or if the publisher discouraged too much of a philosophical discussion in order to appeal to a lower common denominator.  (I would guess the last, but don't know.)I usually don't address points made in other reviews in my own reviews, but will make an exception in this case.  I have no problem with negative reviews that are rational, based on a book.  But some of the negative reviews for this book display real anger and vitriol.  Very strange.  There seems to be some sort of hidden subtext and motivation behind them.  First, some people complain that this book is too much about Scott, that it is self-centered.  ????  It is a memoir about his life.  Of course it is about him.  One person claims that he abandoned his wife and treats his friends badly.  ????  His wife fell in love with someone else and filed for divorce.  And how did he treat his friends badly?  No hint of that in the book.  Another reviewer claims that he was an obnoxious competitor.  ????  Not only is there no hint of that in the book, but from what I've read elsewhere, the running community at large believes him to be one of the least egotistical champions out there.  A few people, with real annoyance, claim that veganism is pure drivel, that there is no proof whatsoever that eating vegan is any better than chowing down on cheeseburgers and steak.  Hmmm.  First, if, over 25 years of competing, Scott has found that eating vegan makes him much more fit and healthy, and gives him far greater stamina, then I believe him.  What possible reason could he have for lying?  (The great vegan industrial complex is paying him millions?)  Second, I would bet every last penny I have that not one of the angry detractors has ever eaten a healthful vegan diet (whole grains, legumes, fruits, veggies) for any amount of time whatsoever.  Because, if he had, he would have felt immensely better after about the first week.  (I've tried all eating styles, and feel soooooo much better eating a healthful vegan diet.)Anyway, if you wish to read an interesting book about the amazing (non)limits that humans can achieve, and enjoy a lucid, clear narrative voice, give this book a try.  It is highly enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LTQVZ0Y36LS6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547569653#wasThisHelpful","R1LTQVZ0Y36LS6","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apparently I'm not as enamored of this book as most people seem to be.  It isn't bad, hence the 3 stars.  But it isn't particularly good.  I've made about 15 of the recipes, and they were all fine, but none of them were delicious.  None were the type that I would want to serve to anyone outside my family.  And, really, I serve them to my family only when I need something both very quick and healthful.  I have so many other vegan recipes that are truly delicious.  This book has retreated to fallback position.I still make recipes from the book, for this one reason.  I like having something healthful in the fridge, so that if I want lunch or a snack, there is something already prepared, thereby preventing unhealthful grazing.  I would recommend this book if you are looking to fill that niche.  And most of the recipes use ingredients that are already in a decently stocked kitchen, so you won't have to run to the store for something unusual.One aspect of the book that is a tad bit off-putting.  Nixon changes, sometimes significantly, traditional recipes from many cultures, making them both vegan and easy to prepare from standard U.S. ingredients.  That's fine.  But she still calls her recipes by the traditional recipe names.  It seems a bit presumptuous, in a steam-rolling western kind of way, to usurp something from another culture, change it significantly, but still call it by its traditional name.  (Certainly use traditional recipes for inspiration, but call them something different.)  I'll likely get lots of Not Helpful votes for daring to say that.  But, really, think about it.  Isn't that kind of rude?","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZ2R9EFD90SD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937856046#wasThisHelpful","RTZ2R9EFD90SD","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I would give this book 3.5 stars, if I could.  Since I can't, the question becomes, 3 or 4 stars?  Since I would recommend it, I'll round up to 4.The characterization is very good, far better than in most novels these days.  Not once did it seem as if each character weren't real.  They all spoke loudly and clearly in their own distinct voices.  It was this aspect of the book, the people, that was the most enjoyable part of the read.  Together they created a unique story world.  If you want to immerse yourself in the Southern domain of the 1930's (or at least the author's vision of it), this book will take you right there.The plot is a little weak.  I knew from nearly the very beginning who the killer likely was, and I was correct.  And the plot is a bit sparse and linear.  But, still, given the rich texture of characterization and character interaction, the plot sparsity is nicely filled in.  Again, I would recommend this book.  And unfortunately, these days, there are very few new novels that I would recommend.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UX9WYHMSEM70/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307475263#wasThisHelpful","R2UX9WYHMSEM70","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book didn't sit well with me, for a variety of reasons, some of which I'll try to explain.  To begin, the book's structure is off-putting.  It is broken into small sections, most only a few pages long, with each being written from the viewpoint of one of the authors.  I understand that all three wanted to tell their stories, each from his/her own point of view, but the constant jerking between them was disruptive.  What made this structure even worse, all three speak in essentially the same literary voice.  Meaning, it is nearly impossible to tell one person's section from another simply by reading them.  (I had to keep referring to the listed name at the start of each section to keep them straight.)  Without being able to hear each person as an individual, it is somewhat difficult to immerse oneself in the story.  I wish they had found a more engaging and elegant way to convey their stories.Another problem.  This has been mentioned by quite a few other people.  I have a difficult time believing that the hikers had no clue where they were. Why?  I've traveled extensively both in the U.S. and in foreign countries on multiple continents, and not once did I not know where I was.  Especially if there was a border anywhere nearby.  That just doesn't happen with experienced travelers.  And, given the extremely fraught nature of the greater Middle East area, it would be even more imperative for any experienced traveler with any common sense to be extremely situationally aware.  Especially since it was the IRANIAN border.  But these three claim that they thought they were 100 miles from the border.  Not one mile, where some confusion might be expected, but 100 miles.  That is a huge distance, especially in the mountains.My next paragraphs will probably cause the Not Helpful votes to rack up like a pinball machine score, but I've got to be honest and tell you what I think.  First, I was put off by the fact that the hikers refuse (to this day) to admit that they did anything wrong, or in any way contributed whatsoever to their imprisonment.  I am not saying at all that what happened to them was justified.  But look at the situation.  Three Americans hiking within a few feet of the Iranian border?  What did they think was going to happen?  What do you think the U.S. would do if three North Korean hikers were found in the mountains at the Canadian/U.S. border without required papers?  They certainly would be detained and questioned, as they should be.  (Not imprisoned for years, but you get the point.)  It is as if the authors feel that they should be able to do anything they want, without realistic consequences because, hey, don't you know who we are?Another negative.  The hikers, in the years before their imprisonment, as well as during their imprisonment, made a big deal out of being so sympathetic to and understanding of the Middle East Arab and Persian plights, and so critical of the U.S.  Gosh, Mr. Iranian interrogator, we disagree with the U.S. and empathize with you greatly.  If you could just understand how much we sympathize, you would know that we're really on your side.  (This wasn't a strategy.  They actually believed this.)  The sheer hypocrisy of this attitude is almost overwhelming, and yet the crazy thing is that none of the three hikers has the faintest recognition of his/her hypocrisy.  They are sitting in a prison in which the Iranians are brutally torturing and killing their own political dissenters, and yet the hikers sincerely explain to their captors how much they sympathize with Iran, and disagree with the U.S.  And they are stunned that their captors don't say, oh, you sympathize with us?  Gosh, we'll release you because we're such great and tolerant people.  How can the hikers possibly be that blind?  Inexplicable.  This is Sarah, speaking to Ahmadinejad himself, after her release: ""The three of us are very critical of our government's foreign policy.  We are all against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I even helped organize a protest against bombing Iran when I was in my twenties.  Will you tell this to the [Iranian] judiciary?""  And yet, oddly, Sarah doesn't beg Ahmadinejad to be allowed to leave the U.S. and live in wonderful Iran.  Hmmm.Another problem.  The hikers continually insist throughout the book that Sarah spends her captivity in solitary confinement.  This annoys me.  I've spent many years volunteering time with organizations that attempt to help brutalized political prisoners in many countries.  And, let me tell you, Sarah is not in solitary confinement.  Simply being by herself in a cell doesn't qualify.  She is regularly, almost daily, taken to visit the other two hikers.  They spend large amounts of time together.  She also has regular interactions with non-hostile guards and some fellow prisoners.  This doesn't constitute solitary confinement.  The continual misuse of this term is a huge slap in the face to all of the political prisoners who truly live in solitary.And, I don't know how else to say it, the hikers' continual whining was embarrassing.  Being imprisoned is horrible.  No doubt about it.  But they, like many Americans (myself included), have led such easy and entitled lives, in which I'm sure they were continually told how important and unique they are, that they seem to have no mental capacity to deal with, or even comprehend, adversity.  Bad things just can't or shouldn't happen to them.  We hiked at the Iranian border.  We were imprisoned as a result (which was an entirely foreseeable consequence), but how can this possibly be happening to us?  Don't you know how unique and intelligent and empathetic we are?  Don't you know how cool we are to have lived in foreign countries and thought so very much about the plight of you poor Iranian government, so abused by the dastardly Americans?  Don't you know... don't you know... don't you know how very special we are?  Because we're us.  Us.  Isn't our value self-evident?Next, the hikers aren't abused in any way.  Other than a few scuffles, nothing physically bad happens to them.  They are given plenty of food and water, books, even a refrigerator, TV, VCR, and delicious birthday cake.  During this time, on more than one occasion, they hear the horrible screams of Iranian prisoners being brutally tortured.  So the hikers' complaining about relative trivialities casts them in a very unsympathetic light.One positive use for this book: it is an excellent, if inadvertent, psychological study of truly entrenched and unthinking white American entitlement.  First example.  After being released, Sarah thinks, ""I'm not sure that I've ever felt anything akin to nationalism in my life- my core identity has largely been shaped in response to (and rebellion against) what I dislike about my culture...greed, selfish individualism, a sense of superiority and entitlement over others.""  Unbelievable.  Why?  Because the three hikers continually display and embody every single one of these attributes, apart from greed.  They are the living essence of them.  They feel so incredibly entitled and selfishly individual, that they have no ability to self-reflect and recognize that truth.  (And, might it be pointed out, that American taxpayers contribute more humanitarian aid to people around the world than just about all other countries combined.  Very selfish and greedy.)Second example.  The hikers have a firmly entrenched image of who they are.  And not even a deep, internal image, but an image that they believe they project to the exterior world.  A superficial, look at my fabulous empathy image.  And it is amazing how they can twist their perception of events to fit this image.  This is Josh, witnessing a minor and equal scuffle between Shane and a guard: ""I can't be mad at Shane for fighting with [the guard].  Even Gandhi wrote that he would choose violent resistance over cowardice.  That was what Shane did.  Perhaps fighting, yet refusing to gang up on [the guard], was Gandhian.""  Wow.  So Shane gets into a little scuffle with a guard, but it can't just be that.  No.  These hikers have such an inflated view of themselves, of their grand importance, that in having a scuffle Shane isn't Shane having a scuffle.  No, Shane is like... Gandhi.  I say it again.  Wow.Again, rack up the Not Helpfuls, write nasty comments, but here goes.  Get over it, you three hikers.  Get over it.  Something bad happened to you.  Something that was somewhat foreseeable, given the circumstances and your actions.  You are partially to blame.  While imprisoned, you were treated well, allowed to see each other, fed, watered, showered, tolerated even when you screamed at guards, slapped them, and demanded things.  You are extremely lucky that you are Americans, that you are from a great and tolerant country, because if you had been Iranian, you would have been tortured, raped, and killed by your own government.  Put that in perspective, why don't you?","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M71REQHOJ3FH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547985533#wasThisHelpful","R2M71REQHOJ3FH","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The characterization in this novel is lovely.  It kept me going long after most books would have, given the lack of plot and suspense.  I very much wish that Baker had married this characterization to a more compelling story.I am not all about crazy suspense or action.  I believe that any suspense or action must be equally balanced by true depth of character.  Most novels, unfortunately, are action/plot heavy and characterization light.  This book is unusual in that it reverses that balance.A bus accident occurs right at the beginning of the story.  Very soon thereafter, we know who caused the accident.  The rest of the book is simply character interaction and development, loosely hanging on the fact of that accident.  The vast majority of characters don't know who caused the accident, but, and this is significant, the reader does.  Wondering if the characters are going to discover the truth doesn't really create any suspense.  That is the mistake that Baker makes.  If the reader knows, even if the characters don't, suspense is minimal.So, not much happens plot-wise for most of the book.  Then all of a sudden, at the very end, there is a very quick rush of a denouement, in which truths are revealed and death occurs.  The plot goes from zero to sixty in about 10 pages.  Very abruptly.  Unsatisfying.Baker clearly can write.  Again, the characterizations are lovely.  So I can't wait until she can join characterization with plot.

"There is a lot to like about this book.  The characters are interesting and well-drawn (which is fairly unusual in popular thrillers these days).  The story is interesting for the first two-thirds or so of the book.  It kept me engaged and interested.  I was really liking the novel, and would have recommended it without qualification, until I started reading the final third or so.In the final third the story devolves into a cookie cutter, hackneyed plot, the kind that has been used too many times in mediocre thrillers.  I won't say what happened, but it was trite, implausible, and kind of silly.  Given the first two-thirds of the story, I know that Elo is capable of far better.

"This is McHugh's first novel.  She does have talent.  She writes scenes in a way that made me truly believe the people and the action.  In that regard it was an effortless read.  I enjoyed the setting, the characters, and the story.My quibble with the book is this.  McHugh has yet to develop a feel for dramatic pacing.  The book moved along at one speed at all times.  That is, the pacing was very even.  What should have been the more tense, dramatic, and/or climactic scenes didn't feel any different from any other scene.  Even the denouement, when the bad guy gets his due, didn't feel much different from a baby shower that was depicted.  For this reason, at the end, nothing of particular consequence seems to have happened.  There is no sense of reader catharsis whatsoever.Now that I think about it, I'll add one more (slight) negative.  The story was structured as two parallel stories, one following Lila as a young woman and the other following Lila's daughter Lucy as a young woman.  Parallel structure is fine, in story, theme, etc.  But in this book the parallels became too obvious and heavy-handed.  In fact, in Lucy's story, a potential love interest, Daniel, appears, but serves no real purpose other than as a parallel to Lucy's father Carl.  If Daniel didn't exist, the story wouldn't really have progressed any differently.  And that is just one example.I enjoyed the book to some degree, but I can't quite say that I would recommend it to others. There are other novels of mystery and/or suspense that are far more well-paced and suspenseful.  But I will read McHugh's next book, to see if she has matured as a writer.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO5WKWQA06F3R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812995201#wasThisHelpful","RO5WKWQA06F3R","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow!  I give very few books, of any kind, 5 stars, because for me a book must be essentially flawless to rate that high.  Ancient Grains deserves those full 5 stars, and more.I cook mostly vegetarian, with a little vegan thrown in.  Though this book has a few non-vegetarian recipes, the vast majority are vegetarian, and some are vegan.  This is one of my very favorite, go-to cookbooks.  Whether for a quick meal on a weeknight, or a more impressive weekend meal for guests, this book is fantastic.And lest you think I'm rating the book based on the photos or the sound of the recipes, I've cooked at least 15 of the recipes, and have adored them all.  There is one recipe, in particular, a warm oat berry salad with blue cheese, green olives, and walnuts, to which I am absolutely addicted.  I've made it at least a dozen times, and plan to make it many more.  And the creamy farro porridge with honey roasted grapes?  Ahhhhhhhh.........As for the skill level required by the recipes, I would say that the vast majority of them are quite easy for anyone with a rudimentary cooking skill set.  And the ingredient lists aren't long at all, for the most part.  This is one of those recipe books that proves that a few good, fresh, tasty ingredients can be combined into a fantastic meal.I seldom gush, but this book is fantastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W34ZP7NDWSRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1580083544#wasThisHelpful","R3W34ZP7NDWSRZ","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love some of Jillian's other videos, especially 30 Day Shred and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  I would recommend them highly.  But in Yoga Meltdown Jillian misses the mark.  After using quite a few of her other videos, I've gotten to know her on-screen persona fairly well.  Compared to those other videos, it seems as if Jillian didn't particularly like making Yoga Meltdown.  She is frown-y, slightly grouchy, and has no enthusiasm for the yoga workout.  I'm guessing that since yoga is currently popular, her team told her that she needed to make a yoga video, so she did.  But her heart clearly wasn't in it.  So it is difficult, while doing the video, to have any enthusiasm for the workout when the instructor doesn't.As for the yoga itself, well, it isn't.  Yoga, that is.  I wasn't expecting strictly traditional yoga.  This is Jillian, after all.  But this workout can be called yoga only with the very most tenuous of connections.  And it is one more example of an ancient and lovely practice being co-opted without any respect or understanding for its true nature.  My recommendation would be to give this video a pass, but to try the two excellent videos that I mentioned in the first sentence.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OUSDRSTG19DP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031XYLWG#wasThisHelpful","R2OUSDRSTG19DP","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must say, I like this book. It has a few flaws, which I will mention near the bottom, but overall I found the volume to be quite useful. To begin, the text itself is completely understandable to a modern Westerner. It is clear, concise, and conveys complicated ideas in a comprehensible manner. This quality may be due in part to the particular translation, but it is also largely due to the clear writing of Hakuin himself. Why do I mention this at the beginning? I've read other older/traditional Asian Buddhist texts, and many of them are highly abstruse, even for an educated Westerner. They often seem as if the reader must have a large well of cultural and experiential background knowledge in order for the texts to even begin to make sense. With this book, however, any intelligent person can pick it up and immediately gain useful knowledge.I've been studying Buddhism for a couple of years, and have found myself a bit confused by the many different strains of Buddhism. This book is the first I've read that clearly explains the difference between Zen Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism. (Very roughly, Pure Land Buddhism relies solely on meditation to achieve enlightenment, while Zen views kensho- a sudden, clear insight- as the first true and necessary step to gaining enlightenment. After kensho has been experienced, the hard work of both meditation and study has just begun. Pondering koans is one essential method that leads to kensho.)And this book not only explains Zen, but it does so in a truly traditional Japanese way, in the words of a Japanese master. I like many books about Buddhism written by modern Western writers and/or for a Western audience, but they sometimes can seem too superficial. That is, they don't really delve down deep into simple but fundamental truth. And too many of them also go to great pains to be so very secular, eschewing any hint that Buddhism has a religious-like aspect, and instead treat Buddhism almost like a self-help regimen. This book is a refreshing and needed change from that type of book.I wasn't expecting this, but Hakuin has a sense of humor that shines through very clearly. One example: ""You could take a conventional explanation like this, knead it up with some good rice, and stick it out under the trees for a thousand days, without getting even a crow to fly by for a second look.""I mentioned above that the book has a few flaws. Flaws might not be the correct word. Perhaps negativities might be better. Hakuin spends a considerable amount of page space excoriating both Pure Land Buddhism and false Zen masters. Some explanation of why he doesn't like them is reasonable, but he goes on at great length. Hakuin was also a main proponent of screaming at students, beating them with sticks, and starving them. This seems extremely un-Buddhist-like to me. In addition, hell is mentioned frequently. And not a theoretical hell, but a fiery, horrible hell. Again, doesn't seen like Buddhism. (But I am a newbie, so what do I know?)Overall, I would recommend this book highly. The text itself is very useful. And it is preceded by both an excellent Translator's Introduction and a Foreward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QRN5DILZN0PC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008AUJHQ0#wasThisHelpful","R1QRN5DILZN0PC","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our closet is too small to hold several laundry bins, so we have to set them out in the bedroom itself.  To keep them from being visually obvious, I wanted nice-looking, neutral colored hampers that also 1) can hold a decent amount, 2) are easily carry-able down 2 flights of stairs, and 3) are a reasonable price.These hampers fit all of those criteria, except...  The interiors are a bright medium blue.  Since the bins are only about 23"" high, when you stand in the room you look down into them, so the interior blue is just as obvious, if not more so, than the tan/cream exterior.  Too bad.  If the interiors had been the same color as the exterior, these hampers would have been 5 star perfect.  Apart from the blue, however, I am quite pleased with the hampers and would recommend them.The exterior is made of a nice light tan canvas-like material.  Just what I was looking for.  They are a useful, largish size, larger than 23"" by 14"" by 14"" sounds.  I'd say they each hold about a load and a half of laundry, so they don't fill too quickly.  Perfect.  The handles make the hamper easy to lift and carry.  I've never had any problem carrying a full hamper up or down 2 flight of stairs.  The price is very reasonable, especially for the quality.  These aren't shoddy boxes.  Instead, they are actually well-designed.  The blue material on the interior is an easily cleanable smooth synthetic.  A square insert, made of the same blue material, fits down into the bottom of the hamper to keep it open.  But if you remove that insert, the hamper easily folds flat for streamlined storage.Overall, the hampers are better than I would have hoped for, especially for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VI8VV2JPGD4N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JF8LSY#wasThisHelpful","R3VI8VV2JPGD4N","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first read this book as a youngster back in the 1980's, and it was already nearly a quarter of a century old then.  In my twelve-year-old perception, I thought it was a good book, and have remembered it fondly every since, though the details became vaguer and vaguer with time.  Then, for some reason, the other week I thought of this book (and of Stewart's books in general) and decided to read it again.  To my surprise, it actually has stood the test of time.  And my much older self liked it nearly as much as my younger self.This is not a literary book.  It is not weighty stuff.  But it is a fun, light, classic mystery, the kind that one might read on a beach (although it is better than the average modern beach read these days).  It moves along at a fairly brisk pace.  It has a bit of exotic mystery.  The characters, while not particularly well-developed, are all distinct and clear.  It does suffer a tad from implausibility, in that, for the sake of moving the plot along, an intelligent character makes a couple of silly choices, which (wouldn't you know it) put her in danger.  But overall, a nice, breezy read.Given that the book is now 50 years old, a good question would be, how dated does it seem?  It doesn't seem dated at all, except for two minor exceptions.  If I hadn't known better, I might have assumed it was written recently.  The two exceptions?  First, the main characters view the Corfu ""peasants"" in a rather patronizing way.  Second, one kiss between two of the characters apparently causes the female to fall so deeply in love that she will do anything for the guy.  Other than those two minor aspects, the rest of the book seems entirely modern.  If you want a fun, light read, you might want to give this book a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L0UX5D2QHQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1613744501#wasThisHelpful","R1L0UX5D2QHQI","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using various Moosewood cookbooks for a couple of decades, and this is by far my favorite among them.  (Remember the older Moosewood books that were filled with recipes for lentil loaf, cashew cheese, etc? :-) )  This is the kind of recipe book that you can pick up after getting home from work, and find something that sounds delicious, but that is also quick and easy to make.  The specific recipes that I've tried so far have all turned out very nicely.  And you don't have to be any sort of expert cook to prepare the recipes.  A basic knowledge of cooking will allow you to successfully complete most of them, and a decent knowledge of cooking will allow you to complete all of them.  This book is quickly becoming a kitchen staple for me.I will emphasize the word ""staple.""  This book contains many staple-type recipes.  Fine by me.  That sort of cookbook certainly has its place in my repertoire.  If, however, you are looking for more uniquely inventive (though not complicated) vegetarian recipes, try New Vegetarian Kitchen by Nicola Graimes.  Truly spectacular.It is SO nice that vegetarian and vegan recipes are now becoming so much more fresh and appealing.  I look at such cookbooks from the '70's, '80's, and even '90's, and so many of the recipes seem to be like hairshirt punishments, giving that sense that a person is being so conscientiously sacrificial to pursue a vegetarian/vegan eating style.  But v/v has come a long way, emerging into truly tasty goodness.  This cookbook is a terrific example of that emergence.  Eat well, and enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HI3RZCMGL7T7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250006252#wasThisHelpful","R1HI3RZCMGL7T7","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I paid $7.97 for each panel.  At that price, I give these curtains 4 stars.  The Mandarin color is true to the product photo.  The ""silk"" material is nice.  Overall, these curtains add a nice color accent in my room, which is exactly what I wanted.  I am pleased with them.Apart from the low price, these curtains do have some flaws of which you might want to be aware.  When viewed up close, it becomes clear that they are rather shoddily made.  Just below the hanging rings, there is a horizontal seam that runs the width of the panel.  The seam is very crooked/wavy.  And the horizontal seam at the bottom of the curtain is also crooked/wavy.  These flaws aren't particularly noticeable from any distance.The material in very thin.  For my purposes, that isn't a problem.  However, if you are expecting the curtains to act as visual barriers between inside and outside of a dwelling, they won't.  If the room is lit at night, everything in that room will be clearly visible from the exterior of the dwelling.  And during the day, the curtains let in a considerable amount of light.**I wouldn't pay much more than I did for these curtains.  They aren't worth a higher price.  However, if you simply want a nice accent of color in a room, the curtains aren't a bad deal overall.  I've seen curtains of a similar quality at much higher prices, so I consider these to be a fairly good find.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E03V4BAZLXGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034QHOLK#wasThisHelpful","R3E03V4BAZLXGY","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've tried other Stash teas that I've liked considerably, including Breakfast in Paris and Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea.  But this Coconut Mango Oolong really misses the mark.  First, there isn't a hint of wuyi oolong flavor.  Nada.  Tastes like a tea-less herbal ""tea.""  That, in and of itself, wouldn't be a problem if the tea were good.  But it tastes very strongly and harshly of coconut.  I love coconut.  It's one of my favorite flavors.  But this coconut isn't good.  It tastes artificial (even though I believe it isn't).  There is a faint mango flavor, but it doesn't balance the strong coconut flavor.  Not good.  Wouldn't recommend it.

"This is a lovely little book.  In it Pennington explains the contemplative life to the layman- its patterns and attributes, the more profound meaning of various monastic rules apart from their mere observance, and the methods by which a layman can incorporate contemplative/monastic aspects into his/her regular daily life.  This isn't a particularly deep discussion, but it does provide useful information presented in a simply elegant and easily read style.  This book can be read quite quickly, and yet a reader walks away with far more information and understanding than the shortish length might suggest.This book isn't just for Christians.  I'm a practicing Buddhist who loves reading about all religions.  There is a great deal in common between Buddhists and contemplative/mystic Christians.  This book, elucidating the Christian monastic rule, enhances the understanding of Buddhist meditation.  Highly recommend it to Buddhists and Christians alike.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QQ5DZ2S04PSW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0809131714#wasThisHelpful","R1QQ5DZ2S04PSW","A1MFOB3PG2F9EV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1MFOB3PG2F9EV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Vitamin C serum is a crucial step in my daily skincare routine...it has been for the last year, and I'm always searching for the perfect, well-made serum to use that actually fits my budget. Some serums are better than others, but this is one a lot more affordable than some on the market, and is still very high quality, as far as I can tell. I like my vitamin C serum to have a citrusy smell, and this serum delivers on that well, with a very light scent that dissipates as it dries, doesn't overwhelm my senses, and provides me with a nice, calm feeling.I always use my serums after I cleanse and exfoliate my face, so that it can get deep into my pores, but before I moisturize. The serum will actually help to draw the moisturizer into your skin...just be sure to let your products dry between every step to avoid any flakiness, especially if you'll be applying makeup after you apply the serum.This serum feels really smooth and silky on my skin, which really just seems to love and soak it up. I love that it doesn't clog my pores, too! I don't have any age spots yet, but I would prefer to prevent them while helping my skin to look young and healthy, and this serum is an affordable way to help with that.I received this vitamin C serum for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"This scale is simple, yet incredibly elegant! I've had few expensive scales that save different users' info, track weight loss or gain, and break down things like % body fat for the user, and they're great...but not really for me! What I really wanted was a scale that everyone in the house could use without having to 'learn how', and that's exactly what I got!Once I got things switched from kg to lb (you do this by crouching, so make sure you're not too close to a wall..haha I learned the hard way), it was really quick and easy to use. You don't have to tap it, step on and off, or do anything at all to turn it on, you just step on, and it reads super-fast, which is perfect for the youngest, most impatient members of my family who don't like to stand still. The lowest weight that it measures is about 10kg, which is around 22 lbs, so it works for all of us, from age 3-30.The initial charge that it came with didn't last long, but it only took a few hours to charge with the included USB cable...the BEST part about this, besides the obvious fact that I don't ever have to replace batteries in my scale again, is that there's a storage compartment on the bottom of the scale for the cord, so I'm not going to lose it, or get stuck searching for a cord. That's a huge deal for me, because it seems like that everything comes with a cord, and I have a hard time remembering which cord goes with what.I really like the sleek, shiny design of this scale, and how well it fits into my bathroom's decor without sticking out like a sore thumb. It also doesn't look like a big, shiny toy, so I don't find the kids in the bathroom playing with it too much, either. This is a great, simple scale for the price that has some amazing features, like the usb charging function, that I haven't seen in a scale before.I purchased this scale at a discount for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"Sometimes, I just need to make everyday tasks more fun to make my kids actually want to do things like brush their hair. This brush is the perfect thing to make hair brushing time just a bit more fun! My girls, 3, 4, and 8, loved it immediately because of the fun, squiggly brush bristles. I loved it immediately because it really does a wonderful job of brushing through tangled hair without creating too much pain. It's really about how you brush the hair, but having the perfect brush doesn't hurt, either...especially when it's as fun as this one! The mirror on the back of the brush is a good, clear mirror that the girls love to use while brushing their hair to make sure that they are doing a good job. I even taught my oldest to use it along with the full-length mirror to be able to check the back of her head to make sure it looks nice!

"This little portable power bank packs a serious punch! When I first received this, I was a bit confused by the fact that it doesn't need a usb cable to operate. I thought 'this little cable is going to break right away, then it's done.' I was very wrong! I thought that not having a usb cord to attach between the power bank and my phone would be a nuisance, but I love it! I really like the fact that I don't have to keep track of an extra cord in addition to my power bank, and that it closes nice and tightly so it doesn't get clogged with gunk in my purse.As far as charging power is concerned, again, I was impressed with this power bank! It didn't really take long to fully charge, which is a huge bonus, but even better was how FAST it charged my phone! Way faster than plugging it into a wall. I don't get a full charge on my android phone with this, but it takes it back up to 85% at lightning speed, which gives me at least a few extra hours of battery life every time. I use this to charge my phone even when I'm at home because it's just so fast. I probably use this little power bank at least two times a day, I really am lost without it! After a few weeks of use it's still going strong, though it does take just a little longer to charge up the more often I drain the battery, which is to be expected.I purchased this portable power bank at a discount for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"Honestly, every couple needs a set of good handcuffs for the bedroom! Sure, those novelty cuffs are cute, but they really don't do the job...not like these do! If you want to practice trusting your partner, or vice versa, these really are the way to go. I like that they came with a carrying pouch that can go on a belt loop...this allows me to store them without it being obvious as to what they are. They're fairly simple to use, with the ability to lock them, or even to double-lock them, so that they can't open OR get tighter on the wrists, which is very important if someone is going to actually be wearing them for any length of time. These cuffs are really heavy-duty, with nice hinges instead of a ring to hold the cuffs together, and the keys are pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it. I do suggest that whoever is going to be doing the 'cuffing' practice first, to make sure that they know exactly how to work the cuffs properly to prevent injuries. The instructions were fairly easy to follow, though it took me awhile to realize that the little piece on the key that you push 'in' on while using was on the very back tip of the key. User error on my part, and i figured it out pretty quickly. These cuffs would make the perfect addition to any halloween costume that needs them as well!I received these handcuffs for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"These weren't really what I expected. There weren't any cute heart or underwater patterns. There was a pink one, and a purple one..Not pink and blue, as pictured. They do seem to be well-made, with little loops at the top for hanging, and they came in individual bags, so they were clean and in great condition...I was just really disappointed that they were plain mesh, and not patterned at all, as pictured.These are great for organizing stuffed animals or small articles of clothing (I've got one hanging from the ceiling, and one in the closet), or different types of toys that need to be organized, like their dolls and their accessories and clothes! My daughters enjoy putting things away in these, and I love that it's not just another thing on the floor filled with toys, which really adds extra room to play in our play room.

"I'll never forget the first time my dad let me smell a can of coffee when he opened it for the first time. I wasn't a coffee drinker yet, and wouldn't be for years, but I immediately realized that there was something special in that can. Since I started to drink coffee myself, and brew it at home, I've learned that I'm picky about my coffee. I always buy whole beans so that I can grind them just before I brew them. Unfortunately, storing the beans in the bag that I buy them in means that I don't get to experience that 'fresh coffee' smell more than once per bag. This coffee canister makes sure that my coffee beans stay really fresh for as long as I need it to. I really like that I can open and recluse the canister with one hand, so that if my other hand's busy with my grinder, I can still get it closed right away to seal in the coffee freshness. The date-dial on the top of the can helps me to remember how old the coffee is, which will be helpful when the next one shows up! I have to have at least two - I like to switch up my coffee a lot, and now that I have a great way to keep it fresh, I get to buy more than one type at a time!I received this coffee canister for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"I'm always skeptical when buying new seat covers for my car...Especially when they clam to be 'universal fit'...but these are really versatile to fit many different seat styles, including mine, which is most important to me!When I opened the package, I was immediately overwhelmed with all of the different pieces. It was tough to figure out what was supposed to go where, so I took it all out to my car, checked out the instructions, and got to work. I started with the back seat. I figured that would be the toughest to install and fit properly, and I wasn't incorrect. The instructions say to pull up or completely remove the seat bottom to ensure a perfect fit...I almost gave up then and there, because I don't believe that I could put the seat back on properly if I removed it. It's just not an option in my older car. But the edges of my seat pulled up just well enough for me to get a good fit and hook the elastic strips together. I had to cut holes for the seat belt buckles, which was a little frustrating, but it makes sense, because of all of the different types of seats.I didn't have to do any unzipping or anything to put the backrest portion of the back seat cover on, thanks to the fact that I have a pretty standard seat for a car, so I just pulled it down like I do to access the trunk and worked the straps into the crack until I could get them to click together, tightened them, then tightened all of the little elastic straps. Both the cover for the seat bottom and back actually fit well, and give the back seat of my car a whole new look.The front seat covers were a bit easier than the back, with no cutting necessary (I just pulled the headrest covers off, rather than cutting them, and they came away easily). Once I pulled the flap through the back like the instructions said, they looked nice and tight-fitting, like they were made specifically for my car. The steering wheel cover wasn't too tough to convince onto the wheel, and the seat belt covers are padded nicely, with strong velcro. Overall, I'm really pleased with this set. The colors are really vibrant, and my old car feels just a bit nicer! I will be purchasing a set for my boyfriend's truck for his birthday.

"I wanted a thermometer that would work in my freezer, because it never seems to work properly so I would like to be able to monitor its temperature. This thermometer is really easy to use, with only two buttons, one for on/off, and one for F/C. I tried it out in my refrigerator first...I love the way that the hook is made to work with pretty much any configuration that your shelves use, because it makes it super easy to install. It worked great in the refrigerator, and seemed accurate. So I switched it to the freezer, and was disappointed to see that a reading of ""LL"" showed on the display. So...either my freezer operates at below -4 degrees fahrenheit, or the thermometer doesn't go low enough to be able to determine the correct temperature of my freezer.

"These cute egg-cups do exactly what they are intended for! I was slightly disappointed, because I thought that I could stack them with egg in them, but they're still really really cool. These are great for serving eggs to my kids without the rolling all over their plates and - heaven forbid - touching something else on their plate! I also like to use these while I bake to keep the eggs I'll be using from rolling away from me or off of the counter. They seem to fit all different size eggs, even the Jumbo size that I buy for easter eggs. I actually painted some cute halloween-themed eggs for the kids one morning with food coloring, and these were great for helping to keep my eggs in place, and keeping the drippy paint off of my fingers. I can almost guarantee I'll be pulling these out for easter-egg coloring time, to help the eggs drain before we put them back into their cartons!These do stack nicely for storage when you're not using them, and they're really easy to wash, too.I received this set of egg holders for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"I LOVE this T-shirt! When I pulled it out of its pretty bag, It looked and smelled so soft, clean, and well-made. It didn't smell like some musty warehouse..it smelled exactly like brand-new clothes in the store. I prayed and prayed that it would fit me well, because I'm a bit too big to be able to easily shop online sometimes. I pulled it on, and fell even more in love! I think it's meant to be a bit oversized on thin girls even though it says slim fit, so it fit perfectly in the shoulders and chest, which is rare for me,it didn't pull too much over my midsection, AND it was an amazing, non-belly-baring length that I absolutely love! I should mention that it felt just as soft on my skin as it did in my hands...think about your favorite soft T-shirt...this is just like that. A heaven T-shirt.I'm always searching for different style shirts to be able to wear with either jeans or a skirt, and this one fits the bill perfectly!

"I chose this set of temporary tattoos to give to my 5 1/2 year old nephew just in time for halloween, and he absolutely loves them! His favorites were the superhero sheet, which he promptly set aside to wear with his halloween costume. He then found the sheet full of bears and wolves, and immediately got us started cutting them apart so that we could cover his arms with them. He was so cute...the little paw prints wrapped around his arms with a little extra to spare, and he loved having ""bears crawling up my arms"", as he put it.The tattoos went on really easily with a washcloth and warm water, but I did that stupid thing that I do every time, and I forgot to take the plastic covering off of one of them, and ended up tattooing the plastic instead of his skin. Oops! Don't forget! After about 4 days of surviving on a little boy's skin, they started to come off, and my sister said that a little bit of baby oil helped her to rub them the rest of the way off that night in the tub.

"Yep, I love this cover! When you have a device like a macbook pro with retina display, you simply can't go without something to protect it from shocks, spills, and dirt without risking decreasing the life of your laptop. In fact, when I bought my laptop through school, I was required to purchase a protective shell as well, but they were all the same. Clear and boring.I love all of the colors available, but chose the dark black color to give my laptop a sleek, professional look. I was not at all disappointed! I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the silicone keyboard cover as well. I recently bought one for my laptop that I like, but I tried the one that came with this, and found that I like it even more. It stays on my keyboard while i type, fits perfectly, and adds to the sleek black look that I'm going for.This shell was really easy to put onto my laptop, and it has a smooth finish. Unfortunately, it's so smooth that it slides down when I set it onto my laptop stand that holds my laptop at an angle. The grippy pads are just so far out that they don't catch the stand at all, so I had to prop the front of it up so that the sliding would stop. It's a little tacky, but it's better than having my laptop sliding downwards as I type. I just hate having such an expensive piece of equipment sitting directly on my desk, because I know I'm a bit of a klutz, and I want to protect my baby from as many spills as possible!I purchased this laptop case at a discounted price for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"These are REALLY long! Lol I think the longest cord I've had in the past was only 6-foot, and this stretches so much farther! I have been searching for a really long cord, because I have a usb-hub plugged into my laptop, and prefer to charge my phone from a cord connected to my hub, but the cords were always too short, and I was forced to keep my phone close to the hub, instead of right next to me where I wanted it.I really like that these cords are extra-thick, and not just the plain skinny cords that we usually get, because my cat has a tendency to chew through the smaller cords. This is a GREAT price for a 3-pack of usb to micro usb cords, as usually I tend to spend about $10 per cord, which piles up quickly when the cat is on a cord-chewing binge. I really hope that the cord inside the plastic is braided like the listing says, but I'm not cutting it apart to find out!  These came individually packaged, so I didn't have to spend any time untangling them or anything silly like that, and I like that I can set the other two aside until I need them.

I have tried liquid eyeliner (runny, tough to apply, comes right off), I've tried pencil eyeliner (so many different brands/styles over the years..a few were great, but ridiculously expensive), crayon-style (again, great, but expensive)...This was my very first gel eyeliner.

(I need to buy a good brush...for the time being, I'm using the brush to my liquid eyeliner from the dollar store, but it works well). I was impressed with how well it actually stayed on..usually the outside corners of my eyes tend to leak just enough that i end up with little black teardrops in the outer corners of my eyes, but this process took a LOT longer with this gel eyeliner.Yesterday, I wore this eyeliner to a funeral...the ultimate waterproof test. After hours of crying and dabbing at my eyes, I was AMAZED at how little of the liner came off onto my tissue! This stuff honestly held up througout the entire day, with very very little coming off.

"This is such a beautiful solution for small-print! I got this as a gift for my mother, who is legally blind but can see directly in front of her. Sometimes small print is still a bit of a bother for her when she's not wearing her glasses, and she's rarely wearing them. Lol in fact, she seems to spend more time searching for her glasses instead of actually wearing them. We bought her a lanyard for her glasses, but they kept knocking into things while she did housework, so that didn't work for her at all.Spending 20 minutes looking for a pair of glasses so that she can read a medicine bottle to find out whether it's the one she wants can get incredibly frustrating, which is where this beautiful magnifying glass comes in! The chain that it comes on is really nice and pretty, yet sturdy, too. It's pretty much always around mom's neck. She likes that it's long enough to use it while she's still wearing it, but can tuck it into her shirt if she doesn't want it to be part of that day's outfit.

"This tempered glass screen protector is so much better than the flimsy plastic one that I just replaced. It worked well, until I got a big scratch in the big plastic that made my keyboard pretty much unusable...Taking off the old screen protector did leave my screen a tiny bit sticky, so I was really glad that this protector came with wipes to clean my screen first. I was actually really impressed, because it came with a wet wipe AND a dry wipe, in addition to the microfiber cloth, ensuring that your screen will be perfectly clean when you install the tempered glass screen protector. They worked really well to get all of the gunk, dirt, and dust completely off of my screen prior to installation. The screen protector itself was cut perfectly for my Note 5, without any overlapping edges, or edges that don't quite go all the way to the edge of the screen, and the cutouts for the buttons and sensors lined up perfectly! I certainly haven't purposely tested the strength of this particular protector, but I have dropped it out of my car onto the concrete (not a really long or hard fall) since installation, and the protector didn't crack or break, and neither did my phone's screen!

The included shot glass that folds into itself is really cool, and the funnel for filling the flask ensures that you won't end up spilling whatever precious liquid you are filling your flask with, and the lid of the flask is attached so you won't lose it on your first time out of the house with it!

I love the fun mishmash of turkeys, snowmen, and pumpkins that grace my home this time of year, so this adorable snowman was the perfect way to make the bathroom one of the many rooms that we decorate for the season! I am impressed with the quality of the fabric, too. The elastic stays on really well. The piece for the top is genius, with the snowman's hat disguising a little holder for tissues that's so neat I never want to take it off! I like the little smiling face of the snowman, and the floor rug with the adorable bow tie really completes the snowman. The kids love this, especially our 3-year-old, who's potty training, and loves to use the 'snowman potty'!I received this seat cover set for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"I really love InstaNaturals' hair masks! I LOVE Keratin treatments for my hair. I've been bleaching and coloring my hair for over 18 years, and have no idea what my 'natural' hair color is...so my hair is, in general, pretty damaged. I love the way that this Keratin hair mask helps to coat and smooth my damaged, dry hair. I use it as a conditioner when I was my hair, an at least once every couple weeks, I take some extra time, and use it as a hair mask. My hair is so much easier to comb through, and it's a lot less frizzy. Unfortunately, less frizz for me means more oil, and I have noticed that this makes my hair tend to get oily more quickly, but my favorite dry shampoo takes care of it without any trouble at all. I think it's totally worth it, because my straightener doesn't fry my dry, frizzy hair anymore because it's got so much more moisture in every strand! I honestly don't know a whole lot about keratin itself, but I know that it's providing amazing benefits to my hair, and a little bit really goes a long way! :DI received this keratin hair conditioner at a discount for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"I really love these, because everyone seems to notice them! Every time I apply I few, I get at least a few compliments...everything from ""You're sparkly!"" to ""Are those real?"". I just giggle and tell them they're the bohotats that I got on Amazon, but that I really do like them more than real tattoos, because I can put them wherever I want, and know that they'll come off, usually within a few days. It really depends where you put it, and how much you wash the area. It also depends on how much you're sweating, I've learned. They don't stand up to more than a few hot days as well as they did to the cooler weeks we've had lately, but they always last at least a few days, even on my arms and wrists!These work just like the temporary tattoos that you used as a kid, only beautiful, intricate, and super-shiny - just cut away the one you want, pull away the protective clear front piece (seriously, don't forget, or you'll have a piece of plastic with a shiny plastic tattoo on it), then put it where you want it, get it nice and wet with a cloth, and wait about ten seconds or so. Pull it away super gently to ensure that it's all stuck to your skin, and you're ready to go! The kids really love these, too.

"I'm so happy to not be constantly throwing away stale chips and snacks anymore. When I got these, I thought that I would be storing them in a drawer, and pulling out one to use every once in awhile for a bag of chips. Boy, was I wrong! It only took a few days, and we had found more uses for the clips than we had clips! We had one on our bag of tortilla chips, one on a snack-size bag of corn chips that didn't get eaten right away, we had one in our cereal box keeping that fresh, one on a bag of pasta, a clip on our bagels, and, sadly, one that my 4-year old broke. I don't suggest you give the kids the clips with the chips, as easy as they are, because after a ton of boredom-induced bending, they will eventually break. I don't blame her, I just miss my clip! We are definitely going to need more than 6, because I have a big bag of popcorn that I want to open. Before, I would just fold the chip bags over and hope they didn't spill everywhere, but this is so much better.

"I've been seeing 'greens' around for a really long time, but I'm one of those people who is skeptical to try something like this, no matter how many people tell me that they like it. I have a really strong sense of smell and taste, so sometimes the nutrient-packed superfoods just aren't for me. This is NOT one of those things. This is for me! I have to admit, I wasn't so sure that I could handle the strong 'green' taste at first...I tried it in my iced cappuccino, and I hated it. Never do that to coffee. Well...try it, but don't try a whole scoop at first, and make sure you take your sweet time mixing it up really really well. Day two I tried it in this little Dole fruit and yogurt smoothie thing, and I was absolutely hooked. I love the smoothies, but I have trouble justifying the amount of sugar that's in them...Drinking my greens in the morning gives me a great reason to drink my favorite yummy smoothies, and the sweet taste of the greens is actually really, really good! I've been using a scoop a day, in the morning, for about a week and a half now. I notice a difference on days when I don't get my greens. I'm a bit run-down, more on-edge, and more likely to really want that afternoon nap.I'm very prone to depression, but refuse to take medication, so I love it when I find an all-natural supplement that gives me the mood boost that I need. I've heard that greens are really amazing for the immune system too, and I have to admit that I had a sore throat this week, but it lasted for one day. That's it. I was pretty impressed!

"I'll admit it. I'm that friend who always has to move a ton of junk around for you to be able to get into my car. Not quite the 'just sit on that stuff' friend, but close. Lol unfortunately, my mom is now legally blind, and has a guide dog, and I give the two of them rides whenever they need to go somewhere while dad's at work. So..I needed a way to learn to keep my car cleaner, especially from 'foodstuffs' that the dog might eat, even though he knows he's not supposed to. This car garbage can is awesome! I do NOT use the included strap to attach it to my car's headrest, because I have a fairly small car, and I'm worried about all of that stuff hitting my daughter in the backseat if we were to get into an accident. So this just hangs out in the backseat, which is actually better, because we can pass it back and forth in the car, instead of everyone passing all of their trash to the person stuck sitting closes to the can. It really has played a huge part in keeping the car a lot cleaner, because we can put all of our trash in it, no matter how yucky, because it's so darn easy to clean. So far I've only had to take it to the kitchen sink and give it a good wash down once, but because it's waterproof it came clean easily, and dried really quickly. I love the sleek, gray look of this, and the fact that it snaps shut so that the trash we've already put in doesn't come out when it gets kicked around a little bit when we're getting into the car. Yay! So much easier and nicer-looking than a plastic bag.

"My boyfriend was so excited when I gave this to him for his new truck. When he bought his truck and traded in his car, he forgot his car charger, so he'd been without power for awhile, and was absolutely thrilled to see that this has 4 ports, so he can charge his cell phone, tablet, my phone, and just about anything else that we can think of at the same time!This car charger doesn't come with a cord at all, but that's not a problem, as we seem to have a bit of an overabundance of USB cords around, anyways. He threw a few in the glove box, so no matter what the situation, we have power! The black color with the blue light looks beautiful and sleek against the dash of the truck, and the lights are really helpful at night, so you aren't searching for the USB plug blindly in the dark.He also really loves the overcharge protection...now he can leave his phone in his truck to charge while he's at work, and his phone will charge quick, and then stop when it's done!

"I absolutely love the look of these wood headphones! The shiny chrome the the black/wood set contrasts so well with the wood pieces, I can't help but feel stylish while I'm wearing these.

I'm not into getting hit by a car because I couldn't hear it! I have a set of bluetooth headphones, but I prefer these because they have a mic, volume control right there in the cord, and even the ability to switch tracks...plus there's not a battery to have die halfway through my ride, which can be really frustrating!The cord is braided and awesomely heavy-duty, so I don't have to worry about it getting caught and stretching to the point of breakage like some cords, and so far my cat hasn't shown much interest in trying to chew through it. (I'll just cross my fingers on that.) They sound really nice, without any added distortion, and even a bit of bass to liven things up for those extra-intense workouts that just need an extra push.

"I love my big dog, and she really loves to go for car rides, especially to the dog park! Unfortunately, she always seems to be shedding, which can lead to embarrassing amounts of dog fur left on my car's seats after we go for a ride. Obviously, this becomes a bit of a problem when I let other people into my car. Even dog lovers mind fur on their clothes when they're all dressed up on the way somewhere. This works SO much better than putting a blanket on the seat, which never stays draped over the back, leaving fur on the back of the seat no matter what I do. Then the second she moves around to get a better look around in the car, the blanket's on the floor, and I've wasted time and a clean blanket!I love how easy this is to use..though if you have bucket seats like me, and already have seat covers installed, the little round piece that fits between the seats might go in if there's not a crack, thanks to the seat cover. I didn't want to take my seat cover off, so I just moved it off to the side so it wouldn't be uncomfortable underneath her, then adjusted it so that it fit onto the bottom of the seat, and clipped it around the top. So easy! The non-slip material on the underside of this seat cover makes this a must-have for leather seats...it takes quite a bit of movement to budge this thing! When it was time to take it out, I just unclipped it at the top, pulled it out, and shook it off before rolling it up and stashing it under the seat for next time. The only thing that would make this cooler would be if it could roll up into itself and create its own little storage pouch to avoid it getting snagged under the seat, but so far I haven't had a single problem...and my seats are so much cleaner!I received this front seat cover for the purpose of my review, but my opinions are 100% my own, and based on MY personal use.

"This review of the performance is taken from Disc 1 of BBC Legends (ICA Classics ICAB 5113), a set of 20 discs of BBC classic performances that contains numerous superb performances of classical works.I first began a 40-year passion for Mahler symphonies when reviewer David Hall of the now-defunct Stereo Review recommended Solti’s highly-charged account of Symphony 8.  I have sought out recordings of this work ever since, each time hoping to find the Holy Grail performance.  When I recently learned of Horenstein’s legacy for this symphony, I was disappointed to find it only available at highway-robbery prices.  I wondered, could it really be worth it?  And the quick answer to that question is YES!I am in general agreement with the bulk of positive comments regarding this performance.  Despite less than superb sound and a wish for a slightly quicker tempo, both in the 1st Movement, and some ensemble imprecision at times throughout, this account approaches very close to the Holy Grail.  It is an emotion-provoking performance of the highest order.  The climaxes are simply awe-inspiring.  I am writing this review during the fourth time I have listened to it in 24 hours.  Nuff said?  I am also hearing orchestral and choral details that I have previously missed in other recordings.  What it must have been like to have heard this performance live.  I can only drool in envy.  If ever a group of musicians performed with more profound inspiration, I’ve never heard it.Needless to say at this point, I cannot recommend this recording more highly.  I am still looking for the Holy Grail, but Horenstein will more than suffice until I find it - if that is even possible!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MUDSFZS3HACK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000I9WX#wasThisHelpful","R3MUDSFZS3HACK","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set of Beethoven’s Nine Symphonies performed by George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra and recorded between 1962 and 1967 has enjoyed classic status for decades.  And well it should!  There isn’t a less-than-excellent performance among these five Sony discs, and most are stellar.  The symphonies are not presented in order of composition but rather economically so they would fit on the fewest discs.  This is somewhat of a pain if you seek to follow the master as his symphony writing matured over the years.  Still, the set is such a bargain that you find it difficult to complain.  The sound may not be exemplary but given the age of the recordings, it requires absolutely no statements of caution or apology – and you bass-lovers will never feel short-changed.As for the music, it is simply sublime.  Szell certainly had the pulse of Beethoven, and I found myself so engrossed in the music that I would have to repeat movements so that I could pound out the review.  It is difficult to pick out favorites, but I found Szell’s Pastoral (coupled with Symphony 1 on the first disc) to be particularly exquisite.  This was my first LP of a Beethoven symphony as a prepubescent and has always been one of my favorites.  In Szell’s hands, it just flows beautifully, with the sonorities bringing more than the occasional tear to my eyes.  Szell allows us to seemingly peer into the heart of Beethoven.  The brass of the 3rd Movement were wonderfully raspy.  The ensuing storm felt like one! The final movement had no shortage of drama and ended with soft intensity.  After over six decades of listening to Beethoven, I am still in awe of the vast range of mood and intensity that he conveyed in his music.  And Szell is second to none in his ability to draw that same range from an orchestra.  This ability is well-demonstrated in the Eroica on Disc 2.  The energy is almost palpable, especially in the fast movements.  Symphony 7 (Disc 3 with Symphony 4) is as fine a performance as I have ever heard and, again, the intensity is arresting.  Ditto for Symphony 5 (Disc 4 with Symphony 2), but Kleiber still reigns supreme.  Symphony 9 for me was the least successful in the set.  The Ode to Joy dragged a bit too much for my tastes.The playing of the Cleveland Orchestra is perfect.  Such precision would be the envy of any orchestra.  So, you have the finest symphonies ever composed (and Overtures), intensely interpreted, spectacularly performed, and at a price not to be beaten.  Needless to say, Very Highly Recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZS9O36V27PEV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EC0VVRA#wasThisHelpful","R2ZS9O36V27PEV","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jesus Arambarri is a Basque composer who lived from 1902 to 1960.  Maurice Ravel came from the same area.  One of Arambarri’s teachers was Paul Dukas.  I was unfamiliar with this fantastic talent before hearing music from this album on Pandora.  I was so impressed that I immediately ordered the album.  This Naxos album, recorded in 2000, contains Arambarri’s Witches on New Year’s Eve, four Impromptus for orchestra, eight Basque Melodies for soprano and orchestra, In Memoriam (an elegy for orchestra, Offering, South Wind, and three Fantasia Espanola.  Performing are the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra under Juan Jose Mena and soprano Itxaro Mentxaka.Witches on New Year’s Eve is a rousing work of three short movements that is sure to get your blood moving in the morning (or any other time of the day, for that matter).  The writing is full of equal parts of energy and interest.  The Impromptu include motifs reminiscent of Witches.  The first is another rousing piece, the second soulful, the third even more so, and the final one takes a more agitated character.  As a group, the Impromptus are delightfully interesting but not enough so to get many replays on my audio system.I must confess not to be an enthusiast of many song cycles.  Vocally, I’m basically a choral guy, but this cycle is gorgeous.  I may actually play it again!  The songs are sure to please lovers of solo voice.  The Soprano sings beautifully with more than a bit of mezzo in her.  The orchestral writing is remarkably interesting and definitely not written as a mere accompaniment.The elegy, In Memoriam, is as expected a wonderful lament that that becomes reanimated at the 4:00 mark and vacillates between grief and glory for the remainder of the piece before ending on a sublime note.  It is just beautiful.  Offering is difficult to describe other than melancholic.  South Wind begins like a lazy, gentle breeze that gains some momentum and intensity as the work progresses.  The final rhythms mark it as a Spanish South Wind.  The album concludes with the three Fantasias espanola.  The first two are easy on the ear and rather dreamy at times. The Fantasia Espanola No. 3 is the longest piece of the entire disc at 7:05.  It erupts ebulliently with sharp idiomatic rhythms and percussion and only loses the dramatic momentum for moments.  Its longer second section is, by contrast, dreamy with flutes playing scale-like passages.  Solo violin introduces an extended melodic theme followed by an up tempo momentum-build to an agitated recapitulation that swells to a grand tutti section that features a galloping prelude to the big finale.  That was just plain fun!The recorded sound is exemplary.  My single criticism of the album is the TINY print that even my reading glasses couldn’t decipher.  But for the music I can only applaud.  My favorites were Witches on New Year’s Eve and the Fantasia espanola No. 3.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLKQCD6I40AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009L4W4#wasThisHelpful","R2XLKQCD6I40AF","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ernst Toch was a fascinating and gifted Austrian composer and pianist who could tout formal training in the disciplines of philosophy, medicine, and music.  Though a highly regarded pianist in Europe, his principal concentration was composing, and he won six music prizes before World War I.  Fleeing Hitler’s Germany, Toch eventually immigrated to the United States where he taught music and philosophy at the University of Southern California and lectured at Harvard.  While on the left coast he wrote some film music but had limited success.  His most memorable achievement in Hollywood was that his music was used for the Frankfort chase scene in the 1937 film, Heide.  In contrast to his disappointing ride in Hollywood, his composition students during that period included Andre Previn and Alex North.  Toch eventually returned to Europe where he taught piano and composition at Mannheim University where Richard Adler was his most notable student.  I have previously reviewed some of Toch’s earlier but distinguished and enjoyable orchestral works performed by the Louisville Orchestra  in these pages.Surprisingly, Toch’s distinguished symphonic work did not commence until 1950, and he composed a total of seven in those last14 years of his life, receiving the Pulitzer Prize for his Third Symphony.  In this CPO set, all seven are performed by the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra with Alun Francis conducting.  Spoiler Alert:  These are skillfully crafted and very accessible modern compositions that deserve far greater recognition and performance than they have generally received.Disc 1 includes Symphonies 1 and 4.  Symphony 1 is rhythmically interesting and very well-orchestrated, but it failed to emotionally involve me.  Best was the 4th Movement, which opens with a series of bold assertions by brass and tympani.  The resulting tension is interspersed with pockets of quiet relief.  Symphony 4 is a 3-movement work with spoken lines separating the movements.  The 3rd Movement is the most intense and involving.Disc 2 contains Symphonies 2 and 3.  Symphony 2 is comprised of four movements and is a far more involving work than Symphony 1 or 4.  The outer movements are characterized by a menacing intensity.  Though clearly a modern symphony, Toch’s Second is much more accessible than those on Disc 1. The 2nd Movement could easily have been marked Dolce and its successor Adagio is immediately involving.  The final movement’s coda is spectacularly bleak with an emphatic use of tympani to underscore the despair in the concluding measures.  Wow!  Symphony 3 won Toch a Pulitzer Prize, but I would have voted for the Second.  The Third is full of interesting ideas, but they just were not enough to engage me until the 4th Movement.  It is agitated and the most emotionally involving movement of the symphony.  Let me tell you, Toch was no slouch when it came to writing climaxes!Disc 3 is comprised of Toch’s final three symphonies, which were composed during an 18 month period when Toch was dying of gastric carcinoma.  Jephta, Rhapsodic Poem is Toch’s 2-movement Fifth Symphony.  A musician expresses feeling most completely by music, and Jephta speaks volumes about the myriad of emotions an individual is likely to experience upon realizing or learning that they have a fatal disease.  I don’t know if it is the musician or psychiatrist within me that hears sadness, anger, denial, despair, mourning, and that child within crying in this music.  At this point in his life Toch, by all accounts, had an urgency to complete his musical mission on earth in the time he had remaining, but his Fifth can certainly be deemed his emotional reaction to discerning or learning of his fate.Symphony 6 begins peacefully, as though Toch had cleared his emotional throat in the Fifth and was back to simply being a composer again.  The 2nd Movement has a charming quality to it, though not without moments of intensity.  The final movement rather explodes onto the scene but quickly gains a melodically melancholic quality that finds quite beautiful resolution towards the movement’s conclusion.  Symphony 7 is typical Toch as represented by his ability to weave multiple ideas and emotions into a single movement.  The 2nd Movement has extended passages of pure joy.  I was unsure what direction the 3rd and final movement would go as I listened.  There is lightness with increasingly frequent hints of profound intent.  The conclusion measures are emphatic but left me with a feeling of being unfinished.  Perhaps it was the perfect epitaph.The Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra plays with precision and the recording captures orchestral sonorities perfectly.  I was particularly impressed with how well-defined the tympani sound.  Toch used percussion brilliantly to underscore the music’s more serious moods.  Alun Francis clearly understands Toch and pulls out all the stops.  Toch was a superb orchestrator and his music seldom fails to maintain the listener’s interest.  My personal favorites were Symphonies 2 and 5, but all except perhaps the First are worthy of repeated listening.  Toch may rate only 4 Stars as a composer, but this complete set is definitely 5-Star!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19NAVNEW3JA6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EQHRYC#wasThisHelpful","R19NAVNEW3JA6K","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It’s difficult not to enjoy beautiful choral music.  I find it less difficult not to enjoy solo vocal music.  And so, for me, this disc of choral music by two of the Twentieth Century’s greatest composers – Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson – represented somewhat of a mixed bag.  The choral music herein is often stunningly beautiful, but I must admit that sections of the works of solo mezzo Luretta Bybee, though she possesses a beautiful voice, were endured rather than enjoyed.  I am certain that those of you who are solo voice aficionados should enjoy the album more.  Gloriae Dei Cantores under Elizabeth C. Patterson performs all of the choral works.The disc begins with Copland’s In The Beginning, followed by his Old American Songs and, finally Four Motets.  In The Beginning is a modern sounding work that failed to win me over.  Old American Songs are a set of five rollicking choral pieces with piano accompaniment that are easy on the ear and sung superbly.  Most are immediately recognizable (Simple Gifts, for example) and completely enjoyable.  The Motets are superb modern choral music.  Help Us, O Lord, unlike In The Beginning, is a moving piece of quiet beauty.  O, Thou Jehovah, Abideth Forever is an interesting piece that reiterates a jumping rhythmic and melodic motif.  Have Mercy On Us, O Lord, like the first motet, has quiet beauty but with greater rhythmic interest.  Sing Ye Praises to Our King, like the others, is modern without the loss of melody of near-conventional harmony.Virgil Thomson has long been a favorite of mine because of his ability to recall hymnal harmonies of yesteryear in his choral compositions.  His Hymns from the Old South is simply gorgeous in every respect and equally moving.  The set of four hymns are some of the most beautiful choral pieces I have ever heard.  I’m sorry I never had the opportunity to sing them back in the choral days of my youth.  It is impossible to pick a favorite among them.  Unlike the case with Copland’s In The Beginning, Gloriae Dei Cantores could not have been recorded with more distinction here.  This is a choral set you MUST hear.  With Mass, for 2-part chorus and percussion, we transition to modern tonal composition, albeit Thomson style.  Dissonances never get in the way of music.  The percussion is minimal, a single snare, for example.  But it works.  De Profundis is a weighty piece, modern enough.  When I Survey the Bright Celestial Sphere is accompanied by six brass instruments.  Although modern, most neophytes shouldn’t find it difficult.The recording is well done but I always wished for a more expansive sound to match the depth of feeling expressed by the chorus in the Copland pieces.  The piano in Songs of the Old Soust is much better recorded with perfect balance with the chorus.  Gloriae Dei Cantores performs with distinction throughout, and I give the album a Very High Recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FY3SSHUCTL66/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000062UT0#wasThisHelpful","R1FY3SSHUCTL66","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 “Titan”  has been one of my favorites since I first heard the Leindsdorf recording back in the 70’s or 80’s.  I am unaccustomed to the Blumine movement and the few times I have listened to accounts that contain it, I have not felt it added much to the 4-movement version, but that may just be a matter of what I am used to hearing.  In this 2004 performance by the Hungarian National Philharmonic Orchestra with Zoltan Kocsis at the helm, I was struck both by interpretation and playing.  This is an exciting, high energy performance.  It was recorded live, and it sounds as though many of the audience had the sniffles that night.  The sound from 2004 is a bit close but top notch, nonetheless.  The brass are just splendid. This account will join my top-shelf recordings of the symphony.  I have found myself listening to it again and again, and let me warn you:  it is capable of evoking emotional expression.  The more I hear it, the more I am impressed.  I must admit that occasionally I felt the pacing could have breathed more, and the ensemble work in tutti sections in Movement 5 is not always absolutely precise, but the interpretation and playing is otherwise superb.  I very highly recommend it to Titan-lovers!  This is one you MUST hear!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDORP9FUBTIC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPP831G#wasThisHelpful","R1TDORP9FUBTIC","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have listened to quite a few Alpine Symphonies over the decades, and it remains my favorite Strauss work.  So, when a new performance comes along, I am eager to hear it.  Most are also-rans to Karajan and Kempe, but this one with Daniel Harding at the helm and the Saito Kinen Orchestra is definitely top shelf.  The Decca disc has only the symphony, and at 51:59, it isn’t a bargain.  Don’t let the total time dissuade you from hearing it, for this is a deep and revealing account with just the right portion of gravitas scattered among its soaring melodic lines.That this performance is not just another flash in the pan is evident from the first few measures of Nacht.  Harding has the pulse of this music like no one else I have heard recently.  I think his interpretation approaches that of the giants.  This music represents Strauss’ love of nature.  He was raised at the foot of mountains and hiked in them often.  This was his religion.  This is what grounded him.  This was his soul.  Throughout the work, we hear a succession of superbly interpreted ideas of profound depth.  Wait.  Was I referring to Strauss or Harding?  The answer is both.  As a musician for six decades, there is an indescribable spark of creative genius that is rarely sensed.  There are more conductors who conduct notes on the score than who make music.  Harding is solidly in the latter camp when it comes to Strauss.  If his Auf dem Gipfel doesn't moisten your eyes, I'll be surprised.  At my age, I can't ignore the end of life any longer.  When it does come (which I hope will be years from now, by the way!), Hardin's Auf dem Gipfel would make a very pleasingl send-off.The recording abounds in perfect phrasing, superb orchestral textures, and profoundly moving ideas.  Orchestral climaxes are gripping and moving.  Softer passages are handled delicately.  Ensemble work is precise.  Sonics are extraordinary.  Soundstage is wide with excellent center fill.  Sonorities couldn’t be more refined.This is a sublime recording.  If you love this powerful, emotional journey through the foothills of the Alps as I do, then Harding’s account must sit alongside Karajan and Kempe on your top shelf, not to displace them but rather to assure us that the finest interpretations have not already passed into history.  I think we have seen only the beginning for this very talented conductor.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCCA1ZQSWSKM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYO8HHS#wasThisHelpful","R3CCCA1ZQSWSKM","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel a certain kinship by proxy with Leopold Stokowski.  I studied piano with Joseph Battista at Indiana University in the mid-1960s.  Battista studied with and was subsequently chosen by the Julliard legend Olga Samaroff to become her teaching assistant in the 1940’s.  Samaroff discovered and married Stokowski, and she has been credited with propelling his career to international fame.  Stokowski would frequently drop in to his wife’s piano classes held for her students.  Stokowski was a colorful figure in the mid-century musical landscape, including an extramarital affair that led to his divorce.  His conducting style and interpretive creativity were equally dramatic, although without moralistic challenges.Only after his death did Stokowski’s love of creating arrangements of classics become widely known.  He composed arrangements of some 200 classical works, four of which are presented on the present BBC Philharmonic label with Matthias Bamert conducting the orchestra.  We hear Stokowski’s arrangements of four works by Mussorgsky:  Pictures at an Exhibition, Boris Godunov: Symphonic Synthesis, A Night on the Bare Mountain, and Entr’acte to Khovanshchina.The first characteristic of this disc to note is the truly exceptional sonics.  I have rarely listened to a recording of such exquisite sound.  A rather sinister A Night on the Bare Mountain is superb from every perspective.  Stokowski clearly had a magical ability to orchestrate.  Throughout this disc his orchestral arrangements pull the listener in and their interesting nature proves thoroughly spellbinding.The same goes for the six sections of the Symphonic Synthesis on Boris Godunov, which begins with begins with such a sweet, melancholic nature.  The 2nd section will be familiar to most and is quite stirring.  You can imagine its initial relentless foreboding music used in a movie on SciFi channel until its melancholic dignity prevails.  The 3rd section begins quietly.  The 4th section is a lively Cossack dance.  The final two sections return to desperation and melancholy, and the final section depicts the Death of Boris.  Frankly, the Symphonic Synthesis is so persuasive, I am going to buy a CD of Mussorgsky’s opera.Khovanshchina is another supremely melancholic arrangement of an unfinished opera that speaks despair and anguish.  It is incredibly beautiful, and I will return to it often.  As a psychiatrist, I have listened to a countless number of tragic stories for which this music would be so appropriate.Familiar to most listeners is Pictures at an Exhibition.  Stokowski’s arrangement is particularly solemn in the Promenade and amazingly beautiful.  Gnomus is quite sinister with a creeping-like quality.  This is NOT party music by any means.  The return of the Promenade is less solemn this time around.  The Old Castle is very close to Mussorgsky’s but slower, lighter and more delicate.  Still the hint of melancholy almost yielding to sinister remains.  Bydlo is a larger, more refined, and more serene until the mid-piece crescendo that ultimately dies away.  The third Promenade is scarcely there compared to its two predecessors but with a sinister undercurrent.  Ballet of the Chickens is another section with strong resemblance to the original.  Samuel Goldenberg and Schmuyle are likewise similar.  Catacombs is drawn out in a quietly dramatic fashion.  This technique is frequently seen in Stokowski’s arrangements.  Con mortuis in lingua mortua is more like a sunset than the original.  The Hut on Fowl’s Legs is more interestingly orchestrated than the original with frequent use of sliding trombone lines, but it retains very similar rhythmic structure.  The Great of Kiev is a mixed bag and perhaps the least successful of the set.  It seems as though Stokowski tried to inject too many tempo changes and add too much drama.  It just seems disjointed.  The coda is a bit overblown.As you might have surmised, Pictures is of variable success but not so the remainder of the disc.  The music is beautifully played and recorded exceptionally well.  Stokowski’s ideas work best in Night on Bare Mountain and the pair of operas.  This is a splendid disc that I recommend very highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FO0PPIA99JFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000AYU#wasThisHelpful","R1FO0PPIA99JFT","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These performances of the Beethoven symphonies with John Elliot Gardiner leading his Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique were originally produced by DG in 1994.  We have here the Archive Production reissue, and it is superb.  The ORR is a 79-member period instrument orchestra of the so-called Historically Informed Performance tradition.  But don’t let that designation scare you away.  You won’t hear any screechy violins that might diminish your enjoyment but their often this sound. Rather, you are in for a real treat.  These are highly (but not overly) charged accounts of the symphonies that are splendidly recorded, and in no way sound 20 years old.  If you, like me, believe that recessed timpani can degrade otherwise wonderful recordings, you will love these accounts, for period drums frankly kick ass.  I have been ambivalent when it comes to Gardiner’s choral work, because too often “charged” becomes “punchy.”  Not so, here.  There is just plenty of good, old-fashioned energy.  No, make that ENERGY!Period instruments provide that “fresh” feel to Symphonies 1 & 2.  LVB was always at the edge in his symphonies, but the lush sound of modern strings dampen one’s ability to imagine being in the original venue and being struck by this brash, new symphony composer.  The Minuetto of Symphony 1 is just glorious.  The profound opening to the 2nd Symphony has plenty of weight, but Gardiner doesn’t belabor its gravity, and there is wonderful flow to the movement.  Unlike many period performances, Gardiner’s tempos don’t seem particularly hurried to my ears.The Eroica is early mature Beethoven from start to finish, but Gardiner gives the listener more to appreciate in way of more pronounced dynamics and a slightly faster flow with more lightness in the softer passages.  The Scherzo is appropriately intense, and climactic passages are everything you could hope for from period instruments, that is unless you are an enthusiast of overbearing gravitas.  Likewise, the Finale is full of intensity and, when appropriate, majesty.  Gardiner allows me to hear the parts better without sacrificing the sense of intensity.  I certainly enjoyed his approach and will return to this Eroica often.  In Gardiner’s hands, Symphony 4 sounds like a more mature work than its predecessor, and it most clearly demonstrates Gardiner’s ability to peel away the cobwebs of tradition while preserving the music’s dignity.  I think his account has quickly become my favorite performance of the 4th.  You have to hear it!Gardiner’s account of the 5th Symphony is excellent.  It has elements of Kleiber’s electricity along with some very sweet passage work at times (remember, Beethoven was not completely hell-bent on scaring the bejesus out of us in this work).  The brass are especially impressive.  The 2nd Movement has just the right ebb and flow.  Tempos seem spot-on to me across the board. There is grandeur everywhere.  The final coda in the 2nd Movement is simply beautiful, but the grand rush to the concluding bars lacks a bit of weight.  It is during this symphony that I really missed the power and forces that the modern orchestra can give interpreters such as Carlos Kleiber.  When the 3rd Movement yields to the 4th, there is electric intensity under Gardiner’s baton.  This is one of my (and probably everyone else’s, as well) favorite symphonic movements, and the orchestra does not disappoint.  Not as white-hot as Kleiber, I’ll grant you, but it is a piece of very fine orchestral work.  Brass and timpani are both thrilling and don’t be surprised if it evokes some teary eyes.  (I must confess, however, that mine will moisten with lesser accounts.)  The final accelerando again made me wish for greater forces.An LP of Symphony 6 was my first Beethoven symphony as pubescent kid.  I still love it!  Gardiner’s interpretation is Pastoral without ever sacrificing intensity.  The 2nd Movement, however, was clearly played by period strings which seemed thinner than I would have expected after listening to the previous five symphonies.  The horns of the 3rd Movement are glorious, and the lower strings are equally impressive.  The real test of period orchestral forces is, of course, the storm scene of the 4th Movement.  The ORR passed with conditional honors, a very honorable effort, to be sure.  After the storm clouds subside, we are back to some very fine music making with only a trace of lightness in terms of weight.  When the theme appears in the prominent horns (or should) in the 5th Movement, I had to strain to hear them.  What a curious engineering snafu.Symphony 7 with Gardiner and the ORR is a veil-lifting experience.  Although I love what a modern orchestra can do with this symphony, I experienced the sensation that was hearing more of what was in Beethoven’s creative mind at the moment of composition when listening to the current forces.  The Allegretto moves along with melancholic intensity at an unhurried pace.  It was simply beautiful, and the period instrument climaxes were excellent.  Symphony 8 comes through with surprising success.Symphony 9 is more of a mixed bag.  From the onset, the thin period violins once again made me wish for instrumental modernity.  Violin issues aside, this performance demonstrates the same intensity, slightly faster but unhurried tempos of its predecessors. The 2nd Movement (the old theme for NBC’s Huntley and Brinkley Report before John Williams got in there, for those of you old enough to remember the news show) is beautifully played but there was frequently a wish for modern instruments and their added richness and weight, especially in tutti passages.  The same issue is seen in Symphonies 3-8.  Movement 3 offers a needed respite from the agitation of the 2nd Movement, and it should be highlighted in Gardiner’s resume.  It is that lovely.  The final movement is hugely successful.  The soloists are uniformly stellar, but the relatively small size of the chorus is a negative factor.I must apologize for the length of this review, but there was just so much that needed comment.  Needless to say, I very much enjoyed Gardiner’s cycle.  The recorded sound is pristine and somewhat close.  For who enjoy period performances, this period Beethoven cycle is second to none.  For me, I prefer the modern orchestra for its richness and weight, but these performances are very impressive.  I found Symphonies 4 and 8 to be the best of the cycle.  They seem to defy the limitations of period instruments better than the others.  Honorable mention goes to the 3rd, 5th and 7th.  In each of the symphonies, however, Gardiner opens the drapes and gives superbly interpreted performances.  I will return to 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 often.  Very Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH232VZRGKC7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000057EO#wasThisHelpful","RH232VZRGKC7M","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn’t listen to much contemporary music when I was young, preferring instead the safe confines of music from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.  As I got older (and older, and older), I began exploring the non-standards, finding initially that such music swept cobwebs away and kept mental rust from forming.  It took a series of decades for me to fully appreciate post-impressionist music, music that I now so enjoy exploring.  In the present London album from 1994, we get two American originals:  Edgard Varese and Charles Ives – composers once deemed heretical by the classical music faithful.  Performing is the Cleveland Orchestra under the direction of Christoph von Dohanyi.Varese was born in France but migrated to the U.S. in the early 1920’s.  Here he produced most of his compositions.  The present album begins with Varese’s gigantic Ameriques, his second major work.  This work is scored for a massive orchestra including13 percussion instruments including a fire siren, cyclone whistle, and crow call! (Large sized orchestras are not unusual for Varese.  He called for 120 musicians for his work, Arcana.  Ameriques calls for 27 winds and29 brass.)  Varese spent his compositional life looking for new orchestral sonorities, and more than a few will delight you in Ameriques.  The work is a sprawling piece that visits a multitude of musical ideas at a fast, highly charged pace.  The work is not initially high on the accessibility scale, and the plethora of percussion instruments and the endless series of climaxes help sustain one’s interest along the way.  Nothing in Ameriques stays the same for long.  Tempos and musical thoughts are varied and constantly evolving.  Ameriques is like a swirling musical kaleidoscope.  You will be hard-pressed to identify conventional melodies. Varese keeps the interest high, but for me, the real listening pleasure only began to open up to me in the second and third sessions.  So, don’t be discouraged if the piece at first seems bewildering.  The final measures are a spectacular sonic experience – snares, siren and all.After Ameriques, Ives’ Symphony 4 seems almost conventional by contrast.  Although Ives composed the symphony between 1909 and 1916, the full, revised work’s premiere wasn’t until 1965 with the American Sympony Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski – ever the champion of new American music – and two assistant conductors (in the 4th Movement) including Jose Sebebrier!  Symphony 4 is divided into four movements:  a prelude, a comedic second movement, a majestic fugue third movement, and a spiritually inspired finale.  As common in Ives’ works, glimpses of traditional hymns make frequent appearances.  The fugue-like 3rd Movement is one of Ives most luscious pieces of writing.  It has always fascinated me that a composer who could at times write music that sounded cataclysmic could produce such inspirational music of the highest order.  The 4th Movement begins quietly and never completely gives away that placidity.  Ives believed it was his musical zenith and had “… something to do with the reality of existence and its religious experience.”  The Unanswered Question, an essay on the meaning of existence, is the final work on the disc.  And the Answer is never found.This is a splendid disc of once-new American classics.  Sonics are first rate.  Dohnanyi is one of our greatest conductors.  The disc is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39SX1B2I9MBTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000423G#wasThisHelpful","R39SX1B2I9MBTH","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"John McCabe is an English composer and pianist.  As a pianist, he gained a certain degree of fame by recording the complete Haydn sonatas.  As a composer, he claims no particular style.  In the Hyperion disc under review, we hear his Fourth Symphony entitled Of Time and the River and his Flute Concerto.  Performing is Vernon Handley and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.Of Time and the River is structured as a two movement work with each movement further subdivided.  In the end, you get two movements, five tempi, and a total of 12 sections.  The listening experience is a constantly shifting musical work.  Elements prominent in this Fourth Symphony are repetition, an assortment of sonorities, traces of minimalism, and even traces of tonality.  Each section of the work seems to generate a rhythmic and melodic motive related to the 1st section of the movement and develop it.  This sometimes becomes a bit tedious.  The penultimate section is a robust recapitulation of the 1st section of the 1st movement, while the 47-second final section offers the symphony a few last dying breaths.  There is considerable beauty in this symphony, but we may be too close in time to the composition to deliver valid verdicts.  Only time will tell if McCabe’s work survives, but given the sometimes tedious nature of the work, I don’t think you can predict its chances as certain.The Flute Concerto is of a similar ilk to the symphony, including repetition, an assortment of sonorities, some traces of minimalism, and perhaps a greater number of hints of tonality.  I found the Concerto less interesting, no doubt because as a pianist, listening to 25 minutes of flute is just excessive.  The Concerto is organized as a single, 12-section movement of contrasting tempi and dynamics.  The final section is reminiscent of the symphony in that it, too, dies off softly.The BBC Symphony performs this often-tedious work with skill and energy.  The recorded sound is superb, and I found no issues in soundstage, center fill, or orchestral balances.  I can recommend the performances very highly, but the compositions themselves do not inspire nor lend themselves to eager repeated listening sessions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YLVN48UMQ0LM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000031WGJ#wasThisHelpful","R1YLVN48UMQ0LM","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As atonal music, neither Andrzei Panufnik’s Sinfonia Votiva (Symphony No. 8) nor Roger Sessions’ Concerto for Orchestra are easy listening for most music-lovers.  In the Hyperion disc under review, we hear both works performed by Seija Ozawa and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  For me, this is music I simply listen to and absorb. I do NOT try to understand or analyze it at first (and it’s not like I am going to perform some Vulcan Mind Melt on atonal music later, either!). Both works share some characteristics besides atonality.  Both begin rather sparsely with increasing vitality and complexity ensuing.Panufnik is a very structured composer who practically calculates his music with engineering precision.  Naturally, few compositions are designed to be haphazard, but modern atonal music IS distributed along a continuum between sounding, for lack of a better word, haphazard and structured.  Panufnik stands are the latter end.  In Sinfonia Votiva, every note’s harmonic and temporal position sounds very determined.  It is much the same with Sessions’ Concerto for Orchestra.  The Sinfonia Votiva’s 1st movement begins with a series of slow melodic intervals played by flute that are answered by the xylophone.  From here the complexity and number of instruments involved gradually increases including the addition of percussion, and the intervals now becoming atonal lines and dissonant chords.  The tempo, too, increases gradually.  The effect of all of these gradual increases is quite interesting and actually rather attractive.  The 2nd movement begins much more aggressively with trumpets sounding quickly repetitive chords under the violins attempt at a reaching melodic line.  The music intensifies with significant use of cymbals and brass.  There is an attempted reversion to calmer waters, but the repetitive, agitated rhythm pulls the music back into the fray. A veritable feast-frenzy of instrumental agitation concludes the work as a note on the tubular bell gradually vanishes.Sessions’ Concerto for Orchestra has greater complexity, density, and more rapid increases in that complexity than its predecessor.  Also, Sessions’ atonality is less stark that Panufnik’s.  The work is structured in three linked movements and was completed in 1981.  Sessions work is more difficult to describe than Panufnik, but equally if not more enjoyable.  As it is denser, the Concerto for Orchestra bears greater resemblance to more conventional tonal music than does Panufnik.  The work opens with an announcement of its vitality but soon the tempo, complexity, and dynamics begin to vary.  The music is never anywhere for long.  Definitely no time for boredom!  Sessions’ writing is exquisitely interesting and for that reason equally appealing.  He produces very attractive sonorities.  Even more to the listeners liking is his unique ability to move the music through one beautiful passage after another.  This is music that is far easier to hear than to describe.I find atonal music difficult to describe, so I just listen and try to be simply open to what comes my way.  What I can say is that the experience is very enjoyable with both works.  Difficult music, yes, but absolutely worth the effort.  The performances have the benefit of exemplary sound.  The orchestra plays with incredible precision and feeling.  These may be strange sounds to some listeners steeped in tonal music, but they should be explored and never be prematurely dismissed as too difficult.  For me, this is top shelf atonal music of the highest kind, and the album gets my ABSOLUTE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJU1P9U12C0DS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000666BF#wasThisHelpful","RJU1P9U12C0DS","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Symphony No. 2 is Johannes Brahms's most lyrical symphony, and it has received a host of superb recordings.  The present 1981 DG disc presents the account by Carlo Maria Giulini and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.Giulini immediately conveys that his will be an intense, emotional interpretation but not at the expenses of the lyrical element.  The 1st movement is typical of Giulini's approach.  Forte tutti's are forceful but the softer passages are sublime.  The 2nd movement is beautifully played and sweet as can be.  Yet, Giulini always supports the interpretation with an intense undercurrent of emotion.  The sublime is never far from the tension, and the final two minutes reveal the inner substance to be the juxtaposition of lyricism and strength.  The 3rd movement is a walk, simple and innocent, then a serious, intense dance, but one of joy.  The 4th movement begins softly with the glorious explosion of full orchestra confirming the intensity that joy can contain.  I have heard some beautiful accounts of this symphony, such as the surprisingly robust recording of Celibidache, but I can't think of one that tops this in any meaningful way.  The final minute of the movement is the greatest I have ever heard.  It is truly astonishing!When you listen to Giulini's masterful account of this wonderful symphony, you get the feeling that this must be what the master intended.  It feel that right.  I would not complain if this was the only account I could ever listen to again.  The sound is fully supportive of the majesty of the reading.  Despite the 1981 recording date, this early digital recording bears few if any of the faults so common in recordings from that period.  The brass may be the slightest bit grainy, but there is no early digital over-brightness.  Soundstage and center fill are superb.  This one is capable of evoking tears and that's what makes it magical.  It easily gets my ABSOLUTE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FP8QMZ2SY5E7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0025OC7BY#wasThisHelpful","R2FP8QMZ2SY5E7","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Virgil Thomson was multitalented and could have been a writer or musician.  So, he chose both, and composed while also working as a music critic.  Growing up, he was a friend of the granddaughter of Joseph Smith.  This proved fortuitous, because when his family couldn’t afford to send him to college, Thomson received help from the Mormon church.  After graduation, he moved to Europe and studied with famed French composition teacher Nadia Boulanger whose other noted American students included Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Elliott Carter, and Walter Piston (pretty much a Who’s Who of 20th century American music).  While in Europe, Thomson formed friendships with James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Aaron Copland, Ezra Pound, Igor Stravinsky, Pablo Picasso,  and Orson Welles.  When Thomson returned home to America in 1940, he landed the position of music critic with the NY Herald Tribune alongside Aaron Copland.  Although Thomson may be as well or better known as a film composer, he wrote three symphonies which we hear on the present Naxos disc.  The works are played by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra under the baton of James Sedares.Symphony 2 opens with a lively, simple tune in a movement marked as Allegro militaire, but the music sounds more peasant-like than military.  Thomson had a true gift for the simple melody.  The structure of the 1st movement is anything but long-lined, and it sounds more like a musical stream of consciousness than coherent composition.  The 3rd movement is much the same.  Interesting to hear and pretty but not enough to repeat the experience very often.The Symphony 3 is quite different, opening with soft timpani, gong and cymbals.  The 1st movement is a serious piece but only a little more complex than its predecessor.  The 2nd movement is delightful, tuneful, and happy, even in the minor mode passages.  The 3rd movement Adagio is slow ala Thomson, i.e. NOT grave by any means.  The theme is actually lovely.  The 4th movement begins with a very Classical Period sound.  This may be the movement with the greatest intensity but I hesitate to call it intense.  The piece ends softly.Pilgrims and Pioneers is a lovely work that was originally the score for a film about immigration to American that was shown in the United States Pavillion at the 1964 World’s Fair in Seattle.  It is a dissonant series of vignettes and hardly a coherent work.Symphony on a Hymn Tune is a work inspired by the hymns How Firm a Foundation and Yes, Jesus Loves You.  I think this is the finest work on the disc.  Although written in 1926 while Thomson was living in Paris, it is a mature-sounding work.  It structured as four movements but really represents a near-endless set of variations on the two familiar hymns.  The other works on this disc are certainly skillfully composed, but the Symphony on a Hymn Tune is by far the most enjoyable.  This Is one that I will put on my Fiio X-5.This is an interesting disc comprised of Virgil Thomson’s more serious orchestral works (in contrast to his film scores).  The Symphony on a Hymn Tune is the highlight of the album.  The playing is superb.  Soundstage is quite good.  For the Symphony alone, this disc is VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKS4DWEKWB1UC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004D3IW#wasThisHelpful","RKS4DWEKWB1UC","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"American modern music composer Christopher Rouse was Born in Baltimore, MD in 1949.  His music education began with an undergraduate degree from Oberlin and graduate degrees from Cornell where he studied with Karel Husa.  He also studied privately with George Crumb. After holding faculty positions at the University of Michigan and Eastman School of Music, Rouse moved to the Juilliard School of Music in 1997 where he teaches composition. His most successful student is Michael Torke. Stylistically, Rouse is considered a neoromantic composer who often blends tonal and atonal music in his compositions.  In the 2004 Ondine disc under review, Leif Segerstam and the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra perform Rouse's Der Gerettete Alberich, Rapture, and Violin Concerto.The album begins with Der Gerettete Alberich, a percussion concerto inspired by Wagner's dwarf character Albrecht in Gotterdammerung who survives with the Rhinemaidens.  The piece opens with a musical flashback to the opera before moving forward a century.  Der Gerettete Alberich imagines various moods of Albrecht following his survival.  The music is predominantly atonal, so don't look for a recognizable melody.  The three-movement work is interesting with some wonderful tutti climaxes and dazzling percussion solos. The slow 2nd movement begins with high-pitched violins and occasional notes from the steel drum.  This section of the work actually presents a brief but beautiful and mournful melodic line.  The 3rd movement could wake up the dead with its STRONG Big Band influence (there is a drum set!) .  The drum solos are energized.  You can't help but enjoy the 3rd movement!Rapture opens slow and tonal.  There is something very beautiful about the work as it builds into a brass chorale in the first few minutes.  The piece progressively builds further with tension, intensity, and complexity of texture increasing.  The ascent isn't smooth and there are repeated flashbacks to earlier in the flight.  Rouse is rightfully acclaimed for his orchestration and especially for his exquisite writing for percussion, and the timpanist in particular gets a workout.  Oh yes, there was plenty of lactic acid accumulating in this piece.  I don't see how any listener couldn't have fun listening to this work.  It is just over the top!I generally shy away from two genres of music, solo voice or instrument (other than piano) and violin concertos.  But this violin concerto (and Brahms, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Tchaikovsky, and Bruch) are exceptions to the rule.  Moreover, I had anticipated that a modern one would be even more difficult to endure.  Not so!  This one is endlessly fascinating.  Of course I miss the conventional melodic lines, but the fascinating writing for the violin kept me in the spell.  This is a two-movement work.  The Barcarola begins slowly with solo violin.  A second joins in, then viola.  Their trio is soft and mesmerizing, but the orchestra explodes with profundity.  Calm is reestablished and the violin carries the melodic line over a glimmering accompaniment.  At about 4:30 a tutti climax seems to signal a premature close, but the music resumes with a faster tempo to another pause. Now, the pace quickens again with a constantly moving melodic line.  Another section appears with similar organization, and the solo, duo, trio reemerges.  The orchestra awakens with a set of intervals with timpani to close another section.  Finally, solo violin reappears over soft timpani, a wonderful effect that concludes the movement.  The 2nd movement Toccata opens quietly but excitedly.  The agitation sometimes leans toward frenetic.  Occasional brass chords are sounded incessantly with increasing rhythmic complexity.  No one sleeps while listening to the Toccata!  Soloist Cho-Liang Lin performs admirably with little rest.  Rouse gives us a rest with a slow melancholic interlude at about 6:30 before the music again picks up tempo at about 9:30 when the music becomes rather furious.  Solo violin plays agitatedly to the close when an brief orchestra flourish concludes the work.This is a fascinating album of Rouse.  For me it is the Big Band 3rd movement of Der Gerettete Alberich and Rapture that steal the show, but the Violin Concerto was quite an interesting work.  The sound is exemplary, with excellent soundstage and center fill.  Another highly successful Christopher Rouse disc that deserves a VERY HIGH RECOMMENDATION!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D0NSY2L5ZDHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001BS40G#wasThisHelpful","R2D0NSY2L5ZDHO","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to take a long paragraph to familiarize you with the personal experiences of Otto Klemperer that helped shape the conductor responsible for the set of recordings under review.  If you would like to move directly to the review, you may skip to the next paragraph now.  Ever notice that in all of the photographs of Otto Klemperer, his face was suggestive of a stern or depressed individual?  Actually, both are true and more.  He suffered humiliating attacks on his character and dismissal from his post at the Kroll Opera in 1933 Berlin by the recently elected Nazis, because he had the audacity as a Jew to conduct a production of Wagner's Tannhauser.  Actually, Klemperer had converted to Catholicism shortly before then to marry his wife but for the Nazis, once a Jew, always a Jew.  After the Nazis issued an arrest warrant, he reluctantly fled his homeland to America, leaving his family until he could send for them.  Once in the U.S., he was appointed conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  He subsequently sought posts at Philadelphia and New York, but he was passed over in both cases.  Klemperer's facies was the consequence of the excision of a brain tumor the size of a small orange in 1939 which left him with considerable facial paralysis.  Throughout his life he suffered from bipolar disorder (manic depression) and was hospitalized once in New York.  During the 1941 ordeal, he was arrested as a deranged individual and was briefly jailed.  To literally add personal insult to injury, the New York Herald Tribune ran a pathetic, humiliating photograph of him behind bars prior to his commitment to a mental hospital.  Later, he was severely burned in a fire from smoking in bed, a matter made only worse by Klemperer's tragic attempt to douse the flames with a flammable liquid.  In 1951, he suffered a severe fall on a conducting trip to Montreal.  Afterwards, he had to conduct from a seated position.  When the U.S. refused to renew his passport in 1952 because of his leftist views, Klemperer returned to Europe.  Having suffered a relentless series of physical and emotional infirmities during his life, it is no surprise that Otto Klemperer may have become a stern individual or a stern conductor, but his facies and other physical disabilities obscured a musician of the highest order, a fact to which these recordings attest.I note the above because there is a remarkable contrast between the Klemperer of record and the Klemperer ON record. In the set of four EMI/Warner discs under review, the legendary conductor reveals his insights into some of the major works of Johannes Brahms:  the four symphonies, Haydn Variations, Alto Rhapsody, and Ein Deutches Requiem.  Performing is the Philharmonia Orchestra.  The recordings date from 1954 to 1961.  The Haydn Variations are in mono.  They were all produced by the famed Walter Legge, whose recordings opened the world's eyes to Klemperer's genius.The set begins with the Brahms Haydn Variations on Disc 1.  I don't really know how to explain Klemperer's performance here except to postulate 1) that he may have been suffering a mood episode of his Bipolar Disorder that interfered with his usual intense expressiveness, 2) that the relatively degraded quality of the mono master tapes prevents us from hearing correct orchestral balance and sonorities, a possibility that would prevent other aspects of his expressiveness to show through, or 3) some combination of both.  The detail is all there but the typical Klemperer expressiveness is diminished beginning with the tempo itself often sounds a little rushed.  Adequate evaluation of the performance is almost impossible because of the negative bias that is created by mono recordings, and to make matters worse, because it appears that the master tapes suffered some degradation as evidenced by the thin sound of the recording.  None of this is to say that the performance is bad.  It is not.  But it is also not up to the interpretive level of the symphonies and requiem.Symphony 1 is partnered with the Variations on Disc 1.  It is a splendid reading of the Brahms First.  The 1st movement flows a bit faster than some, but the expressiveness of the interpretation is certain.  This is a performance that is weighted towards the lyrical elements rather than the aggressive ones.  The 2nd movement reveals less of the mushy, romantic side of Brahms (as if Brahms even had any histrionic aspect to his musical self) and, instead highlights clarity.  Brahms and Klemperer both studied relentlessly the music of Bach and Beethoven to learn classical forms and probably had an ear for clarity that is reflected in the works of Brahms and Klemperer's interpretation of those works.  It is interesting to consider the possibility that Klemperer's interpretations are truer to the composer's intent than other conductors.  In fact it makes sense that Brahms' wrote his thick textures with the assumption that interpreters would be especially careful not to thicken them further by mush.  The 3rd and especially the 4th movements benefit from Klemperer's ear for clarity of texture.  Don't read into this that Klemperer's clean interpretation lack the monumental element.  Just listen.  As critic Joseph Horowitz once stated, ""Klemperer's most characteristic performances, rigorously projecting outward design, amassed a magisterial poise and weight.""  The conductor has an uncanny ability to preserve the lyrical and the monumental element simultaneously.  There are only rare interpretations of Brahms First that can equal the satisfaction that Klemperer gives the listener.  Of course the clarity that Klemperer achieves would not be possible without the precision that the Philharmonia gave to their conductor.  Just listen to the final minute of the 4th movement to hear it all come together in one long, glorious, heaven-sent moment.Disc 2 begins with Symphony 2, one of Brahms most lyrical, and here will not unpredictably find Klemperer giving what some might call a lean interpretation, especially when compared the excesses that other conductors bring to their performances.  There is no lack of weight, however, to the 1st movement.  Rather, we hear sweet majesty.  If any criticism can be levied it is that at times, the tempo feels like it should be broadened.  The 2nd movement Adagio is less Adagio than one would expect but at no expense to the drama.  The 3rd movement is perfect in tempo, innocence, and weight.  It conveys an innocent happiness that feels right.  In those minor mode passages, the mood dampens only briefly.  The loud tutti passages have adequate weight without ever being overblown.  In the 4th movement, Brahms dropped any nave elements in preference to mature joy which normally contain traces of the profound.  Klemperer is magical here, producing a mood that we psychiatrists would term euthymic.  Brahms concludes his symphony with joyful but profound majesty, and Klemperer gets it perfectly!In contrast to the frequent lightness of his Second, Brahms' Symphony 3 explores the deep parts of the soul.  The 1st movement is a hodgepodge of faces within that most mysterious part of who we are.  There is the anguished opening theme, light figurative passages, and the serious, pensive corner of the soul or unconscious mind.  In the 2nd movement, Brahms conveys an almost prayerful state, full of calm and rightness with the world.  It is one of Brahms most beautiful movements.  The brief excursions towards melancholy never are allowed to dominate the landscape for long.  The longing of the 3rd movement never quite gets to anguish.  Instead, you can feel the mood vacillate between joyful and melancholic memories.  A similar feeling permeates the 4th movement, only the intensity awakens in full dress uniform.  If the 3rd movement represented longing, then the 4th demonstrates ""I can't live without you.""  Anguish played by the violins blooms and then visits beauty and back to anguish and back and forth.  As tension quietly grows, so does the progressive resolution to the deep peace of acceptance.Disc 3 contains the Academic and Tragic Overtures as well as the Alto Rhapsody.  The Academic Festival Overture has always been one of my very favorites but here is played at a tempo that robs it of some of its youthfulness.  At the same time, I heard detail and instrumental lines that I didn't know were hidden within the score.  That aspect was fascinating.  As the overture progressed, the tempo quickened and intensity increased.  Now things sounded as they should.  When the coda that always makes me think of ivy-covered wall, Klemperer moves to a slower majestic pace with all of the weight the music deserves. (But I think the music would have appreciated a majestic that was a few beats per minute faster!)  The Tragic Overture is less to my liking in both composition and performance tempo.  I don't consider it on the level of beauty the other Brahms works and Klemperer's pace does nothing to further its case.  With regard to the Alto Rhapsody, I generally stay away from the solo voice, and will defer comments on the performance to those reviewers who appreciate such works more than I do.  I will say that the men's choral element is very persuasive and the orchestra is no less so.Brahms' Symphony 4 1st movement under Klemperer's baton just flows.  It is lyrical without sacrificing its power.  What is missing is that element of excitement.  The finest, most exciting Fourth is unquestionably Carlos Kleiber with the Vienna Philharmonic.  You can find my review of this magnificent account under that listing. Klemperer, to my ears, cannot compare to Kleiber in this symphony.  The 2nd movement is almost redemptive.  Klemperer and the Philharmonia shine in all respects.  The intensity is ever-present and the movement is a moving account.  The 3rd movement is almost successful but the tempo holds it back as does a slight pause that I am unaccustomed to hearing (and don't like).  But otherwise, the tutti sections are near-perfect in performance.  Somehow, the intensity of the 3rd movement fades in the 4th which never seems to get off the ground.Disc 4 is Klemperer's account of Ein Deutches Requiem.  It is classic, and I have reviewed this seminal performance elsewhere on Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/Brahms-Deutsches-Requiem-Elisabeth-Schwarzkopf/dp/B0032HKEPO/ref=sr_1_5?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1409522063&sr=1-5&keywords=brahms+requiem+klempererThis set of symphonies and other orchestral/choral works by Johannes Brahms performed by Otto Klemperer and the Philharmonia Orchestra is a mixed bag.  Symphony 1 and Ein Deutsches Requiem are complete successes, and the latter is the definitive performance of the work.  Portions of the remaining works approach such lofty heights, but none are performances that are particularly top shelf.  Still, as a collection and in respect for the performances of Symphony 1 (of which there are equally compelling accounts such as Celibidache - no kidding!) and the Requiem which is definitive, the set deserves a High Recommendation!!  You can purchase the Requiem separately and thereby obtain the essential work from this collection while saving money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCX823MGVY4HP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A4AI19I#wasThisHelpful","RCX823MGVY4HP","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We bought two of these cord caddies to wind our anchor rope at the bow and stern of our 20' pontoon boat.  We use 1/2"" double braided nylon line for 100' of anchor rope.  The gizmo works well for something that sells for less than 10 bucks but there are a couple of imperfections that should be noted.  First, the rope should be under a minimal amount of tension in order for the rope to wind around the spool properly.  Second, someone must feed the line back and forth across the width of the spool to fill it evenly.  Third, the rope can easily go between the spool and the vertical piece that attaches to the handle.  Fourth, the unit is quite flimsy.  BUT you get what you pay for.  The metal units are $150 and up.  So, I would definitely recommend the K-100 because it is better than nothing, and it is so inexpensive.

"This is one of those discs that just delights with its wonderfully-lively music and superb sonics.  We have Roger Norrington and his London Classical Players of yesteryear giving performances of seven popular Overtures by Gioachino Rossini on this 1991 EMI disc.  I'm not sure how authentic the orchestra instruments are to Rossini's day, but each overture is fresh and lively.  I especially like tracks 1 through 7 (grin).  The disc is really that much fun, and I don't think there is a weak performance on the entire disc. The William Tell Overture could have been a bit more propulsive, but that is the only criticism I think fair.The London Classical Players were comfortable with the music covering three centuries and always played with precision and polish be the fare Handel, Bach, Beethoven, or Rossini.  The sound is glorious with just the right bit of reverberation.  Soundstage and center fill were both excellent as were orchestral sonorities.

"John Pickard is a was born in 1963. He studied composition with Louis Andriessen at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague, Netherlands and in 1989 obtained his PhD in composition from the University of Wales. He currently teaches composition at the University of Bristol.  Pickard's compositions are known for their powerful, large-scale musical architecture.  He has written four symphonies of which No. 4 is presented on this BIS Super-Audio disc along with Eden, a work for brass band.  Performing is the Eikang-Bjorsvik Musikklag led by Andreas Hanson.  Both works are scored for a standard British band.The album begins with Eden, a 15-minute, three section work inspired by the final lines in Milton's ""Paradise Lost.""  The 1st section, entitled Tsunami, depicts Adam, Eve, and the serpent by euphonium, cornet, and trombone.  It opens with sustained chords but then proceeds with introducing the principal characters.  The theme is reminiscent of the opening theme to the movie Superman.  See if you aren't reminded of the same.  The remaining music represents a duet between Adam and Eve.  The music livens up, but I must confess that the music isn't the most beautiful I have heard.  The 2nd section is somewhat fast and furious.  The 3rd section is slow and quite beautiful.  Despite a meager beginning, the 3rd section of the work was immensely enjoyable.The Gaia Symphony opens pensively with brass chords over maracas before the pace quickens.  The 1st movement, Tsunami, has strong jazz and minimalistic undercurrents.  The orchestration is very fine but less so than Rouse works, some of whose works I reviewed earlier.  Still, this is excellent albeit not the greatest modern music.  I found the tutti passages far more enjoyable than the small ensemble work.  Between each movement are 2-4 minute Windows.  The one that follows the 1st movement (Water - Fire) is primarily percussive.  The 2nd movement, Wildfire, is one of near-perpetual motion.  There are few melodic elements of any consequence, and the movement is largely one of brief motifs that are often repetitive.  In Window 2 (Fire-Air), the Fire is EXTREMELY LOUD - loud enough to crack speaker cones, so test it out on low volume first.  I'm sorry but this is sound effect - NOT music!  The 3rd movement, Aurora is a calm meandering piece.  Window 3 (Air - Earth) begins with a continuation of what sounds like the 3rd movement.  The 4th movement, Men of Stone, has a slow tempo and also meanders to successive crescendos.  After 4 minutes, the pace quickens as does the inherent interest to some degree.  The symphony has a nice, conventionally tonal finish.I don't want to be too hasty and simply dismiss Pickard as an also-ran, but the works on this album do not inspire confidence in him as a great composer.

"Christopher Rouse was born in Baltimore and teaches at Juilliard in NYC.  His most prominent student is Michael Torke.  Rouse has composed more than 50 works, and he is regarded as one of the most audience-pleasing composers of the 20th (and now, 21st) century.  He was trained at Oberlin and Cornell and studied with Karel Husa and George Crumb.  I just reviewed a stellar album of his music performed by Marin Alsop and the Colorado Symphony Orchestra that  is probably the single most exciting disc of late 20th century music I have listened to.  In this Koch album, Alsop conducts the Concordia Orchestra in performances of Ku-Ka-Ilimoku, Concerto Per Corde, Rotae Passionis, and Ogoun Badagris.The album begins with Ku-Ka-Ilimoku, a work for percussion ensemble that depicts the Hawaiian mythological god of war.  For percussion-lovers like me, the work is incredibly interesting with multiple repeated rhythms using multiple percussion instruments.  The booklet accompanying the disc says that the piece is best viewed as a savage, propulsive war dance.  Actually, I didn’t find it as savage or war dance-like as I did propulsive, but it is a perpetual motion piece that is extremely energized and fun to listen to.Concerto Per Corde is based on Rouse’s String Quartet No. 2 but is not a simple transcription of the earlier work, as the composer apparently did considerable rewriting.  The work is based upon a permutation of Bach’s name in the German letters for musical pitches.  The 1st movement is a sad-sounding piece, very mournful and anguished.  It is quite beautiful (why is it that melancholic pieces are so often so?).  The 2nd movement is rather savage (there’s that Rouse adjective, again) with only brief passages of calm.  I really enjoy Rouse and his creative genius for creating engaging rhythms.  The 3rd and final movement returns to the slow tempo that characterized the 1st movement, but it is more modern-sounding and strident at times.  I think the term “bleak” best characterizes it.  The booklet call it “cold desolation.”Rotae Passionis is a difficult piece to love, although anything with bass drum, snare, or timpani will always provide some pleasure for me.  Think of drums and a few other instruments and that’s it for instrumentation.  The work is in three sections depicting various aspects of the Crucifixion of Christ.  There is little in it that most would call music in the conventional sense.  I didn’t particularly enjoy it and won’t probably play it again.Ogoun Badagris is inspired by Haitian drumming patterns and bears some relevance to Voodo.  Ogoun Badagris is one of the most frightful Voodo deities.  With that as an introduction, it should come as no surprise that the brief percussion work is dance-like, repetitive, extremely rhythmic, strongly percussive (Duh!), and often angry-sounding.  Interesting piece.Passion Wheels, as the album is entitled, is a fascinating compilation of works by Christopher Rouse that rely strongly on a multitude of percussion instruments.  My favorites are the first two works, Ku-Ka-Ilimoku and Concerto Per Corde.  I will record those two for my Fiio X-5.  Marin Alsop must be a magician to conduct these challenging works, and the Concordia Orchestra needs no better proof of its virtuosity than this disc. The sound presents the sonorities of the instruments very well.  On a high-end audio system with subs, the effect is often hair-raising.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, especially for Ku-Ka-Ilimoku and Concerto Per Corde!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O3MGLF05TJDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SC0N#wasThisHelpful","R2O3MGLF05TJDL","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Baltimore-born Christopher Rouse was trained at Oberlin and Cornell.  He studied with Karel Husa and George Crumb and held faculty positions at U. of Michigan and Eastman School of Music before moving to Juilliard in 1997.  Juilliard's gain.  Everyone else's loss.  His most prominent composition student is Michael Torke. Stylistically, Rouse is considered a neoromantic composer, but some are more musically obtuse.  In the present RCA album, Marin Alsop leads the Colorado Symphony Orchestra in Rouse's Trombone Concerto, Gorgon, and Iscariot.  The works were recorded in 1995 using 20-bit technology and the sound is astonishing!The album begins with the Trombone Concerto.  Right from the start, I must tell you that I thought this was one I was going to have to listen to for purposes of the review, but surprise, surprise:  I actually enjoyed it immensely.  This is wonderful music, one of the most fantastic modern works I have heard.  The 1st movement begins rather darkly and sparsely.  My first impression was ""Oh, God, is this even music?""  The trombone makes slow, low-pitched,  almost groaning sounds similar to... well, you can just guess.  But then it became increasingly musical in a more conventional sense, and I realized that I was actually beginning to enjoy it.  A lot. It... became... beautiful!  The 2nd movement is stunning, sort of perpetual motion.  It is often loud.  The rhythms are fascinating.  The trombonist must have required resuscitation by the end of the movement!  Really, really enjoyable.  I'll be listening again and again to this.  I couldn't help but think of Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind.  Remember, the trombone note coming from the saucer after it landed on Devil's Mountain?  Well, multiply that times a hundred, and add percussion, additional brass, and strings.  All I can say is WOW!  What impactful music.  You have to hear it to believe it.  Amazing!  The 3rd movement returns to a slow tempo with woodwinds playing soulfully.  But the music crescendos and gathers increasing intensity before coming to a quiet and sublime section that is exceptionally peaceful.  Soft timpani lead into a gentle conclusion.Gorgon is a three-movement piece that begins in raucous fashion with wonderful timpani passages.  I love that instrument, and in the 1st movement it plays an important role.  Rouse described Gorgon as ""... a work of exorcistic rage, an attempt in music to heal by facing that which seems unfaceable.""  I think exorcistic rage is an apt phrase for this music.  Chords are repeated 10 or 15 times in rapid succession.  It's riotous and stunning - almost shocking.  The 3rd movement, Medussa, is so in-your-face that it is difficult to describe.  The booklet says that Gorgon is an attempt to take Rouse's attraction towards fast, loud and wild music to its terrifying ultimate.  That about says it all.  I will play this often.Iscariot is the antithesis of Gorgon, with its slow, mournful yet sublime nature.  It is a pleasure, and a needed one after listening to Gorgon's terror.  But don't think that Rouse has robbed you of terror completely.  There are many such moments, but their intensity, though impressive, don't equal those of Gorgon.  I found Iscariot less compelling than Gorgon but stillRouse's music is astonishing for its relentlessly energized drive and dynamics.  No dozing off here.  I found myself eagerly anticipating the next new flurry of rhythms and percussion effects.  The sound is splendid with a full soundstage and center fill.  The Colorado Symphony should be recognized as on the brink of world class.  They play this difficult music with aplomb.  Marin Alsop, whose other recordings have not impressed me that much, needs not to prove herself further.  She is a major talent.  This is one of the most exciting and thoroughly enjoyable albums of modern music I have ever listened to.  ABSOLUTElY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RNG3YLYVQOCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003G0Q#wasThisHelpful","R1RNG3YLYVQOCG","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a spectacular Albany album of serious wind music performed by the University of Miami Wind Ensemble.  Ensemble?  Well, it is a 57-member “ensemble” led by conductor Gary M. Green – and the band is superb on all counts as is the recorded sound!The disc begins with Symphony from Ivy Green by Mark Camphouse.  The work is a song cycle of sorts with lyrics consisting of the writings of Helen Keller, who was born at Ivy Green.  This is beautiful musical depiction of Keller’s thoughts, ideas, struggles, and joy.  Singing is the composer’s spouse, Elizabeth Curtis, who sang in the work’s premier in 1998.  Curtis’ diction is superb and moving.  The wind music is impressive and blends with its vocal partner seamlessly.  The work is divided into six movements with descriptive titles such as “Silence Sits Immense Upon My Sould.”  Everything about this work is meaningful, sobering, moving, and while not always typical of modern music, beautiful.  I don’t usually enjoy the solo voice, but this is a notable exception.  You must hear it!Next up is Equus by Eric Whitacre.  The work was commissioned by the wind ensemble that performs the music on this disc and must be considered definitive.  Clearly inspired by minimalism, Whitacre calls it Dynamic Minimalism, and dynamic it is.  This is not obtuse modern music in any sense, but rather is one of the finest pieces of minimalistic structure I have hear since the wonderful film music for Hamburger Hill by Philip Glass.  Whitacre intended the piece to depict perpetual motion, and he was superbly successful.  Its rhythms never dull, and the music is quite compelling.  You are going to really enjoy this one!The final work is a four-movement Concerto for Marimba and Wind Ensemble by Ney Rosauro that is ever more interesting as the work progresses.  Its original form was as concerto for marimba and string orchestra, then reiterated as a piano piece, and finally a concerto with percussion ensemble.  Dr. Thomas McCutchen later arranged it for wind ensemble.  Brazilian rhythms are enticing and percussion is clearly a major force in the music.  I would not have imagined that  the marimba would be a natural solo instrument in a concerto, but it works.This album is a pure joy from start to finish.  The U. Miami Wind Ensemble perform exquisitely with polish and precision.  Personally, I love hearing college ensembles like I love watching college basketball.  Both play their hearts out, although only the basketball players are reaching for the big bucks.  Gary Green must take great pride in the quality of his instrumentalists.  The sound is as splendid as the music.  Soundstage is great, center fill perfect, bass definition superb, and the sonorities astonishing.  Have I made my point?  ABSOLUTELY VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGMN2IKIO1QAH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000083F4D#wasThisHelpful","RGMN2IKIO1QAH","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an important docudrama that depicts the struggles of Linda Pino, MD with the managed care system.  In medical school, managed care was not the terrible influence it is now.  I didn't know Dr. Linda Pino, but her husband was my resident during my rotation on OB/Gyn at the University of Louisville.  The problems seen in the movie are real and even greater today.  I wish EVERYONE could see this movie.  As a physician in private practice, managed care makes taking care of my patients more than a little difficult.  Moreover, most all of my patients have seen increases in deductibles, copays, and premiums while at the same time experiencing greater difficulty in obtaining the medical care that they deserve, require, and believe they had paid for.

"Samuel Barber is among the finest composers that America has ever produced, much less than one of the greatest of the 20th century.  He knew that his destiny was musical composition from early childhood and told his mother so in a letter at 9 years of age.  By14, he was enrolled in the newly-formed Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.  His dream came true – for Barber and for us, as well.  Barber wrote standard symphonies and concertos, but he is probably best known for his shorter works.  We get a bit of both in this Argo album with Symphon1, Adagio for Strings. Overture to The School for Scandal, First and Second Essays for Orchestra, and Music for a Scene from Shelley.  Performing is David Zinman and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra.  The recording was made in 1991.  Since this album competes with Schippers’ account with the NYPO and Columbia Symphony Orchestra, I will point out contrasts between the two sets of accounts as I review the present disc.The album begins with Barber’s timeless Adagio for Strings, adapted for string orchestra from an early string quartet movement.  It receives a moving account by Zinman and Baltimore, but it is more relaxed than Schippers/NYPO performances.  The music has been said to be authentic.  William Schuman stated that there is no apparent compositional technique.  It is just effortless and natural.  Few listeners have not been moved by its timeless beauty.  Its seemingly longing mood accounts for it having been called America’s national funeral music.  Both this and Schippers/NYPO accounts are equally valid interpretation, and both receive superb performances.The Overture to The School for Scandal was written for the play by Sheridan, but musically is really a literal depiction of little of the play’s content.  But as a musical work, it stands well on its own.  The first theme is an ebullient one of some intensity.  The second theme introduced by oboe is one of the loveliest composed during the 20th century.  Both this and Schippers/NYPO accounts are equally valid interpretation, and both receive superb performances, although the profound bass of this account could make this one a more attractive choice.The First Essay for Orchestra is an elegiac work with contrasting section of light playfulness.  Barber composed it as an attempt to duplicate the contrasts and cogency of his Symphony 1 on a smaller scale.  When it begins, it is reminiscent of his Adagio, being equally dark but less profound and with a theme that competes poorly with that of the Adagio.  It lacks the smooth melodic nature of the Adagio.  Still, it is a beautiful work and profound in its own right.  This work is not included on Schippers/NYPO.Music for a Scene from Shelley was composed in response to some lines from Shelley’s Prometheus Unbound.  The piece opens mysteriously, not really progressing anywhere in particular but doing so with some beauty and with gradually-increasing intensity.  Finally, a tutti explosion offers a stirring, almost anguished, longing theme that is embraced by a singly trumpet, then strings.  A dialogue between instrumental sections leads to another intermediate climax, pause, greater and percussive climax of death blows.  An eerie calm is restored reminiscent of the original opening sequence and the work quiets to a close.The Second Essay for Orchestra begins with a pastoral mood that evolves texturally and dynamically to some climactic passages.  These increase in intensity to percussive climaxes with prominent timpani.  Next a jumpy sequence of extended motifs appears that gives occasional way to minor climaxes.  We never hear a real melodic line, but the music has much interest and some of the intermediate climaxes are profound and stirring.(Most of the following comments on Barber’s Symphony 1 are taken from my review of Slatkin’s superb account.)  Barber’s First Symphony is a remarkably accessible work written in 1936 when Barber was 26.  In Program Notes, Barber describes the symphony in this way:  “The form of my Symphony in One Movement is a synthetic treatment of the four-movement classical symphony. It is based on three themes of the initial Allegro non troppo, which retain throughout the work their fundamental character. The Allegro ma non troppo opens with the usual exposition of a main theme, a more lyrical second theme, and a closing theme. After a brief development of the three themes, instead of the customary recapitulation, the first theme in diminution forms the basis of a scherzo section (vivace). The second theme (oboe over muted strings) then appears in augmentation, in an extended Andante tranquillo. An intense crescendo introduces the finale, which is a short passacaglia based on the first theme… over which, together with figures from other themes, the closing theme is woven, thus serving as a recapitulation for the entire symphony.” (Heyman 1994, 140)  Barber had an ear for the long line and it shows in this intensely dramatic symphony.This disc gives us superb readings of Barber works.  The bass is strong but slightly less well-defined than in competing accounts such as Slatkin/St. Louis SO and Schippers/NYPO.  Generally speaking and although Schippers is a considerably older recording, he brings greater excitement to these works than Zinman and Schippers sound is a bit brighter.  Likewise, Slatkin’s account of Symphony 1 is infused with more excitement.  Each of the recordings, however have something going for them that makes each compelling.  For Zinman like the other two, the disc is VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GHX8Q1MNR9L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000004CVV#wasThisHelpful","R1GHX8Q1MNR9L8","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Samuel Barber is regarded by the public at large as one of America's greatest 20th century composers because of one single composition - the timeless Adagio for Strings.  Yet for music lovers, we know that his talent doesn't end there.  The present album is a reminder of his ability to write enduring works longer that 8 or 9 minutes.  Barber knew, even as a child, that his destiny was musical composition, and at 9 years of age, he wrote a letter to his mother and told her so!  He was one of the first students to enroll in Philadelphia's newly-formed Curtis Institute of Music.  This RCA disc features two of his large-scale works, Symphony No. 1 and his Piano Concert, as well as Souvenirs for four hands.  Performing is Leonard Slatkin and the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra with John Browning, pianist.  The recording was made in 1990.Barber's First Symphony is a remarkably accessible work written in 1936 when Barber was 26.  In Program Notes, Barber describes the symphony in this way:  ""The form of my Symphony in One Movement is a synthetic treatment of the four-movement classical symphony. It is based on three themes of the initial Allegro non troppo, which retain throughout the work their fundamental character.

(Heyman 1994, 140)  Couldn't have said it better myself, but what Barber leaves out is how truly beautiful the work is.  Barber had an ear for the long line and it shows in this intensely dramatic symphony.Barber wrote the Piano Concerto FOR John Browning.  Before he began writing it, Browning spent three or four days with the composer who asked him to play everything he knew so that Barber could tailor the work to Browning's personality.  As a pianist myself, I have always found it difficult to love 20th century piano concertos.  Unlike with 20th century orchestral works, I am just not moved by them.  John Browning plays spectacularly as usual.  I first heard Browning 50 years ago when he was about 30 and remember my impression that he was a pianist with unbelievable technique.  (I also heard Leon Fleisher that same season and thought he played with far more emotion than Browning.)  The Piano Concerto is a virtuosic tour de force with much that is interesting but little that moves me.For Souvenirs, conductor Slatkin serves as the other two hands.  This is a six-movement nostalgic work that includes Waltz, Schottische, Pas de deux, Two-Step, Hesitation-Tango, and Galop.  Browning studied with Rosina Lhévinne at Juilliard.  Slatkin studied violin, viola, and piano.  Although not perfectly together at times, Browning and partner are technically well-matched for Souvenirs.  The piece is fun to hear.This is a an interesting album.  For me the major work is the Symphony 1 and it is played par excellance.  The Piano Concerto played by its dedicatee is self-recommending and competes with the performance with Browning/Szell.  The sound is superb in every respect.

"This is a very good music encyclopedia for the targeted audience.  So there are really two questions: 1) why is this book only very good, and 2) who is the targeted audience?I initially bought this book because I was trying out several encyclopedic volumes for my classical music reviews here on Amazon.  I wanted a book or books that would be a quick reference for factual bibliographic information regarding composers and some additional information regarding their compositions.  With regard to composers, the book contains much bibliographic detail on all of the major composers.  What is missing is info on the others.  For example, there are no listings for Henze or Rubbra, both significant 20th century composers.  The major composers prior to the 20th century have been filtered by time so that it is relatively easy to say who the major ones are.  In a hundred years, there will probably be a half dozen ""major"" composers of the second half of the 20th century, but today we can only say who the contenders are.  For me, it isn't worth looking up many composers of the last 50 years, because they often aren't listed.  The problem is even worse for  works of music.  Only often recorded works are certain to be included.  Again, for the majority of works from the last 50 years, they are unlikely to be included.The audience best served by The NPR Listener's Encyclopedia are all listeners relatively new to classical music.  More experienced listeners and those, like me, with formal training in music, will be less likely to benefit from the book for the reasons noted n the preceding paragraph.  Those listeners who are not new to classical music but are still listening primarily to the major 16th to mid-20th century compositions should also find the book beneficial.I think that the term ""Listener's Companion"" might have been a more accurate title for the book.  It is not encyclopedic.  If you are looking for succinct presentations of most all composers, this is the wrong book for you.  This is no fault of the author or editors.  No single book can give you what it seems to promise.  I am partial to the Oxford Dictionary of Music and the Harvard Dictionary of Music and use them primarily.  So, for its intended audience that I have described, I think this is an excellent reference.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SD1KC8FS3EZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761120726#wasThisHelpful","R3SD1KC8FS3EZ9","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Even as a child, he knew that his destiny was musical composition.  At 9 years of age, he wrote a letter to his mother and told her just that!  By 14, he was enrolled in the newly-formed Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.  His dream came true - for Barber and for us, as well.  In this incredible Sony album, we have Thomas Schippers leading either the New York Philharmonic or Columbia Symphony in performances of Barber's Medea's Dance of Vengeance, Adagio for Strings, Second Essay for Orchestra, Overture to The School for Scandal, Andromache's Farewell, Intermezzo from Vanessa; Menotti's Overture to Amelia al ballo; Berg's Interlude from Wozzeck (Act III); and d'Indy's Introduction to Fervaal.  The works by Barber are performed by the NYPO, while the remaining works are performed by the Columbia SO.  All were recorded in the early 1960's and subsequently remastered.To begin the Barber fest, we hear Media's Dance of Vengeance, a suite taken from the ballet music.  The music depicts the themes of jealousy and revenge and begins quietly with strings, woodwinds, and percussion.  But the quiet beauty of longing is only temporary, and in time it transitions to a broader, more sweeping, almost sultry treatment of the theme.  The music next becomes agitated with even larger orchestral ideas including the use of piano.  The catchy rhythms keep the music lively as it expands to near riotous tutti's.  Finally, the piece concludes with anguished passages before the agitation makes one last heroic statement.Little needs to be said of the Adagio for Strings, Barber's adaptation of an early string quartet movement for string orchestra.  Here, it receives one of the most emotional and endearing performances that I have ever heard.  The music has been said to be authentic.  William Schuman stated that there is no apparent compositional technique.  It is just effortless and natural.  Few listeners have not been moved by its timeless beauty.  Its seemingly longing mood accounts for it having been called America's national funeral music.The Second Essay for Orchestra is not my favorite Barber piece, but it receives a superb performance by Schippers/NYPO.  Ever since I heard the Overture for the School for Scandal, I have been taken by its propulsive rhythms and melodic motifs, and what an exciting performance it receives.  When the pensive theme finally arrives, it induces a deep calm to all who hear it.  It is certainly one of the finest themes of the 20th century.  The recapitulation of the original agitated introduction is simply glorious, especially the restatement of the timeless theme.I was unfamiliar with Andromache's Farewell, but while interesting, it isn't one of Barber's best works IMHO.  It is a work for soprano and orchestra with the text from The Trojan Women by Euripi¬des.  In contrast, the Intermezzo from Vanessa (Act III) is a lovely piece with the oboe taking a prominent role.  The final three works, played by the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, begin with Menotti's Overture to Amelia al ballo, a lively and beautiful work full of energy and good humor.  The conclusion is pure joy.  Next is Berg's Interlude from Wozzeck (Act III).  This is a mournful work that turns to anguish.  The conclusion with brass fades to darkness.  The final work is d'Indy's Introduction to Fervaal.  It, also, is rather melancholic but the melancholy of love, not sadness.  Its theme is rich and beautiful.Throughout this album, I was struck by how splendid was the sound.  These are 50 year old recordings.  Columbia took care of their master tapes.  There are absolutely no criticisms possible with the sound, including soundstage and center fill.  Okay, maybe the soundstage is a tad shallow, but everything else is superb.  The orchestras under Thomas Schippers also deserve much praise.

"Christopher Rouse is a modern, living American composer with a very impressive Curriculum Vita and about 50 compositions to his credit.  Born in Baltimore, MD, his music education includes a bachelor degree from Oberlin and graduate degrees from Cornell where he studied with Karel Husa.  He also studied privately with George Crumb.  He has held faculty positions at U. of Michigan, Eastman, and since 1997 at Juilliard.  His most prominent composition student is Michael Torke.  Stylistically, Rouse is considered a neoromantic composer.  With regard to the present album, David Zinman leads the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra in Rubbra's Symphony No. 1 and Phantasmata.Symphony 1 begins eerily with high violins that are subsequently joined by a tutti explosion.  The 1st and only movement is largely comprised of this rather dark and frequently ominous music which at times increases in interest, texture, and dynamic volume.  Still, it reminds you of the score to a fright film.  To be fair, however, the music is of MUCH higher quality than most of those films.  There is plenty of percussion bombast to work out your audio systems and prized subwoofers.  At times, the music becomes conventionally and beautifully tonal.  Rouse is a bit of a chameleon.  I like that, but I sometimes wondered if we were stretching the definition of music as we know it.  I have maintained for years that modern music, if nothing else, cleans the cobwebs out of our brains and prevents us from becoming stale in our listening habits.  Symphony 1 does that job and does it well.  It IS music, after all.  It just isn't music we are accustomed to hearing.  For me, it is worth repeated listening sessions.Phantasmata has three movements with uncommon titles, like The Evestrum of Juan de la Cruz in the Sagrada Familia at 3 AM, The Infernal Machine, and Bump.  Seriously!  I'll just stick to the music here.  The 1st movement is eerie.  Like Symphony 1, Rouse inserts wild dynamically contrasting passages, although the movement is never bombastic.  The 2nd movement is agitated with lots of ascending and descending glissandos, percussion effects, and a fascinating array of orchestral sonorities, pulsations and rhythms.  It's actually fun to listen to.  Promise.  The 3rd movement, Bump, Rouse takes us on a Boston Pops tour from Hell, with gouhls and the like dancing around bumping into things and people.  Another treat!I would love to see the neuronal firing patterns in Zinman's brain as he conducts these works by Rouse.  The Baltimore Symphony should never have to prove themselves again.  I'm certain they had quite the workout.  Much of this is music is fun to listen to.  I am not going to try to tell you that I understand it well enough to give you an erudite analysis, but I think you will find it extremely enjoyable.  (Plus, I like timpani, and there is plenty of it!)  The sound is spectacular.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14EBEESECPJKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GMW3Z6#wasThisHelpful","R14EBEESECPJKG","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Randall Thompson was one of the leaders of 20th century American music who taught at UC Berkeley, was the Director of Curtis Institute, and faculty member at Princeton and Harvard. Besides his three symphonies, he also composed considerable choral music including Choose Something Like a Star from Americana. This is a stunningly mesmerizing work, and If you haven't heard it, I heartedly recommend you do so.  I recently reviewed Thompson's Symphonies 2 and 3.  The present disc features his Symphony 1 but also includes Morton Gould's Fall River Legend on the Koch label.  The works are performed by James Sedares conducting the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and were recorded in 1992.Morton Gould was another 20th century American composer whose compositions were usually related to American themes.  Fall River Legend depicts the Lizzie Borden affair.  Borden was tried for the hatchet murder of her father and stepmother in 1892.  Gould wrote music for a ballet at the request of famed choreographer Agnes de Mille.  This is pleasant, interesting music from a relatively unimportant American composer.  Much of it is exciting, and Gould was quite an orchestrator.  However, I think the story more than the music itself has guaranteed its place in the orchestral literature.Thompson's Symphony No. 1 is the main feature of this album.  The 1st movement demonstrates syncopation and other jazz influences.  The music is not particularly memorable.  The 2nd movement isn't either.  The 3rd and final movement moves from pastoral and a bit lively to excellent intensity and energy.  The performance is far better than the music.If you want to hear superb music of Randall Thompson, listen to his Symphonies 2 and 3.  The current fare on this disc is pleasant and interesting and little more in my opinion.  Sound, however, is superb.  Recommended for completists.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BO3TMU3Z3AU2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001SG2#wasThisHelpful","R1BO3TMU3Z3AU2","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edmund Rubbra, considered one of the leading composers of the 20th century, wrote a total of 11 symphonies. He studied composition with Gustav Holst at the Royal College of Music and later wrote a biography of his mentor.  I recently reviewed performances of his Symphonies 6 and 8 with Norman Del Mar and the Philharmonia Orchestra.  The present Lyrita disc includes Rubbra’s Symphonies 3 and 4 with the same forces.  In addition to the symphonies, we also hear A Tribute and Overture Resurgam fitted between the two larger works.Symphony 3’s 1st movement opens in major key but soon dark clouds begin appearing on the horizon as the intensity picks up.  While less dark than Symphonies 6 and 8, the ominous character of the Third is ever-present.  Rubbra’s superb orchestration skills are immediately apparent, and Del Mar and the Philharmonia are up to the task of expressing them.  Rubbra’s orchestration and thematic structure are reminiscent of Sibelius at his early best.  The tempo slows to a lovely finale.  The 2nd movement begins quaintly with music that continues its resemblance to Sibelius with equal accessibility.  Rubbra’s music isn’t quite the match to the Scandinavian, but then that would be a tall order for any subsequent composer to fill.  The 2nd movement, however, is no thematic equal to the 1st, but its intensity is typical Rubbra.  The movement returns to major in the prominent brass conclusion.  The 3rd movement is music of quiet melancholy and occasional anguish but of considerable beauty throughout.  The movement again ends with a lovely major mode conclusion.  Del Mar is in tune with the darkness, and it is difficult to imagine any other conductor drawing more from the score.  The 4th and final movement continues the melancholic mood so common in Rubbra, but it lightens slightly about 2 minutes into the movement.  The mood progresses further away from despair.  Structurally, the 4th movement is constructed as a theme with 7 superbly written variations that demonstrate contrasts in mode, style and tempo and concluding with a fugue.  These aren’t up to the quality of Elgar’s Enigma set, but they are impressive nonetheless.  The final variation is the longest and grandest, with brass ablaze and timpani underscoring the thematic majesty at the conclusion in a Bach-like harmonic resolution to a Picardy third.A Tribute resulted from a commission from the BBC for a short work to celebrate Ralph Vaughn-Williams 70th birthday.  It is slowly paced, rather pastoral, somewhat melancholic work that while attractive really doesn’t sound very much like Vaughn-Williams or celebration.  Overture Resurgam was also a commissioned work but by the Plymouth Symphony to commemorate the Nazi bombing of the city.  It is appropriately dark in mood during much of its 7+ minutes.  (I’m beginning to think that no composer does dark as well or as often as Rubbra!)  It is a pleasant, far more dramatic piece than A Tribute and seems to depict considerable light at the end of the tunnel.Rubbra himself conducted one of the early performances of Symphony 4 dressed in military uniform, but Sir Adrian Boult premiered the work.  It begins with a serene, conventionally structured dialogue between violins and woodwinds/brass repeating a simple rhythmic motif.  This interplay evolves to a somewhat mournful and intense, pulsatile prelude to a moving intermediate climax.  Eventually, the music becomes increasingly intense with an exquisite brass dialogue passage.  Once again, Rubbra’s orchestration impresses, and the movement ends like someone in a death struggle taking some final breaths.  The 2nd movement is rather easy-going but of less interest than the 1st movement.  The 3rd movement is a serious affair lead by the low strings.  The characteristic Rubbra intensity is ever-evident.  This is easy music to love.  The 4th movement picks up the pace, and Del Mar and the Philharmonia play their hearts out.  I hope, by now, you don’t expect happy music.  Good!  The music becomes majestic and ends gloriously.This is a superb disc in every respect.  Interpretations, performance and sound are all exemplary.  Unless you have a naively happy character, there is so much to love about the music of Edmund Rubbra.  I don’t believe that Del Mar and company recorded more the the Symphonie Nos. 3, 4, 6, and 8, but I sure wish he had.  I’ll have to buy the Chandos complete set of symphonies to hear the others, but for these Lyrita recordings, I’ll be surprised if Hickox betters these performances.

"I was first introduced to Gibran's masterpiece when I was a young intelligence analyst serving in Vietnam in 1968.  You may think what an odd place to meet The Prophet, but actually a combat zone may have been the perfect locale.  Vietnam was an area where man's inhumanity to man begged for something that was beautifully expressed and was profoundly true, something that was man's greatest achievement in an area of his worst.  This is just one example of the power of The Prophet.The Prophet is a relatively short book that can be read in an afternoon, but its impact will endure for a lifetime.  I have given copies to friends on the occasion of their weddings, and read it to every woman I ever loved.  I have also recommended it to countless patients in my psychiatry practice.  One would have to be dead inside not to be moved by the poetic beauty of Gibran's carefully chosen words on life, love, marriage, joy and sorrow, children and the like.  It was truly inspired by God himself, so profound are its truths.This edition is equally perfect.  It is hardcover and contains Gibran's own unique drawings.  The paper is heavy and softly feathered, giving it an expensive appearance appropriate to the value of the writing within. It really does make a simple but valuable gift for occasions such as weddings or for others you love.If you have never read The Prophet, then you must buy some copies, read one and keep it, and give the others away to people you care about.  After all these years, I cannot count the number of times that I have quoted it.  It is my favorite book of all times and easily garners MY ABSOLUTE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R148MV8QKA5DS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0394404289#wasThisHelpful","R148MV8QKA5DS3","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Edmund Rubbra (1901-1986) was an English composer who studied composition with Gustav Holst (he later wrote a biography of the composer) at the Royal College of Music and who was regarded as one of the leading composers of his day.  He composed a total of 11 symphonies of which Nos. 6 and 8 are presented here along with his Soliloquy for Cello and Orchestra to top off this generous Lyrita disc.  Norman del Mar and the Philharmonia Orchestra perform the symphonies, while the Soliloquy is played by Vernon Handley and the London Symphony Orchestra.  The recordings were made in the late 1970’s (Soliloquy) and early 1980’s (symphonies) but neither was recorded digitally.  They were all digitally remastered with great success.Symphony 6 is a darkly beautiful work that I found rather melancholic.  Unlike so much modern music, it takes little effort to enjoy this work that is dominated by strings.  While you won’t get up from your listening chair humming the melodies, they are nonetheless beautifully woven themes that carry drama, emotion and intensity.  This is particularly true of the 4th movement which I found emotionally stirring.  Rubbra was a superb orchestrator, a fact illustrated by this movement especially, with its sonorous finale of strings and brass.  And the timpani, while never overplayed, is an important and well-defined pulse of the coda.Symphony 8’s mood resembles that of the Sixth.  If you are familiar with my classical reviews, you already know how I look for the timpani’s definition in works.  Well, I was not disappointed here.  The 1st movement is large in scope and intensity with prominent timpani.  Del Mar is one of those conductors who you don’t hear a lot, but he is always exciting.  He seems well able to elucidate the ideas within the murky texture of this symphony for the listener.  I honestly can’t find anything I don’t enjoy about Rubbra.  He never allows the music to loiter.  There is always a new idea or an old one redefined.  The 2nd movement is more lively but not much happier.  The 3rd and final movement is a tragic sounding Poco Lento with a sorrowful mood of considerable intensity.  Now, this is a movement that dwells in the doldrums of despair.  At around 5 minutes, the intensity increases with a strong pulsatile rhythm that gives way to anguish.  Wow, can this composer ever search the darker places of the soul.  Then, almost surprisingly, the music lifts out of the swamp and ends softly in major.  At times, the music will make you reach for the Prozac.  But despite the predominant mood, I found the movement growing on me with repeated listenings.The Soliloquy begins immediately with the cello presenting a dark theme.  No surprise, right?  I must confess that I found the Soliloquy less compelling than the symphonies.  It was recorded earlier than the symphonies, is played by Handley/LSO, and has a sonically constricted ambience.For the Symphonies 6 and 8, I can report that the sound is excellent but not superb.  Soundstage and center fill are superb, however.  At times the strings sounded a bit grainy, but otherwise is not issue.  What is an issue is how great the music is.  I think you will want to explore Rubbra’s other symphonies.  I certainly will.

"Eugene List was a pupil of Olga Samaroff at Juilliard who also taught Roslyn Tureck.  He had an illustrious concert career but his recordings are hard to find, now.  This Vanguard disc presents him in performances of the piano music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk.  The first disc is devoted to two-hand piano music, while the second features one-piano four-hands and two-piano works.Disc 1 begins with one of Gottschalk’s most well-known works, The Banjo.  While I have heard faster accounts, I have heard none with such rounded tone. Nor has the piano been recorded so well.  If you have never heard The Banjo, you are in for a real treat.  This is the finest performance of the virtuoso piece ever!  I will mention a few other pieces of note beginning with Souvenir de Porto Rico which receives a caring performance and perfect idiomatic playing.  This is a rather sultry piece, and List gives it plenty of sway.  You won’t fail to be impressed.  Bamboula is another of popular pieces.  It is the forerunner to the cakewalk.  The reading is luscious.  The Last Hope is a mournful piece of great beauty.  Tournament is a gallop that is just plain fun to hear.Disc 2 is comprised mostly of arrangements by List and Cary Lewis.  They are, of course, performed with distinction, but I have little interest in arrangements as they are not the intent of the composer.  Only Tremolo is the original Gottschalk version and it receives a superb performance by List and assistant.  This is a very lively work with a wonderful theme.  The four hands almost play as one.This is a superb album of Gottschalk piano music.  The second disc is equally enjoyable but largely consisting of arrangements.  The piano sound is excellent but sounded like a different instrument on Disc 2.  Curious.

"People who buy compilations such as this one aren't necessarily looking for definitive accounts of the works but rather a mix of styles that share the quality of being enjoyable to listen to.  We classical musicians are looking for an easy way to hear superbly performed musical candy.  So, it is a real plus for the first group when almost all of the selections are excellently performed as these are.  For those in the second group, a plus with caveats  The second plus is that Reference Recordings records these wonderful performances.  Both groups win on this plus.Chabrier's Espana  Rhapsody receives a stellar, exciting performance.  Finlandia is beautifully recorded but lacks the intensity and punch it deserves.  Still the work never fails to bring tears to my eyes and does here, as well.  Escales has never been one of my favorites and still isn't, although it is a sweet piece.  Alfven's Midsummer Vigil is a lively piece but this attribute is lacking the nth degree in this performance.  Borodin's Steppes of Central Asia receives an average performance, again lacking any magical quality.  Smetana's Moldau is held back by tempo.  Tchaikovsky's Capriccio Italien is the longest work on the disc and too often seems it.Oue could sometimes seem uninspired, and he does here.  Tempi are a bit on the slow side, which robs the works of their edge.  The orchestra performs beautifully, and the sound is simply stellar.  For what the intent of this album is, it's a success.  But I don't think that most musicians or experienced listeners will be too interested in repeated listening.  Highly Recommended for those looking for a fine compilation of classical candy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUF81MFUVM7SO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000015AG#wasThisHelpful","RUF81MFUVM7SO","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These 1/4"" labels are the perfect way to organize CD's.  My system for classical music is as follows (for those of you interested in such things).  My top picks for a work are designated with two red dots on the right spine of the case.  Other superb recordings of that work get one red dot.  All of my superb or better recordings are in my top three drawers.  Everything else is in the drawers below.  Contemporary recordings that I want to listen to again get a green dot on the left portion of the spine.  Demonstration quality recordings get a yellow dot on the left, as well.  This makes it easy to refind the great albums.  Of course, there are in alphabetical order by genre and composer.  With about  500-600 albums, using these dots fixes the problem of not recalling which albums I rated as definitive recordings.The dots are easily removed from the paper, and they stick on the CD jewel case very well.  I only wish they were fluorescent.  They can be removed with little more effort than using your fingernail.  We use the larger ones at my private practice office for patient folders.

"Confession time:  I’m a bandaholic. I admit it.  I love band music.  Wind Band, Symphonic Band, Brass Band.  Add nothing or add bagpipes, organ, or even full orchestra.  It doesn’t matter.  I still love it.  With that being said, I am happy to report that this album is a band lover’s dream.  The works recorded for this Klavier album are exceptional compositions that receive exquisite performances with resplendent sound.  The pieces include Richard Danielpour’s Icarus, Eric Ewazen’s Shadowcatcher, Kathryn Salfelder’s Stylus Phantasticus, and Anthony Plog’s Concerto 2010.  They were recorded in 2012 and 2013.  Performing the program are the Western Michigan University Symphonic Band, Western Winds, and Western Brass Quintet.The album begins with Danielpour’s Icarus for Brass Ensemble, Percussion, and Two Pianos, an 11-minute work inspired by the Greek mythology story of Daedalus and his son Icarus and their tragic flight (literally and figuratively) from imprisonment.  The fear, drama, angst are all superbly depicted by Danielpour’s unique cast of instruments.  The music reflects a series of moods from agitation to worrisome, despair, and lament.  Enjoyable rhythms and pulse as well as instrumental sonorities throughout!Ewazen’s moving Shadowcatcher, a work commissioned by the Butler University Wind Ensemble, was inspired by four photographs from a photo journey through the North American Indian nations made by Edward Curtis over the first three decades of the 20th century.  The 1st movement Offering to the Sun captures both the optimism of light and celebratory gratitude with attractive melodic elements.  The 2nd movement Among the Aspens begins with the sounds of Native ceremony.  The writing is entirely moving with wonderful arpeggio work by the trumpets.  The melodic elements that infuse the movement are simply beautiful.  Note the marvelous effect of the off-stage trumpets at 5:00.  Drums add to the decidedly Native feel of the piece.  The final few minutes are so emotionally driven that you can’t help but feel guilt about our regrettable treatment of these spiritual giants.  The 3rd movement The Vanishing Race only continues the emotional tone begun in the 2nd movement, but now the mood becomes more mournful and sad.  You sense the aimless wandering of a people who have lost their home.  I find Ewazen’s ability to compose such superb depictions of intense moods astonishing.  With the 4th movement’s Dancing to Restore an Eclipsed Moon depicts the Kwakiuntl Indians’ belief that a lunar eclipse resulted from the moon being swallowed by a creature.  Their dance around a fire was aimed at making the creature sneeze and free the moon.  The music is agitated appropriately as though the intensity was required for the dance to work its magic.  Serenity if restored in the final few minutes and the music says all is right with the world again.  Ewazen’s creative genius has never been so well displayed!Salfelder’s Stylus Phantasticus is all the more impressive when one realizes that she is still a doctoral student at the New England Conservatory, with an already-enviable list of compositions and commissioned works!  She has been awarded the 2012 ASCAP Morton Gould Young Composer Award and 2008 ASCAP/CBDNA Frederick Fennell Prize and her music clearly explains why.  Stylus Phantasticus is a Baroque style.  During the piece, Salfelder has musical flashbacks (including fugal passages) to the Baroque period as the work unfolds in a mostly-modern manner.  Stylus Phantasticus is a fascinating bridge between two widely divergent periods in music history.  The writing itself is ingenious and the orchestration absolutely grand and large-scaled.  This is one I will listen to repeatedly!Plog’s Concerto 2010 is a four movement work in which movements share motifs or attaccas.  Analysis aside, the Concerto is a very original and fascinating work of various instrumental combinations.  The 1st movement begins calmly but soon progresses to the 2nd movement and near-perpetual motion.  The 3rd movement Adagio sounds rather sparse of instruments and ideas.  The 4th movements returns us to the agitation of the 2nd movement.  Quite interesting.This is an extraordinary album from compositional, performance and sound perspectives.  Aside from Plog’s not very special 1st and 3rd movements, all are uniformly impressive musical works.  The performances are exquisite as is the sound.

"Everything about Toru Takemitsu’s and his list of accomplishments is unique.  Among his accomplishments, he organized an experimental workshop for painters and composers in Tokyo and designed a Space Theater for the Osaka Exposition in 1970.  Oh and I almost forgot, he is also a noted Japanese composer who has been influenced by Debussy, Messiaen, Cage, and Boulez on the Western end of music.  Of course, Takemitsu has been most influenced by his traditional Japanese music.  The results are very original compositions that blend the two spheres of influence.  Given what you have read, it should come as no surprise that Takemitsu’s music is like none I have ever heard.  As a Westerner, it sounds more Japanese than anything else to me.  In other words, compared to Takemitsu, the most modern atonal music sounds absolutely conventional to me.So, this Philips album is going to be fun to review!  It features Seiji Ozawa conducting the Saito Kinen Orchestra in Takemitsu’s November Steps for orchestra with shakubachi and biwa, Eclipse for shakubachi and biwa, and Viola Concerto “A String around Autumn”.  The album was recorded in 1989 and 1990.  Expect some unusual (for Western listeners) sounds and instruments you are not accustomed to hearing.  To the average listener, some of the instruments sound like stretched rubber band plucked and other unusual instrumental sonorities.November Steps is, like most of Takemitsu’s works, a single movement.  It features the shakubachi and biwa.  The Shakubachi is a wind instrument resembling a recorder.  The Biwa is a fretted string instrument resembling a lute.  This is an orchestral piece, but as the piece unfolds there is increasing emphasis on the Japanese instruments with minor elaboration by strings.  It sounds like you would anticipate traditional Japanese music sounding.  If you like the twanging effect of the Biwa in an advent-guard piece, they you will like November Steps.  Eclipse is much the same but with even less conventional orchestra.It isn’t until we hear A String Around Autumn that we hear the more familiar Avant-guard “conventiality”. The work is tonal and the most accessible on the disc.  For modern music, I was surprised how listenable the work was.  The influence of Debussy is obvious, and melody is present (of course, it is the modern notion of melody).  The viola is played superbly and according to the composer, “the viola plays the part of a human being observing nature in this Autumn scene.”  There is much beauty to behold in this work.Sound is exemplary with no issues whatsoever.  This is difficult music, so adequate time must be allowed to appreciate the music within.  RECOMMENDED!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29DJDE0IHNOCU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4TM#wasThisHelpful","R29DJDE0IHNOCU","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"English composer Sir Michael Tippett didn't really discover music until his teens and in his adult life was composer, conductor, and politically incorrect pacifist radical  (he was actually imprisoned for three months during WW II for his pacifist actions). He wrote his first Symphony at 37 years of age and was most prolific during his later years. His work was especially popular in the United States, and Symphony No. 4 was commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  In the present album we hear Byzantium and Symphony No. 4 by Sir Michael Tippett performed by Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on a London disc recorded in or before 1991.Byzantium originated as a song cycle of three movements but was abandoned in favor of the present set of five songs with mezzo Faye Robinson.  The singer does a first rate job and the performance is commendable.  I must confess not being especially of modern song cycles, and despite the superb orchestral role, I will be unlikely to revisit Byzantium in the future.  If you enjoy such works, I am certain that you will  not be disappointed in this performance.  The orchestra sounds fantastic!Symphony 4 is organized as a single 30-minute movement, but sections roughly correspond to movements.  Tippett called the symphony a ""birth to death piece,"" harking back to a visit to a museum experience during which he saw preserved fetuses.  The symphony even employs breathing sound machine.  The 1st section opens darkly (almost bleakly) and introduces several tempi that will characterize the remaining sections.  I find that absorbing the music produces the greatest pleasure when you first listen to this symphony, because trying to make sense of symphony initially is a rather challenging.  There are a multitude of musical ideas and they seem to be thrown about at random.  If you like difficult modern music, then you will love this symphony, his crowning symphonic work.  If the Symphony 4 is at first frustrating as it was for me, repeated listening will increase your satisfaction to the point of enjoyment.  It certainly did for me.  I actually enjoy its amazing complexity, intensity, and fascinating orchestral sonorities, now.This is a superb sounding album with performances that are bettered only by Tippett’s own performances.  Michael Tippett conducted both Symphony 2 and 4 with the BBC Symphony Orchestra exactly as he intended them to sound on a BBC disc that I reviewed a couple of months ago.  The Second Symphony is far more accessible than the initially confusing Fourth. The recorded sound on the present disc is surprisingly good.  Soundstage, orchestral balance, and center fill is great. Solti’s performances are certainly recommended, but if you are interested only in Symphony 4, then buy the BBC disc that contains Symphony 2 as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5DZ45AB38N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000E4XV#wasThisHelpful","RB5DZ45AB38N1","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was disappointed in this Queen Square reflex hammer in most every way.  I ordered this as a spare for my more substantial hammer I bought for my bag in the sophomore year of medical school in 1983.

"Randall Thompson was an important figure in 20th century American music who taught at UC Berkeley, was the Director of Curtis Institute, and faculty member at Princeton and Harvard.  Besides his three symphonies, he also composed much choral music including Choose Something Like a Star from Americana.  If you haven't heard this wonderfully moving piece, I strongly encourage you to do so.  The present Koch album presents Thompson's Symphony 2 and 3 performed by Andrew Schenck conducting the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.Special mention is appropriate for the conductor who died tragically of cancer at 52 in 1992. Schenck studied conducting with Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Monteux, and Izler Solomon (late conductor of the Indianapolis SO).  He graduated from Harvard and obtained his Masters from Indiana University. Andrew Schenck was a superb conductor who with this orchestra resurrected the music of Samuel Barber from the doldrums.  The music world lost one of its finest conductors by his early death, and he will be missed by many of us grateful listeners. Symphony 2 begins energetically with vivacious rhythms.  The 2nd movement is as lovely a slow movement as you are likely to hear from the 20th century and would be a fitting tribute to Andrew Schenck.  The pensive theme can only be described as sublime.  The 3rd movement begins with plucked bass and has a hint of jazz majesty to it.  I heard more than a few Gershwin-like bars of music. This music may not be moving but certainly makes you want to move.  A middle section is at times dreamy.  Thompson demonstrates a bit of musical chameleon to his character, able to change his color at a moment's notice.  Impressive.  The 4th movement Andante had another lovely theme that walked along with a hint of melancholy before transforming to an upbeat tempo.  More chameleon.  You gotta love it!  Finally, Thompson gives us a full orchestra version of the original melody that is just awe-inspiring.  If I had to pick one phrase to describe Thompson, it would be ""one colorful surprise after another.""  This is some of the easiest to hear and most beautiful 20th century music ever written - right up there with Copland's Appalachian Spring.Symphony 3 begins with sorrowful strings playing one of the most melancholic themes in music.  If anyone doubts Thompson's creative genius, this 1st movement alone should dismiss any question about his ability to construct sublime music.  If sorrowful isn't enough, prepare for intensely anguished at the 3 minute mark, when the music takes a decided turn to serious emotional impact.  It immediately drew tears as I listened.  I have always maintained that the true merit of a composer is not how well he conveys his emotions but how well he draws yours.  Randall Thompson does.  The 2nd movement may be the most brilliantly written and thrilling movements in the 20th century symphonic repertoire.  The orchestration, especially in the tutti climaxes, is astonishing.  The brass players must have been delighted beyond belief.  At the conclusion, however, Thompson quiets to a pastoral close. The 3rd movement represents another moving piece of composition, tender and pastoral with a hint of longing.  I know of no 20th century composer who could write more beautiful slow movements.  The 4th and final movement reminds you of youthful play, innocent and the like, yet on occasion the music upscales to mature, sometimes serious climaxes.  The brass and timpani play a particularly important roles in this movement, with the former glorious and the latter profound.  The conclusion of the symphony is stupendous.This album is likely to be my absolute favorite disc of 20th century music, immensely enjoyable from start to finish.  The music is more wonderful than words can describe.  The performance is exquisite, and the sound is resplendent.  This is a Must Have album for every music lover with even the slightest interest in 20th century American music.  There are NO shortcomings whatsoever, and the disc earns MY ABSOLUTELY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZCZHWAVZ4UEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001SEA#wasThisHelpful","RZCZHWAVZ4UEW","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Virgil Thomson, like many smart musicians, hedged his musical bets with “real” jobs, music critic and film composer.  Born in Kansas City, Missouri, the young musician attended Harvard University thanks to a loan from Mormon Joseph Smith’s grandson.  After graduation, he moved to Europe and studied with famed French composition teacher Nadia Boulanger whose other noted American students included Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Elliott Carter, and Walter Piston (pretty much a Who’s Who of 20th century American music).  While in Europe, Thomson enjoyed friendships with James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, Aaron Copland, Ezra Pound, Igor Stravinsky, Pablo Picasso,  and Orson Welles.  When Thomson returned home to America in 1940, he landed the position of music critic with the NY Herald Tribune alongside Aaron Copland.While Thomson composed a number of classical works including three symphonies and three operas, he is perhaps much better known as a film composer.  The present disc of film music includes scores for The River and The Plough that Broke the Plains performed by Richard Kapp conducting the Philharmonia Virtuosi.  Thomson’s music for these films is strikingly Americana, with abundant references to common hymns and folk tunes such as When Johnny Comes Marching Home.  The music is thoroughly enjoyable for what it is, and the writing is similar to Copland in Appalachian Spring.  The orchestra plays the works splendidly and the sound is first rate.  RECOMMENDED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JZ5GNCRPLNZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000082V#wasThisHelpful","R1JZ5GNCRPLNZO","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Witold Lutoslawski was the most prolific of 20th century Polish composers (and pianist and conductor) who was little known in America until 1956 when he visited the U.S. to give lectures and seminars.  Lutoslawski was trained for the Polish Army Signal Corp during WW II but was captured and imprisoned by the Germans.  He escaped and played piano in musical cafes  of Poland for the duration of the war.  He was also a composer in search of a compositional style with which he could confidently express his musical ideas, and his musical journey meandered through several influences and styles before arriving at his own.  Initially, the expression of his musical ideas was limited to folk-dominated music by the post-war Polish state until finally in the 1950’s, when he devised his own methods that involved using groups of musical intervals to build his harmonic structure. He also employed aleatory in which rhythmic elements of the music are subjected to chance.  This element of chance culminates in Indeterminacy in which increasing degrees of freedom are granted to the performer.I’ve covered only a sampling of Lutoslawski’s life to give you some idea of its breadth.  That life was an active one experientially as well as musically, and this album presents works beginning with the Symphonic Variations, his orchestral debut written at the age of 25, his Piano Concerto (1988), Variations on a Theme by Paganini for Solo Piano and Orchestra (1978), and his final Symphony 4 composed in 1992, just two years before his death.  The works are performed by Edward Gardner and the BBC Symphony Orchestra on Chandos and were recorded in 2011.The album begins with Lutoslawski’s Symphonic Variations, composed while the composer was studying composition at the Warsaw Conservatory.  His teacher pronounced it musically incomprehensible and ugly.  Nice.  It depicts the influence of Stravinsky and involves a ten measure theme first presented by flute, then violins.  Seven variations follow with a final coda.  The music immediately captures and holds your attention, and it demonstrates how fine an orchestrator Lutoslawski had already become.  The music is exciting, sometimes lovely, and sometimes powerful, sometimes stark, sometimes lush – but ALWAYS endlessly fascinating.  Okay, I’ll admit it:  I enjoy Lutoslawski!  The rhythms, melodic elements, dynamic contrasts, orchestral sonorities, and drama make this music easy to enjoy.The Piano Concerto was composed specifically for Krystain Zimmerman but is played here by Louis Lortie.  Each movement has the tempo specified with metronome markings.  The 1st movement is a driving affair with impressive climaxes.  Lortie’s piano tone is beautifully rounded.  The 2nd movement is marked Presto but is inconsistently so.  I did not find it nearly as interesting as the 1st.  The 3rd movement is slower and even less interesting.  The 4th movement opens with low strings playing a quiet but agitated melodic element (really, a brief series of strongly rhythmic motifs).  After 30 seconds of that introduction, the piano enters.  As the movement continues and more instruments join in, those motifs dominate the musicscape. A final coda ensues that is quite exciting.  Lortie demonstrates superb technique in one of the more difficult sounding piano concertos I have heard.  The music is uniformly interesting and more than listenable, but I find it somewhat difficult to give it stars for beauty.The Variations on a Theme by Paganini have an interesting history.  German occupation of Poland stripped the land of its classical music opportunities, and musical cafes popped up as a new venue.  Lutoslawski partnered with composer/pianist Panufnik to arrange and perform light music.  They composed or arranged a considerable number of works, all but these Variations lost in the 1944 Polish Uprising.  Much later, Lutoslawski arranged the Variations for piano and orchestra.  These are interesting and superbly played, but I will always defer to Rachmaninov for such an arrangement.Symphony 4 begins darkly.  A clarinet sings a long, slow, rather pensive melody is soon repeated that is taken up by other instruments and instrument ensembles as the single movement symphony unfolds.  Before the first tempo closes, the intensity increases, and the “movement” becomes a bit furious.  The second tempo section is agitated and at times angry-sounding.  Four more tempo section follow.  This is difficult music to love, yet Lutoslawski felt that his later music better expressed his musical ideas.  Personally, although I find great pleasure in modern music, I find Lutoslawski’s earlier works that are more easily accessible are far more enjoyable.This album is an excellent sampling of Lutoslawski across time.  Orchestral execution is superb, and Gardner is certainly in the mind of the music even if it has varying degrees of heart.  Sonically, the disc is without flaw, and the music makes a big splash on an adequately amped audio system.  VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for the Symphonic Variations, but others may enjoy his more obtuse works as well.  The latter, for me, are more enjoyable if absorbed rather than analyzed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TOYUSI0EF7BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0069TWD42#wasThisHelpful","R1TOYUSI0EF7BQ","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roy Harris, Randall Thompson, and David Diamond – three noted 20th century American composers on one disc, Bernstein:  American Masters.  The Sony album presents Harris Symphony 3, Thompson Symphony 2, and Diamond Symphony 4 performed by Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in recordings made in 1962, 1969, and 1959, respectively.I recently reviewed Roy Harris’s Third Symphony performed by Bernstein/NYPO on a DG disc.  Quoting from that review, I said:  “Harris, who didn’t chose composition as a career until 26, studied with Sir Arthur Bliss and Nadia Boulanger. He is quoted as saying that his Third Symphony came along when it was needed. To be sure, it is a modern single-movement symphony of 1939 that was easily accessible, and it garnered wide acclaim upon its introduction. The music is assertive, direct, and relatively uncomplicated when compared to some other early 20th century music. It begins with melancholic cellos on a meandering modern theme. Additional strings take up the theme as tension build. Horns and other instruments complete the ensemble as the harmony increases in complexity. The music is interesting and easy to listen to. The pace quickens in a second-like movement, and the music adopts a new, more lively theme that jumps from one instrument to another before an exquisite fugue-like passage that brings in the timpani’s first appearance. Increasing complexity, tension, and dynamic contrasts ensue. We don’t hear even an intermediate full orchestra climax until the 14 minute mark in this 18  minute work. The music then slows with a repeated timpani pulse as the mood returns to mournful. A final set of chords played by strings and brass adds a timpani roll that brings the symphony to a close. Fine 20th century music. Not great, but Bernstein and crew perform it with precise distinction.”  The present Sony recording has more immediacy that DG’s as well as more excitement.  AND the timpani are very well defined. (Those familiar with my review know that in my next life I will play the timpani as well as the piano!)  The sound on this recording is far more vivid that DG’s, with the brass especially glorious.  The Sony disc unquestionably offers the better performance and sound.  It’s surprising how different two recordings of the same symphony, conductor, and orchestra can be.  Having heard this performance, I would NOT have called the music “fine but not great.”  It’s great!Randall Thompson was another important figure in 20th century American music who made his rounds of elite American music schools including UC Berkeley, Director of Curtis Institute, and faculty member of Princeton and Harvard.  Not a bad C.V.  Besides his three symphonies, he also composed much choral music including Choose Something Like a Star from Americana.  If you haven’t heard this wonderfully moving piece, find it, buy it, and prepare to be moved.  Thompson’s Symphony 2 begins energetically with vivacious rhythms.  The 2nd movement is as lovely a slow movement as you are likely to hear from the 20th century.  The 3rd movement begins with plucked bass and has a hint of jazz majesty to it.  I heard more than a few Gershwin-like bars of music. This music may not be moving but certainly makes you want to move.  A middle section is at times dreamy.  Thompson demonstrates a bit of musical chameleon to his character, able to change his color at a moment’s notice.  Impressive.  The 4th movement Andante had another lovely theme that walked along with a hint of melancholy before transforming to an upbeat tempo.  More chameleon.  You gotta love it!  Finally, Thompson gives us a full orchestra version of the original melody that is just awe-inspiring.  If I had to pick one phrase to describe Thompson, it would be “one colorful surprise after another.”  This is some of the easiest to hear 20th century music ever written – right up there with Copland’s Appalachian Spring.David Diamond may have been the least academically oriented of the three composers on this disc, but he was the most prolific and the biggest award-winner.  He wrote 11 symphonies, of which the Fourth is performed on this disc.  The 1st movement is a serious-sounding work but never ponderous or overworked.  It is very attractive modern music but not beautifully melodic like that of Thompson.  Diamond writes with power and substance with more tutti than ensemble.  The 2nd movement begins with a stark brass passage sounding very modern that adds strings in a melancholic, almost anguished, hymn.  The music, though modern, is of considerable interest, and it is a fine demonstration of Diamonds superb orchestration skills.  Just listen to the powerful climaxes.  This deserves repeated listening.  The 3rd and final movement is energized with a plethora of different orchestral sonorities.  The music is exciting throughout and easily holds the listener’s attention.  It is easy to see why Bernstein included Diamond on this disc.This is one of the most enjoyable albums of 20th century American music I have yet heard, and I can’t think of a finer introduction to our symphonic music of the last century.  Equally enjoyable is the sound which absolutely defies its age.  Everything sonically is as it should be.  Sony should be commended for its remastering which is astonishing.  The album easily deserves my VERY HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!  Not to be missed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDID2WGDTY62H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000009CYH#wasThisHelpful","RDID2WGDTY62H","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roger Sessions is found only a few pages after “serialism” in music dictionaries and encyclopedias.  How appropriate given his use of this compositional system.  He is regarded as an important figure in 20th century American music.  Born just before his century began, Sessions studied at Harvard and Yale, took private lessons from Ernest Bloch, and later became Bloch’s assistant at Curtis Institute.  Most impressive, as always, is not the education one receives but rather the education one gives.  In this regard, Sessions’ students affirm his place in American music:  Milton Babbitt, Peter Maxwell Davies, and Ellen Zwilich – each an American composer of considerable note.  And so was Sessions.Although I attended music school at Indiana University (but left after a three semesters for medicine), I am not about to claim any profound knowledge of serialism.  I approach modern music from my right hemisphere much more than from my left one.  In so doing, modern music such as that of Roger Sessions is either approachable or it isn’t.  I listen and absorb when I can’t listen and analyze.  The music of Sessions is: a) very approachable and enjoyable, and b) I listen and absorb much more than I even try to analyze it.  So, given those honest admissions, what do I think of his music and this recording?  First answers to that question: interesting musical ideas and instrumentation; stretches my musical mind which prevents me from becoming stagnant; enjoyable.  No, it didn’t evoke tears.  Sessions’ music isn’t amelodic, but don’t lose sleep if you can’t spot them.  Look for motifs both melodic and rhythmic.With a little patience, I found beauty within this pleasant music, enough that I want to listen to more works of Sessions.  I find multiple sequences of intervals and somewhat novel sonorities.  Symphony 5 is more energetic than Symphony 4.  I found the Fifth more interesting and energized but less soothing.  Both require active attention to reap rewards.  The sound is excellent.  The Columbus Symphony is a fine regional orchestra that plays well for Badea.  Soundstage is excellent with superb center fill.

"Stanislaw Skrowaczewski had quite a celebrated tenure at Minneapolis and here performs Prokofiev Romeo and Juliet Suites.  Also on the disc is A Night on Bald Mountain with Antal Dorati and the London Symphony.  These are both original Mercury recordings, Romeo and Juliet from 1962 and Bald Mountain from 1960.The two Romeo and Juliet Suites are given excellent albeit refined performances with exquisite sonic.  Skrowaczewski is a terrific interpreter of the music but never pulls out all the stops or plays over the top.  These are distinguished performances with wonderful energy and excitement.  I could be happy with them being my only recordings.  I suspect, however, that most listeners will prefer more dynamic and emotional accounts of competing conductors.  The Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra plays with precision.  The sound is extraordinary, with excellent soundstage, center fill, and orchestral sonorities.For excitement and energy, listen to Dorati’s LSO performance of Night on Bald Mountain.  This is a conductor known for pulling out the stops, and he gives one of the finest accounts I’ve heard.  Sound, however, is not up to that of the Suites.  Center fill is less than desirable, and the ambience is typical of a studio recording.  Even so, this is a reading that I would position on the top shelf ahead of the majority of competitors.  Talk about dynamics.Sound is excellent to superb.  Night on Bald Mountain is the tastiest treat here, but the Romeo and Juliet Suites are almost their equal.

"This is a case when a pair of Threes wins the hand.  Here we have classic accounts of Roy Harris Symphony 3 and William Schuman Symphony 3 by perhaps the greatest champion of American music that ever lived – Leonard Bernstein – with his NYPO on the DG label.  Both works and performances are of definitive status with great sound.Harris, who didn’t chose composition as a career until 26, studied with Sir Arthur Bliss and Nadia Boulanger.  He is quoted as saying that his Third Symphony came along when it was needed.  To be sure, it is a modern single-movement symphony of 1939 that was easily accessible, and it garnered wide acclaim upon its introduction.

The music then slows with a repeated timpani pulse as the mood returns to mournful.  A final set of chords played by strings and brass adds a timpani roll that brings the symphony to a close.  Fine 20th century music.  Not great, but Bernstein and crew perform it with precise distinction.William Schuman studies at Juilliard with Roy Harris.  His composition career was set when drew the attention of Koussevitzky.  Schuman also had an administrative career, as well, serving a publications director for G. Schirmer and as presidents of Juilliard and Lincoln Center.  Best of all, his music is more interesting than his mentor’s!  The present work is two parts of two movements each.  Schuman’s Third Symphony begins with similarity to Harris’ but the 1st movement Passacaglia quickly picks up the pace, additional instruments, and harmonic and textural interest.  The 2nd movement Fugue is an incredible piece of music, although not readily identifiable as a fugue.  This is your Mamma’s Bach in name only, but it is completely extraordinary and fun to follow.  You’ll love it.  There is such harmonic and textural beauty, I almost forgot that it was modern music.  The sonorities are terrific.  The 3rd movement is a mournful Chorale the opens with strings.  A single trumpet joins to take up the theme, then turns it over to a single flute, all the while the strings provide a moving base. Strings resume the theme and underlying harmonic foundation with sublime beauty.  The melancholic mood never subsides.  The 4th movement Toccata is studded with snare while woodwind instruments present the lively theme.  Frequent runs enhance the interest.  The music often becomes anguished or agitated but never dull.  Increasing appearances of timpani and cymbals announce increasing tension as the symphony draws to an exciting close.  This is superb 20th century music with much greater interest and beauty than its companion on the disc.This is an all-together successful album of American music.  The sound is as distinguished as the performances, although the Schuman is far more enjoyable.  Soundstage, center fill, and orchestral sonorities are superb.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGM3GSWGPNU62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001G8E#wasThisHelpful","RGM3GSWGPNU62","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been on a recent quest for greatest recordings of Brahms Symphony No. 4 and have come upon one that other reviewers and now I have found outstanding - Carlos Kleiber and the Vienna PO on DG, which I recently reviewed and is vivid in interpretation and sound.  The present account by Fritz Reiner and the Royal PO is a remastering by Chesky Records.  It is phenomenal, a perfect example of the capability of astute technicians to both eliminate the hiss of older recordings while actually enhancing the sound rather than degrading the highs.  Chesky considers itself an audiophile label, and they'll get no argument from me.  The sound is absolutely stupendous.  You would never guess that this is a 1962 recording.  Chesky could teach RCA a thing or two about rehabilitating old recordings the right way, certainly better than those RCA SACD's of the classic accounts.Reiner's interpretation is a bit more relaxed in comparison to the fire typically infused into his performances.  The tempos aren't slow but they sure aren't rushed, either.  In the 1st movement (and the other, for that matter), Reiner seems to aim more for exploring the depth of the music rather than settle for a mere blockbuster performance. This is a stately performance of considerable emotional depth.  The Andante is very capable of evoking listener emotion.  The warmth of the reading is astonishing for Reiner.  In the 3rd movement, I noticed that the slightly-dulled leading edge of instrumental attacks may be a casualty of Chesky's process of restoration.  It could also be a consequence of the reverberation.  Once noticed, it seemed to be ubiquitous.  Same with the 4th movement.  Still, this is a wonderful interpretation and not one to be missed.After rehearing the album, I am convinced that Reiner's recording of Symphony 4 won't displace Kleiber's account despite the generally phenomenal sound for a 1962 recording.  However, I would rank Reiner ahead of Nagano.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFMYS7YBN6OR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000003GCQ#wasThisHelpful","R2SFMYS7YBN6OR","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is difficult from me to put my finger on, but there is something about this recording of Brahms Symphony 4 with Kent Nagano and the German Symphony Orchestra on Harmonia Mundi that strikes me as not quite right; and it is the recorded sound rather than the interpretation that is the more problematic.  According to Wikipedia, the orchestra was founded in 1946 by the American occupation forces in Berlin.  Although the Deutsches SO has had an incredibly notable number of conductors - Ferenc Fricsay (1948-1954, 1959-1963), Lorin Maazel (1964-1975), Riccardo Chailly (1982-1989), Vladimir Ashkenazy (1989-1999), and Kent Nagano (2000-2006) – it competes with the Berlin PO for players.  Now, who do you think is going to win the best players?  I could not find any information regarding the size of the Deutsches SO, but by the sound of the recording I would guess that the orchestra is smaller than the norm.  This is not to say that it isn’t an excellent orchestra, for it is.  They play with distinction for their conductor of half a dozen years.  The sound issue may be a slight lack of brilliance and less than optimally defined timpani.  My “like-new” disc lacked the booklet, but this sounds like a recording made in an overly damped studio.  Perhaps others can hear the issue more clearly.Kent Nagano’s interpretation played by the Berlin PO would probably have sounded better.  The interpretation lacks the electricity of one of my favorites – Kleiber, but he has been accused by some of being too white-hot with his reading on DG.  Still this is a superb interpretation, perhaps more lyrical than Kleiber’s.  I would certainly place it as a 4.5 Stars - 5 for interpretation and 4.25 for sound - and recommend it highly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O8OJSLPQFDMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HXDRZA#wasThisHelpful","R2O8OJSLPQFDMF","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Eric Ewazen teaches at Julliard, and his music has the simple beauty and accessibility of Karl Jenkins.  In this album the International Sejong Soloists play Ewazen’s Concerto for Violin and Strings, Down a River of Time (Concerto for Oboe & Strings), and Sinfonia for Strings.  Each are three-movement works.  Each is a refined, well-played work of considerable interest.  Most of all, each work is a pure delight.  Is Ewazen really a modern-day composer?  The question is at once appropriate for his music is heaven sent in a day usually filled with dissonance and atonality.  Not so with Ewazen.  While not quite music that you hum after listening, this (like Jenkins) is almost too accessible to be 21st century products.I very much enjoy listening to and reviewing modern music with its often times difficult-to-describe sonorities.  I was surprised by the sheer beauty of this music.  It is truly a breath of fresh air.  I compose piano music without major dissonance and sometimes feel like I am in the wrong century.  Ewazen quells my self-doubt. It IS possible to write serious music that doesn’t attack the listener after all.  I don’t typically enjoy concertos other than piano, but both the violin and oboe concertos are splendid creations.  His Sinfonia is a sublime work of music.Ewazen’s music has considerable poignancy infused throughout each work.  I don’t know if Ewazen’s music will stand the test of time, but I can assure you that his music will fall favorably and easily on the ears of our time.  I strongly encourage you to take the opportunity to hear this wonderful music.

"Gustav Allan Pettersson was a Stockholm-born symphonist who composed in the vicinity of the middle of the 20th century.  He is considered one of Sweden’s most important 20th century composers.  He is unique in that his symphonic music fails to adhere to any particular school of composition unless you consider “dark” a school.  His music is, indeed, quite dark – but also quite compelling.  His life is a fascinating one and of immediate interest to a psychiatrist.  We know that his father was apparently a roaring alcoholic blacksmith, while his mother was kind and playful.  He began studying at the Stockholm Royal Conservatory (violin and viola) at 19.  A later diagnosis of polyarthritis was to ultimately confine him to his apartment for the last years of his life.  Pettersson was better known as a performer until 1968 when Antal Dorati premiered his fame-producing Symphony No. 7.  He continued to write until his death in 1080.On this SACD disc, Christian Lindberg leads the Norrkoping Symphony Orchestra in Pettersson’s Ninth Symphony.  Symphony 9, like most of his 16 symphonies, is organized as one long movement, in this case of almost 70 minutes duration.  His music is tonal, but don’t expect melodies as such.  There are abundant melodic motifs, however.  Rather, Pettersson produces a variety of orchestral sonorities, moods, and rhythms, many of the latter repetitive.  Fortunately, his music is variable enough to easily sustain the listener’s interest.  I certainly found his Ninth to do so.  Yes, it is dark, but I don’t find it oppressively so.  Like many 20th century composers, Pettersson enjoys combinations of instruments as much as orchestral tutti’s.  When a tutti appears, there is a repetitive relentlessness about it, usually connoting a struggle.  Tutti’s are usually accompanied by plenty of timpani, always dear to my heart.  You will hear traces of dances and minimalism.  Despite the lack of flowing melodic lines, there is a poignancy to Pettersson’s music that is very alluring and engaging.  And I found the symphony very enjoyable – not smile-provoking, but enjoyable nonetheless.  After 70 minutes of gloom, the music ends simply with a touching Picardy third.The orchestra plays beautifully, but sounds like a regional orchestra with forces I wish were greater.  Sonics are excellent, however.  I really liked this modern symphony and will order more Pettersson as a result.  I rate the recording Highly Recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2845OYMGN48T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP90AVY#wasThisHelpful","R2845OYMGN48T4","A2O8XMNIBHZXCE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2O8XMNIBHZXCE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the big brother to the Dorcy 41-2510.  Both are superb flashlights with intense light.  The company should rename it a mini-searchlight.  It is relatively light and fairly difficult to lose with its vibrant yellow and black color scheme.  Now you might ask why you should buy a $13 flashlight. First, you don't change the batteries very often.  LEDs don't consume much energy.  This flashlight uses 4-AA batteries and will last 5 hours of continuous use.  When was the last time you used any flashlight that long?  Probably never.  Second, this thing is VERY bright.  Third, it looks rugged. I bought two of these and five of its little brother.  Frankly, most users would do as well to just buy the little brother which is cheaper, lighter, uses only two batteries, and still shines one heck of a beam.

"The most important thing to know about this Thermo Hygrometer is to experiment with the location for your sensor.  We are only interested in the temperature reading and have discovered that placement of the sensor does indeed affect your temperature reading.  The location of ours is in the crevice of the window.  This shields it a tiny bit so that it reads warmer by a few degrees in the winter, and colder in the summer because that location is in the shade.  We adjust our expectations knowing the limitations of placement.  Still, it's nice to know the ""general"" temperature without the burden of wires running through the bottom of your windows.

"A really nice iPhone 6 case that adds a cool color without adding bulk. This case is a great way to protect your phone from scratches and light bumps, but I don't think it would hold up to a big drop. It's lightweight and low profile - doesn't add any bulk at all. Fit snugly and was easy to put on. It came with a screen protector (YAY) and accessories to apply it easily. I liked that it was packaged so the screen protector and accessories didn't come already scratched like I have experience with other brands. I don't know how well this will stand up to long term use and scratches, but it's a great case if you like to change often and want a new look for your phone without a lot of bulk or weight.I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XRCUR8GKRQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01444J5YO#wasThisHelpful","R16XRCUR8GKRQ1","A14ITQL3HRNYW8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14ITQL3HRNYW8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I'm reviewing a product I like to do the pros and cons in my head of what I expect from a product. For this product I expect a level of grit that will be comfortable but will get the job done. This met my expectations of what a good foot file would have. It gets the dead skin off my feet effectively without being uncomfortable. I like that it came with two files - I have one in the bathtub and I use it there. The other I keep next to my vanity and I use it if I feel like my feet are rough before I put lotion on in the morning. They're both double sided though I cannot tell a difference in the texture from top to bottom. The handle fit my hand well and the hole in the handle allows me to hang it from my shower caddy so it doesn't get gross from sitting on a shelf.

"I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest evaluation.I am currently 8.5 mo pregnant so I couldn't try it on myself - though I fully intend to use it postpartum as my core support and I will update my review if anything changes. For the purposes of this review I asked a friend who is 8 weeks postpartum and similarly sized and shaped to me to wear it for a week over her tank top and tell me how it fit. First of all when I think latex I imagine like fake rubber - that's not the case here, it's soft and stretchy. It has three adjustment levels so you can tighten or loosen it depending on if you're experiencing a bloated day or you're losing weight. It didn't irritate the skin, or cause excessive sweating. It fit comfortably and being an underbust style didn't affect nursing in a negative way. It gave a shapely silhouette under her clothes and I didn't even realize she had it on one day when I visited a few days later. She said she was impressed it didn't dig into her hips when she sat down as she has a much shorter torso than I do (she's 5'4"" to my 5'8""). I look forward to trying this myself in about 6 weeks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16QD77D7K7IZ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014NKLR54#wasThisHelpful","R16QD77D7K7IZ4","A14ITQL3HRNYW8","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A14ITQL3HRNYW8?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The transmitter is in a weatherproof case and is well made. 8 DIP switches control the security code, and 2 more switches control the chime sound selection. I am glad to see it using four CR123A batteries -- certainly better than regular alkaline batteries, yet standard enough to get easily and cheaply. It works on 433.92 MHz.The sensor coil is buried in the ground. It picks up magnetic field change, so only vehicles trigger it. You can move a hammer or a large metal can to test trigger. It should be installed far away from the main road to avoid triggering by large trucks.At first, the receiver did not work for me at 1000 feet. It started working reliably once it was moved high on the wall and mounted vertically.There is a LED for each of the 4 zones and the number of blinks can show the number of triggering. Each has separate relay for easy external control. The terminal block makes connection easy.Now the negative points (besides being much overpriced)...The receiver has 3 function buttons, simply labeled A, B, and C. They control LED, beep, and exit delay. They could have labeled them as such. There are 16 jumpers which are also tersely labeled. They do not even document them in sequence (example: they explain button C before button A). Not everyone will use these buttons or jumpers, but they could have made this unit so much more user friendly. Aaarg!For the price they charge, they could have provided an extra sensor probe so that alarm is only triggered on incoming vehicle and not the outgoing.

"Just the right size for occasional use. I use it to grease my riding lawn mower and tractor.People complaining of leaking should make sure to remove the foil cover from the cartridge completely. Any tiny particle going into the gun can cause a pump failure or leak.If it does not pump, you may have inserted the cartridge upside down. It will work either way eventually, but doing it properly makes it easier. The foil side goes to the top of the gun. The open side goes into the rubber plunger. The foil side is packed and has no air, so the suction works to pump immediately. Otherwise air has to bleed out for the pump to work, which is why some people suggest leaving the top loosened a bit at first.It can also suction load from a bulk grease container if you do not want to use a 3oz cartridge. Cheaper, but messier in my opinion.It becomes difficult to detach from a connector if you overfill. You need to stop pumping immediately once the pressure build-up is felt. This is how Zerk connector works. If it does not detach, unscrew the nozzle to relieve the pressure which will let it detach.Some grease fittings are difficult to reach.

"Worked fine as a XBMC/KODI box. If that is all you want, then it works well and at a great price.The IR remote was terrible... it would often double each keystroke, so it was impossible to enter the WiFi password. Workaround was to use a USB keyboard, though that defeats using it wireless. Get an AirMouse or something like it instead. I believe this remote was defective because it would work correctly from time to time, then start erratically again a while later. I have other Android TVs and they do not have this issue, so it is not a problem with stray IR in the room.Where it fails is as an Android device. It comes with a shell that might be easier for some people instead of a standard Android desktop. It is not well customizable and makes it more tedious to use. Many functions fail, such as setting the keyboard layout even though it keeps bugging you to set it. And OTA update function fails also.The item description claims you can download virtually any app from the playstore, but the store does not list many popular programs such as Candy Crush. SlingPlayer also could not be found. The problem may be that the box is set to Shanghai location and it cannot be changed, even though it correctly locates me in USA using WiFi. They provide an APK installer so looks like it is possible to copy from another box, though.Other than the bad IR remote and/or receiver, the box itself worked well. Perhaps a firmware update or a custom ROM would solve all the issues.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183GCYNF4K1DX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYNGASU#wasThisHelpful","R183GCYNF4K1DX","A2I2KPNJDQ9SL0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I2KPNJDQ9SL0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is comfortable to wear and the battery lasts at least 10 hours (spec says 12).The sound is very good.It works as an unpowered headphone, too.Over-the-ear design is great for outdoor use as it cuts down on noise.Some problems for my use:1. With some Bluetooth transmitters the sound was too loud and could not be made lower. Its lowest volume setting is ""mute"".2. There is no battery-level indication, so you cannot tell if it is charged enough for the day. I wish it would speak the remaining charge as with Plantronics. The battery is very easy to change. One would have to purchase an universal charger, though, to charge separately.3. You have to speak pretty loud for the microphone to activate when used as a headset.Update: The USB connector on the headset broke after a year. I have seen this happen on other charge ports from repeated insertion. I wish it had a wireless Q-charging capability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP3QFXRDFYUX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IL9ZMF0#wasThisHelpful","RP3QFXRDFYUX0","A2I2KPNJDQ9SL0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I2KPNJDQ9SL0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Basically it is a thin white shelf-liner with adhesive.

"This Quad sensor is identical to the Trio version externally. Internally, the main difference is the addition of PIR and DIP switches.The magnetic door, light, and temperature sensors are the same.The device is compact and well made. It has many Z-Wave configuration parameters. The firmware needs work, however.Trio unit was good, but this Quad with PIR has false triggering issues and the firmware does not effectively address PIR and reed function in combination.The magnetic reed switch is located at both sides of the body and either one makes the contact, so it is convenient but the actuation can be defeated by placing a magnet on the unused side.The documentation has much details, but written in such a way that makes it a bit difficult to read and has errors -- not good in a technical paper.Main Pros: Lots of options, CR123A battery, relatively small size for multi-functionMain Cons: PIR has false triggering problem and does not always turn off. Difficult to open the case once it is mounted! Battery change is a challenge without removing the unit from the wall.It is a good unit for temperature and light-level reading, though there are other choices.For door-sensing only, Fibaro (with many options) or Ecolink/Schlage is better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DPF0FCS33X8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KK042R2#wasThisHelpful","R2DPF0FCS33X8Z","A2I2KPNJDQ9SL0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2I2KPNJDQ9SL0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is really cool.  I had previously ordered a different model that I couldn't get to use with my computer AT ALL.  Had to send it back.  So I ordered this, and was attracted to the fact that it doesn't need any drivers.  It can scan to a card or just to its very small internal memory, then copied to the computer.I just use the internal memory.  Have years of 35 mm film negatives to scan, and I get about 24 pics (about one roll of film) before I run out of memory, and copy over to the computer.  It is fast and the scans are quite nice.  I'm very happy with this.I could use a card and not copy to computer as often, but frankly, I like this because I can put each roll into a folder by date/event.  I like that, so it doesn't bother me at all to stop and copy after each roll.I recommend this!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14M1JEQ6EZ37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GIDADP0#wasThisHelpful","R14M1JEQ6EZ37","A3TJO6RS1G4AQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TJO6RS1G4AQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"So, I never really believed that radar detectors work.  I have a friend that is retired CHP (California Highway Patrol), and he told me that they don't work.  Then, in a conversation with a colleague she mentioned that she has a radar detector and that it works great.  So it was on my mind when the company asked me if I wanted to review this item.  I said yes, without cautious optimism, but no real expectation.So I drive a lot for work.  I have used this now for 4 weeks.  In that time I've covered the 80 miles between Santa Barbara and Santa Maria (highway 101) 6 times, and 300 miles between Sacramento and Paso Robles 2 times.  The detector has worked beautifully.  We've gotten a fair number of X and K signals, that I pretty much ignore.  However, each time we got a Ka signal, it was real.  And 2 times, on highway 41 and 46, we at first thought it was false because we looked around and saw no CHP.  But, in BOTH cases, there was a CHP and we were alerted so far in advance we couldn't see them for a bit.  It must have been picking up the signal they were sending to cars well ahead of us.  That is a 55 mile an hour road, and it's impossible to go that slow.  This really saved us.  I know that if there is no one ahead of you, and you get the radar pointed at you, it isn't going to save you, but in these 2 cases, it most definitely saved us by signaling when drivers well ahead of us were radared.I was very skeptical at first, but this has turned out to be a worthwhile little gadget.  Buying 2 for gifts now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21HC089BXBEZ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAFW336#wasThisHelpful","R21HC089BXBEZ7","A3TJO6RS1G4AQS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3TJO6RS1G4AQS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I liked this book because it makes an incredible case for something in which I've always believed: if you create an environment where it is the employee who has to make decisions - meaning that you share the responsibility of decision-making - you are creating an environment where those employees will thrive, bloom and excel.Obviously, in the real world, things are not so simple - that's why the approach is not so widespread in our corporate culture. However, this book takes a serious look at what it takes (risks and advantages - and how to address both) to build that environment.This book is valuable from beginning to end.

Another reviewer said it is expensive... it is true... but then again, all of those Kindle/iPad covers usually are expensive. I paid $70 for a leather cover for my iPad.

"On the photo, it did not look so big. But then I saw another photo of a hand opening the door to the ink cartridges. And I said ""OMG, this printer is a beast!"". And I was right. It makes an A3 sheet of paper look like an A4. The box is huge enough to serve as a table and, boy, it is not light.But then you realize THIS IS NOT an average printer. This is the Rolls-Royce of printers. This is not the printer that a photographer will need... but one he/she will desire. This is a piece of hardware aimed at those who know what they are buying. The most amazing prints you'll ever see in a long time.Unboxing takes a lot of effort since the printer is big and heavy. You will have to have a table for it. It will not fit where normal printers usually are. But if you bought one, you already understood the central place it will take around your work. So I placed it is a nice spot, with a dedicated table where I keep the paper and other office material. I used the Ethernet cable to connect it to my router and the rest was not as hard as I thought.Installing the ink cartridges was easy enough. The printer comes with all the documentation you need and it is easy to follow. However, the printer will take some time to pump the ink through the tubes, test this, test that... and since I'm very slow, the whole process (from unboxing to printing the first photo) took me FOUR HOURS. But let me be clear... once I saw what it can do, well, it was north it!I would go as far as saying that there is nothing you cannot print with this printer.Every color, every finishing... glossy, more glossy, less glossy, more ink, less ink... everything that comes out of this printer is flawless... which can be good if you know exactly what you are doing or bad if you don't. I'm still getting used to what it can do... so I will take some time until I can truly take advantage of all the control this printer gives me. I do not use the Canon software. Like others, I print it directly from Photoshop.The printer is not fast. But at this level of quality you understand that four minutes to print one photo is exactly what you were looking for when you bought it. This printer knows what it is doing and makes no compromise.Needless to say, this printer will not replace my fast HP OfficeJet. The HP is a printer. The Canon Pixma Pro-1 is an Artist.I love this printer and couldn't be happier!NOTE: the printer takes a lot of ink on its FIRST use. But that's an illusion because the large amount of ink it takes from the cartridges is not used right away. Instead, it is feeding the tubes all the way to the print head. Meaning that long after you have replaced those cartridges, the ink arriving at the head will still be from the previous cartridges. They are expensive (and they are 12!) but with a fine piece of hardware like this one, I'd say it is stupid NOT to buy the Canon cartridges. Come on, you spent almost a thousand dollars on a printer and you are compromising its performance (and possibly its lifespan) by getting cheap on the ink?RECOMMENDED!!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FLLY95INBB5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064VZD06#wasThisHelpful","R2FLLY95INBB5F","A1PL8JA0TEHBVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A critical conversation can be many things: a customer who insists in complaining, a family member with a personal problem, an employee you must let go, a colleague who is damaging the group... all of these moments and many others are the subject of this book. And it is a great book because what is basically does, is to show you the common issues we all face when in those situations and what we can do in order to ""have the conversation"" and start solving the problem (whatever it may be). Typically, the book is aimed at the workplace... but you can easily learn enough here to use anywhere. That's why I liked this book so much.Those who are familiar to the ""Dummies"" series will not be disappointed with the tips, warnings and reminders that make the series so effective. In fact, this book also helps you to better prepare and conduct yourself for any conversation (more or less critical).

"The REAL content of this book would fit in 20 pages: all the possible definitions of strategy, its elements and what strategy is not. Then the author gives a few personal insights about how strategic thought works and that's it. 20 Pages at best.But of course this book is not just that. The idea is very nice: to create a duo of silly characters who keep on talking to each other about strategy. The problem is that those dialogues MUST be very funny and brilliantly comical - otherwise they are just a bore. Unfortunately, they are a bore. The fast dialogue exchanges were written by a specialist in strategy... BUT NOT by a specialist in BOTH strategy and comedy. So the whole concept of this book really disappointed me.Plus... pages and pages comparing BOEING and AIRBUS. Silly, pointless and superficial. At a certain point, I thought Boeing was a sponsor of this book since the author loves the Dreamliner (he looks like a kid in awe) while coming ""this close"" to say the A380 is as bad as a Ford Pinto.

"This book is roughly divided in two parts: the first (chapters 1 and 2) calls our attention to the importance of choosing the right verbs, the right words, the right posture and the right mindset BEFORE giving a speech or presentation. And it is the best part of the book. The second part is a list of the actual power verbs to be used.In my point of view, that list is short and the choice of verbs is left unexplained. Why are the verbs ""mollycoddle"" or ""obnubilate"" power verbs? Many of the verbs here are completely unknown. What's the power in a verb few people know what it means? There must be some explanation about why a certain verb is a power verb. But this book does not give it. In many cases, all we get is the verb, its meaning and one or two phrases where it is used.I was expecting something like: ""Titivate"" - this is a power verb because...... it has this meaning...... and you can use it like this...... and take more advantage of it like this.....But no.So from page 21 onwards I found this book a major disappointment.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVC680QYIYUYW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133158640#wasThisHelpful","RVC680QYIYUYW","A1PL8JA0TEHBVN","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Garcinia Cambogia is very controversial.  Also, as with most supplements, it is very difficult to know exactly if they work or not as there is no true and accurate gauge for most.Per Webmd: ""Garcinia is a small to medium-sized tree that grows in India and Southeast Asia. The fruit rind contains the chemical hydroxycitric acid (HCA) and is used to make medicine.  How does it work? Garcinia contains the chemical hydroxycitric acid (HCA). Developing research suggests that HCA might prevent fat storage, control appetite, and increase exercise endurance...""I've read that at least 60% needs to be HCA or it is ineffective.

That is mostly why I take and try supplements in the first place.Overall Conclusion:  After trying this product I did feel that it did help control or suppress my appetite.

"I have played with many photo editing software programs over the years.  This one is fairly straight forward and fairly easy to use.  I had to hunt and peck for awhile as I was new to it's layout.  But, overall after you see the breakdown, etc. it is not too hard to navigate.  It does have some powerful abilities, but in my opinion not as powerful as photoshop.  Although, it does allow layers to be built and merged which is similar to photoshop.  I did not see a quick way to control each layers transparency etc. as I am accustomed to in Photoshop.  I originally opened the program with a photo to edit and simply wanted to flip it horizontally.  I looked for a long time and only found a way to rotate it. Which is not the same at all.  While continuing to feel my way around in the program, I ended up importing another pic and then discovered that via layers, you could flip the pic. It will take a bit more exploring and learning the program's abilities to get the entire ease of it's use - but overall it does seem to be a strong and solid editing program for it's price range.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CRFIY7PDUH96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0158RGNR8#wasThisHelpful","R1CRFIY7PDUH96","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bluedio Sports HeadsetThese buds fit very comfortably.  They come with various sized additional buds to ensure a good snug fit.  The sound quality sounds similar to the iphone ear buds.  The bass is pretty decent for this price range. They are not tinny either like other cheaper earbuds.  You can easily adjust the equalizer to more or less bass by pushing both volume adjustments at the same time. The sound controller buttons are good sized for quick access.  I actually can't say enough about that being a great feature as well. The fit and design are very good and should work well for most runners or other activities.

"Let me start with - the sound quality is excellent if your speakers are excellent as well.  However, the video receiver portion only functions via wired connections and even mirroring your device.  It does NOT work via any usb or home networking method.  All you get there is AUDIO or PHOTOS. I debated taking away a star for the lack of function there.  But, if you read the documentation carefully - it never actually says it can play movies, etc. thru the network - it only mentions sound quality, sound quality and sound quality.  Now personally, I think this is a shame as so many devices can use video in those methods.  Even my Samsung blu ray player can play movies via my network router media server, my shares via my tablet, phone & computer.  Also, of course being able to play a movie via a usb flash drive is again very common now and is doable on many non smart tv's as long as they are usb capable.  Therefore, I think this device missed some great features that just should be available for this price level of AV (audio/video) receiver.  If they had just announced this as an audio receiver, then perhaps I wouldn't be so disappointed in the lack of being able to play movies via a usb drive or networking drive.  That seems like a simple thing/function in this day and age - but yet this audio/video receiver device simply can't do it.Ok, so once I got past that expectation - the display interface isn't terrible as some suggested.  It's not beautiful, but functional.  It's a bit confusing at first, but doesn't take long to figure out some things.  Of course, reading the manual always helps a bit.  http://helpguide.sony.net/ha/strdn10686/v1/en/index.htmlI actually like how you can select watch, listen right from the remote and get to where you are going fairly fast.  Now granted if you are just interested in listening to some music and don't want to turn on the on screen display, you can use the songpal connected to your smart phone or tablet and it gives you almost the same options as the actual sony remote. Or if you are just interested in the radio - you can easily find that on the remote and not worry about the on screen display as well.  I have a projector setup instead of a tv - so this is an important feature to me.  I don't like wasting the bulb to just find some music etc. when it shouldn't be necessary.  I did install the songpal using the NFC function (bumping) and it paired flawlessly.HDMI ports:The video quality of the HDMI ports seem to do very well - even the mhl (Mobile High-Definition Link - smart phones, tablets etc.)  One more thing worth mentioning.  I did try the device mirroring and was actually able to play a movie without a lot of signal dropping and the audio and video was better than I expected.  Of course, it's not the same quality as connecting the device directly or even serving it to the media device via a media file server.Google Cast:It does cast AUDIO very nicely from almost anywhere back to the receiver within a google casting capable app.  Of course, if you want video, you will have to add your own Google Chromecast device to one of the hdmi ports.Overall - the sound and controls are excellent on this receiver.  I just wish it had more video receiving options as well as so many sound options.  If you do not care about all those other, extra ways to get video thru your network and instead just care about good quality sound and/or just connecting hdmi devices, then you can't go wrong with this receiver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQ6SWGLUFW8K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNH97QM#wasThisHelpful","R2UQ6SWGLUFW8K","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This works great.  I've finished two full weeks of sessions now and feel I can see an improvement.Out of the box:You have to put the gel stickies on the pads to allow the electric impulses to work. This is a bit cumbersome to place them originally, but then it's no big deal to cover them up with the included plastic covers when you are not using them.  This is to ensure they stay clean, etc.  I've also read that you can use certain tricks (alcohol, etc) to keep them sticky longer.  Otherwise, when the pads stop being sticky and stop conducting the electric impulses they will have to be replaced.I charged the battery originally and so far I haven't had to recharge it, so I'm still on the same charge.  It is showing about a half charge now after 6 sessions.  Which is pretty good in my opinion.  I really figured after about 3 sessions it would be dead. So, I am very impressed with the battery life.The Slendertone Arms7 has 3 programs - with the program 1 basically being conditioning and program 3 being the one you want to get to in order to  tone your arms.  Each program also has 99 levels of intensity.  It's too soon for me to say, but 99 levels might be overkill.  I'm on level 44 now.  The only con I've found so far is the the size of the ""one size fits all"" cuffs.  I have small arms and feel they are a bit big for me - yes you can adjust the cuff via the Velcro, but since the one strap on the one side is non adjustable, it can only be adjusted down so much.  Therefore, an added adjustment on both sides might be more helpful for really small arms like mine.Overall - it seems to be working and the power is very impressive and I love the fact that you can just charge the battery and not change them constantly.  Also, the controller and cable is just long enough to use, but no so long it's constantly in the way.  The design overall and functionality overall is very good.  5 stars - Marilyn","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25MIXOKPFTB2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011U19SX2#wasThisHelpful","R25MIXOKPFTB2K","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kiven 6Pack 3w LED Filament T10 Light Bulb Replacement to 40 Watt Incandescent Tube BulbI like the shape and look of these, but the long shape is also a downfall in regards to getting it to fit many fixture types.  It is too long to fit in my fan lights that also have an enclosed fixture.  I think these would be great in a lamp or a multi lighted item that could take 4 or so of these.  These are only 3w and are comparable to a 40 watt incandescent bulb - so by themselves they do not give you much light.  They do however create a nice warm atmospheric lighting and would be great when atmosphere is wanted or any other low lighted situation.  Of course as I said earlier you can use more than one to get more light in the right light fixtures.Pros: instant ON - unlike the old style of ledscons: long shape won't fit in all fixturesOverall, they work well and the look and design is great but will limit them to what they can fit into.

It doesn't feel heavy on my head and fits well.  I am sure most of the comfort is due to the fact that the ear pads are made of memory foam.

"This is an excellent assortment of selfie method mounts, etc.  This package is geared towards the Gopro Hero sports Camera, but will still work with many other cameras.  It does have various mounting options and contains a selfie stick with a clamping mounting method (which will work with just about any mobile phone).  It also has a tripod screw type setting that will work with certain cameras if they have the tripod mounting option. It of course also contains the mounting options to attach the Gopro Hero sports Camera and any other camera that mounts the same way.  If you examine the attachments carefully, you can figure out that you can actually switch some the mounting methods around to the other various attachment devices.  For example: there is a handlebar attachment for the gopro hero type mount - but you could use the handlebar attachment and add the tripod mount to it so that other cameras could be used in that situation as opposed to being limited to the Gopro Hero Camera.  I think with as many parts in this package and the fact that you can mix it up a bit and get just what you need for almost any camera mounting situation is a fantastic feature and makes this package very valuable and very useful.

"This is really a great invention.  This does exactly what my label maker can do, but with a lot more template options.  You go to avery.com/print to access the online templates.  There are a bunch of templates categorized by type (home, business, etc.). Once you choose your template, you can edit one or edit all labels on the page.  Although, I found it best to print all ten labels on a page when printing.  This is because after printing, in order to fully create the label, you have to crease the paper before removing the labels.  I think it is harder to go back and reprint a second label after having creased the paper.  For me, that is my biggest compliant - having to print all 10 at one time.

The phone easily snaps into it and the front edges of the case come up far enough to protect the phones edges from drops, etc.  I really like this otterbox as it is simple and clean looking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROW6DINI5TDQK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0X3AL0#wasThisHelpful","ROW6DINI5TDQK","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are really great.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well they sounded.  They come with extra ear loops and ear buds that include different sizes. Therefore, would be hard to find any ears that they don't fit.  The loop are used to fit the inside fold of your ear, which helps them stay in place while using the correctly sized ear bud to make listening an experience while making it possible to shut out other sounds around you. Since the bud does go directly into your ear, it helps make the sound absolutely crystal clear as well.  The strap goes around the back of your neck, therefore if you do need to remove one or both, the strap would just hang on your neck, not fall to the floor/ground, etc.  These are very nicely designed and the quality is outstanding for bluetooth earbuds.  I received these in exchange for my honest review.  5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R275U2LG32Q9AM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LP6CFEC#wasThisHelpful","R275U2LG32Q9AM","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice little electric device that can help your state of mind via it's calming lights or by adding scented oils.It holds just a little under 5.5 ounces (160 ml) of water.  You can add drops of various scented oils or even alcohol to the water for whatever soothing effect you need. The device has an automatic shutoff when the water level gets low.  It also runs very quiet - I was surprised that I couldn't hear it even a tiny bit.

"When I first started to use this razor I noticed that the shave wasn’t all that great.  But as the weeks went by, it gradually started to do a better job.  I can accept that your body does adapt to a new razor, etc.  But yet even now, it doesn't do as good of a job as a simple razor blade would have done.  This razor comes with a cleaning system.  The cleaning system cleans the heads after each use and keeps the blades sharp for the next use - it also charges the razor at the same time while cleaning.  It also comes with an adjustable 5 setting trimmer, that works very well.  It has a travel case for the razor only.  This razor is for sensitive skin and I'm guessing that is maybe why it is so difficult to get a CLOSE shave, but as I would like a close shave and it not to leave stubble, I'm giving it a 4 star review - for the cost of this razor, I shouldn't have to complain that the shave is not Close enough.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MV5O2GCQZR4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QYOTALG#wasThisHelpful","R3MV5O2GCQZR4","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Igearpro  8GB usb voice recorderThis little Deseret recorder works great and can be attached to your keyring.  It has an on/off button to turn recording on or off.  When turned on or off it flickers a red light a couple of times so you know the recorder is on or off.  But, then the light goes away and therefore no one would be the wiser if you were recording anything privately. It does not play anything back from the stick itself as it does not have a speaker, etc.  You can play the recordings back via inserting the device into your pc like a flash drive.  It will open as a storage drive, then you can select whatever file you want to play back.  The sound quality is shockingly good on this small device.  I recommend it for anyone that has a need to quickly create recordings.

"Out of the box - let me start with - you will have to put it together. But, it's not difficult - just assemble the pedestal tubes by screwing them together, then insert the pedestal feet into the base - it will click into place.  Add the tube assembly into the pedestal base, then put the grill base on top of the pedestal tube assembly, etc. Pretty much just follow the easy to understand included instructions.  Once you've followed them all (in 8 easy steps) and added the handle (8th step) - you are ready to grill.As long as you've put it together properly - then you can simply unclip the grill base from the pedestal in order to bring indoors, for indoor grilling if desired.  I have never really considered that I needed an electric grill outside.  However, this indoor/outdoor grill does make it easy to do.  Also, it is much faster than firing up the charcoal grill.  So, definitely when time is an issue and/or flare ups need to be avoided - this is a great healthy way to cook.  The cleanup is not that bad either - but could be made easier with a removable grill plate in addition to the existing removable drip tray. As with most all George Foreman electric grills - they do cook wonderfully and not much room to complain on the taste of the food.  This one is no exception.  I like that you can simply remove it from the stand and bring indoors to cook and/or to clean, etc.  Also, it is not designed to leave outdoors - it should be stored indoors or in a similar climate controlled environment.  Overall, this is a great and fairly versatile grill with a cooking controller that includes a warmer setting and has a light indicator.  This is a great sized grill which can be useful while entertaining as the grill plate is large enough to accommodate 15 portions.  This is a great indoor/outdoor grill.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MKQD5ICN6D15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHRH3HA#wasThisHelpful","R3MKQD5ICN6D15","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received a free watch for review. This is an interesting look for a watch and frankly I've never seen one like this before.  It has a black screen until you push the it's face to reveal the digital time.  It looks much like some of the fitness trackers.  To set the time, you touch the face with a long press, then it goes into ""set"" mode.  Literally, that one touch ""button"" does everything. It goes like this to set it:Press the button (screen)--> Hours/Minutes Shows* White it shows, long press on the screen until the hour blink--> Hour blink, minutes are steady. short push on the screen cycle through the hours* Long press on the screen again, Hours are steady, Minutes blink--> Short push on the screen cycle through the minutes* Long press on the screen again, Shows ""y 13"" for Year 2013.--> Short push on the screen cycle through the Years* Long press on the screen again, Shows Month:Day. Month is blinking, day is steady--> Short push on the screen cycle through the Months* Long press on the screen again, Shows Month:Day. Month is steady, day is blinking--> Short push on the screen cycle through the Days* Long Press and it goes back to normal displayIt may be a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's not as hard.  This is a cool watch for collectors and for those that just want something maybe a bit different or a bit more futuristic looking.  It is a unisex one, so it's really for anyone - especially those that are tired of the norm.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM9W1CYAION3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8UAFRI#wasThisHelpful","R2RM9W1CYAION3","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a free watch for review. This is a very nice and interesting watch.  It has that vintage antique look like your grandfather carried, but yet it's a much smaller version for women.  I will mention that it comes with no instructions and may be confusing at first as to how to open.  You push the top button and it releases the clasp and wa la the door pops open. You then just turn the knob to set the time. The display is big enough for most to read and thus far I can say the watch keeps time perfectly.  Overall, a cool vintage looking women's watch that comes with a gift box if you want to gift it.  It is priced so low it's hard to resist for yourself and/or as a gift as it's hard to go wrong with this one.

"Ok, this is an awesome charger and the extra special bonus is it's ability to jump start your car.  Or in this case my motorcycle.  This charger comes in a very nice portable case that can easily slip into my motorcycle's saddle bag.  That way when I need it, I will have it.  Of course, it will also charge just about any other type of battery on your phones, laptops, or tablets as well.  It comes with a digital display for jumping car/motorcycle batteries and it displays the % of power it has and if the battery is ok to charge.  It also has other cables that are to be used for the phone charging, etc.  Oh and did I mention it has a flashlight too. A hi tech flash light that also does strobing and sos distress signal.  For the cost of this unit, I think if nothing else it should be part of everyone's survival kit.  Especially those that live where hurricanes occur.  I have been there and something like this would have been wonderful at that time.  I remember scavenging for batteries and how expensive they were just to purchase when a hurricane was expected.  This little unit is worth it's weight in gold.  It has so many practical uses, I could go on and on.  It claims to hold a charge for 3 months - I haven't had it charged and left it alone long enough to testify to that or not, but hoping that to be true.  Of course you can always hook up the lcd accessory and check the battery level as well as get a quick indication of how charged it is by it's light bar indicator when you power it on.  You can charge the unit up either via it's included wall charger or it's included car charger.  I think this is a must have device and has many charging abilities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REWX47JG66HP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UIEELSU#wasThisHelpful","REWX47JG66HP0","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a really nice set and very essential to any kitchen.  The fat separator has a screen at the top to strain bits and pieces before it goes into the container.  Then after going into the container, you can push the red button on the handle and it will release the natural goody juice from the opening in the bottom of the fat separator.  This is very nice and very functional as opposed to the ones that separate from the top or even worse having to manually use a spoon to dip your juice.  So, this is nice and works well.  Also, worth mentioning the container is HUGE - holds 4 cups - that's big enough to do large cooking projects as well as smaller ones.The baster gadget is nothing to be ignored either.  It is also HUGE - big enough to take on a turkey, etc. easily.  But, it can also be used for smaller things.  It comes with two attachments.  One is a brush which gives you a lot of control while basting.  The other attachment has holes in the end - more like a strainer.  Depending on your needs, both can be very useful attachments and are nice to have as options on the single large basting tube.This is a nice set and should be useful in any kitchen.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BJMPURTFR24A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WG6FQCI#wasThisHelpful","R3BJMPURTFR24A","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a niffy little recorder that I was provided free in exchange for my honest review.  Much more sophisticated than it appears. The first thing I did was put it on it's usb charger and let it charge so I could play with it adequately.  After the charging process, I began the drilling process of putting it thru it's paces.  It takes a while to get the hang of how it actually works.  For example: to raise the volume, you have to hit play/pause, then hit volume (you will see the speaker display), then use the up or down adjustments to actually adjust it..  Also things to consider - it doesn't actually have a stop button.  Therefore, you have to hit the record button again to actually stop recording and save it or hit pause when you are finished listening to something. Other wise regarding playback - it will play continuously. The only options I found were to either only repeat the current file or repeat all files. It does separate your voice recordings on the dvr from the actual music files though - which is a nice feature, especially during playback.  It also has a dvr or music status display on the screen.  But, after mastering the not so obvious controls, it then becomes fairly easy to use. It has a nice little display screen that actually gives you an abundance of information, but will be hard for some to see as it is small.  It displays things like your recording names and or the name of the songs you have on the device as well as the track number and out of how many tracks are actually available in addition to if you are recording or pausing, etc.  It also displays status mode, play or record and surprisingly it shows a pc display when it is connected to a pc as well as other info.  Also, let me add - if you are unable to see the display easily in order to know if you are recording - it has an led recording light setting just for you.  If you are recording the light will display red - if you pause it, it will flash red - if you hit the record the second time to stop and save it, the red light will go off.Let's talk sound quality.  I was surprised that it actually sounds very clear and does a great job of recording quality sound.  It doesn't sound as loud as some devices I've heard, but as it is clear sound and doesn't distort, it's an acceptable compromise.  Plus if you want more volume, you can connect it's included earbuds and the sound is tremendous or you can even connect an external speaker. It doesn't appear to have a  mic port, but honestly this is intended to be a portable device - if you add 100 accessories how portable is it going to be?  So, just to easily throw into your pocket and use for dictation - it seems to work flawlessly.Data conection:  you can use the included usb charger/data cable to connect to a pc and it shows up just like a removable drive.  Which means you can easily copy your recordings off or onto the device as well as music files. The recordings format is wav and the music files that it can play back are formatted in mp3 or wma.  It's a great dictation recording device and the fact that it can also play any music files is a bonus in my opinion.It does have other bells and whistles that I will touch on briefly.  It does have a a-b repeat option - meaning if you set it, it will only repeat files from a-b.  It also has a function that will enable it to record ONLY when it hears sound above 30db-40db (VOR - voice operational function).  If the sound drops below that - it will stop recording.  It has a password option for turning on the device.  Which means you can keep your recordings very confidential.  It also has a monitor switch which is for it to either detect or not detect voices when the earbuds are plugged in - you can set it to on or off.Pros:- Has an 8GB capacity- Comes with a set time file and when data cable is connected to pc - only requires unzipping and then execute the file - works brilliantly and effortlessly (windows 8.1) - now my recordings have the correct date and time on the recordings-small and light weight- fits in pocket easily-fully charges in only 3 -4 hours-has roughly 4hrs of continuous recording ability until the battery needs rechargingCons:- music files can only be uploaded into the devices root as folder support is not available - which also means you can not define playlists as far as I can tell.Overall, this is a very capable device and does exactly what it was intended to do. It is small yet feels like it's made of good quality to last. I like the look and feel and the fact that it fits so easily into my pocket, so that I can take it anywhere on the fly.  Well done -5 stars!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R318VG76BA4JQ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UW0VG2E#wasThisHelpful","R318VG76BA4JQ1","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start with - this is NOT just a crock pot for those looking at it quickly.  This is a serious 4qt MULTI COOKER.  That means it really can do what your stove top can do and it can also do what your oven can do.  Out of the box - this thing is actually quiet beautiful.  The pictures do not do it justice.  It is indeed candy red and has a tempered glass lid with a handle (the picture doesn't show this well) that has a built in strainer/pour opening.  The pot itself has nice looking lifting handles on each side and feel very durable.  The inside is a removable nonstick cooking pot that has a pour spout.  So, let me just say - very easy cleanup.  It also comes with a steam basket that can be reversed to turn it into a roasting rack.  The unit itself has a nice digital control panel that ranges from temperatures of 110 to 450 F.  A stir tower can be purchased as an accessory, but it is not packaged with this unit - it is sold separately.Features:temp control - will do Fahrenheit and Celsius10 different cooking methods including a manual mode and 4 step by step modestimer (can be set up to 12 hours)auto warm mode (switches over to keep warm mode after the food is cooked and will keep food warm for up to 24hrs - some modes do this automatically - other modes this option can be selected manually)remembers the last mode used if you leave it plugged inThis unit sears, sautes, steams, roasts, simmers, slow cooks, fast cooks and more.  Basically the fact that this mulitcooker can go from searing to cooking pasta is amazing.  I could go on and on about all the wonderful things it can cook and the HOW it can cook them.  But, overall to keep it short and simple - if you can think it - you can cook it.  It has enough options that will allow the basic cook to DO and also enough options to allow the GENIUS CHEF to DO.

"I have a tremendous fear of snakes.  However, I do not like to kill things if it can be avoided.  I saw this on vine and jumped at the chance to try it.  I have a wood pile behind my garage and always have a fear of what I will find in there, especially in the warmer months.  I had never heard of anything like the snake shield repellent before so I was excited to try it.  Upon opening it does have a number of smells that hit you all at once (sulfur, cedar oil, cinnamon oil, and clove oil).  But, honestly it's not a bad smell.  I was expecting some type of powder and a more prominent sulfur smell - which isn't very pleasant. So, I was pleasantly surprised at the smell.  It actually looks more like cat litter without the sandy composition.  To use you just sprinkle lightly around the area you want to protect, forming an 8"" band.  It suggest reapplying after a hard rain.  So far, so good!  I will update this review if I see a snake after using this product - but I am hopeful that it works and I will not.

"This is a great case for your phone.  It has a wallet compartment that will hold 3 cards and some money comfortably.  The front edges of the case come up just enough to be above your screen - which from low drops or just laying your phone face down will help protect the screen.  It also has it's own buttons for volume and power. It has notched edging along one of the back sides (very subtle) so that you can use one of your cards to insert into the notching and it becomes a kickstand for the case.  It has two positions, which is just based on flipping the phone on the opposite horizontal edge - but both positions are still horizontal/wide viewing as far as I can tell.  But definitely for horizontal (wide) viewing, the kickstand/card balancing actually does work.  I also have the wallet case for the galaxy s4 and this one does have a couple of improvements. One is the speaker area - it now does not have the upward vent, which I think just made the sound tinny and of course the genius notching on the edge for the kickstand idea.  Actually, the lack of kickstand was one of my big disappointments for the s4 case and the sound vent.  So, very impressive that they fixed both of my previous complaints.  Therefore, I can find NOTHING wrong with this design. It is a nice looking case and is also very functional as a case with a kickstand.

"These are very nice bags made in India.  They are just the right size - not too big and not too small.  They are great from carrying grocery items to carrying beach items to the beach.  They feel very durable and the straps are sewn/attached strongly enough that they will not pull away when a little weight is added to the bags (like books, etc.).  The bags I received are of the nautical them.  One is a cream color, one blue and the other blue stripped.  All feel like canvas material. These bags are 100% cotton and are machine washable in cold water.  They can also be tumble dried on low.

I am actually using the microphone to dictate this review. Therefore, if you do not see any spelling errors or misplaced words, then the microphone is proving to be very clear.

"This is a very nice laptop cooler. It has four blue LED lit fans. It's not very heavy and appears to be well constructed. The cooler connects to your laptop usb port and also has an extra usb port so that you aren't actually losing a port by using it. It also has a control dial to enable controlling the fan speed. After using it for hours, my laptop wasn't even warm. The cooler definitely works and will save the life of your laptop. When components overheat they will break down. So, it's a small investment that will pay off big by saving a payout later. I recommend this item.

"This is the best Blu phone so far that I've had a chance to review.  Let's discuss the 13MP front and back camera.  Wow.  Usually this is where you're ripped off if you get a high end phone with 13MP camera - it's only in the back and the front camera is usually lacking.  Not with this baby - it is called Selfie for a reason. Also make no mistake - both cameras have a flash.  If the camera alone doesn't sell this phone, then consider that they have also improved the sound quality for this model too.  It also has HD recording (1080p). It has 16GB internal storage, but you can add up to a 64GB SD card to get more storage space.  It also has several other bells and whistles - like has energy efficient technology to help save your battery life and has it's own proprietary software to improve your pics.  In addition to the great cool features, it actually does quiet well as a PHONE. Although, I am not sure why these Blu phones are still shipping with Kitkat at this point instead of being updated to Lollipop or if an over the air update is scheduled for this particular phone.When you compare this phone to some of the Samsung Galaxy's - especially the newer ones, then it does fall short on features.  However, if you consider the price range of this device compared to any of the Samsung Galaxy's, then you can't actually beat it.  Just depends on if you have $800 plus to spend on a phone or $250.  Then your choice is clear.  This phone also comes with a case and screen protector as well as earphones and a charger.  Overall, it is an attractive well designed nice feeling phone and unbeatable for it's features weighed against it's cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TTRHWL83APMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRRGTTS#wasThisHelpful","R1TTRHWL83APMO","A2AVMEB8PQOTTE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2AVMEB8PQOTTE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well built case for the Samsung Galaxy S6 and includes a screen protector.  It is extremely light and not bulky in any sense of the word.  However, it feels sturdy and strong on the phone.  It has several finger grippy areas to ensure you have a good grip on your phone while using it as well.  It also has some nonskid bumpers on the back side of the case.  It has easy access buttons that allow you to fully use your phone without any issues - adjusting volume, etc.  It also has a more pronounced or raised cut out on the back to allow usage and protect the phones camera lens when laying the phone down.

"This product works great.  I was interested in trying it because it not only kills weeds it also fertilizes while doing so.  I was also concerned about using it in my yard as we have so many critters running around. The instructions say simply to keep everything off of the area you spray until it dries.  That was a huge relief and made it more doable and us not afraid to use it. It kills several different type of weeds including Dandelions and Clover.  My yard is running over of Clover.

Also one cable is extremely long - so that's nice if you want to walk away from your laptop/device, etc. Just for testing purposes, I cranked my devices to full capacity just to see if they could handle it.

"This is a great little humidifier, diffuser, etc.  You can add just a couple of drops of oil to your water and it easily becomes a diffuser.  I like that it runs via a usb cable.  Which means you can plug it directly into your pc or other usb ported devices or chargers as long as they are not more than 5 volts.  It also has an led light which has various colors to sooth the mood while using it as aromatherapy.  The other really nice thing about this unit is if you forget it and leave it unattended, it has an auto shutoff when it runs out of water.  It will also flash a red light that can be seen via the diffuser opening to let you know it needs to be refilled. Over all it's a nice device and I feel good about recommending it.

"This is an interesting looking bracelet. It is made from a very shiney metal, but feels more durable than it actually looks. it contains a very pretty set made of Cubic Zirconia.  It comes in a very attractive and well packaged ""gift"" box.  The bracelet does not contain a clasp, but instead it has a smaller looped chain at the end and is meant to place the wings thru the chained loop for containment.  I actually did that and decided it might be too losable from only letting it gracefully hang by the loop.  So I looped it thru twice and it feels more secure, but I think if you wear it casually and often until it goes unnoticed, you will probably come home without it as it can still easily work it's way out of the loop and off your wrist.  I would either recommend adding a clasp or only wear it to events where you won't forget you are wearing it.

"The main package which after initially opening seals back like a ziplock bag and includes 4 patches for your forehead and 4 patches for your smile lines.  The forehead and sets of smile lines are packaged in individual smaller packages inside of the main package to assist in keeping the patches sealed in order to maintain their freshness. In order to apply a patch - you only need to remove the backing and place on the area for that patch design.Now for the patches themselves:  they feel cool on the skin and you do indeed feel like you are getting a treatment of some sort.  The great part is you only wear them for 10 minutes, which is doable for almost anyone.  Near the end of the 10 minutes, I could feel a little tingly sensation, but nothing painful or even enough to feel uncomfortable.  After removing the patch, the skin dries fast.  I could tell some subtle difference and didn't have any unrealistic expectations of a full blown miracle as I think some reviewers have had. It does act as a filler as many other products do and in so doing, it does seem to plump up the skin a bit to fill those lines.  Also, it is noticeable just as it advertises.  It also contains a hexapeptide, which is a substrate of Botulinum toxin aka Botox.  The hexapeptide in turn relaxes the muscles which does give a visibly better appearance. Or that would be true if injected into the skin.  I am not sure their is any evidence to prove that applying even Botox topically has any effect on wrinkles.  But, none the less - it also has other ingredients that help with collagen production and hydration, etc.  Overall, this is a reasonable priced product that does give a subtle noticeable difference in only 10 minutes.  Other than injections, this is a reasonable compromise to achieve some minor results.

"Wow! What a power tool. You can feel the weight in your hand. And when you turn it on, you almost expect to be zapped. But seriously, this is a great kit that is professional in both quality and accessories. You get 10 sizes for shaving from 8 all the way down to 1/2 size lengths. You also get a comb and scissors as well as a plastic cover to catch the shavings. It plugs into the wall, no chargeable version here. I have went through so many chargeable shavers and in the long run, there will be at least once where it will not charge fully and dies in the middle of a shave. You don't have to worry about that here. Plug it in and turn it on. Also has a lever to determine the closeness of the shave, or if you want to taper the cut. Comes complete in a plastic carrying case which is not the most durable plastic case, but serves its purpose effectively.

"I am a graphic designer who uses this large format printer for creating film positives for screen printing. It gives a rich black when all the colors are present. The print is sharp and clean. After that, it is downhill. The first problem is that this printer goes through ink like a dehydrated person who just crossed the desert. It seriously lasts less than a month per cartridge. Which tells me either the computer is designed to lie about how much ink is actually left in the cartridge, or it uses an unnecessary amount while ""cleaning and maintaining"". It does allow you to print black only for a period of time but its not a true black. Secondly, because I work in a technical field, there are times when it will distort the printing by the way it pulls the paper through. Sometimes crooked, sometimes slightly off. So, when it works, I think its great. But it really is a high maintenance machine and the inks are expensive to keep pouring $60+ every 2-4 weeks.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7OM4LAPTGLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CIDHSS4#wasThisHelpful","R3J7OM4LAPTGLX","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Go ahead, drop your iPhone. I dare you! Well, with this Gumdrop case, you can be fairly sure, dropping your phone will be less frustrating than having your calls dropped. The case is made of, what seems, like the same material that they make tires from, so it will maintain safety in its descent to the ground. I for one am not crazy about cases that make the phone very big, and the iPhone 6+ is already a big phone, so this makes it about double in thickness and a little wider. But when you pay $700 for a phone, you want to protect that s*** - even at the cost of fashion. Which, this is not the most beautiful case to look at, but its plain to see that it is out to do one job - and it does it! Phone cases have been exorbitant in pricing to begin with ($30 for plastic?), but give that has been the standard, $40 for this case seems a fair price. I would recommend this to anyone who has lady fingers or can't seem to hold onto objects very well and has a tendency to constantly drop things. iPhones are slick in material, especially new and the fact they are fragile, sometimes we treat them like eggs. So, with that in mind, I would highly recommend this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXJHHSDWI6MD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSZM6LK#wasThisHelpful","RXJHHSDWI6MD1","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was excited to use this program to handle my accounting for my small online business. It is completely online, so you only receive a card in a relatively large plastic box. Unnecessary packaging, if you ask me. So upon activating my one year subscription to the Sage One Accounting service, I needed to access my bank accounts. While the first was a Credit Union, it had trouble accessing it. I tried over and over and it just would not access the info, even though Sage recognized my bank. So i decided to try my PayPal account. This would not go through either. Lastly I tried my BOA credit card. This worked. After a few days of giving up, I decided to try it again. Again, I was met with an error. I thought maybe my bank wont allow this program to interact. So I went to the online tech support, and sure enough, as I posed my problem, access to the Credit Union was permitted. Not by any magic of Sage One, but more likely Murphy's Law. Needless to say the tech support guy was friendly and informative. The PayPal account, however, he stated that Sage One does not currently support. I asked the techie why I read an article that Sage One is supporting PayPal? He responded that they allow invoices to be sent out for PayPal payments, but you cannot access your PayPal account directly.The program wil require time and patience to set it all up, but it is easy to navigate and helps budget and show your transactions that can be updated from your bank. You can also set any goals, whether financial, personal or investment-wise. I will continue to use this despite some missing elements as it will be helpful with my primary banking. As I look now, the cost is only $25 which to me is a great deal for this program and worth it at that price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5RKI2ZW5JGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0098WBVKY#wasThisHelpful","R1R5RKI2ZW5JGI","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy Alton Brown's GOOD EATS on so many levels. First, the obvious - the food. He shows you many ways in which to cook a particular food, or within a certain category of food. Second, AB comes from the school of Harold McGee's ""On Food and Cooking"" where the science of food becomes applicable in understanding why foods react the way they do. How certain foods react with different metals and why some foods get along and others do not (depending on what you do to them). So Alton extends this information in a fun, visual way. AB's humor, to me, really makes this show a fun way to learn about cooking. He has silly characters throughout, running gags from show to show, and has a geeky mannerism that makes his character charming. His style of directing is very well controlled and organized. His panning shots along a counter-top, with ingredients lined up, makes for easy ""digestion"" of the recipe. He includes little bits of history throughout the show about food or some interesting incident concerning the food. All in all, AB packs a high amount of information through both visual and his hyper-verbal manner of spewing information. If you enjoy cooking or are thinking about it - look no more! This is your source. I also recommend the three books which covers every episode in an almost as informative way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GYJ8T5ZBQEMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESB2N6G#wasThisHelpful","R1GYJ8T5ZBQEMK","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok, maybe not really really. But at least able to actually pick things off a shelf. This supermarket from the Calico Critters series of animal figures who come to buy their produce, canned goods and dairy products. The selection of food goes far beyond a generic organic supermarket, but offers oil and vinegar, pretzels, condiments, etc. Yes, there are lots of parts! So I would just put out a blanket hazard statement that if your kid is at the biting stage, its probably best to wait or keep away as they are small. In addition, unless they are well organized, its easy to lose these little parts as well. It is made so you can design how the store is set up and what goes on what racks.

"The Calico Critters is a popular children's dollhouse type world that has been around since the 1990's, beginning in Japan, then migrated to the States. The Ice Cream Truck follows the line further outside the house setting and adds an outdoor event to the fantasy world. The Ice Cream Truck is both mobile and highly detailed with many little parts ranging from ice cream scoopers, ice cream cones, ice cream, and even soft serve ice cream! You can design and arrange the internal parts yourself inside the truck. Also a set of decals to set on and around the truck and a menu of deserts. Its a fun item that can also teach organization for kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CPOD0YW89VZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AW94T2#wasThisHelpful","R1CPOD0YW89VZ8","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a book collector myself, I never realized that books had been collectible for a lot longer than I was aware. This book steps into New York during the 20's where book shops were by the dozens. Some specialty shops, rare and antiquated books, and of course modern books. I am not sure ""best sellers"" were of the time, but I am sure there were popular titles. And with this was a well known section of New York in Manhattan known as Book Row. Here is where the setting takes place and where a book dealer would enlist homeless people to steal books for him. These were rare first editions and very valuable. If you like true-crime and mystery/detective novels, with a bit a history thrown in for good measure, this is definitely the book for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2W4KNBXDA2548/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199922667#wasThisHelpful","R2W4KNBXDA2548","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Author Andrew Carroll embarks on a cross-country tour to many houses, farms, buildings, and sites to learn more about an American history that does not get paid much attention to. This includes inventions, people and certain modern practices took place, where an elucidation is evoked and explained which gives context to American as a nation. Some are remarkable, such as laughing gas, while others seem more like footnotes, like Al Capone's brother.Although the author took a tour of America in writing this book, it is not organized according to his travels, but more about time and then categorized according to the discovery or historical importance. While it reads like a travelogue in some respects, because of the way it is organized, I think it was a misstep to categorize the way it is. It might have been more interesting to read it more in the style that he presents it. So instead I was more interested in flipping to points of interest, rather than be interested in his personal discoveries.Unearthing information from the past can be difficult for stuff that has minimal published material, and talking to people who have lived or known from the time are equally becoming scarcer, so it would seem prudent to collect this data while it is available. Carroll is a competent writer who is passionate about his material and also respects his subject matter. I gave the book three stars primarily on the books organization that it does not lead me chapter to chapter to various states, settings, or locations in a logical order, but rather, again, some sort of encyclopedic method that could have been better utilized with America as a backdrop to the landscape of his discovery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32TKWZ4BIT1NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307463974#wasThisHelpful","R32TKWZ4BIT1NH","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am sure there are hard core fans of Miss Fisher and these murder mysteries. Upon this review, I have never heard of it or the books from which this was inspired. While it has a strong fan base, being someone who never heard of it and watched this, I cannot say I walked away a fan or interested in this series any further. The production values are good and the stories were well told, but there was a component that was just not appealing to me. Maybe it was the acting, the actors and actresses, the time period. I cannot place any specific on this, but I was just left sort of ho-hum about the whole thing.So if you like mysteries and whodunits, you might enjoy this.

"I grabbed this less as a haircut, but more for beard maintenance. My previous version, also a Remington, seemed to get easily overwhelmed if you are trimming off too much at once. This one, however, seemed more industrial and ready for what ever you bring to it. I am not a hairstylist, or want to cut my own hair, but having it for as a beard trimmer is very nice. Its clean and straight each time and consistent.The touch controls are nice to the eye, but not very necessary. At times they are even confusing. The charge, once full has a very good life which is nice and can work off the plug if needed.Overall, as a beard trimmer, I would recommend this. There are accessories that aid towards haircutting length and not beard length, so some adjustments need to be made if that is your intentions.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33BKK8T1RBMXL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB5YHFW#wasThisHelpful","R33BKK8T1RBMXL","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What better fun would it be than to make edible alien guts? Well, DOCTOR DREADFUL - ALIEN AUTOPSY is pretty much just that. You get what you see and 4 packets of candy mix. All that is needed is water and 4 double A batteries. Its pretty fun to put together and add the mixture into the alien and wait for the magic to happen. It is suggested that you read the instructions.The Pros of this is the fun factor. Like I said, its fun making the mix and putting it into the alien. I think thats where the pros end.The Cons? The amount of time and effort compared to the results does not pay out well. The gummy eyes and lungs it recommends to remove and put into fridge to expedite the solidification of the candy. So I felt this should have been noted before putting the whole thing together because its not easy taking the parts on an off, not to mention a pain.The gummy eyes and lungs worked well. The intestines were a mediocre success. They looked good, but wet candy does not taste very good. Maybe its supposed to be on the slimy side.Lastly, is the stomach which is a frozen cookie. I am not sure the amount was correctly stated. It says 5 scoops of stomach mix, and 2 scoops of water. The instructions say to pour that into the stomach area, but it just is a crumbly mess and not a liquidy goo like its supposed to be.Finally, none of it tasted very good. It was a cross between Vitamin C and a bland oreo cookie. Otherwise I felt it was all rather tasteless.Overall it was fun to do, but a lot of work putting it together, taking it apart, mixing things up, all for very small portions of candy. Repeated mixing needs to be done which means cleaning the utensils and the trays each time to do it again. And for small portions.Caveat - It might be worth considering, this review is coming from a 40-year old male, so a 10 year old might love this and provide hours of fun and curiosity. As an adult, I found the fun factor high, but the results were improperly mixed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MWP5H2VQ16KD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X93L34#wasThisHelpful","R3MWP5H2VQ16KD","A3PWPNZVMNX3PA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3PWPNZVMNX3PA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Has textured sections, which helps keep it from slipping while in use. I wish they included instructions of some kind to tell you which ones works best for what types of blemishes and stuff, I mean you can try them out on different ones etc, but I honestly thought about getting all my teen nieces and nephews their own sets, but without being able to tell them or them be able to read, specific tips, tricks or instructions it makes it a little hard to gift and they seem more clinical, as if you need to know medical stuff to use them.

"Very lightweight, extremely sharp blades. I like that there is not a handle, because the last one I had, the handle broke completely off, this one grinds by the power of your hand. Which without the crank handle means I have to put less inside, but otherwise works great. The one con to this 5 in 1 spice grinder, is the threads are not clean. Twisting open the sections is smooth and easy, however when you go to twist/screw the sections back together, they do not line up well, and catch, and jump threads. The middle and bottom sections both did this. The top section does not have threads and does not screw on. It simply sits on top. However with that being said, my husband took a piece of scotch bright to debure it and smooth the threads down. Received at a discounted rate for our honest opinion. It's okay, not the best, top of the line, but gets the job done. The threads should have been cleaner, as nobody wants little slivers of metal in their grind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R304PDIYFXQSR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014E3X0AA#wasThisHelpful","R304PDIYFXQSR9","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is extremely small! I never read the dimensions and probably should have prior to purchase. However with that being said, it's much stronger than it looks. The wheels move effortlessly along carpet AND grass with an easy 70+ pounds on this. They even included a strap to help keep your boxes stationary and help eliminate shifting and causing the cart to become unbalanced.Quick movements or turns will cause the cart to tip sideways, but general, normal walking seems to be no issue what so ever. This cart folds down very compactly. The top handle section fold down and back from the center section, while the holding cart section, folds up and towards the middle section.  You can then use the strap to wrap up and around the cart to keep it folded in place. At this point the card is maybe 4-5 inches tall and can be stored just about anywhere.

"Very sharp knife! This knife arrived exactly as pictured, packaged in a nice gift-able box, with plenty padding around, below and above the knife. The blade is extremely sharp, and can easily glide through a piece of paper on arrival.The only issue I have with this knife, could possibly be the way I actually use a knife. I tend to start at the bottom area of the top of the blade and slide downward and toward me, mainly using an up and down chopping motion. The back end of the blade doesn't seem to start cutting like my go to knife does, but once you get towards the top of the blade, it goes through smooth and quickly. I ended up switching the way I was chopping and tried starting at the back of the blade and slice downward, while pulling toward me and that worked much more efficiently.Overall I think its a great knife. Really sharp, but seems you have to use it a certain way to get the proper smoothness to the cut. I received this at a discounted rate for my opinion. I honestly like it and would recommend to those who use knifes a certain way, but for me, I will most likely not use this as often as my go to.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DG2AJ6HT3EZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00985K8X2#wasThisHelpful","R1DG2AJ6HT3EZD","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Once I was able to get the settings set up correctly and change some settings on my audio, I was able to use the microphone with no issues. If you go into the properties you can even select if you want to be able to hear what you are recording or no. I like that because it allows us to use it for simple recordings or for fun like Karaoke just by changing a simple setting.I received this at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased opinion. While I now like it a lot and plan to utilize it much more now that we got it all figured out, it was honestly a pain to configure. I would have loved to see better more detailed instructions, or perhaps some sort of software wizard that helps with the install. I know for a fact if half of my family had gotten this, it would have been returned or sat on a shelf never to be used again. Its to confusing and time consuming.. BUT to be fair, if you can figure it all out and set it up correctly it's actually pretty decent microphone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TY5XMR3Q6VSC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WFWYV1U#wasThisHelpful","R1TY5XMR3Q6VSC","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When given the opportunity to review this wall mounted fish tank at a discounted rate, I jumped at the chance. My daguther recently moved into the dorm and the only pets allowed are fish. She took this fish tank to her dorm and the 4 girls (her roomates) took the bus to the mall and got a new Beta Fish. This is how their process went.""We washed it with hot water then we put Luke warm water in it and put a few drops of this stuff to neutralize the water and then hung it on the wall with the nails provided and left it there overnight then the next morning we transferred the fish in and he really likes it.""They have been admiring their new fish tank for about a week now. NO issues. The tank is beautiful and tranquil looking and the beta looks amazing in the tank!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HQN8W5UDUR2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SBXIN0M#wasThisHelpful","R1HQN8W5UDUR2E","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shirt is super cute. I love the color. I was hoping the color was close to the screen color when I ordered and IT WAS!! I was thrilled. Its a unique color that allows you to wear it casually or on a more sophisticated evening. I also like how long the shirt it. The bottom of the shirt does not look like it has the hug effect when you hold it up, but when you put it on, it instantly hugs the waist area, creating a bunch effect. The bottom can be bunched up how you like or can be pulled down slightly to create a different look.My daughter tried this shirt on with a nice black pencil skirt we also received for review and they looked pretty good together. This shirt was a little wrinkled out of the package, but after washing, the wrinkles disappeared with no issues. We received this at a discounted rate in exchange for our opinion. Over all its a nice versatile shirt. I personally feel they run a little small, but not extreme difference. If this was labeled as juniors clothing instead of women's, I'd say the fit was perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HS1IJJHX9YDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZTYFK34#wasThisHelpful","R1HS1IJJHX9YDD","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ladies flair pencil skirt is a nice black skirt. I like the pleated look of the front design. The design is solid, and does not bunch or move when walking or sitting. It is a stitched in design, not a layered design. I bought this in a Large as the size chart says it's equivalent to a womens 14/16. My daughter wears a womans 11/12 or Juniors 12/13. This in a size large fit her perfectly. I don't think I have ever bought her a large anything. lolThis pencil skirt sits above the waist, but the elastic/stretch fabric material makes it comfortable and easy to move around in, walk in, sit in. The fit is snug, but not so snug that it looks like it's painted on. Its a great body shaper all by itself as well. Very flattering, especially for your butt!

"Well I honestly thought my kids would fight over these. The headband/eye mask is a thin material and the ear buds built in are flat, making it easy to put on your head and align to your ears. The cord is pretty long, but when sleeping it just seems to tangle up. My 18yr daughter tried these first and didn't last more than 20 minutes. She said they were just to uncomfortable. The headband was snug, but the earbuds inside were pressed against her ears to hard and the cord was to much to deal with. The sound quality was fine.My 15yr old son tried them next and decided they were just to hot to keep on his head. And that was that.

"These microfiber cleaning cloths are great. We use nothing but these types of cleaning cloths on all our electronics. From our TV's, laptops, computers, tablets and phones. I also keep them separate from other cleaning cloths. The microfiber helps grab any dust or debris on your electronics, while also leaving a nice streak-free surface.These particular microfiber cloths do not feel exactly like the ones I am used to using. My husband says they feel exactly the same, but to me, these seem to have a silicone/rubber feel added to them. They feel like microfiber with a little added grip or something.

I thought he would enjoy trying these out and having a way to keep track without having to focus on counting.At first he looked at me, like what the heck are these. After I explained what they were, he took them and tried them out for himself. His favorite part was that, even when he tried to mess up the reading, it could tell if he was doing a full push up or not. He said it never read wrong. He said at one point he spent more time trying to get it to read wrong, more than actually using it and it just never did.

"This Paw Patrol backpack is great! The material is a mix of plastic like and canvas. The character design is bright and bold and plastic, making it easily cleaned with a damp cloth.

"This is a great set of of gel ink pens. The colors are bright and bold. The ink flows out instantly and smoothly the FIRST time. I checked every single pen and did not have to scribble or start any of them. The ink came out instantly and glided across the paper with ease.This particular set has 12 Glitter pens, which you can tell these apart easily from the glitter, as the pen shaft is completely see through, which is great to let you know how much ink is left. It also includes 6 Neon and 6 Pastel, now most of these are easy to tell apart, but some of them it's hard to tell if they are considered neon or pastel, and a few of them look exactly the same of paper. Not enough to be an issue, but personally I would have liked if the pens had the color/type on the pen itself.The only pen in this set that I had any kind of issues with was the white pen. It seems to clump up quicker the more you use it than the rest. Not sure if its the ink itself or what the issue is, but I don't use the white often anyways.

"I have been using this case since it arrived. I literally took it out of the package and snapped my phone into the plastic holder. There is nothing covering the front or front edge of the phone.

Real tiny and has a plug to be able to plug the stylis into your phone for easy access.The only negative I have about this case is the color is already peeling off.

"Overall these are nice quality socks. They have a good thickness that feels comfortable and breathable, but not to thick that they feel heavy or sweaty. The height of these no show socks are a little high, for what I would normally consider no show. These completely cover my ankles. No show to me, stop below my ankles.As for the size, I personally think they are big. The shoes size described in the descriptions says 5-9, well that is quite a range in itself. I wear a 7 1/2 -8 and these were to big for me. They fit snug on my feet and against my skin, but there was so much extra toe room, it just felt funny.My daughter who is closer to an 8 than I am, also had lots of toe room left, especially by the baby/pinky toe.

"A few years ago my daughter and I got into the habit of straightening our hair. We both have thick, heavy, long, naturally semi curly hair. Hence why we straighten.. lolAnyways, I have used so many different kinds of clips to hold our hair out of the way, that until now I have only been real successful with those claw clips. Because even a small section of our hair, when twisted, up and tucked away becomes a mini bun. How many clips do you know will hold a mini bun? Not many, so claw clips have to suffice.BUT then I got these.. I did not even know they made clips like this.These work for very thin layers of hair, all the way to a full mountain. I was able to hold ALL of my hair up for a full day, with ONE of these clips. It was a spring cleaning kind of day and I grabbed my hair up, twisted it all up and into a big bun on the back of my head and one handed grabbed one of these clips. I slid the flat bottom side under the bun and the top grabbed as I released the clip. Honestly it help pretty well just like that... BUT... I also dislike little hairs falling down around my head and neck area, especially when cleaning.. (spiders, ninja dance, embarrassment.. etc you get the idea.. ) These clips have an added feature that after you clip it in place, the top has a hinged section that you can press down and it go inward towards your hair center. As it glides back out, it has little catches where the clip will stay in place sort of like a ponytail holder.  I would guess, it was at least 2+inches of mound up hair it was holding.. It lasted ALL DAY. No hair falling out, no adjustments.. I wish they were prettier,  I'd use them for daily wear.. Received for review for honest unbiased opinion. I love them. Would recommend.

"I honestly did not think I would like this brush because of the size. I have very thick heavy sort of long semi curly hair.. I looked at this brush and though yeah right...I first tried it out of the shower with wet hair, as it seems much easier to brush my hair when it's wet. This brush went through with no issues. I was shocked. I could not believe how easily it slide through my hair, and that I could actually feel the bristles touching my scalp. I have to admit, I ended up brushing my hair for a good long time. I liked the scalp massage I was receiving.Later that day, I put the brush through my hair again, after it had been pulled up and down all day, and was completely dry and somewhat in disarray. Again the brush went completely to my scalp, and had no issues brushing through. The few snags I did have, came right out with very little messing around.I am impressed and now kind of feel regret for never trying one of these before. I would definitely recommend.

"I am enjoying this pre-seasoned Cast Iron Skillet. I received a few different pieces of this companies cast iron cookware and so far this is by far my absolute favorite. As I did with the other pieces I received, I washed in hot water, heated and re-oiled each piece of Cast Iron before use.This 10.5in skillet is the perfect size for a side dish for large gatherings or a main meal for my small family of four. I have cooked pancakes (although I do have their Utopia Kitchen Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Round Griddle 10.5 inch also, however this particular morning we had a larger crowd and it was easier to use multiple cookware) deep dish pizza, flat bread pizza, eggs, kielbasa glazed with syrup, which left an ooey gooey, caramelized mess in the pan. I have had NO ISSUES at all with sticking, food breaking or even with cleaning.I have not cooked inside my house one time since I received all these pieces of cast iron cookware. There is nothing nicer than cooking over the fire in the woods while sitting by the creek. This skillet has truly made me a huge Cast Iron fan now.Another bonus is the lid from their Utopia Kitchen Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Dutch Oven with Skillet Cove, 3.5 Quart! also fits perfectly on this skillet.

"I received this at a 50% discount to review. While I love every other piece I have gotten from this company thus far, this one was not as easy to use. I washed the cast iron dutch oven with hot water and then heated and oiled it as I did with all the other pieces prior to use. I also did the same with the lid. However when we went to use the dutch oven, I had horrible issues with sticking, even letting it sit over the hot coals directly to help at least maybe burn it so I could get it cleaned out. Didn't work. I ended up having to flip it over and set the dutch over the flames and hot coals. This finally burned up the residue left behind and I was able to scrape it all out and re wash and reoil it. We tried using it again and had the same issues.I have really high hopes for this cast iron dutch oven and plan to keep working at it to get it working good.The lid is a perfect fit to the dutch oven and the handle has a nice enough sized opening to allow me to grab it easily with pot holders. This unit is HEAVY.One thing I was thrilled about, is the lid also fits their Utopia Kitchen Pre-Seasoned Cast-Iron Skillet, 10.25 inch, which I also received at a 50% discount.

Over the last few years we have been setting up a camp site for summer and we have a lean too and cooking station. I have been wanting to purchase some cast iron for outdoor cooking for awhile. When given the chance to purchase these at a 50% discount, I jumped at the chance.This pancake skillet worked with no issues what so ever. I washed with hot water and then heated and re-oiled the cast iron skillet before first use to help keep the non stick. We cooked pancakes over the fire and had no issues with sticking what so ever. My daughter even added pieces of chocolate bar to her pancake and still, even after melting all over the place, it just slid right off the cast iron skillet just as well as the ones without any additions.Great cast iron pancake skillet! Would recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38R6PGIXFLEH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6L6Z4A#wasThisHelpful","R38R6PGIXFLEH9","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This milk frother is made of stainless steel, which makes it super easy to spot clean, as you can not immerse the battery section in water. The battery cover pushes off super easy and FAST. When we first took the battery cover off it flew across the room, I thought it was just a fluke, but everyone who first opens it does it the same way and the kids ended up making a game out of it. Thankfully the cover is still intact and no issues.The battery compartment has an image in the inner compartment to show the direction of the AA batteries (NOT INCLUDED) Required to operate the frother. To turn the frother on, you simply press/spin? the wheel on the side of the battery compartment forward/up towards the whisk end. The whisk then stars to spin/vibrate with a force.We used this to froth milk, which took very little effort, the hardest part was figuring out how far to immerse the whisk head to create the foam you desire. Putting the whisk into the milk to far created more of a whipping effect, than a frothing effect, immerse even more and it becomes more of a funnel. I did this to mix up a little vanilla ice cream and milk and it created a nice thick shake, with very quick easy rinse clean up.I received this for my honest review, I honestly like it, will most likely use it more for a quick mixer for hot cocoa or shakes as we don't froth our milk often. Works great, seems sturdy so far. Ours has gotten a lot of use and so far still working same as day one. Would recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJG8CP4YEIKSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XH6D2YK#wasThisHelpful","RJG8CP4YEIKSS","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like this bird feeder and was really looking forward to hanging it in my yard. The day it arrived I immediately opened it up to check it all out. It arrived un-assembled. In order to add seed to the mesh holder, you simply twist it from the top to connect or release it. We started to pour our seed into the metal mesh section only to have almost all of the seed fall right out.We realized that a mixed blend seed will not work with this feeder. We ended up having to use black sunflower seed to be able to keep the seed inside the mesh. This is not necessarily a problem, but black sunflower seed is much more expensive to keep on hand than mixed seed. I honestly don't see me keeping a bag on hand just for one feeder.The feeder itself is light weight, but sturdy. All metal. The green top is bright and has no sign of any wear or tear or paint peeling. I also like how the top of the feeder overhangs the metal mesh holder enough to help keep the birds out of the weather when feeding. I think that is a great feature. Received for review purpose. I honestly love the style and design, but I would prefer a smaller mesh for the seeds. Or maybe an option when ordering. Otherwise this mushroom bird feeder is great and I would recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28SVN4QD7QMI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YO14FRA#wasThisHelpful","R28SVN4QD7QMI7","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like these non-lego brand block people. There were a couple doubles in this pack of 20, which arrived in two separate 10 pieces sets.Each little person also came in it's own little package, completely disassembled.Each figure had:HatHeadbody2 x arms2 x handswaist2 x legsThe colors on the figures are great. The details and designs on the chest pieces are consistent and we didn't find any that had paint missing. These are not cheaply made and thrown together. A pirate looks like a pirate, the construction worker looks like a construction worker, I was a little bummed that we didn't receive a Santa looking figure, as they have pictured, but I do realize it never said a specific set of people.All pieces fit tight together. There were a few pieces that my nephew could not get pushed together by himself, however most of the people he was able to assemble without help (when he wanted too lol)The only 2 negatives I can say about this set of 20 block figures is:1. a couple multiples. Mostly different, but I do believe we had 3 sets of doubles.2. A couple of the hand pieces do not fit as tight as the rest of the hands. We were able to switch and then they were tighter, but a couple of them, it didn't matter what person we tried the hand in, it would still fall out when you tip the figure upside down or sideways, they were just a little to small and lose. (I think there were 2 that did this)Overall I think this is a great set. Received for purchase code to leave an honest review. I honestly like this set. Would recommend and will probably purchase additional sets for my other nephews now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUTOWRS0SZIVM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011BDQVJI#wasThisHelpful","RUTOWRS0SZIVM","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as I wanted to love these rapid fill water balloon system, I just can't get past the amount of wasted water. The screw top attachment threads easily onto the end of the hose with no issues. Being plastic I paid close attention to this detail and the threads were great.The part that gets a little frustrating is when you turn the water one to fill the balloons, it is quite hard to get a good feel of how fast or slow you should let the water flow. Going to slow, not only takes forever to fill the balloons and after years of filling 100's at a time for birthday parties and other get together this was somewhat annoying feeling like I could do faster by hand. BUT... If you turn it up to far, some balloons fill really fast and pop right off while the others still go slow. So while the others are still filling their is water coming out the tubes where the first fast fills fell off.Trying to find a happy medium is difficult and there is a lot of wasted water. We have a spring fed well, so this actually does not effect us as much as it might someone else, but I still don't like wasting that much, especially when you plan on filling multiple sets at a time. I guess I was looking for more consistency. Where all the balloons fill and drop off within a few seconds of each other, not almost minutes from the first to the last.The unit as a whole seems to be pretty sturdy and we had no issues with the balloons falling off without being filled first. Even with everyone checking them out, being the great  newest thing, passing around did not remove any balloons. They stayed securely attached.Received at a discounted rate for my honest opinion. I honestly thought they were neat and great idea, but after using them, I will most likely go back to hand tying to eliminate the water waste and like I said after years and years of doing it this way, were pretty fast anyways.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N5RDN5EGIXEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YA3LQLU#wasThisHelpful","R2N5RDN5EGIXEJ","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Snowflake baking cutters are great. I wasn't sure how well these were going to work with all the detailed edges and points of these snowflakes. I realize these are for sugar-crafts such as fondants and the like, but I wanted to use them to make snowflake cookies for the top of ""Frozen"" themed cupcakes. I was a little leery when I first started and I put a mix of flour and powdered sugar in a pile and I would dip the cutters in the mix before cutting the cookie dough.

"This collapsible lantern is probably one of my favorite camping gadgets for the kiddos. While the light is super bright and very conveient, the unit itself is very light weight and easy to use.I like how it slides down inside itself for easy storage. The handles also fold down out of the way. When you want to use the lantern, you simply pull the handles up, and then proceed to pull the unit from the top of the lantern, up to the desired illumination you want. If you just want a dim light to see around you, pull it up about half inch, and it will stay. If you want more light or full light, you simply pull the lantern up further. To shut it off, you simply slide it closed, and fold the handles down out of the way..My nephew was extremely excited about this lantern and I did not own it very long before he decided he needed it for his camp out. He is 8 years old and having his very own lantern just made his day.

"The color of the storage wardrobe is pretty true to what they have displayed. I was a little concerned about this and happy that it was as close as it was. The actual frame of the unit is made up of a gazillion plastic pieces. While this partly annoys me, as I have had many of these different types of organizing closets that don't require half as many parts, I also like that there are so many because it makes it so much easier to personalize for our needs.I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion and started out taking photos of the process, but after a while it became to much of a hassle to keep up with pictures with so many pieces involved. There are a ton of connector pieces to help make sections as tall, short, wise or slim as you want. However the main frame stays the same. You just adjust the middles sections as you wish.The cover is thicker than I thought it would be and I like that it is a clothe type material. Makes it easy to spot wash, or even take off the frame completely and throw in the washing machine. The cover has a double zipper that allows you to open one section and reach in grab, or you can open both zippers and have a wide access opening. This unit stands off the ground, keeping your stuff off the floor or even allowing a little extra storage area underneath.Since I purchased this with intentions of my daughter taking it off to college with her and putting it in her dorm, we then had to disassemble the unit and hope we could get it back in the box. While it ended up being a lot easier to take apart than it was to put together, be prepared for it to start falling apart as you take pieces out of connection. It seems to lose a lot of the stability any time you try to adjust it. However, once we realized that, we became more cautious of how we were doing it and it became a lot easier.I am personally happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone needing alittle extra storage or temporary storage.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R461D6GFSFXC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XO3DRE6#wasThisHelpful","R461D6GFSFXC8","A12TSALWP062D9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12TSALWP062D9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This stool is very portable and easy to store when folded up. To set up, you unfold the sides out until they click and lock into place.

"This is by far one of the nicest Bluetooth speakers I have used thus far. Aside from the eye appealing bright colors, I purchased the green one for my daughter. I liked that it included a carabiner clip to make it easy for walks, hikes and activities..The silicone cover makes a great security feature as well as making it look nice. The silicone cover is probably close to 1/16th inch thickness and seems like a good shock absorption if the wireless speaker gets dropped or falls. This is definitely a nice added feature.The package included:1. Bluetooth / NFC Wireless Speaker Unit w/ Silicone cover and Carabiner clip2. USB Cable3. 1/8 inch Audio Cable4. Detailed instruction manual.This particular Bluetooth speaker can be used with NFC technology or via Bluetooth. I had never even heard of NFC technology. And if any of my other speakers had it, it wasn't obvious. The manual gives you step by step instructions on how to connect with the NFC as well as how to connect via Bluetooth.Charging time is roughly 3 hours to full charge. When we charged ours, it was only about 2 hours. I am not sure if it was because it already had a partial charge or if it was from using a fast port charging station.The sound quality is amazing! With or without the silicone cover. I honestly thought the cover would distort the sound at least a little. It did not at all so far. Actually it barely even distorts the volume let alone the clarity. I received this for review and I honestly love it. I like it better than my $400 wireless speaker.

I've been mountain biking for 25 years, so I'm well versed in these pumps.There are basically two types of these things: ones without a little hose that pops out and ones with the hose.  The hose makes pumping these WAY easier, because it separates the pump (which you move around as you pump it) from the valve, but the hose adds weight and saves a lot of wear on the valve and the better the hose, the heavier it is.  The hose in any pump also is likely to be the first thing to fail.I had a plastic pump with no hose and the thing weighed only 3 ounces, this one weighs 5.5 without the bracket, and 5.4 if you remove the two adapters for filling balls and other inflatables that you probably will never use.  Most of the extra weight comes from what appears to be a very high quality (and therefor heavy) hose.I was really prepared not to like this one because of the extra weight, but the two extra ounces are probably worth it, especially if you are going to make this your only pump.  The reason is it's a lot of extra weight to carry around if you are only going to use it in an emergency.  With tire liners, I only seem to get a flat every two or three years, and about half of those are slow leaks that can be fixed at home using the floor pump.  So carrying around the extra two ounces for something I'll only use once every five years is probably overkill.  It's also twice the price of the plastic pumps and the plastic one I had lasted 15 years.  The likelihood any company will be around in 15 years to honor a warranty is low, and you could just buy a second half priced one and that gets you 30 years.I deflated a presta valve tire and it reinflated it relatively quickly, though the amount of air per pump is lower than others that are engineered to maximize that issue.  Note that it takes a couple of pumps to put enough pressure in the thing to push against the presta valve to open it, so you have to pump a few times at a fairly rapid clip or it won't add any air at all.  The design will also limit the amount of air you can pump into a presta valve tube.  70-80psi is probably about the best you are going to do, though I didn't test it.So this was a tough call on how to rate it.  Where it excels is a situation where you are going to beat the heck out of the pump, like keeping it in a backpack because the all plastic ones don't hold up too well in that situation.  So for a commuter like me, it works and I'm keeping it.  It's also a good choice if you aren't going to have a floor pump because of the hose.  However, if you want something to take on the trail that you'll mount to your bike and then remove, and you have a regular pump like a floor pump, you can save a few ounces and get a plastic one that maximizes the amount of air per pump.So I started with 5 stars for being well built.  I took off one star for the small amount of air per pump and extra weight.  I took off one star for the price being twice as high as others, and rate this one 3 stars.  Based on the price, I think I wished I had spent more time and bought something else that was lighter and cheaper, even if I had to replace it in 15 years on my own.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R162325RTUAU9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XUNEGTK#wasThisHelpful","R162325RTUAU9","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have several of these, all operating trouble free.  However:1.  Cisco stopped selling these in May of 2012.  Search ""spa2102 discontinued"".  Although some companies bought tons and never used them, most of what you can get by now are used.  I've bought used ones without any problems.  I typically pay, with shipping, around $35.2.  The user interface is extremely technical.  These are designed for someone who knows what they are doing.  The average non technical person is going to be flummoxed.  Definitely not plug and play.  Those having intermittent problems and the like probably didn't configure them properly.3.  The one I bought in 2010 is still working just fine.  I have two others bought two years ago, used, also working fine.  But these are now 5-8 years old, and you shouldn't expect an infinite life out of them.4.  These have been replaced with a newer model SPA122 that's around the same price of these.  As far as I know, they are basically identical: same complex user interface.

"This is just way more than you need to spend on tire levers and it solves a problem no one has.  The things are freaking enormous.  They are the size of a butter knife, which means you won't be taking them anywhere.  They certainly reduce the effort required in using them, but my standard 3"" tools never gave me any problem there, so they solve a problem no one has.They also have a sort of sandpaper type finish.  So they are, in my opinion, the wrong tool for the job because you can't slide them without damaging the rim.  So, great they solve a problem that doesn't exist and they prevent you from using them properly or taking them with you.  And for this, you get to spend three times as much money.So what should you get?  The Pedros levers come highly rated.  Same for the Park Tools levers.  The problem is that they are plastic and my experience is that old plastic levers break.  If you use tire liners, you rarely get a flat, so you want something you can keep in a drawer and use every 5 years.  After about 15 years, plastic levers get old and brittle and break.What would I recommend.  Get the Ice Toolz steel levers.  First of all, there are three of them and I always need all three.  Second, they are metal and will never break, though all metal levers run the risk of damaging rims.  However, those are smooth, not scratchy like these, so you can at least use them for their intended purpose.These would be great if you are elderly or female or don't have much hand strength and need the extra leverage an enormous tire lever like this provides.  They can also be used to demounting much thicker tires, like a small trailer tire or a hand truck pneumatic tire.  Otherwise, buy a set of three plastic ones from a reputable source to take with you on the trail and a set of three metal ones to keep at home to use as a backup when the plastic ones get old and break.  And you'll still have money left over to replace the plastic ones when they finally break (note the pedros have a lifetime warranty).  These are just way more money for too little benefit.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V0J6GCCXSP39/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000R9GG1G#wasThisHelpful","R3V0J6GCCXSP39","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's the same length but much lighter and narrower.  In my case, one end slid into some slots, while the other end was held in place by a nut and a screw.  I unscrewed the one screw and this one, being the same length, slid right into place.HOWEVER, the wires are not long enough to reach the tombstone sockets.  So the next step is to cut the color coded wires and reinstall color for color.  There are two of each color: it doesn't matter which one of the same color is which, connect one yellow to a yellow wire and then connect the other yellow to the other yellow wire.  Only one to one, don't connect both yellow wires coming out of this thing together.  Now repeat for red and then for blue.  Code would require these connections to be made using wire nuts.  You'll need 8 18 ga. wire nuts.Why 8 when there are only three pairs of output wires and you can reuse the wire nuts for the input wires?  Because the input wires are ridiculously short, so you may need to extend them.  Where are you going to get extension wire?  Cut the black and white wires from the old one and use it as extension wire.  One could also twist the wires together and use electrical tape, but that wouldn't be to code.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23WZ8Q7I83SIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003GW3DNU#wasThisHelpful","R23WZ8Q7I83SIJ","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our local bike station, where people drop off bikes for the day and take the train, has this bike pump for people to use for free.  It's probably used at least 20 times per day, 200 days per year or 4000 uses a year.  The pump seems to last them 2-3 years, or about 10,000 pumps before they have to replace it.Assuming I use this twice a month, that's 24 pumps per year.

"This is a comparison of the Amazon Basics Large Portable Speaker with the SHARKK® Boombox Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with 18+ Hour Battery Life and Award Winning Top Rated High-Def Sound Quality 10W Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for iPhone iPad Samsung Computers both about the same price.Weight: The sameSize: Sharkk is about 70% of the size of the Amazon Basics product, which is much larger.User Interface: Amazon retains your last setting, Shark doesn't.  Kind of a minor annoyance.Power: Amazon uses it's own wall wart and cable.  Shark uses a Micro USB which is more widely available in various lengths.Sound: The Sharkk uses smaller speaker but has a well-designed passive radiator system that gives it a bit more bass.  It also has a 6 watt amplifier instead of the 5 watt amplifier of the Amazon product.  The larger speakers of the Amazon product provide clearer sound, but it struggles with the low notes that the Sharkk hits easily.  As a result, you can't really turn up the volume to make the amazon product louder, because it is limited by the bass response: it starts distorting before you can really blast it.  As a result, the Amazon product is no louder than the Sharkk.  The bass response difference is slight, but definitely noticeable.  I'd give the nod to the Sharkk because of the better bass response.  If the Amazon product had a passive radiator like the Sharkk, it would win hands down, but it doesn't.Quality: The Sharkk is a disaster.  I've owned three of them and they have all failed for the same reason: the auxiliary input jack has nothing holding it but the solder to the circuit board.  When you use it as you expect, portably, plugging the music source in and unplugging it, the jack will separate from the circuit board, making the product unuseable.  The most recent one failed in two weeks of owning it, and I'm extra careful with them because I know of the problem.  You can use bluetooth and skip the wiring problem as long as your devices have bluetooth, but the sound isn't that great.  I haven't owned the Amazon product long enough to determine if this is an issue, but if it is, I'll update my review if it is.Conclusion: The Sharkk is a better product because of it's superior sound and size, but quality problems of the Sharkk make the Amazon product the better choice.  The sound quality of the Amazon product is good, not great like the Sharkk.  If you want a small speaker that sits in a dorm room and never moves, you'll be happier with the Sharkk.  If you want something you can take with you, the Amazon product is possibly the better choice.  In either case, unplug the audio cable before transporting them.I paid for both products.  I did not receive anything for the review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKR7MG4LFH9CX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJEYM5O#wasThisHelpful","RKR7MG4LFH9CX","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For anyone wondering what this stuff is, it's just Alberger Process salt with a little bit of artificial butter flavoring and some dye mixed in.  Alberger Process results in salt that is flaky like snowflakes rather than grainy like grains of sand, so it sticks to the popcorn better than other types of salt and distributes more readily in oil.  Salt doesn't dissolve in oil, but flaky salt will suspend while grainy salt will sink to the bottom.The butter flavor adds taste without the hit in calories of real butter.  Butter flavor is *usually* just butter and maltodextrin (an artificial sugar used to extend the butter: i.e. to give it more volume by coating a lower calorie product, maltodextrin, with butter flavor, to provide nearly the same taste with lower calories overall).  Maltodextrin has some health effects like weight gain, but there wouldn't be that much of it in this product to cause much of a concern.  Note that I don't know for certain that this product contains maltodextrin, it may be flavored with nothing other than butter, with the salt itself used as the extender.If you want an alternative that doesn't have the artificial flavor and dye, search Amazon for ""Fine Salt"" and a bunch of them will pop  up, including Diamond Crystal Popcorn and Nut Salt.  That product has some Tricalcium Phosphate as an anti caking agent, but your teeth and bones are made if it, and there is some in cow's milk, so it doesn't seem harmful.

"This popcorn is cheap for a reason.  It's about the worst popcorn you can buy right now.  This stuff was the first branded popcorn, so people just keep buying it because it's all they know.  They buy it because their parents did.However, since then, others have come along with better popcorn.  Oville Reddinbacher started it when he developed a hybrid corn that produced better popcorn.  Since then, Snappy and Pop Secret have all developed a superior product.However, since there is only a limited amount of those other products, and a far higher demand, they are 3 times as expensive.Jolly time is just generic popcorn with someone's name on it.  It doesn't pop very forcefully, which means you'll get smaller popped kernels that don't explode with as much force, and therefore stick to the bottom of the pan and are more likely to burn.  When I pop this stuff, I end up with 1/3 smaller popped corn even though I started with the same amount of unpopped corn.If you're wondering why your popcorn tastes slightly burnt and isn't as big as movie theater popcorn, try any other brand.

"I have gotten 3 of these, and 3 out of 3 have failed.  I bought the first version when there were literally 2 product reviews, a few years ago.  Loved the product.  You really need to use a jack to get the most out of it, and that's how I've been using it.However, the first one failed.  There is a HUGE design flaw for a portable speaker that you'll keep connecting and disconnecting every time you use it: the jack is not mounted to anything, the solder is the only thing holding it on so ultimately, the solder joint fails and the whole thing won't work.  I kept resoldering it and kept it going.  I really like it a lot so I keep repairing it.I came on here and provided a review stating all of this, and the company was nice enough to send me another one, a newer version.  The newer version is more powerful and even better than the original version.  Just the perfect speaker when I thought you really couldn't get any better.  But that one also failed, almost immediately, for the very same reason.  So I had two, one was kept in reserve for when the other one failed, and then the failed one would get repaired, and back and forth.  Again I resoldered the newer one and the older one and kept it going, but the jack finally ripped the leads off the circuit board so it cannot be resoldered.Down to one, continuously repairing it until an accident left it inoperable.  Not the product's fault.So I ordered a *third* one, and within two weeks: same problem.  The jack is coming off.This is just the most fantastic speaker ever, I just can't say enough good things about the sound quality, but not if it breaks every few weeks.  The design flaw is something that I finally just gave up on, and I'm looking at a different model.So now I have three of these, and all of them have failed repeatedly due to the same problem.

"I think a lot of supplements are voodoo.  Most people don't really need them.  However, I was having trouble in terms of mental clarity and some mild depression after the loss of my 21 year old cat.  I saw this product (though not from this seller) being promoted in a book on aging and decided to try it.  I started with just one dose per day and when I didn't get any side effects, increased it to two doses per day.It took two days before I felt any difference at all, and the difference is small, but definitely noticeable.  Mental clarity went up for sure and my mood lightened a little.  Now I'm only spending 5 cents or so per dose, so it's not like I expected miracles, but it did way better than I expected.  I normally have fairly stressful dreams and woke up on my 4th day after starting this stuff and instantly realized I had my first really *good* dream in years.  I mean years.

"I bought one pair and used them to replace the most worn pads, the front pads.  They initially seemed mch better, but not so much better that I would buy another pair until the back pads wore out.Who knew that they get a lot better after they've been broken in?  Three weeks after I installed them, a car came charging out of a driveway, right into my path.  Both brakes were applied to maximum force.  The rear brakes stopped about as well as you would expect: stopping distance would have been about 10 feet.  The Kool Stops locked the front wheels instantly: I was lucky I didn't fly over the top, because the rear wheels came off the ground.  The front wheel simply stopped instantly.I came back here to buy another pair for the back brakes!  Best brakes I've ever experienced.

"This is not a light you can see by, it's purpose is to be seen.  The corner LEDs give nearly 180 degree visibility and it is VERY bright for this purpose.  A big benefit is its light weight.  I have it hooked to my helmet, so weight is important.  The strap wraps around just about anything, so you can use it wherever you want.The downside is that none of the USB rechargeable lights made by any manufacturer is actually waterproof.  To protect mine, I slip a sandwich baggie over it and bunch it up where the light meets the strap.  Then I double up a rubber band to hold the baggie in place.  It keeps it dry enough to keep working, but it's of course a bit of a pain to have to remember to do it and to actually do it every time it rains.

"This is a very sturdy hanging rack.  It does require assembly, but assembly takes about ten seconds, you just twist the main bar until it snaps into place, there's no tools and anyone can do it.  You can't see it but the hangar in the back is square, it just hangs over any standard door.  There's no screws to hold it in place.Some people have mentioned you can use both the front bar and the sides, but that's only the case if you are using men's pants hangars.  A standard hangar will let you use the front bar OR the sides, but not both.  If you use the sides, the hangars hang halfway out from each side and if you use the front bar, they hang halfway out from that.I've had 6 pair of wet jeans on the thing and it just laughs at the weight.  My doors are hollow, but it's not a problem.12 shirts hang from the front OR the sides.  I tend to use the sides because using the front bar means everything sticks way out from the door.  The wavy sides keep everything spaced apart, which is ideal for use as a drying rack.  I have it centered on the door and the hangars come just about an inch past each side of the door, not really visible.Now for the downsides.1.  The thing is metal and it's going to scratch the door when you put it on or take it off.  Do what I did, take some sticky back felt and put it on the front and back of the square hangar.  Don't put it on the underside of the top because of #2, below.2.  The metal hangar is thick.  It's about 3/16"" thick.  That makes it sturdy, but I didn't have a single door that closed on it.  That means it won't work for most bathroom doors, which need to close.  I put it on a closet door that I never close.This thing is really excellent quality, but just don't expect to close the door its on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IRCZLOZKJ7EG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008771EU8#wasThisHelpful","R3IRCZLOZKJ7EG","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried the best Sony and it was terrible.  Sony has sacrificed sound quality as much as possible in order to squeeze every drop out of the battery, and the results are terrible.This radio, on the other hand is a joy to listen to.  Sound quality is as good as you can get from FM.Just a helpful hint for those people complaining about the included earbuds, a serious listener throws included earbuds in the trash, without even trying them.  Apple does the same thing: they just include cheap terrible ones so you can listen to it right away if you don't have anything else lying around but no one expects them to sound anything but terrible or last more than a week.  Throw them away and get something decent.The sound quality of a radio is really a function of how much power it uses.  These use two AA batteries, a rarity.  That means it has the power to pack a punch.  Stay away from single battery units (i.e. Sony) - they have no punch and listening to music on them is boring (if you are looking for talk radio or ball games, any radio will do).  This radio is the real deal if you like music sound quality.  FM radio cannot deliver high quality, but this is as good as it gets.  I'm so happy that at least one company still makes something that's actually nice to listen to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPWV8TMW37WPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006HOKR#wasThisHelpful","RPWV8TMW37WPR","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was one of the three items I've bought on Amazon that I ended up returning in over 12 years.  The reviews make it sound better than it is.Like many of you, I had an old style Sony FM radio that I purchased many years ago that needed to be replaced.  In my case, the volume control knob had fallen off, but at a level that worked for at least one setting, so I thought it might be time to replace it.  I was hoping that in ten years, the reception might have improved.I looked at some of the reviews and  What Sony appears to have done is to have decided that battery life matters more than sound quality, and so many of their newer radios will last forever on one AAA battery, but to do that they engineered the sound to make the battery last as long as possible.  The way they did it was to reduce the dynamic range, so that the loudest sounds are not much different from the least loud sounds.  The result is music that sounds dull and lifeless.  The notes are all there, but the punch is completely, and I mean completely, gone.In my case, I still had the old radio, so I was able to compare them.  The reception on this unit is improved, but slightly and is nothing to write home about.  You'll barely notice the difference.  But the music is really, really bland.So I think the best advice is to steer clear of the ""45 hours on one AAA"" battery models and go for the double AAA or AA models.  My old one only lasts about 8 hours on two AAAs, but the sound quality makes it totally worth the battery life reduction.  I use rechargeables, so it doesn't really cost em any more.I haven't yet found one I'm willing to buy, but when I do, I'll be back to let you know how it worked out.Edit: Found the ideal radio.  The Sangean DT-200X FM-Stereo AM/FM Digital Tuning Personal Receiver.  Gets fantastic reception, better than this Sony and better than anything I've ever had, long battery life from 2 AA batteries and sounds terrific, better than the old school radios I thought I'd never be able to replace.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S9XV4542HXOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000MSYFW4#wasThisHelpful","R3S9XV4542HXOF","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Your USB device that you want to plug into this has a male plug.  That plug draws power to allow your USB device to work.This adapter will not supply any power because the round jack that this device plugs into doesn't supply any power either.  The USB connection will be made, but your USB device will not be powered on, and so it will not work.What device could this adapter work for?  Something completely passive.  That means a plain microphone (no noise cancelling mics or electret) and plain headphones (again, no noise canceling).  Those don't use any power - they just need the signal this device, in theory, provides.  There will be no power supplied at the USB plug, so any USB device that does anything that requires power (which is basically everything else I can think of) will never power on.It would be like buying an adapter that has an electric plug on one end and a hose adapter on the other end: plug your vacuum cleaner into your faucet!

"These products consist of two clamps, one for the phone and one for the bike, and an adjustable knuckle connecting the two clamps that you adjust and tighten in place.  There is a limited range of tubes you can clamp around, this one is really optimized for bike handlebars.  You can't really clamp it to many other parts of the bike.  That wouldn't be a problem, but the knuckle is not all that adjustable, so you can sometimes get stuck if you want to use this as a mount for a bike cam.  It's passable, but you may find yourself making compromises.  The clamp for the phone is surprisingly strong, but I wouldn't trust it under all circumstances.  That problem is easily solved with a rubber band around the camera and the back plate of this device.All in all, I'm happy with what I got for the price.

The things I don't like about that other one (not this one) is it's not very adjustable, doesn't clamp onto a large range of tubes, and the clamp for the phone is good but not great.

The clamp for the camera is like a strong chip clip and I'm not remotely worried about the phone falling out.

"These put out what appears to be about 15 watts equivalent of light and use 2 watts of electricity according to my Kil-O-Watt.  That may be rounded from 1.5, but assuming it's really 2, that means you can get 500 hours out of each one for a killowatt of electricity, which generally costs about 10-13 cents.  At an average of 12 hours per day, it means each one will cost you about eight to ten cents per month to operate.  Being solid state, you can expect them to last 5-10 years.  So they cost about $2 per year in lamp costs plus electricity, so I thought it was a worthy purchase.I use these in the hallways of a small office building and if I can shut my main lights off an hour earlier than I would otherwise, but still allow the tenants to leave safely, I save about 9 kilowatts per month, about $11 per year, so net, I save about $7 per year with two of these lights.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ6VA128FVPS8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030CDEEY#wasThisHelpful","RZ6VA128FVPS8","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My S3 is a great phone, but I chew through the battery in about 8 hours, requiring a mid day recharge.  Enter this bad boy, I can run for over three days without charging.

Not a problem.It's basically a replacement S3 battery attached to another battery that takes up the lower 2/3 of your phone.  To hold the behemoth in place, they supply a cover that you use instead of your S3 cover, which is surprisingly easy to remove.  The cover fits over the phone and holds the battery in place, but allows full use of the camera without interference.

When you don't need it, pull it out after you finished charging it and use your regular battery.  When I put it back in after a month of non use, this guy is still 99% charged.It also makes a great spare, for times you forget to charge your battery, so I keep this one charged before I put it away.This is quite possibly the best product I've ever got.

Your monitor is the only way to adjust.  Probably not recommended for high end graphics work unless there is some other program that will work with this card to adjust it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29S25Q0C56HQ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00612ZPQA#wasThisHelpful","R29S25Q0C56HQ5","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is the printer only.  To print stamps on it, you have to use the Dymo Stamps program.  To use that program, they require you to use labels that they sell for about 9 cents per stamp each.  Generic labels won't work because you need an activation code on the labels.  The generic labels themselves retail for a penny, so you are basically paying them 8 cents per stamp.We use about 12 stamps per week, so the fee is going to be about $4 per month.  If that's worth it, this is the product for you.  If you send more than 25 pieces of mail, you can buy an account for $9.95 per month that lets you use the generic stamps.You can buy stamps online at usps.gov and they will deliver them to your door for free.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJD8ZXXRVCK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0027J9KH6#wasThisHelpful","R2NJD8ZXXRVCK6","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've gotten these from the dentist for $300 each.  This product is every bit as good as those.Just follow the directions and it fits as well as the ones from my dentist.  Do you see all the comments from people saying it isn't as good?  Those are dentists.  Ignore them.Here's what I did.First, practice putting it in your mouth on your upper teeth, push your tongue on it to push it up on your teeth and suck, hard, to get the air out of it and mold it to your teeth.  Got it?  Now take it out and set it aside.I have a small mouth, so I trimmed the back on the line they provide for that purpose.  It made it exactly the same size as the one I got from the dentist.  When you trim it, round the corners.  That means start parallel to the long sides and turn the scissors to make a little quarter circle and then cut the rest of the way.  When you reach the other side, round that too.  Do both ends.Then I put about 2/3 of a cup of water in a coffee mug.  I microwaved it for about 1:45 until it was at a full boil.  Note, I did NOT put the product in the cup while I was microwaving it.  Do you see all the people who said the thing turned into a melted clump?  That's what they did, they microwaved the product with the water.  Don't do that.  Leave the product OUT and just microwave the water.Next, using the handy little tab attached to the front, dunk the product into the water and count to ten.Shake the water off -  the product won't even be remotely hot, so don't worry, put it into your mouth on the upper teeth and push it with your tongue and suck, just like you did for practice.  Count to twenty.Pull it out, run it under cold water for five seconds and you're done.  You just saved yourself a trip to the dentist and $300.Buy denture cleaner to clean it.  The cheap fizzy tabs, generic quality, are fine.They give you a cool little holder.  If you don't need the holder, buy a denture cleaner holder and then buy the version that comes as an add on product from amazon (you have to buy something else for them to ship it to you).  That is about $8 cheaper but doesn't have the holder.  This holder has air slots to dry it.  I just left the denture cleaner holder open and it dries just as fast.  This holder is good for travel, so it doesn't hurt to have one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYMDGWQTQHAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002P54M9I#wasThisHelpful","R2PYMDGWQTQHAP","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a super high security lock.  It's better than a cable (anything is better than a cable) and better than most chains.  It's fairly light weight so it's a decent trade off.  But it's bigger than necessary and that makes it easy to defeat.  U locks take some effort to defeat, and if you aren't leaving your bike outside overnight, this is probably a decent choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS23ICMSS95D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005YPK9FW#wasThisHelpful","RS23ICMSS95D","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Did your vet prescribe Famotidine?  He's probably selling it to you in a solution that you have to fight to give your pet.  And he's charging you about ten times the price of these tablets.Each tablet is 20Mg, figure out the strength from the bottle, which will be in mg/Ml, and then measure the amount you've been giving your pet (ue a table spoon or teaspoon measure and then convert in your friendly search engine.  Get a pill grinder and grind away.And I avoid the fight with my cat by just mixing it directly into the can of cat food and adding a little water.  The extra strength is more concentrated so you need less for the same amount of medicine, making it less likely to be detected by your pet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F1FZIB4ZCEV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092L6U5C#wasThisHelpful","R3F1FZIB4ZCEV7","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have virtually every new model of bike light on the market today, and this is the one I use.Pros:-Very well built.  The battery slot is far superior to the battery slots of other lights - better constructed.  The lens has a gasket to keep water out.  Solidly built and will last for years.-Very bright.  Among the brightest lights on the market, good side to side visibility too.  A lot of lights give you brightness in a narrowly focused beam, -- not this one. It's bright and dispersed.-Good battery life.  I only use rechargeables and it's giving more than 30 hours per charge on 2-AAA Eneloops.-Best design on the market. As mentioned, the light pattern is disbursed exceptionally well, yet brightness is preserved.Cons:-The switch can turn the light on accidentally.  This is not a light you throw in a backpack and expect it to be fully powered.-Flash pattern.  This is the only real complaint I have with the light: the flash pattern is steady and unvaried.  This can invite drunk/high drivers to get fixated by the pattern and run into the bike.  The solution I use is to use two of them.  Each one has a slightly different flash speed than the other, so the pattern of both of them randomizes and prevents the ""moth effect"".  They are so cheap, buying two is still very inexpensive and provides a simply massive amount of light.  If you can't buy two, I would advise to leave it on steady, though that will impact the battery life.I ride in traffic in San Francisco, the city with one of the highest bike fatalities in the US.  These lights are a dream come true for me.  The ultimate test is how far away the cars pass you.  They are giving me a wide berth.  Buy two of these, you'll never regret it.  These lights are **the best on the market today**: the fact that they are also one of the most inexpensive is simply fantastic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q9J9BTB4GLRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOZHW3O#wasThisHelpful","R2Q9J9BTB4GLRF","A3SUZA0C8QV8AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3SUZA0C8QV8AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
