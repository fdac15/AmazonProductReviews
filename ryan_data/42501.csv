"Furgiven is Milly Taiden's third book in her trio of books about 3 best friends who end up with 3 bear-shifter brothers.  In this one, Rafe broke up with Julie because she refused to commit...because he refused to say ""I love you."" Yeah kind of sounds convoluted but it makes sense in the story.  I enjoyed the story. can't wait to see what Milly comes up with next.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R231FAYM7UTGE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3PSE0Y#wasThisHelpful","R231FAYM7UTGE1","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved Under Locke so I was so excited to see a new book out by Mariana Zapata. I was so excited and started the book...and it was so slow...and so long....like really really long. With the latest trend of fast-paced novellas, it took me a bit to get into this book. I will be honest, I almost gave up on the book twice...but then the main characters made a pit stop for a brief cameo by Dex & Iris. OMG I almost wet myself at that moment. With a big goofy grin on my face that I tried to hide from my co-workers, I stuck with the book and I am so glad I did...even if it took four hours of my life.  I know...why am I complaining...I'm not really but I usually read 30 minute novellas so this was a major commitment for me.So yes even though it was long and slow moving I am definitely 5 starring this book. It was a nice change of pace from insta-love romance. Plenty of witty humor, great friends, hilarious family, and a sworn worthy guy. Love it, absolutely love it!!! I just don't know if I am going to re-read it five times like I have Under Locke because...seriously...four hours. Maybe I will just bookmark my favorite scenes ;-).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W56PX20JWJDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V12L3CU#wasThisHelpful","R1W56PX20JWJDR","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Furgotten is the second short story in a series about best friends and the brothers they love.  In Furgotten, we learn Karina's relationship ended with  Ash because he was a workaholic.  Ash finally realizes work isn't everything and tries his hardest to win Karina back.  Cute, quick read.  Can't wait for the third brother's story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9IH0AE7TBA0R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US78192#wasThisHelpful","R9IH0AE7TBA0R","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Furbidden is a short story featuring Ethan Sinclair (bear shifter) and Penelope Medina, his human ex-girlfriend.  Penelope and Ethan broke up a year ago because Penelope was mad that Ethan kept some secrets from her. Since Penelope won't answer his calls, he makes sure that he is the only one to buy her at a charity auction.I liked the story, it was cute, both characters likable. I can understand why Penelope felt like Ethan was lying to her but I am not for sure I would have ended a relationship over that. The story also introduced great secondary characters, can't wait to read their stories.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ECUFJFO6BEDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UGP39S4#wasThisHelpful","R3ECUFJFO6BEDE","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sassy in Diapers is a novella set in Milly Taiden's Sassy Mates series. I do love these in between novellas that keep readers up to date on past characters. In Sassy In Diapers, features Karla and Nate dealing with Karla's pregnancy.  So funny and so very cute! I don't want to spoil the story but it is definitely a must read.

"Mercenary Courage is Ruby Lionsdrake's latest addition to her Mandrake Company series.  Mercenary Courage revisits the main characters from Mercenary Instinct. I am usually not a fan of a book with repeat main characters but in Mercenary Courage, the plot works for me, especially since we get to see Ankari and Viktor's relationship grow realistically.****Possible minor spoilers****In Mercenary Courage, Viktor is just back from a job that resulted in several dead crew members.  Ankari and her small company were on a space station working (because Viktor does his best to keep them away from dangerous jobs).  When they meet up at a space station, everything that could possibly goes wrong and while Viktor does his best to keep Ankari safe, she turns the tables and saves him. OMG, that was my favorite twist, loved how Ankari proved her worthiness and stubborness to Viktor.

"Tamed by the Mistress is the continuation of Reena and Archer's story from Mistress of the City.  Absolutely loved this story.  Definitely a nice change to have the main alpha werewolf be female.

"And To Cherish  is Jackie Ivie's 23rd book in her Vampire Assassin League.  This series is starting to make me feel old because I can remember when the first book came out at least several years ago, lol.  Anyway, And To Cherish, features a female vamp lead who meets a geeky bird expert during an assignment. This novella was great as usual but it is my new personal favorite because I live in St. Louis (where the story location is set). Every time the author mentioned a St Louis location I was very happy, especially when she featured the bird sanctuary that I have been to numerous times.  The only thing missing was a pizza reference but seeing as vampires don't eat, I suppose that would have been hard to write in. Highly recommend this novella and the entire series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCVOF7HMLDZ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SI223ZW#wasThisHelpful","R3GCVOF7HMLDZ2","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I usually buy all of Viola Grace's books on release day but last month was business and I completely missed this one. So glad I went back to see what I missed because this is one of my new favorite Terran Time books.Aster is a bodyguard who due to a work place accident has developed perfect bodyguard abilities. While serving as a bodyguard to a female negotiator, Aster meets a godlike man who sets his sights on her.I loved how Aster didn't fall immediately into his arms and was able to choose her own destiny before going back to Yodin.

Make Love, Not War features two mercenaries drowning their troubles in drinks when they notice each other and decide to pass the time in a more fun way.

"Taken by Night is Milly's fourth novella in her Night and Day Ink series.  Seriously if I didn't already read all of Milly's books, I would have read this book just because of the cover!!! My new favorite cover!!! I need to stalk Milly and get this cover autographed.In Taken by Night, curvy Tigress Valentina has never met her boss who works overseas.  All of her friends would love if she hooked up with her boss since apparently there is something in the building's water because all the ladies seem to be finding their mates in the building. Anyway, Valentina is perfectly happy being single but when she goes in heat, her Tigress takes over and meets the perfect wolf on the walk home.  Lots of hotness ensues, a bit of mystery, and an absolute perfect ending. I have enjoyed all the books in the series but this one is my absolute favorite.  I loved how Brett cleverly wooed Valentina and I especially loved that she wasn't a big whiny baby about the ""deception.""  Nothing wrong with a man being clever.

"Cowboy Delight is a cowboy themed novella by Cheryl Brooks.  Lauren Allen's car breaks down in the middle of nowhere on the way to Houston.  After walking 6 miles to a small town she meets a cowboy who is willing to give her a ride to Houston.  Lauren is already engaged to another man but an instant attraction to rancher Steve Williams has Lauren re-valuating what she wants out of life.Cheryl Brooks is one of my favorite sci-fi writers.  I think her branch out to contemporary is a great choice. Cowboy's aren't my first choice but Cheryl does write them very sexy!!! I wasn't disappointed at all and expecially loved the small reference for her sci-fi alien fans.  My only complaint is the author may have ruined butter for me ;-).  Highly recommend this cowboy novella!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQDCY8QCGKTT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R37SQEK#wasThisHelpful","R2LQDCY8QCGKTT","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Mate Challenge is Milly Taiden's fourth book in her Sassy Mates series. Each book can be read as a standalone but I highly recommend reading the previous books first since there are tons of recurring characters.In The Mate Challenge, human Emma Ferro knows that her mate is Mason Wolfe but his over protectiveness is driving her crazy so they haven't officially became permanent mates yet.  I don't want to spoil the story but plenty of hotness ensues in Mason's pursuit of Emma. Throw in an interesting storyline and some great new characters and Milly has a winner with The Mate Challenge. Definitely my new favorite out of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NWRE1CBGG0IG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PCPO7Y8#wasThisHelpful","R2NWRE1CBGG0IG","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mistress of the City by Mina Carter is another short in the Smut-Shorties series.  New city, New lycans, same great concept.  Mina does add a different spin on this story, that lycans are not only born but the classic concept of turning from a bite from a lycan.  Mina hasn't mentioned this in her previous Master of the City series and the classic concept went really well with this storyline.  I absolutely loved this story and it is definitely my new favorite of the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R78LA84ELTHPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SS3WB2Q#wasThisHelpful","R78LA84ELTHPF","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Ryker has enough of her avoidance and makes his move the first night Ciara is back in town.I did enjoy the story.  Milly is excellent at writing hot scenes.

"This is my new favorite Sci-Fi romance book.  I was just about to give up on Kindle Unlimited but I am so glad I stuck with it and discovered this great author.In Venomous, Venomous is an alien who fights to keep human Luman on a slave planet. They get rescued by Venomous's people but it is a long trying road to the couple's HEA. This book is so long, just when I thought the story was about over a whole new drama is introduced.  Usually I am not a fan of tons of drama but it definitely worked in this novel.  It was like a whole sci-fi series rolled into one book.  I loved this book so much I will buy it instead of ""borrowing"" it from Kindle Unlimited because I need a permanent copy.And to Penelope Fletcher, please please please write the next book soon, very soon. The teaser at the end of this book was so awesome.  Would definitely read the next one!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C8EKZFEI6NGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RG0IGH6#wasThisHelpful","R2C8EKZFEI6NGW","A1XA4BJ23AVBT7","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XA4BJ23AVBT7?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These boots are well made and comfortable; comparable to Uggs. I bought them on a lightening deal for $46 - a steal. Amazon regular price at $65 is also a good deal. The reason I can't give them a five star rating is that they run a full size too small. My daughter wears a size nine. I ordered these in a size nine for her, but they are way too small on her. I wear a size eight, and these size nine boots fit me perfectly. So either I got a pair that is mis marked, or these boots run really small. My daughter can't use them, but I can.

"Bought to replace a Shark that stopped making steam after only 2 years of infrequent use. Hadn't heard of VonHaus and was a little concerned about quality. Turns out the VonHaus is much better than the Shark. Bigger water tank, trigger action for steam, triangular mop head gets into corners better, this mop has loads of wattage for truly hot steam, and requires no pumping action to make it. Plus it costs far less than Shark. The Shark is over rated in my opinion, and I would happily recommend the VonHaus. My reason for four and not five stars is I wish it had a longer electric cord. The one on it probably adequate for most people. But I would like to not have to change wall outlets to do my entire first floor. And the micro fiber floor cloth doesn't fit securely. I have to stop and retighten it several times during operation. But, for $40, and free shipping with my Prime membership, I'm more than pleased with my purchase. Even if it lasts only a year or two it will be less expensive to replace than a Shar.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYU6VD1WFA4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00766X9HC#wasThisHelpful","RPYU6VD1WFA4G","A1P99HOPB4LB9I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P99HOPB4LB9I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Thieves in the Night is a darkly beautiful work of fiction. The novel is the story of Dan, a former bad boy, and Bron, a jaded musician. Ball’s narrative jumps around in time. We started in 1999 in London and then travel back to 1995 as Dan’s girlfriend is giving birth in the hospital. We’re with him as he ferrets out a possible affair. In a sense he takes it as something he should have known and then lets the reader in on his intent. He doesn’t leave the hospital; instead he goes in to stand bleakly as his girlfriend names the child after her lover. “Jealousy is a weakness,” Dan tell us “A woman leaves and you get another.” So many points tie back in the novel to other points and Dan’s thoughts on jealousy is one of those points. There are times when the story feels like a series of short stories strung together with common characters and, when read that way, the overall effect can be quite poetic.The cynicism of the characters is manic and shares a depth of rationalization of the criminal mind. If a horrible wrong is done, what does going to jail solve? If you’ve killed someone, it doesn’t bring him or her back?Ball’s description of setting is bleak and brilliant. My favorite phrase in Thieves in the Night (and perhaps any book) was at Kindle location 1467. “…and the lampshade threw an absence of light…” Ball seems to be a master of the picturesque turn of phrase.Thieves in the Night difficult to get into. Once I got used to the way it was written and saw it as anecdotal (it bounces around terribly in time and from person to person), it became less confusing and more about the moment and I think that's perhaps part of the charm of these characters is that they're living in the moment.This is not a novel for everyone. If you need a very linear story, this is not the novel for you. If you’re not a person who can read drug use or violence, this is not the novel for you. If you’d like a look at the darker side of London life, Thieves in the Night just may be the perfect read for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QGFS0FDC4D1B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7701D0#wasThisHelpful","R2QGFS0FDC4D1B","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The authors gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.I love the language in which this novel is written. The first line: “There wasn’t a soul in eleven hundred square miles of Caprock County, Texas willing or able to take care of Mary Alice Bennett, not for love or money.” Despite the expectation set, “Bless your heart” is never once uttered by a character in this 291 page work and I must admit a bit of disappointment on that count. Still, this is a tale chock full of southernisms and stock southern female characters written with respect and round edges instead of cheap stereotypes. “The Paragraph Ranch” is a character driven story. We are with Dee for this experience and, in a sense, her evolution as a woman and writer. It was interesting to watch her research and writing process. At its heart, “The Paragraph Ranch” is simple and direct but without any loss of the softness appropriate to a female driven story. Dee’s flaws aren’t hidden and her awkwardness isn’t concealed.What most surprised me about “The Paragraph Ranch” is how seamlessly it’s written. Had I read other works by either author a signature style may have been evident. As a first time reader of both, I could not detect a duality of style in the work.Overall, “The Paragraph Ranch” was a delightfully warm read. I really enjoyed the relationship between characters and the awkward fun of encountering people from years before. I enjoyed how Dee was roped into the book group and her relationship with her mother, a woman not afraid to say what she thinks.  There was a kinship between Dee and me in that I saw my own relationship with my mother reflected. Sometimes the point of a novel is to develop a bond with the person reading under a warm blanket with a cup of tea in hand. This novel delivers that in spades. If you like a good story, pick up “The Paragraph Ranch” today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U0SWX543LHKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6UFXR6#wasThisHelpful","R3U0SWX543LHKA","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Marc Horn, gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.Marc Horn scares me. His talent for writing beautifully brilliant characters that are truly disturbed is terrifying. Razors may be the best example of his work yet. Razors is a character in a responsible position with irresponsible motivations. His superiors are willing to turn a blind eye for results but only to an extent and their boy gets results but he’s getting increasingly unpredictable. Horn eases us into the character through Razors’s own narrative but also through the eyes of a terrified trainee. Razors is truth, justice and the English way and that way is brutal and, to the main character’s eyes, justice.Razors approaches the “normal world” in much the same way as Irvine Welsh’s anti-hero, Mark Renton (“Trainspotting”). He’s good-looking and attractive to women. Horn’s deep look for the reader into the man that is Razors is always a surprise. Just when you think he might take a left, he swings for the right and suddenly someone has steaming poo on their sofa. Razors tell us on page 98 that “The worst crimes occur in the mind.”I have spent much time on the character of Razors and that’s because details of the story would very easily give away its trajectory. It’s a linear story wrapped up in a character profile that outlines for readers, who this person is, in keeping with its subject and the atmosphere in which he lives. Razors is telling us the story in his own voice so there is regional banter but not anything savvy readers couldn’t work out rather easily in the context of the story. While I read Cuffed: A gripping psychological & crime thriller in a single sitting, I read it again while on a recent trip to revisit nuances that might have been missed. Marc Horn’s third novel is a deeply complex tale and one I imagine, it was difficult to construct in honoring its very erratic main character.Cuffed: A gripping psychological & crime thriller uses vulgar language and violent situations. I am a big Marc Horn fan. Love the dark characters and unique voice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZUPN27W9PI5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MPWHYWS#wasThisHelpful","R1ZUPN27W9PI5A","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Nadine Keels, gave me a copy of this novelette in exchange for my review.“The She Stands Alone” is a 38 page story that reads like spoken word. For most of the first part of this novelette as we are acquainted with Sheridan’s back-story, I couldn’t help but imagine someone sitting on a stage and captivating people with the poetic nature of the prose. An example is Sheridan’s decryption of David Franklin, “…it was all so romantic, really, when I thought about it. Picture tallish, chocolate-dipped specimen of unaffected charisma and looker-to-end-all-lookers.” There’s an elegant drama in that way that Keel’s writes.I really like the artistic craftsmanship that went into “The She Stands Alone.” Had I passed this novelette on a store bookshelf I may have kept going but in reading it and looking for below the surface the depth of Keel’s writing is masterful. The only negative note I have is that I wish it was a longer story. I wouldn’t mind spending more time with Sheridan and with Keel’s poetic style. I’d also like very much to hear some of this story read at a spoken word festival. I think it would be an empowering experience for young women who have felt a let down by a one-sided relationship.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IFDXRT0K1SEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M8HML4G#wasThisHelpful","R3IFDXRT0K1SEU","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Laurel A. Rockefeller, gave me a copy of this book in exchange for my review.Boudicca, Britain's Queen of the Iceni is very much a story with an aim to educate as well as entertain. The framework of the tale is that it’s a story told to a child. The storyteller this time is her mother and the goal is to serve as an empowering tale. Things get tough but women, frequently marginalized in our recorded past, can too change the course of history.Rockefeller doesn’t sugarcoat the history in Boudicca, Britain's Queen of the Iceni for young readers. She is delicate and doesn’t go into graphic detail but abuse, rape and potential sexual slavery is mentioned. It is difficult for young women to comprehend the way that Boudicca and her twin daughters were perceived.Twelve-year-old Alex and I read this novel together and she found the dynamic fascinating. Boudicca’s tale once again confirmed her delight at being born in the 21st Century. From the time we meet Boudicca as she’s running from an abusive mistress, the level of courage she showed in Rockefeller’s well-composed narrative appealed to the young Alex and she enters a phase in her life where she’ll embrace a growing independence.I really enjoy Laurel Rockefeller’s work and believe that she’ll be responsible for introducing many young women to historical figures they will admire.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5J1QAIY9220T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J43RCN2#wasThisHelpful","R5J1QAIY9220T","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ramsey said that “Like Shards of Glass” was a short story that took on a life of its own. In reading this story, I wondered where she planned to stop. Any missing piece of this emotional and tragic tale would have been a loss. Ramsey alternates POV between Monroe, the twenty-four year old Dominique and Monroe’s surviving son, Karter. The first hand tale of each player gives us his or her perspective on his or her past and present and soul deep fears and sorrow. As usual with Ramsey’s work, the inner workings of the characters are profound and perhaps rather inevitable. “Like Shards of Glass” takes Ramsey into the thriller genre illustrating that this author clearly owns whatever she wants to write.Monroe is a deeply complex character. She was trapped in a relationship with a man on the edge and when he cracked, he did it in the most devastating way possible. Monroe’s curse is that Carter left her to live. She, in a lot of ways, has given up and Domnique is her enabler in the quest of forgetting. She’s on board for alcohol, drugs and sex. Whatever makes her forget works for this character. Monroe skates the thin line between sex, drugs and danger for the rare chance to feel something. Dominque describes her as a butterfly, which is descriptive of her characters interaction in the story itself.Karter is bred in a family whose daily life is violence. His father, Carter, lost mental footholds and Karter knew early on that he was losing himself. In a flashback scene, Carter humiliates his son in front ofrelatives and friends and Karter punishes those bystanders for being there when the embarrassment happens. Monroe is horrified by Carter holds her back laughing off the violence. This scene especially defines what the character becomes for the reader and what he struggles to fight. Ramsey sets a character for us that could truly go either way and in so doing sets a tense feel. This is an author who writes for her story and takes drastic risks that won’t appeal to all audiences but readers cannot deny are brilliantly reasoned and plotted.In common with Ramsey’s other work is that this story provides character studies of its subjects. These are wholly developed characters with defined dysfunction.  None of the focal characters are good for each other and within their experiences together they either grow of refine their inability to come together as a viable support system.As always, Ramsey gives us characters that we could be passing in daily life. It is not difficult to imagine Keith Morrison of Dateline giving the background of this story in his dramatic cadence and intonation. I have always been a fan of this author but the development of the plot is an uncharacteristic delight.  I love psychological thrillers and “Like Shards of Glass” is such extremes of the human experience and general engaging dysfunction that I would mark this novel at the top the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDEFERJR39HVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MUWOL7Y#wasThisHelpful","RDEFERJR39HVE","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Veronica Scott, gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.Scott wastes no time once the novel begins. We meet Princess Shalira’s stepmother. When Mike meets her we see through his eyes an overdone and haughty woman convinced of her absolute control. Also through his eyes we see the Princess unsure and clinging to her horse in a seeming metaphor to her approach for life. Her control is limited and she clings to whatever she can. They meet in an impossibly dangerous moment and one of the first in which Princess Shalira leans on him for both literal and metaphorical support in a tangible and believable trust built by a skilled author with record speed.Mike is typical of Scott’s male characters. He’s a soldier with a soldier’s mind and with a quick instinct to help those in his charge. Mike wants to protect Princess Shalira but has the self-awareness not to belabour the point. He knows why he wants to do it and as it has as much to do with his admiration for her as his need to protect her. Again, the realism in this sort of storyline is important. There has to be more of a reason for the attraction than compatible private parts and Scott gives that to her readers without the overdone will they or won’t they. Can you have strong and decisive characters that an audience will believe if they’re not self-aware? That said, there’s a softness in each character rounding them out and further endearing them to the reader.Scott writes wonderful action. Her fight scenes are exquisitely framed and lead the reader on a fast paced wild ride. Scott’s settings are majestic. In “Mission to Mahjundar"" readers are treated to an ancient world in the future ruled by gods and goddesses. “Mission to Mahjundar"" is a beautiful read.

"On the first page of “I Hate Everyone…Starting with Me,” Joan tells us that “Love may be a many splendoured thing but hate makes the world go round…if you happen to love puppies and kittens and the infirm, I’m impressed. I hate you but I’m impressed.” Joan’s absolute denunciation of everything starts an avalanche of things that irritate the author. From waiters to tweens to Lorne Green, no one is safe from River’s acerbic wit. In todays world its hard to shock readers but many moments were jaw dropping followed by a simply inability to stop laughing. Rivers’ style is like her standup. She’s direct, fast paced and ready to say anything. She once said at Sundance “If you laugh at it, you can deal with it, and if you don’t, you can’t deal with it. And don’t start telling me that I shouldn’t be saying it. That’s the way I do it. I would have been laughing at Auschwitz.” Of her over the line Holocaust jokes (in the book she says she’s tired of hearing Holocaust survivors talk about how they only had one piece of bread and water and yet lived) she said “This is the way I remind people about the Holocaust. I do it through humor. My husband lost his entire family in the Holocaust.""As much as Rivers skirts the line of good taste (and indeed crosses it, delightfully pulling off what is decidedly offensive) when talking about the things she hates, the thing she seems most at ease poking fun at is herself. She jokes about her age, gravity catching up with her and even saggy personal parts. Rivers caustic and wholly politically incorrect style demonstrates why she was the Queen of Comedy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KQ02RRGMO5AA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0072O0066#wasThisHelpful","R1KQ02RRGMO5AA","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Book Guild Publishing provided a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.“The Dragon and the Needle” is a thriller on an international scale. Mike and Eleanor are brought together by a colleague to investigate a mystery disease that is highly suspicious in its exclusivity. Mike and Eleanor each seem somewhat wary of common pitfalls of the other’s profession at first but there is soon an undeniable connection. The only problem for the reader is we’re left wondering what each finds so great about the other. We have no other reason to believe their attraction other than as a matter of convenience.The dialogue in “The Dragon and the Needle” is rife with shallow emotion. At Kindle location 2573, Eleanor is described as being “filling with loathing for him, and it was becoming more and more difficult to hide her feelings. But she must!” Her next line in the novel is said in a voice that “quavered.” At first I wrote the awkwardness of language off as the difference in language culturally but over time I expected a bad guy to walk “on-screen” twirling a moustache. When Mike and Eleanor are reunited and the door was locked the whole scene played out like a cheesy movie and while readers of this blog know there are times when I adore a good cheesy read, this was not one of those times.That isn’t to say that “The Dragon and the Needle” isn’t a good novel. It is a story with a fabulously good idea that lacks in execution. While there are elements that could have been better done, the novel reads as having been written by an author with a great idea but without a clear path to bringing it to life. It is the great idea that kept this reader interested and reading. If Franks could self edit and make the characters more plausible, “The Dragon and the Needle” could be a knock out hit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FWVVFHJAX1W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA9ZBM2#wasThisHelpful","R1FWVVFHJAX1W4","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Marissa Tejada, gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.There is a trend in pop culture and fiction toward quirky women who are floundering through life. In the case of Ava Martin, she’s starting a new life in a new place when circumstances spin out of control. Ava is a normal woman with baggage from her childhood inhibiting confidence in the decisions she makes. Tejada manages to present in Ava Martin a woman who fits the trend without feeling silly or overdone. She’s a woman on the edge who has suffered a true blow and is scrambling to recover. Ava is the spirit of chick-lit.I have not been to Greece so cannot speak to if the Greece of the page is that of reality but there is a special quality to the setting that feels as though its well known to its author.Whether dipping a toe in the dating world, navigating the local constabulary or being chased by a man on a horse while naked, Ava reads as a woman in desperate need of finding her purpose. Thankfully she has faithful Greek friends to sit her down and remind her not to over think things.

"After reading “Dalek I Love You: Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Edition” by Nick Griffiths, I cannot call myself a Whovian. While Griffiths doesn’t consider himself a hard-core Whovian his long experience with the show (from the age of 4) surely qualifies him for expert status. While the book is as much about Griffiths’ life as the show, it does give readers an idea of the sort of person who adores, follows and obsesses over the iconic show. People the world over whether they watch the show or not know when they see Tom Baker’s scarf the show from which it originated.There is a Dave Barryesque reticent charm to Griffiths’ writing. At the start of the memoir he tells us he has a child so at least one woman was willing to sleep with him and then cites another girlfriend so that was two. He also openly states that some facts will be slightly blurred due to either memory or convenience. The tone is light and fun and there’s no shortage of laugh out-loud quotable moments. “Surprise is everything. Without it you have stuff; with it, you have stuff plus wonderment.” (Location 875) This author certainly surprises the reader in a delightful way as no matter how far the author gets away from his Doctor Who, he always comes back to the show and actors begging the question of how pop culture shapes us.“Dalek I Love You: Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Edition” by Nick Griffiths doesn’t simply chronicle a love affair with Doctor Who. In respect to a cultural barrier, the football team was the only point where I stumbled. “Dalek I Love You: Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Edition” was fun, warm hearted and even David Tennant liked it.

"The editor of this novel, Henry Herz, gave me a copy in exchange for participating in this blog tour.I am a huge fan of “The Dresden Files” by Jim Butcher so when the editor of the piece approached me to write a review, that author was the one I was most looking forward to reading. I’d heard of some of the others but had never read them and wasn’t really interested in learning more about that work. Everything changed upon finishing this wonderfully laid out anthology. The stories leave readers wanting more when they shift to the next but the arrangement makes for a good flow while the sameness of dark tone peppered with humor keeps readers in the moment.My favorite story was by old favorite, Jim Butcher. As many authors do, he chose to use his anthology story to expand on a character from the Dresden world. Johnny Marcone is a mobster who makes life more interesting for Harry Dresden and Butcher gives us a closer look at his character in “Even Hand.” Butcher shows the readers Marcone’s view of himself as a professional monster and yet shows us a deeper side that has to be consciously kept at bay. In a classic economy of words, Butcher gives us a compelling story that easily stands on its own while thrilling existing fans.“The Adventures of Lightning Merriemouse-Jones” by Nancy & Belle Holder was a great way to finish the anthology. It was nice and light and fun. The author’s crafted a classic story (Dracula) and set it at sea using mice so there’s a “Secret of Nihm” gone wrong feeling throughout and it was just wonderfully hilarious. Miss Lightning Merriemouse-Jones is a Penelope Pitstop for a new generation.If you’re a fan of fantasy or the paranormal, I urge you to buy “Beyond the Pale” today. It’s a delightful look into a scarier world than our own with delicious flashes of brilliance from the authors.

"The author, Alastair Puddick, gave me a copy of thing novel in exchange for my review.There are many brilliant moments in “The Unexpected Vacation of George Thring.” The day he first sees Elvis could have come from a Carry On movie and the way Puddick writes the scene perfectly conveys how much a fish out of water Thring is in his situation.  Puddick’s environmental and character descriptions convey a clear photograph of a scene without the feeling that we have elaborately painted a picture brush stroke by brush stroke.No classic British read would be complete without a romantic sub-plot. George at the beginning lacks finesse with the female of the species. When he encounters Alice he doesn’t automatically become a lothario. The spirit of Elvis is not invoked. Instead the evolution of the story progresses naturally and if that includes love for our laid back hero, that is to be determined.Puddick very clearly tells us who his characters are and why they do what they do and does it in such an entertaining way that “The Unexpected Vacation of George Thring” is a novel that is simply delicious to read. It is a story that reminds me of why I fell in love with reading and the humor that has kept me such an avid reader all these years. That this is Puddick’s first novel is astonishing to this reader. It is wonderfully written and seamlessly edited so that readers closing the book won’t have the sense of having read a prelude to the main act.“The Unexpected Vacation of George Thring” was an unexpected delight to read.If you like classic British humor, I strongly suggest picking up “The Unexpected Vacation of George Thring.”","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK43ARZJOFMFT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6KCX04#wasThisHelpful","RK43ARZJOFMFT","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a big fan of Julie Frayn. Her writing style is easy and classic. Her narrative flows like water on the page and there’s nary an error to be found in any of her published work. Unlike her other stories, the stories of  “Two Wins and an Honourable Mention” are written is a style reminiscent of Flannary O’Connor’s Southern Gothic.The first story, “End of the Line,” is about a Gordon Fisk. True to the Southern Gothic tradition, Gordon is a man socially isolated by his filth and stench and, while lonely, he seems to prefer his routine. For the course of this story we are with Gordon as he goes about his nightly routine and by his side when people with negative intent invade his space in a flurry of violence and gunfire. What will Gordon do? Is he to be a participant or observer in this story? Frayn is an author who takes risks with her characters so his participation in the story is not guaranteed but what plays out is a perfect ballet of what is meant to be.“The Final Bow” is the story of Adrienne, Gabriel and Emmett. It breaks my heart as a reader to say this but for the majority of the story, I did not enjoy this one.  Adrienne and Emmett are musicians. Adrienne is interested in Emmett romantically but standing in her way is Gabriel, the ghost who haunts her house. As with Frayn’s other stories, it’s very well written but I could not connect with the characters. They were over the top straight out of an oil on velvet painting and somewhat predictable. The end of the story though. Chills. The end of the story was wonderful. Despite my distaste for the characters I wanted the story to continue. I wanted to know what happened with the characters and where they went from the moment of snapping strings to leaving the house.The final story “God Damn, The Fisherman” was inspired. It was “Hannibal” with humor. When your kills are being attributed to another serial killer, what do you do? That killer has no style, grace or taste. How dare the media give the attention he’s owed to the other serial killer. We are in The Baker’s head for much of the story and it is a scary and horrible place.  “God Damn, The Fisherman” was my favorite of the three in that it was uniquely light while remaining very dark. The style in which it was written while rivetingly gory was so engaging that when finished I wondered when Frayn would release the rest of this book. I must read more!“Two Wins and an Honourable Mention” showed me a new level in Frayn’s writing and I loved it. This is a wonderful trio of short stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2B9OL6E69LABV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LLJGINC#wasThisHelpful","R2B9OL6E69LABV","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Laurel A. Rockefeller, gave me a copy of this book in exchange for my review.The stated demographic is grades 2-12. Alex is a 12-year-old who will enter Grade 7 in the upcoming school year. “Catherine de Valois” by Laurel A. Rockefeller was her first exposure to this historical figure. Alex enjoyed that the narrative was a story told to a young bride by the sons of the subject. Rockefeller’s style is very smooth and the anecdotes chosen fit together perfectly. The story led to discussion about historical cultural differences. Would a 12-year-old marry? Isn’t it sad that a mother wouldn’t see her son for years? Wasn’t it terribly cruel for a monarch to take property from people? Alex found the five-year-old Catherine unrealistically mature in he speech but understood that times were different and each day was uncertain especially when surrounded by war and an insane and powerful parent.  Alex was happy for Catherine that in the end it seems she was able to do what she wanted even if it meant being separated from her son.Rockefeller provides a list for further reading at the end of the book as a guide for those, like Alex, interested in learning more. “Catherine de Valois” is an interesting, engaging, well-researched tale of the life of a strong woman in history and a must read for young girls and anyone looking for a quick historical read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOWUNGCUADMG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2OLUIY#wasThisHelpful","R1QOWUNGCUADMG","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Getting Bobby Glitter to play the club is a huge triumph for her punctuated by a local rock station covering the event but she’s going to make it work despite the minor trouble that may befall the group. This is going to be crowning achievement and things are going up from here.  When the owner of the club, who had recently been acting erratically falls to his death, Ame must know what happened. That’s the hook for cozies. You have the character unable to resist justice. For Ame she knows that her friends weren’t involved in his death and that’s all she needs to know. With her sidekick, the teenaged Bronwyn, she sets out to find the truth and clear her friends of suspicion.Stoddard’s Stephanie Bond-like style will give this author and character longevity. The author tells us that her passion is the music industry and concerts and I can while she doesn’t belabor the technical details, she gives us a sense of place and reality. We have a character with a job that she does while using intelligence, common sense and a bit of chance to work herself into a case in which she doesn’t belong.If you’re looking for a vacation, summer or beach read. Something light but interesting and wholly engaging, pick up “Murder at the Castle Rock.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R370QV6QHPAO92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CPTCAES#wasThisHelpful","R370QV6QHPAO92","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Karen Faris, gave me a copy of this book in exchange for my review.These are authors you either don’t care for or you hold in your heart and Karen Faris is an author that I will hold in my heart. “Grumbles the Novel Book One: Take a Pill” is not a perfect read. It’s more Fforde than Douglas in structure in a modern day setting that stays earthbound and takes us to a quite unique place.  Faris takes us to a near future written in euphemism. Hector works at the “Cop Shop” and does “Cop Shop Missions” in the Corporate Woods. The world is an odd mish-mash of bad taste and convenient living through fear of reprisal. The Weatherman rules all and even controls time and is living up to his campaign promises and keeping the world 72 and sunnySo, yeah, this is that kind of book and its brilliant. Faris awkwardly starts and stops as she sets the scenes. Faris is able to pull the narrative together so that each plot point promotes a better understanding of the world in which Pettie Grumbles lives and of the character herself.Joining Grumbles as a sounding board and sometimes contrarian is the “10 or 11” year old, Toga. Their byplay throughout the piece is as entertaining as the off-kilter world in which they live.  The message from Faris is that while this is the unlikely place we’ll go, this is the world ahead and we should dig beneath the humor and look at the message.“Grumbles the Novel Book One: Take a Pill” is a 128 page masterpiece. If you enjoy social satire this is the perfect novel for you. If you like Jasper Fforde, “Grumbles the Novel Book One: Take a Pill” is like a divinely placed cherry cordial in a box where you thought only nougat was left. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series to see where Faris takes her characters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RELIRGZPYW411/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GP18T42#wasThisHelpful","RELIRGZPYW411","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Can you save a person with sex? This is the question posed by “Demon of Envy,” the fifth “episode” in the Gods of Love Series.  Liv is a fluffy girl who was traumatized by her former boyfriend and generally insecure about her attractiveness level who hasn’t had sex in a long time and Thon is the Chippendales toned, penile enhanced god that has eyes only for her. This, my friends, is erotica.I am going to give Lynne credit for not using any of the time-worn clichés in the sexual novel pantheon. This is an author giving the reader straightforward sex that is hot, raw and pretty well written. I’m no erotica expert but the encounters had an urgency that these sort of written scenes sometimes lack. These are characters we believe want each other and they want each other badly. When Thon’s insertion into Liv’s life extends outside of the bedroom, she’s not sure she really wants him there and that’s where Lynne gives readers an extra level of conflict that given the characters presented make sense in their storyline.We don’t have as strong a sense of the character that is Thon as we do Liv. Perhaps his character was better outlined in a previous book. What is presented works in the scope of this 55 page novella. He and Liv are together not just to heal her but also to heal him. Though the fifth book in the series, “Demon of Envy easily stands alone. “Demon of Envy” is straight up self-indulgent girl porn. If you like erotica, you’ll like this novella.

"The author’s publisher, Curiosity Quills Press, gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.Emma starts out as a fairly stereotypical loner. She’s been bullied by classmates, made to feel inferior and inadequate by her mother (her father’s much younger trophy wife) and generally is afraid to make friends because they will eventually find her strange and unworthy and reject her. She is petulant and somewhat intellectually elitist even before Mike’s death but she has a wistful nature that inspires empathy. Emma, in the aftermath of Mike’s death, doesn’t handle herself in the best way making things worse and her more sensitive to the critical stares of others and she’s conscious of that to an extent.A funny thing happened on the way to the dead guy, Emma became someone you wanted to win. She brings her first dead guy, Sam, back. He’s an aspiring medical student who threw himself into the river. When Emma and Sam involve themselves in the troubles of a fellow student and Emma seems to become less obsessed with the wholly unattractive loser she feels herself to be, she stops being a Disney movie cookie-cutter and becomes more a real person. Emma has a focus beyond herself and that focus acts as a bit of a photo developer for the other issues in her life.Ann Noser’s “How to Date Dead Guys” is something of a diamond in the rough. Noser’s story-line is fresh and unique. The way she wraps the story is nothing sort of amazing. She makes clear to the audience when Emma embarks on her witchcraft experiment that the desire to act is born from the depths of despair and that Emma doesn’t know what will happen so we’ll just find out along with her. Each back from the water character grows her knowledge and her confidence in her powers.“How to Date Dead Guys” has a clear direction in it’s plotting and the author seems to pace what she reveals to both Emma and the audience. It’s a story of a girl becoming that she’s meant to be and embracing her unique talents. Or, for this reader, a story that started with rolling eyes and ended with a true interest in the character and her abilities.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNVG8L0ZKG6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620075199#wasThisHelpful","R2BNVG8L0ZKG6P","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite a very slow start, Thornburg’s passion for nature and knowledge of the job that her character performs shines. As the author returns Rima to Arizona from California and settles her into a world and job the author clearly knows very well, she becomes more comfortable in her subject and that comfort reflects in her narrative flow. The magic of nature shines in Thornburg’s writing and the reader has the sense that the author shares her character’s awe in its beauty. There is a visceral sense in the depiction of Arizona for the reader. An introduction of a love as deep as any other Rima or the author might experience in the space, wildlife and unique features of the state.The evil in “Condor Moon” is very specific and very clear from the start. As with most series novels, the first is a very personal case and while the “eco-monster” of “Condor Moon” may have a name, the feeling of the text is that this is what people in Rima’s situation face corruption and deceit everyday and we as caretakers of the planet must protect endangered plants and animals. While Iris Johansen tends to write murder mysteries with protagonists in forensic fields, Thornburg’s “Condor Moon” shares a spirit of activism with the more prolific novelist.“Condor Moon” was as much about the journey as the end and when this reader arrived at that final page, I wanted to read on. What is Rima doing next? I enjoyed “Condor Moon” immensely and look forward to seeing where Tanna Thornburg takes the Rima Larkin series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R119LOTLD3SAZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KDV5C2C#wasThisHelpful","R119LOTLD3SAZG","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this book as an Advanced Readers Copy from the author’s manager. Content may have changed between the copy I received and publication.As is indicative of the genre, Story falls into a world she’s destined to help. I don’t know about other readers but I didn’t like her at first. She struck me as self-absorbed and more teenager than young adult (her mother notes this as well early on in the advent of mood swings). She has vivid imaginary friends and her paintings depict violent scenes born of her dreams. To be fair to the character, when Story falls into this alternate world everything she’s been struggling to make sense of and everything that has perhaps made her a bit odd falls into place.Good fantasy is imbued with darkness, danger and hope. “Fractured Dreams” has those qualities in spades. Hope leaves room for humor even if it’s in the sense that we may as well laugh at ourselves because our next moment may be all we have.There is a heavy romantic thread in the novel in the relationship between Story and Nicholas. Randall’s threading of the relationship in the story so that it doesn’t distract from the core message is expertly done so that fantasy readers won’t roll their eyes but romance readers have a storyline to which to cling.“Fractured Dreams” is a story not yet complete. Readers of this first novel will have a sense of having read a complete story but will have a need to read on. Story may have settled the immediate problems of the alternate world but a much bigger bad looms and that bad is just thrilling.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTFCZJ6AAK5SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JG8U6TC#wasThisHelpful","RTFCZJ6AAK5SC","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Doug E. Jones, sent me a copy of this book in exchange for my review.It would have been easy for Jones to ride on stereotypes in “Nowhere to Goa Bhang Lassis, Rickshaws, and Holy Cows!” Scott, the good twin vs. Mike, the rakish and likeable irresponsible twin. Instead of leaning on what might be easy, Jones builds an authentic, wholly realized and thoroughly entertaining story of a man who may be looking for his brother but ends up finding himself.“Nowhere to Goa Bhang Lassis, Rickshaws, and Holy Cows!” is funny, insightful and poignant. Scott is accustomed to the weight of expectation and responsibility. He and his parents have been living as a unit apart from his twin, Mike. Mike’s been the only really unpredictable element in their lives and while they love him dearly, he’s more a responsibility than a unified part of the family. When he arrives in India and starts looking for Mike he finds that things are perhaps worse than he thought but as he starts the odyssey to his brother (with whom he is reunited quite late in the novel) who seems to be on his own pursuit of drugs, sex and rock and roll. Scott tells us early on after discovering that his brother had headed for the Himalayas that he rarely lost his temper but it’s almost always because of his brother who he sees as an impulse driven hedonist….and as someone who needs saving. There is no one on this planet that knows more of the answers than a 19-year-old. It is in the transformative moments we realize how little we know.Jones depiction of setting is vivid. He integrates information about culture, history and people beautifully making for an engrossing travel read. As enjoyable as the characters are, the settings are what make this read. I’m not overly familiar with the India, Thailand and other locales depicted but they are painted with such through and loving strokes that I now feel this is perhaps a trip that is necessary to a complete life. When Scott passes through Pushkar, India in his pursuit of Mike, he describes a beautifully mild Holy Town where people gather by the lake to have their heads sprinkled with Holy Water. Rituals such as the removing of shoes and gathering by the lake are done with reverent dignity. The reader gets the feeling that these are places the author knows well because each has a unique spirit.“Nowhere to Goa Bhang Lassis, Rickshaws, and Holy Cows!” is a very relaxed novel. Told in Scott’s voice the flow is easy and relaxed. Per, a man met on the plane, acts as a bit of a common sense guide to a character thrown into a culture. After Scott loses a ton of money in a case of mistaken identity in exchange for a cup of chai and a handjob, Per helps Scott make sense of why Mike might go where he’s headed. He also acts in a sense as a travel mentor to the younger man.I really liked “Nowhere to Goa Bhang Lassis, Rickshaws, and Holy Cows!” I found the novel to be personable, engaging, expertly written and wholly engrossing. I recommend this for anyone who likes travel novels, coming of age stories or just generally good fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R226OC6NBKCMTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I19Y5W6#wasThisHelpful","R226OC6NBKCMTF","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, David Meredith, gave me a copy of this book in exchange for my review.The Snow White of “The Reflections of Queen Snow White” is not a Disney princess and not the cutesy outlaw played by Ginnifer Goodwin of “Once Upon a Time.” Queen Snow White was a victim of a jealous stepmother who was increasingly losing her mind with envy and brutalized her young stepdaughter.  Meredith’s take on the classic tale is closer to the original in its raw brutality and some graphic material. “The Reflections of Queen Snow White” is a very grown up look at a character in crisis.At 155 pages “The Reflections of Queen Snow White” manages to accomplish everything one might think it should. There is deep symbolism in the story that will be evident to attentive readers.  More sensitive readers should be aware of graphic sex and violence. Meredith does not cut corners. I had the feeling when reading that if a scene worked in the story he was going for it and making it as brutal as needed to enhance his characters. This story will make you look at the story differently but I found not a single thing that did not make sense for the character and her world. Will Snow rejoin her daughter Princess Raven or will she be lost to everyone with no one to save her?There is a theme, or so it seems, of things left festering and threatening to destroy us. “The Reflections of Queen Snow White” is an interesting as the idea sounds.

"Tell Cotton sent me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.“Cooper” is a novel with a bit of a different feel from the previous two books in the series. The Landon Family is looking to the future. The three primary characters have sweethearts and plans involving those sweethearts that look toward the continuation of the Landon name. Easier planned than done in the days when you weren’t sure you’d live to see the next sunrise. There is a feeling of coming together of the other two stories in this book and some resolution though Cotten could easily continue the series and keep the reader engaged. And we do know that the series will go on as the work ends with a except from Book 4 which will be titled “Rondo.”Josie is a badass. Cotten, in his writing, tends to give the women spirit. In my review of “Entwined Paths,” I cited Jessica as no wilting violet but Josie makes her look like a swooning silent movie actress (though Jessica does appear in “Cooper” in a significant way and makes an interesting transformation). Josie was kidnapped from her home and made an Indian bride and she learned much from her experience. She catches food without weapons, mends wounds with sticks and on Page 115 when they need someone to act as scout for a location she’s there willing and volunteering. Cotten gives us some moments of uncertainty early on when he needs her off-screen (in a manner of speaking) but this is not a woman who falls easily. She is the Wild West feminist movement. If she stays with Cooper it’ll be because she wants to stay with Cooper and not because she needs him and I love that about her. The inclusion of this character in a normally male driven genre makes this one of the better westerns I’ve read.Cotten’s work is character driven. Over the course of the now trilogy characters have evolved and expanded and to a man (and women) have become more interesting instead of less. Cotten’s settings are strong. His setting itself is something of a bonus character but it is the people that makes the series and will keep readers coming back for more.If you like westerns or have a loved one that enjoys a down and dirty trip to the Wild West click through to Amazon and buy the Landon Family Saga by Tell Cotten. They run at the $2.99 to $3.05 price point for e-readers and are engaging, entertaining and engrossing.

"Written much in the style and humor of the author it honors, Neil Gaiman’s ""Don’t Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy"" is a wonderful treat for fans of “The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy” and its author. The book contains supporting material from Douglas Adams himself, as well as his own words as compiled from Gaiman’s interviews with him, as well as a tireless search of the media.Adams early aspirations were toward the stage. He saw John Cleese perform while at Cambridge and thought to himself, “I can do that… I’m as tall as he is” (page 7).  Gaiman connects for the reader Adams early work with the work that would become The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.  While working with Graham Chapman after the days on Monty Python’s Flying Circus, Adams amassed ideas he thought either too good to discard or too interesting to forget and they would make up elements of his later masterpiece. The Adams that Gaiman outlines for us very much worked on instinct and inspiration. Douglas said that he “Didn’t so much like writing as having written (Page 7).""Don’t Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy""  is a fanboy love letter to an author known and admired. There is, after all, a reason a day is dedicated to this internally best-selling author. “Don’t Panic: Douglas Adams and the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy” is a wonderful reference for any fan of Douglas Adams and gives us a true insight into his process, his insecurities, his challenges and ultimately his success. Written in the light and thought-provoking style of its subject, I am now inspired to go out and snap up everything Nail Gaiman has ever written.On Page 59, Gaiman lists three opinions of why ""The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy"" was so successful. The consensus seems to be that it’s because it’s not like nothing the reading public had ever seen before. As someone who first read Adams as a teenager and has been searching for like authors for the better part of my life, I believe this perfect style of brilliance and madness is so hard to produce that we’ll see it infrequently as time goes on. Adams is lost to us now. Jasper Fforde remains, and up and coming authors like Ford Forkum as well, but catching the magic in the bottle that was Adams is elusive. ""Don’t Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy"" was a sheer delight to read and to remember the man that was Douglas Adams.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXN808MOCL3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1848564961#wasThisHelpful","R2CXN808MOCL3L","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“The Cabinetmaker” on the surface is a solid police procedural. We get the good, bad and very ugly face of a 1970’s Scottish police precinct. At its heart it’s the story of a bond built between a victim and a man who desperately wants to help him but isn’t sure the police are in the business of the public best interest. Jones does a stunning job of portraying a gritty Glaswegian force. Jones gives readers the feel of a real and unfiltered look into the inner workings of a murder case that seems to have little hope of being solved. People are unwilling to talk and respect for the law is low. In the passing of decades there are inevitably points where a story might start to drag. Jones maintains a logical pace. Francis is hesitant at first, as any victim might be, but recognizes the innocence in McDaid and the value of making him think about what he’s seen.On the negative side for US readers, a certain word considered too foul on this side of the pond for many Americans to even contemplate using appears again and again in regular speech. After several paragraphs, this reader became somewhat inured to the word. While terrible to read it is essential to add a certain element to the story.The cumulative effect of “The Cabinetmaker” is masterful. Alan Jones gives readers an imperfect story but a solid and entertaining read that will appeal to fans of police procedurals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32VLPO92ICCNF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F0WWVYQ#wasThisHelpful","R32VLPO92ICCNF","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"“Clonmac’s Bridge” is a globetrotting thriller featuring an archaeologist who will stop at nothing to solve a historical mystery. Perren cites in a footnote to the story that the tale was inspired by an actual archaeological discovery while all else is fiction. The story is written with a strong sense of authenticity. Perren invites the reader to point out errors that he might have made in the 9th century chapters of the novel.  The language, care and invitation to readers speak of an author with a deep investment in history and accuracy of his narrative.Griffin Clonmac is a well-rounded character. At the start of the story we get a picture of a man who is perhaps a bit wonderful. Too good looking, too charming and too willing to do absolutely anything to find what that which he seeks. As we get to know the character we discover that while he has flaws, Griffin’s challenge is to stay ahead of the people trying to stop him. In order to stay ahead Griffin is canny, quick witted and ideally suited to his challenge. A lessor man wouldn’t stand a chance because Perren isn’t likely to cut this character a break. He may survive by his wits but Griffin has to work to make his story happen and everyone is looking to stop him from those closest to colleagues he’s always despised.Perren’s plot is information heavy. For this highly detailed story to make sense the reader has to know what Perren knows and the author does so with a skill that doesn’t slow the story. The last third of “Clonmac’s Bridge” barrels to an eventual conclusion without leaving the reader in the dark. There are no stones unturned, no threads untied. Every element is natural, logical and something of a surprise.If you like thrillers, “Clonmac’s Bridge” is a wonderful and complete read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBRQIJP9PQCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4NE8DE#wasThisHelpful","RTBRQIJP9PQCV","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Alice Walsh, gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.The description of this novel cites that not all relationships end in “happily ever after.” The aim of the novel is to spotlight that every relationship no matter how dysfunctional is a “poker game of love” involving winners and losers. I can appreciate the authors goal and I can say without reservation that she has shown us quite unique characters and relationships in “A Poker Game of Love.” I can also say without reservation that the two main characters along with a few others are truly awful and do not get any better in the course of this 269 page novel.Sylvia is essentially the main character of the piece. She’s a girl not so pretty but who has learned to make herself appealing. Sylvia adorns herself in designer labels and good taste and plays the game so well that she has no worries about lying on her resume as she has a stable of capable men to do the work for her. All she has to do to keep them willing is smile and flirt a little. Stephen, a man who seems to do the bulk of her work, is a long time acquaintance and former lover who seems to know the game. He allows himself to be used for whatever reason but still seems to illogically pity Sylvia her outlook on love, relationships and men.James, we’re led to believe, is the one responsible for Sylvia’s destructive outlook toward sex and her own value. She, from what we understand, expected more from him than he was willing to give and ultimately settled for an emotionally abusive sexual relationship with him that honed her ability to use sex and her femininity to her advantage. This is not a spoiler as a majority of it happens prior to the start of the story. Convinced of his awesomeness, James wants what he doesn’t have and wants to keep what has become handy and knows what he likes.The author’s biography touts her writing style as being a cross between “The Devil Wears Prada” and “Sex in the City.” I’ve only read the former and beyond the fashion of the novel – and this novel contains a great deal of fashion styling – did not see a resemblance.There are people who love the irredeemable jerk in pop culture and this novel will appeal to them. It is well written, gives a connected story and carries through on the promise of a winner at the end. I’m sure that Sylvia would think I was simply too deluded to get the game but this was a novel that I appreciated as something different but can’t say that I enjoyed.If you liked “Bitter is the New Black,” you will love “A Poker Game of Love.”","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PEZANTHC0P8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRNJUPI#wasThisHelpful","R1PEZANTHC0P8Q","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Carol Cooper gives us a diverse group of singles from every walk of London life and facing a variety of personal challenges. There’s the housewife who answers questions of would be suitors with disinterest parroting the answers her children might give to their questions. There’s the man looking for a break in the loneliness and desperation of his inevitable expiration date as a result of cancer. There’s that man’s former girlfriend a looking for love idealist looking to manipulate her way into a man’s heart using her body. Cooper wisely formats her book so that we are essentially getting flash dates of our own with the souls of the characters.There’s a reason for Cooper’s disclaimer at the end of the novel that none of the characters are based on people living or dead – these characters are real and wholly realized. Often novels of their type fall down on dialogue not so in the case of “One Night at the Jacaranda.” Cooper has a background in psychology and puts that knowledge to good use in forming characters that react to and interact with environmental stimuli. Cooper’s story moves forward at rapid fire pace rotating between the characters leaving no story line unresolved and no character flaw left underdeveloped.“One Night at the Jacaranda” is expertly edited and polished. There is very little fat and filler on this storyline. Most of what we learn about these characters is essential to our understanding of them. Sanjay and Laure’s first meeting in the book is tense and involves Sanjay blurting his condition and banal discussion about how the cat hadn’t grown out of its vomiting problem. In that moment we have a clear picture of the intimacy they once shared with the complication of that interaction yet to be uncovered.“One Night at the Jacaranda” is enjoyable, well written and sure to satisfy readers who like contemporary fiction.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQNHBVCJGAYL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYGEIM0#wasThisHelpful","R3IQNHBVCJGAYL","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author, Allen Mitchum, gave me a copy of this novel in exchange for my review.“Trophy Target” is a real treat for fans of Daniel Silva. Mitchum gives readers an expertly executed character in a world that could and probably does exist in the shadows of our world. Brutal mercenaries, organizations poised for control and manipulations of government officials all in the name of self-service.“Trophy Target” is an exquisitely polished novel. Readers will see no difference in writing style and quality from some of the better known names of the genre. Fadi is typical of the genre in that we get to know him without ever having had the sense of getting to know him. The air of mystery which sustains novels of the genre is seamless and serves the author well in the progression of the story. Mitchum takes us from the rough terrain of Guiana to the Danish Royal House back then to the sandy and hot terrain of Afghanistan. The reader understands that these are locations the author has either researched heavily or visited and that the locations and the tenuous danger of them work as a separate character in his piece.The motivations given for an insider to betray the Danish government served as a usual layer to “Trophy Target” that further stands to set the piece apart. The driving force was unusual, logical and written in such a way that readers will find engaging. The storyline involving Prince Erik and the person trying to manipulate results could have easily been relegated to a secondary place and not developed but Mitchum does not cheat his readers in a sense of urgency or excitement.If you are a fan of international thrillers and anti-heroes, pick up “Trophy Target” today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQU5475MCHA6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1AV2V6#wasThisHelpful","RFQU5475MCHA6","A1K97BMLKKASEO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1K97BMLKKASEO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great first ""pop-up"" style book, if not technically a pop-up. There are pieces that slide back and forth, for the most part. Although the movement is essentially the same throughout, the designs and context make everything feel different. For the most part, movements correspond to the real thing: pull a measuring tape, saw, etc. Those that don't, wouldn't really be possible in two dimensions, such as a screwdriver. So the screwdriver bit is about identifying Phillips vs flat.What I really appreciate about this book is that it's very sturdy, and therefore appropriate for young toddlers. Baumann has other books, such as the one about vehicles, that are very cool but too delicate for younger kids. This one will hold up well, better than ""lift the flap"" books that often lose their flaps.Construction fans will especially love this one. It's a good pick for travel as well, since there's a variety to keep interest but it's compact to fit into a bag. The handle is a cute touch, too.I checked this out for my 2 year old but plan to put this under the tree. I'm sure he'll enjoy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHTTPOJ28R7O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1027600743#wasThisHelpful","RHTTPOJ28R7O6","AESNOYBYV9WGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESNOYBYV9WGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Four out of four dogs in our house agree that this is a tasty food. They seem to tolerate it well--no upset stomach--and even our picky one eats this right up. This is a high grain food, which may not be to everyone's preference, but for our older, less active dogs, it suits them well. The ocean fish meal is a good protein that seems to provide the flavor that our picky eater likes (he's always been quicker to chow down on fish-based dry foods).

"I was very interested to try a quinoa cereal for baby. At this age, he gets his nutrition from breastmilk and formula, so the ""superfoods"" status is not such a huge factor compared to a toddler who is on all solids. Still, I was interested.This was easy to mix. It took a little more liquid than other cereals to get it smooth, but it blended easily.My baby ate this as enthusiastically as anything else hes tried. It's not very sweet at all, the apple is very subtle, which is fine by me. I did not notice the ""soapy"" taste that other reviewers mentioned. This tasted like quinoa, not in-rinsed quinoa. It's iron fortified, but with plant-based iron (curry leaves). I hope it's just as good as what's in conventional cereals, because I did not detect that strong metallic flavor that many iron fortified cereals and formulas have. It's such a dramatic difference that I'll be looking for plant-based iron going forward (supplements, etc). He doesn't eat enough of it yet to know if it's constipating.All in all, I'm happy to have tried this cereal and will look for their products again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTEK68M9I30F4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8DYVXC#wasThisHelpful","RTEK68M9I30F4","AESNOYBYV9WGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESNOYBYV9WGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This conditioner performs as advertised: it's rich and smoothing for damaged hair. For that reason, it earns 4 stars.It doesn't earn 5 in my book for these reasons:First, there are less expensive options in the drugstore that perform as well. That's true for just about any salon hair product, especially shampoos and conditioners (vs styling) so a salon product has to really wow me for a fifth star and extra $10 or more. This did not.Second, I found the fragrance very unpleasant. Another reviewer compared it to baby powder and that's quite accurate. I have babies but I don't like that baby powder scent and I sure don't want my hair to smell like it. Since nicer fragrances are often a selling point for salon products, that's a deal breaker in my book.

"We got to try these right as my son began potty training in earnest.  They are a great nighttime complement to daytime training. My son loves wearing his undies most of all, but a Pull Up is often more practical. He's a little disappointed to of a diaper back on (they are clearly in the ""baby"" category for him now) but these pull on diapers definitely fit that need. They go on like undies for him but give us the nighttime absorbency and fit we need.Speaking of fit: these fit him better than regular Huggies diapers, which were always the most prone to leak for us due to the shape. These fit a little more like Pampers. While that's great for us, it might be a drawback for those toddlers who have a better time in Huggies diapers vs Pampers.

"This vacuum navigates well. Not the most efficiently, it seems at times, but it's great at maneuvering around objects, and because it uses a camera to navigate, it seems to do a better job of coping with moving objects (if you push something out of its way for ex, or living beings). It also gets over the strips between flooring types well.It vacuums well, picks up the dust, debris, and pet hair. Because robotic vacuums take a bit longer than manual vacuums, the noise is an important factor. On ""silent"" mode, this is highly tolerable, better than most dishwashers. Volume isn't too loud and it's a low hum. Easy to ignore.The point cleaner is cool. Like a slow motion cat and laser pointer. It helps especially when you just have a few areas to get.This vacuum looks really cool, but it's taller than a Roomba or Neato, so it won't get under furniture as well. That's a drawback.We're pleased with this, as it's nice to set it to run before were up and going. It doesn't even disturb the dogs, which is a huge plus. However, you'll still need a manual vacuum to get where this won't:corners, crevices, underneath stuff. That's just the trade off with robot vacuums, but you won't have to break out the upright or canister every day, and you can probably get away with a less expensive model for those occasional uses. Which is good, because this is on the higher priced end of the range for robot vacuums.If you're drawn to this one, you won't be unhappy.

He loves the cars too, and the different features on this track add a lot of interest. Even the gears are an extra something to play with, and the elevator is really cool. The car can also be operated of the track, which is nice when you aren't in the mood to have this fully assembled (it's big).

"Sonicare toothbrusshes are great, including this model. The distinguishing features here are the design and the app.The stickers allow children limited customization of their toothbrush through stickers or sleeves. If you're sharing this among children (each with their own brush head) that might raise some contention but there are some options within a limited color scheme (green, blue, purple).The biggest feature is the app and Bluetooth connectivity. The app features the same characters as the stickers (Sparklys). Each kid gets a profile and can upload a photo to th e app. When the kid starts to brush, there's an animation of the inside of the little Sparkly's mouth, showing where to direct the toothbrush and move it along to kill the little germs. It's cute but a bit weird (the tongue moves naturally, which is kind of weird. The designers did as good a job as could be hoped for, coming up with a way to style the moving tongue without it being downright disturbing). When you finish, you get a prize, and you earn prizes towards achievements.The app can be an effective way to keep kids motivated to brush, and also engaged and focused enough to brush properly.For the parent, it's helpful because you'll get alerts when the kid misses a brushing (you can set times). You also set notificiations when it's time to change the brush head, and you can set up your own rewards. The brush doesn't have to be connected each time its used: you can sync up every few days. (You can also download the app and use it with any other toothbrush, although you'll have to manually update the use.)A lot of thought went into the app, and it's easy to use and provides just enough content and gratification to serve it's purpose. An improvement would be to offer some variety in the brushing animation, just to mix it up a bit.All in all, the app adds interest and useful features, and the connected brush seems to be about the same price as the standard. With that, the connected brush is a good pic.But it seems  that this burhs","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K1B69MA9QDUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7ZL6#wasThisHelpful","R2K1B69MA9QDUB","AESNOYBYV9WGP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AESNOYBYV9WGP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Who would need someone else to write speeches for them? The answer is probably people with power but no time. Who would want to write speeches for others? That would probably be bright and articulate people who need a job. Barton Swaim’s book illuminates the psyche of the two – the speaker and the speechwriter. It is illuminating in the general sense as a study of speakers and speechwriters generally, and it is also illuminating of the author personally, as a speechwriter to the speaker whose speeches he wrote.Although he did not name his boss, the world knows that Barton Swaim was a speechwriter for Mark Sanford, the governor of South Carolina whose claim to fame is proportionately due to his tragic-comic adultery, his incoherence when speaking on his own without a speechwriter, and the fact that in spite of the first two, he is still the Congressional representative for South Carolina.Kurt Vonnegut once told his writing class that only a nut would want to be the president of the United States – ‘but he gave me a job’ (as a speechwriter for $1,800). Somewhere in the relationship between a speaker and his speechwriter, honesty and sincerity are given makeovers, from the mild to the extreme. A speaker like Sanford probably does not understand the drift, let alone the nuances, that his speechwriter has etched out for him. A speechwriter, on the other hand, carves ideals and promises for his principal knowing that they are not going to happen.Swaim knows this for he writes: “It’s impossible to attain much success in politics if you’re the sort of person who can’t abide by disingenuousness. This isn’t to say that politics is full of lies and liars; it has no more liars than other fields do. Actually one hears very few proper lies in politics. Using vague, slippery, or just meaningless language is not the same as lying: it’s not intended to deceive so much as to preserve options, buy time, distance oneself from others, or just to sound like you’re saying something instead of nothing.’Oh dear, Mr Swaim, using ‘vague, slippery, or just meaningless language’ with intent to avoid the truth and thus misleading the listener is no better than lying (what Swaim refers to as ‘proper lies’). In the combined act the speaker and the speechwriter are pretending to be somebody he is not, and pretending to say something from his conscience when he is not. Remember Vonnegut? He has this advice: 'We are what we pretend to be, so we must be very careful about what we pretend to be.’ Are the Swaims of the literary world listening?","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FESE72UL5MAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476769923#wasThisHelpful","R3FESE72UL5MAO","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an immensely entertaining and illuminating book about the history of capitalism, how it is reflected from the mirror of morals, and its future. Plender tells his tale by citing literary works and history. He begins with the moral warning against avarice from a plethora of ancient voices. The great Christian Paul might turn in his bed in Heaven should he see how his diatribe against wealth – the love of money is the root of all evil – has been twisted. The slightly less famous GB Shaw protested that it is ‘the lack of money’ that is the root of all evil.Plender strives to find the ethical basis for capitalism, but at every turn he finds questions that are hard to answer. He searches for the seed of capitalism, beginning with the animal spirit of the entrepreneur, using, among other works, the ‘Fable of the Bees’ by Nicholas Barbon to illustrate the point that capitalists needed to be ‘both vicious and economically creative’.He examines the role of bankers and why appearances are important to them – they are, after all, Plender suggests, masters of the con job. Here, he refers to the story of the Tellson Bank in Dickens’ ‘A Tale of Two Cities’ to illustrate how banks create the impression of probity. When it comes to industrial shrinkage and financial excess he has no lack of material. From Dickens again, he found ‘Hard Times’, and from Adam Smith’s ‘The Wealth of Nations’ and Gibbons’s ‘The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire’, lessons to the fall of the Lehman Brothers. The shrinkage of industrialisation is not, in Plender’s view, a necessary catastrophe because he thinks that it may be that it is just a case of the world going through an economic balance, with industrialisation giving way to services. But that is what brought about the excesses of the banking services which he discusses further in his later chapters about the sophists, economists, and other silky-tongued drivers of the financial services.Plender does not expect us to be disappointed with a book about capitalism without talking about gold. His chapter, ‘Gold: the 6,000 year Bubble’ is fascinating with his references to Richard Wagner’s ‘The Ring of Biebelung’ and Thomas More’s ‘Utopia’. He studies Warren Buffet’s (negative) views about gold, and endorses them although he believes it is still a good bet to hold on to some gold as a hedge against inflation.Plender concludes that with all its warts, there is a future for capitalism because history has vindicated capitalism for having ‘lifted millions from poverty all across the world’.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TQ7WUQJ56D7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010G4FSHO#wasThisHelpful","R2TQ7WUQJ56D7I","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Derek Wall is a supporter of the Green Party of England and Wales. He is thus naturally inclined to think that the world's economic woes spring from capitalism and its modern off-spring, the even more evil globalisation. His book, 'Economics after Capitalism' is not a book that contains the rantings of an anti-capitalist. It is measured and deserves deep and serious consideration. He is very lucid and explicit about the flaws of capitalism. He explains how capitalists and the rich elite destroy the resources of the world, impoverishing the poor (nations and individuals alike) while enriching themselves.The big and powerful nations are all capitalists. They employ the three powerful institutions – the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organisation –to retain control of wealth and power. Although he presents some alternatives, the various forms of anti-capitalists from Marx to Negri, including the proponents of the commons, Wall is short of any real solution. He sees and understands the problem but is unable to find an answer in economics or politics. Perhaps the answer is not in either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20QLE7OJ0G1H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0745335071#wasThisHelpful","R20QLE7OJ0G1H4","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Without the Bible the Christian religion will not be as we know it today although that is not to say that we know all about the Christian religion. That is because the religion is as fractured as it is diverse. Being all things to all men comes at the price of impenetrability. The Bible is a book that requires the reader to decide whether to read it literally or to read it metaphorically, grasping the words as symbolism of whatever the imagination takes them. Christians of the latter school will assert that theirs is not the mere imagination the rest of us understand it to be but it is the imagination inspired by the spirit of their Jesus. This review will say nothing of these two ways of reading the Bible. This is a review of A N Wilson’s way. A N Wilson was a Christian who turned militant atheist, writing anti-religious tracts (such as ‘Against Religion’) but he tells us in ‘The Book of the People’ (‘BOP’) by the time his atheist books appeared in print he was already harbouring doubts about atheism.  He eventually re-converted to Christianity and now hopes to show us (Christians and non-Christians alike) how to read the Bible. What is clear is that he accepts the position that Jesus as depicted in the Bible cannot be proven. The historical Jesus is a myth, a stand shared by many Biblical scholars and Christians but rejected by others. BOP goes further. It is clearly against a literal reading of the Bible and accepts that all of it is narratives, not by witnesses of the events. It is a book of narratives of people claiming to be witnesses. Wilson admires writers such as Thomas Brodie for their blend of ‘scholarship, intellectual inquiry, and an imaginative, even poetic “take” upon the world’. The trouble with admirers of such blends is that they often do not see how imagination acts as a cover for the blanks in scholarship. Wilson resorts to many sources including the Apocrypha and Revelation to construct his methodology. Having proposed that the Bible has little historical or evidential truth, he reads between the lines of the text and imagines the minds of the narrators who the writers of the Biblical books claim to be recording. Without proof and evidence, Wilson is left with little else but imagination. Psychologically, seekers are desperate to find. They also loathe failing. Thus, egged on by ‘Seek and ye shall find’, they find.Perhaps he was stimulated by his friend’s comment that the Bible is the best book for atheists for the thrust and conclusion he brings to his way of understanding the Bible is that ‘Christ did not come into the world to found a religion, but to make “religion” superfluous’ for there will be no Jews against Christians, no Buddhists against Hindus, and no Shiite against Sunni. The BOP is not an orthodox approach to Bible reading, but it is a fascinating book even though it is likely to be criticised by Christians and atheists. Of course, if Wilson is right, this book will have made him at least a minor prophet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NH6Y9Y5KHL7F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWQV26Y#wasThisHelpful","R2NH6Y9Y5KHL7F","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well written and comprehensive historical account of the gay movement in America. The landmarks are the major court decisions beginning with the 1958 (unwritten) Supreme Court decision overruling the US Postal Service's attempt to suppress a magazine ('One') that was intended for a homosexual audience, to US v Windsor (the case striking out the 'Defense of Marriage Act'). The impressive and fascinating history stopped just before the US Supreme Court's biggest ruling in this area in Obergefell v Hodges. So although this is an excellent book on the history of the gay movement in America, one might wait for the second edition or a reprint that will include the Obergefell (pronounced oh-ber-ger-fel) decision.The account by Walter Frank also analyses and comments on the function of the family court and how gay issues are and ought to be handled. The debate over gay rights is one that has always been passionate and heated. In this regard, in the chapter 'The Debate Over Gay Rights', Frank not only sets out the issues but also how the debate ought to set out ‘its public reasons' for the stand that each side takes. There is also an illuminating chapter on the onset of the AIDS, how it was perceived as a problem of sin, the resulting neglect and how it turned from 1988. He tells of the long battles between supporters and opponents of the movement, and of Obama's support, a support that began, then floundered, and re-emerged but he reserves the details of Obama's personal support for another story.Frank asserts that the overriding goal of the gay rights movement is for gay persons to enjoy the same freedom and joy that everyone else enjoys, but he acknowledges that it 'will take more than political victories, however, to achieve this goal, for no amount of political success can protect a young child from the inner stress that comes from being different'.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R243RY0DPH2EVT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0813568714#wasThisHelpful","R243RY0DPH2EVT","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The two popular translations of ‘Crime and Punishment’ before the 1993 translation by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, were by Constance Garnett and David McDuff. The Pevear/Volokhonsky translation became my favourite – until Oliver Ready’s translation came along. Not knowing a word of Russian, I declare my favourite only by the enjoyment I derived from reading the book in English.Many things may indeed be lost in translation, and many others get misrepresented but we may not know. The result of reading only the English versions is that one’s choice is largely subjective. Compared to the Garnett version, the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation seems very modern – until Ready’s came along. Little things like changing ‘had not’ to ‘hadn’t’ renders Ready’s version not only a little more modern but also more informal. That is not to say that the atmosphere of old Russia is lost. Ready uses ‘fibs’ for ‘lies’ (Pevear/Volokhonsky) in one passage.Ultimately, the reader has to decide for himself which style he enjoys more. Here is a comparison from one of my favourite passages (there are many) from the book. I set out first the Pevear/Volokhonsky version then the Ready version:“What do you think?” Razmumikhin shouted, raising his voice even more. “You think it’s because they’re lying? Nonsense! I like it when people lie! Lying is man’s only privilege over all other organisms. If you lie- you get to the truth! Lying is what makes me a man. Not one truth has ever been reached without lying fourteen times or so, maybe a hundred and fourteen, and that’s honourable in its way; well, but we can’t even lie with our minds! Lie to me, but in your own way, and I’ll kiss you for it. Lying in one’s own way is almost better than telling the truth in someone else’s way; in the first case you’re a man, and in the second – no better than a bird. The truth won’t go away, but life can be nailed shut; there are examples. (Pevear/Volokhonsky)‘Now what are you thinking?’ cried Razumikhin, raising even more. ‘That it’s their lies I can’t stand? Nonsense! I like it when people lie. Telling lies is humanity’s sole privilege over other organism. Keep fibbing and you’ll end up with the truth!  I’m only human because I lie. No truth’s ever been discovered without fourteen fibs along the way, if not one hundred and fourteen, and there’s honour in that. But our lies aren’t even our own! Lie to me by all means, but make sure it’s your own, and then I’ll kiss you. After all, lies of your own are almost better than someone else’s truth: in the first case you’re human; in the second you’re just a bird! The truth won’t run away, but life just might – wouldn’t be the first time.Ready’s version has a table of chronological events and a fresh, inspiring introduction that will help the first-time reader understand and appreciate the context of ‘Crime and Punishment’","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16H7IEH59FO7U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0143107631#wasThisHelpful","R16H7IEH59FO7U","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bell begins his study of the Chinese political model of government by examining the flaws of the Western democratic model. The three flaws he identified concern, ironically, the tyrannical face of democracy – the tyranny of the majority (oppressing the minority), the tyranny of the minority (rich capitalists exploiting the poor), and the tyranny of the voter (over residents with no voting power). He then examines the success of a hybrid capitalist-socialist model from a small country – Singapore. Here he quotes the former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew as to the dangers of allowing the uninformed to vote. China, immensely larger than Singapore has turned, not only to Confucianism, but also to Singapore to see how it can develop a model of government that is primarily Asian. Underneath the fascinating analysis of Western-style democracy and Asian autocracy is a curious mind probing for the answer to the problems of government. Bell makes a compelling case that orthodox democracy has too many flaws to be ideal, but what is the alternative? The China model is unlikely to have fans in the Western world, so is it possible to find a suitable hybrid that is universally palatable?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQM3DZ2VK552/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0691166455#wasThisHelpful","RFQM3DZ2VK552","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is this book really about? Where America is and where it might be heading are the complex issues that Bremmer tries to discuss. He also thinks that he has captured the three paths from which the next President can choose to lead America to, but where to? Bremmer's made it clear that he wants to see a strong America leading and the rest of the (weaker) world following willingly and with admiration. He does not want to see an America, strong in military strength but weak in good sense, charging to yet another catastrophic military venture.But Bremmer has not been entirely lucid or consistent with what he wants to tell the reader. On the one hand, he wants the reader to read and think about what this book has to say and elect the right president next year, but at the same time, he is firmly of the view that the president must obey Congress. So what sort of president does Bremmer really want? His inconsistent and vague positions have led to reviewers misunderstanding him. Does Bremmer really believe that an 'Independent America' is one that 'should primarily worry about itself' as a five-star review appears to have understood him? Similarly, one review that gave this book a solitary star might have read too much into Bremmer's analysis in dismissing other alternatives (described as 'Moneyball America' and Indispensable America').I think that Bremmer understands that the world has changed and sees the danger of an extremist America, but unfortunately, he has pitched his book at the local voter and thus his ideas are lacking in coherence, consistency, and depth. The result is that it confuses the voter and draws disdain from the intellectual. In either case, the reader might benefit with a closer reading. If the reader has the patience, the book is worth reading.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHSNAM6JJ6Y59/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591847478#wasThisHelpful","RHSNAM6JJ6Y59","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Zerzan attempts a philosophy of anarchism which he defines as an end to all forms of domination. This is an interesting book which might appear learned and deep but is really a collection of the negative thoughts of a bright mind with no answers to the problems of humankind. Therein lies the danger - readers who sense the darkness that comes from Zerzan's pen may seek desperate solutions. The Unabomber might have been one such person; but Zerzan wants us to believe that people like the Unabomber see clearly the danger of modernity and civilization, they have seen the enemy, and it is us. Technology is attacked as a threat with no redeeming features. If only Zerzan had been clearer. But then, he might have lost his admirers had he expressed himself clearly enough; it is through murkiness that his ideas take any semblance of shape, captivating and arresting minds already clouded in the first place.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OR2UUNXV74MN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=092291575X#wasThisHelpful","R2OR2UUNXV74MN","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The authors are professors from Harvard and MIT. They spent 30 years studying the three men, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, and Steve Jobs – former CEOs of Microsoft, Intel, and Apple, respectively. This book contains their analysis of how those three men made their companies so successful. It is not a biographical work in which pages and pages turn on the statistics that show how their companies become the giants that they are today, nor is this an historical account of the slow rise of these three men. This book dives straight to the results of the 30-year research.The authors are of the view that there were five rules which the three men observed fervently and consistently. The authors set out these five rules as their opinion of the formula and not as the usual management mission statement. The five rules are as follows.The first rule is, ‘look forward, reason back’. The authors reasoned that strategy is always forward-looking, but history’s lessons must be also be learnt. They say that in planning strategies one cannot assume that the future will always be like the past. Looking forward means anticipating the needs of customers; then looking back to see what one’s capabilities are. Grove, having expanded Intel, realised that the way forward was to concentrate on its core business and not compete with its customers.The second rule is to ‘make big bets without betting the company’. The authors are of the view that: ‘Great strategists do the non-obvious, the difficult, and the counter-intuitive in order to alter the landscape in their favor’. The authors analyse how Gates, Grove, and Jobs placed their bets at crucial periods. Gates went big when Microsoft was strong enough so that the threat of bankruptcy was low.The third rule is, ‘build platforms and ecosystems – not just products’. This requires a vision of what the company and its business is capable of. In the context of the authors’ analysis, ‘Platforms bring individuals or groups together for a common purpose, usually with access to shared resources’ – such as Microsoft reaching out to IBM when it went to Microsoft looking for an operating system. Gates made the DOS (‘Disk Operating System’) a universal system and not just a product for IBM.The fourth rule is ‘exploit leverages and power – play Judo and sumo’. This requires one to ‘stay under the radar’, and like a page from Sun Zi’s ‘Art of War’, keep your enemies close, but at the same time embrace and extend the competitors’ strengths. Instead of buying Universal Music and making enemies of all music labels, Jobs took the harmless line, ‘What harm could it possibly do to license us the music on the Mac?’ The authors explain how ‘throwing one’s weight’ helps. The use of ‘vaporware’ by Gates is one example – this is the tactic of preannouncing new lines when the product is far from complete. It unsettles the customers of competitors.The fifth rule is, ‘shape the organization around your personal anchor’. The authors here show how, despite their personal flaws, the three men drove performances and organizational effectiveness. ‘Although willing to be proved wrong, each CEO saw himself as the smartest man in the room.’ This rule implicitly requires deep personal insight (although one might question whether arrogant men have this quality). This rule requires one to ‘pay extraordinary attention to detail’ but ‘never lose sight of the big picture’, and to ‘give power to the people with “the knowledge”’.If the slant of this book is towards depicting the three CEOs as men of vision, it might have given less credit to the role of luck that ran the course of their lives and their companies – as indeed it does everything in this universe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV2D5FPL2FZBI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062373951#wasThisHelpful","RV2D5FPL2FZBI","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the industrial revolution gaining steam John Maynard Keynes felt optimistic enough to declare that in the future we need only work 3 hours a day. The rest of the time we can devote to the pursuit of leisure. Here we are today screaming for work-life balance and ‘quality time’. The advancement in technology is so astounding that Keynes could not have imagined what machines can do today. Yet why is it that his general imagination of a more leisurely life seems as distant today as it was before? Wajcman is a sociologist who studies the effect of machines on us, and the effect we have on them, and the connection between the two fields is where we can find the answers about the shortage of time. Wajcman first puts things in context and perspective by making sure that the premises are objective and uncontroversial. We have the same 24 hours a day. So when we feel pressed for time it is not because the hours have grown shorter or that there are fewer hours now. Cars move so much faster than a horse and carriage but Wajcman points out that in congested London, it takes a car just as long to travel the same distance a horse and carriage used to do. Wajcman’s thesis is that technology and machines are not the cause of pressing us for time. She believes that it is human nature and culture that have yet to harness technology properly. We tend to make busyness a badge of distinction when often it is just a mark of incompetence or deceit. But working in the internet age with constant connectivity is a challenge if we wish to realise the Keynesian dream. We must realise, as Wajcman tells us, that ‘The very same machines that can make us feel harried also free up time, allowing for much greater autonomy, flexibility, and versatility in how we organize human affairs.’ It is true that technology now allows work to intrude into our leisure time, just as it allows us to carry out personal activities during work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA3U6N3AP99SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=022619647X#wasThisHelpful","RA3U6N3AP99SI","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Edge is gone. Mark Urban believes that the economic and military might of the West, namely, America and Europe, has deteriorated so much that the West has now lost the ability to ‘deter people in parts of the world from doing desperate things’. The ‘worst case’ scenario that Urban depicts is scary. What makes it chilling is that it is happening. Urban illustrates the helplessness in which the West, post Iraq and Afghanistan, faces the display of violence or aggression by non-states such as ISIS and Boko Haram, and states such as Russia and China. Russia has got its way, mostly, with the events in Ukraine and the Crimea. China is flexing its muscles in disputed territories. Urban fears that soon, India, Brazil, and even Iran and North Korea may become embolden by the fact that the West can no longer muster the money, equipment, and will to stand in their way. In this book, Urban provides an account of the areas in which Russia and China are racing ahead of the West. For example, he thinks that Russia now has the ability to detect stealth aircraft, thus rendering the new F-35 fighter-bomber obsolete even before it begins production. The West has no equivalent of the Russian BUK type missiles that (he says) shot down the Malaysian civilian aircraft over the Ukraine. The greater fear is that the West may resort to nuclear weapons now that it is unable to meet its enemies in a conventional war. This makes brinkmanship and leadership matters of great importance. If Putin is bad, his successor might be worse. If Western airplanes provoke Russian and Chinese ones, it only takes an incident to trigger a major conflict. Furthermore, a weakened West may also be dragged into conflict by its treaty allies picking fights with Russia and China. Urban does not offer any positive outlook.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T7G18H19OVTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y30R3NU#wasThisHelpful","R3T7G18H19OVTM","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book that will interest every aging person. Aleman begins by describing the different types of memories and the rate and process in which they deteriorate as we age. He also discusses the difference between the processes of storing and accessing memories. Older people tend to have difficulty repressing irrelevant information and that contributes to ‘poor memory’ because we need to free the space so that relevant information can be accessed more quickly.Next Aleman discusses the different types of dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent. Dementia occurs with age but at different rates for different people – and also in different degrees and forms. He writes about the case of an 82-year-old woman who thought that she would soon die and so decided to donate her body for science. When she reached 111 she called up the University Medical Center Groningen and asked if such an old body was still useful. The Center visited her and explained that it would be very useful if they could ask her to perform some cognitive tests. She did very well and took the test again when she was 112 and again when she was 114. She could recall stories better than a 70-year-old. All that occurs with changes to the brain. Aleman discusses this in great detail in his chapter on ‘Forgetfulness or Dementia?’ Here he describes the forms of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and how they lead to dementia. He tells us what can be done about MCI.All is not bleak for older people because Aleman reports that older people are emotionally more stable and also calmer. He gives an account of why this is so. He also discusses the reasons that causes depression in older people. Many of the causes are related to an aging brain, but older people, he reports, are actually less depressed than younger people. Further, the reasons for their depression are also different. Some of which is due to the fact that they are, physically, more dependent on others.Aleman also discusses the types of food that might help slow down the deterioration of the brain. He reports on the studies of pills and supplements such as Omega-3. He also discusses why exercise is relevant. He concludes with a chapter called, ‘The Best Possible Brain’ in which he summarises the factors that help older people understand and cope with the aging brain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F8HKM6D43TI8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1922247634#wasThisHelpful","R2F8HKM6D43TI8","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Atkinson takes on a subject that is of great concern to most of us -- the problem of inequality. He distinguishes the inequality that exists within a nation and the inequality among nations, capturing the essence of the causes of each of these types of inequality. This book is partly economics, partly politics, partly sociology, and partly international affairs. It promises much because he is taking an innovative approach to the problem. His main thrust is on the problems arising from distribution. The book is technical and not an easy read for many who are not familiar with economics.Atkinson’s proposals for action and reform are not merely fiscal or purely political. His appears to be a multi-prong approach and thus merits serious study. In theory, this might have been a nice plan but his proposals may lead one to query the practicality of his views. He has a basic socialist approach in which he advocates greater government action such as creating a national pay policy with minimum wage, a capital endowment paid to all adults, progressive tax, and social insurance, but at the same time he also believes in continued social security contributions. The only problem with his admirable plan in creating a fairer distribution of wealth is that we have first to create sufficient wealth in those countries in which equality has little significance because everyone is mired in poverty. Francois Bourguinon's book, 'The Globalization of Inequality', 2015 Princeton University Press, may be a good companion to Atkinson's book. The stark reality is that good ideas about equality require strong government, but in capitalist countries, a government is as strong as its political base. There are no easy answers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QV4AHEDIREUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674504763#wasThisHelpful","R3QV4AHEDIREUG","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a thought-provoking book by a number of international affairs experts. The theme is duo-fold. First it analyses the causes of the First World War and secondly, it attempts to draw a comparative risk analysis in the relationship between the US and China today. It is not the economic contest alone that poses a risk of war. Arthur Stein and Joseph Nye Jr provide interesting views as to the causes of WWI. Nye Jr in his essay addresses the two main general questions: Is war preventable and is it inevitable. WWI is an apt subject of study because it had 20 million people killed and empires were destroyed. There were multiple causes of WWI and these are examined in full by Nye Jr. The establishment of two strong blocs in Europe did not cause the war, but Nye Jr says, ‘…without the two blocs, the war could not have broken out in the way it did’. As some of the other contributors assert, two ‘small’ factors were highly crucial in causing the outbreak of WWI. The first was that the leaders of the key nations, Germany, Britain, Russia, and France listened to the advice of the lesser known figures in their respective countries. Secondly, it was the failure to contain small incidents and allowing them to escalate. The two factors became crucial when two big powers allowed long-standing conflicts of interests to continue without finding a diplomatic valve to diffuse the tension. The problem is further complicated by a third factor – the presence of a third party. This is the composite figure of the various allies of the super-powers. Their involvement and disputes with one of the powers invariably draw in the other. Small things mean a lot, and be careful of your friends as you should be with your enemies. That seems to be the overall message of this book. What makes the book a chilling read is that the reader can juxtapose the present-day bickering between the US and China and their respective allies to see how close the contributors’ analyses are to the history of Europe leading to WWI. Perhaps the leaders of the US and China ought to read this book – and be more aware of the hawks in their own ranks, spoiling for a fight. Or else, history will surely repeat itself.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20R5DF6D6EHPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0262028999#wasThisHelpful","R20R5DF6D6EHPH","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an immensely fascinating book about the history of American interest in China from the perspectives of the key men from both countries. It begins with the American interest in getting a good trade deal and the indignation at the haughty stance of the Chinese emperor. From then, America and Britain bullied the Chinese with their superior fire power. This was the time of Warren Delano, the grandfather of President Franklin Roosevelt. Bradley gives a gripping account of how the Roosevelts made their fortune from the China trade. But by the First World War, America lost interest in China briefly until Japan started its dominance as a power in the East.The bulk of the book tells the story of how Chiang Kai Shek and the Soong sisters, one of whom he married, together with his brother-in-law, T V Soong, lost China and fooled America into believing that by supporting Chiang, they had a puppet they could manipulate. America was taken in by a combination of factors – that Chiang and the Soongs were graduates from American universities (Chiang was from Harvard) and became Southern Baptists (an important factor to Christian America – it was fervent in its zeal to spread its Christian religion to the Chinese peasants), Chiang’s dishonesty, his sister-in-law’s cunning, the popularity of Pearl Buck’s book ‘The Good Earth’, America’s ignorance of China and the Chinese, and lastly, America’s own ‘China Lobby’ consisting of top aides of President Roosevelt who believed that Chiang would beat the Japanese and also the communists. Billions of dollars were given to Chiang’s ‘New China’. Bradley does not say so, but questions arise as to how much of that went to the Chiang and Soong families who continued to own properties in Brazil and New York even after they lost China to Mao Tse Tung.The same ignorance and naivety coupled with the desire to dominate Asia led to the American debacles in Korea and Vietnam. Just as the Americans had no idea what Mao was like (they only saw the flashy but hollow Chiang), they had no idea what Ho Chi Minh was like because they saw only their own puppet, President Ngo Dinh Diem, who, like Chiang, was a Christian president in a Buddhist country. These two episodes are found in the last chapters of the book. They are relevant to the question ‘Who lost China?’ which was raised. Bradley pointed out that most Americans do not know that Mao offered his hand in friendship to America but was spurned until 1973 when President Nixon finally paid homage to the Celestial City as did foreigners since the ancient history of the Middle Kingdom.It seems that America is still perceiving the China mirage when it constantly sees China as a threat to regional and world peace when in fact it might be America itself that creates and poses that very threat. To that end, Bradley's book can be enlightening - but only if America wishes to see clearly.This book is lucidly written and explains the greed and political ambition, cunning (and naivety) in politics and international relations. The book is 376 pages long but can be read in a day because it is impossible to put down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K0HZONN1MRE9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316196673#wasThisHelpful","R3K0HZONN1MRE9","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three years ago, Stiglitz published ‘The Price of Inequality’. That was a book about the effect of globalization and the rise of the top 1 percent of society’s income earners. This year he published ‘The Great Divide’ which is a bit more of the same, but this recent book is more a collection of essays connected by the central theme that the divide between the top 1 percent (does it matter if it is 2 percent?) and the rest is growing so rapaciously that the middle class that has served an important socio-economic purpose up to the twentieth century is now disappearing.In this book, Stiglitz hints at solutions. First, the top 1 percent must learn like the 1 percent of old, that it is no good to be at the top of the pyramid if there is no stable base. Inequality makes the position of the top 1 percent precarious. Stiglitz points to the various kinds of inequality enveloping American society (and gradually, global societies), not just the inequality of wealth but others such as inequality of education and political power, that is undermining the sustainable growth of a healthy economic society.On a more personal level, Stiglitz ruminates and examines issues such as the real reasons why Detroit is failing, and why he thinks Janet Yellen makes a better Federal Reserve than Larry Summers (the latter was anti-regulation and Stiglitz blames the financial crises of 2008 on the de-regulation of the financial institutions).  He also cautions Japan against falling into the same inequality trap.This book seems a nice reminder and a suitable addition to his previous book, but it also complements Anthony Atkinson's book – ‘Inequality: What Can Be Done?’ (2015 Harvard University Press)","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6V79LQ7384W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393248577#wasThisHelpful","R6V79LQ7384W4","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pillsbury is a director of the Center on Chinese Strategy of the Hudson Institute, and has written this fascinating book about politics, military strategy, espionage and intrigue. The author believes that China had a long (100 years) plan of toppling the USA as the world superpower. He cites small incidents and interviews by Chinese dissidents. An example of the former is the story of the Chinese performance artist Cai Guo Qiang who gave an exhibition of his craft by blowing up a Christmas Tree, turning it black, to signify the discovery of gunpowder by the Chinese. But Pillsbury saw this act in more ominous light.Pillsbury calls Cai a Chinese hawk and like the ruling hawks in the Chinese politburo, Cai is supportive of the ‘narrative of the decline of the United States and the rise of a strong China’. Although the book is interesting and informative especially when it recalls incidents in which the author experienced first-hand, the interpretations and analyses by the author are questionable. Pillsbury admitted that he has not read internal Chinese documents. He is piecing his story from accounts by dissidents. His criticism of China is suspiciously overcooked. For example, he complains that China is increasing greenhouse gas by more than 500 million tons a year when America and Europe together are cutting down theirs by 60 million tons a year.  One wonders how much of that 60 million is America’s alone?Pillsbury writes about people who suffer from the acts of the Chinese governments – businessmen who have been refused visas, for example. But if the Chinese are planning global economic domination as Pillsbury thinks they are, why would China be spurning business?  Further, Pillsbury writes about the secret plans China has to help its cause. He has a chapter called ‘The Assassin’s Mace’ in which he talks about China’s plans to build super weapons so that they can overcome a superior enemy. Has not America been doing the same? Pillsbury quotes former Chinese President Hu Jintao, ‘Let us join hands and work together to build a harmonious world with lasting peace and prosperity.’ He then quotes from a speech by President Xi Jinping, ‘We must constantly tamp the material and cultural foundations for the realization of the Chinese dream’, and advances the astonishing conclusion that ‘Xi was laying out the goal of harmonizing the world according to Chinese values’. For decades American has been exporting its capitalistic foundations for the ‘American Dream’. There is nothing wrong with that in itself; it is Pillsbury’s hypocrisy that hopes to turn dreams into nightmares.The lack of a balanced view detracts from the credibility of this book. The book’s main attraction is its representation of what and how an American hawk thinks about its new and fearsome competitor. Basically, as an American, Pillsbury wants America, not China to dominate the world (in every sense and in every sphere). If America has to do what he accuses the Chinese of doing (and who is to say America is not already doing so) to forge ahead, one doubts that Pillsbury would mind that at all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1183R4IAJJ8WH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627790101#wasThisHelpful","R1183R4IAJJ8WH","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It does seem strange to assert that we do not have free will when we are making hundreds of decisions daily many of which are made after thoughtful considerations. Therein lies James B Miles’ lucid and illuminating work. We may make decisions but that does not mean that the choices we make are freely made. Working from the basis that science has shown that the universe (including us) are subject to the laws of determinism, that is to say, that every effect has a cause, Miles points out the conclusion that is rapidly gaining ground in the study of free will – that we are the product of biology and environment. Only those who hold the Libertarian view of free will still maintain otherwise.Hence, when we choose eggs instead of cereals for breakfast we appear to be making a choice out of free will. No one compelled us to choose eggs over cereals. But on closer examination, we will find out why we chose eggs. For example, we had cereals the day before, and we have a practice of not eating similar breakfast two days in a row; and that practice started when we were 12; that practice started with an event in which a relative fell ill after eating similar breakfasts two days in a row; and so on. What we do today, and how we think, are affected by past events. Our attitude, character, personality goad us towards certain bias in decision-making, and these factors are formed in us, bit by bit, layer by layer. Further, neuroscience has also shown that in the bulk of our decision-making, our subconscious brain already starts to move in the direction of the final decision before we are consciously aware of that final decision.Having set out the state of science and reason, Miles tears away at the Libertarian dependence on religion (God) for the basis of asserting free will. He argues, for example, that the Libertarian view that we have free will because we have the power to do otherwise than what we in fact do, implies that any conception that God is all-powerful, all-benevolent, and all-knowing, cannot be true. If we decide to do evil and God does not stop us, he either has no power, or is not willing, or he just cannot know the future.In the next two chapters, Miles then attacks the flaws in the diverse arguments of the compatibilist views of free will. Compatibilists can be religious or not, but they all accept that the universe is governed by deterministic laws, yet they believe that nonetheless, we still have free will. Naturally, there are many versions and theories as to how that might be possible. Miles attacks the strongest of these, including the views of Kant, Iwagen, Dennett, and Watson.Miles takes the view that belief in free will undermines our ability to empathise with the less fortunate. The conceit that holds us to the belief that we make good our lives also leads us to believe that poverty and misfortune is not attributable to luck but to our own design. The conceit of free will denies the existence of moral luck. Thus compatibilists spend a great deal of effort attempting to show how free will can overcome moral luck. Miles addresses all those arguments and explains why they are flawed and inadequate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LQTWDJJYBAE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1784621692#wasThisHelpful","R2LQTWDJJYBAE2","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These are questions that compels us to assess the difference between a thing of value and a valuable thing.

"Ronson interviews people who have been subject to the wrath of the anonymous 'people' that inhabit the internet. One of the more famous discussed was a well-known author. He was caught plagiarizing and re-cycling his own materials as well as creating false stories for his books. His career ended and he suffered greatly for it when he was exposed by a fellow journalist. The offending author tried to make a public apology but that made things worse and he endured a second round of mass attack on the internet. Others in the book included a woman who tweeted a sexist joke told behind her by one man to another. The woman was hounded out of job and city.The other reviewers are correct in warning readers about posting messages online without thinking through. But the importance of Ronson's book lies in its examination of crowd behaviour, especially of the anonymous variety, and the possibility of the inherent schadenfreude in us. It is just as important for us to measure our response to things written and posted in the internet. As Ronson says in his book, 'It's not them.

"Julian Baggini (`JG') begins by acknowledging that advances `in neuroscience has put wind into the sails of those who would deny free will' and elsewhere in the book he demolishes conventional (but outdated and flawed) arguments in favour of free will. Yet he asks, `So is the game really up for free will?' He does not think so.In his usual clarity JG has written an excellent book that explains the arguments in favour of free will and also the traditional arguments against them, taking into account the advancement in science (neuroscience and genetics especially) - scientists has shown that our body determines our action a fraction ahead of our thought, or, as JG puts it, `when we make some choices, the conscious self is the last to know'.But JG examines the gaps in science and by brilliantly excising the indefensible arguments of free will, he crafts a version of free will which he holds must exist. He says, for example, those who claim that we have the free will to believe in the existence of God demolish their own premise by holding the premise that God is omniscient. If He were, it means that He knows the future and what we would be doing. Nothing therefore is free because everything is determined before hand (otherwise God would not be omniscient).By taking into account our conscious self's ability to mould character, and thus determining, with our experience and rationality, that we have the option to do otherwise `in the future', we retain a freedom that is worthy of its name. His argument relies on autonomy and responsibility while accepting the things we cannot change. It is not that he has not taken into account the indelible marks of life-changing events, but he claims that we can act freely in spite of them.Has he re-defined free will as is generally understood or has he explained it in a way that no one else has? His theory does not, of course, prove that our beliefs are true, but that we can choose our beliefs freely. This will be an excellent companion to James Miles' recently published `The Free Will Delusion' (2015 Matador − which is an excellent companion to JG's book).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TXAFHNUZ3NHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TPVITVC#wasThisHelpful","R2TXAFHNUZ3NHH","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Stephens writes, and one supposes, believes, that America invaded Iraq 'to put on notice other would-be Saddams that, after 9/11, we had a low tolerance for flagrant challenges to global order', citing a speech by Hilary Clinton as authority. Stephens does not think that the Iraq war was itself a mistake, but 'the confusion of its aims...it wasn't the overreliance on force that led to near fiasco; it was the timid application of force in the face of an enemy that knew only the logic of force'.Stephens begins by reminding his readers of the birth of the Marshall Plan after the sunset of the British Empire, and from that year - 1947 - on, America became the world's policeman, a role, it seems to Stephens, that was destined to be filled by America - permanently. That is how he ends his book - by a hawkish call for America to 'again start deploying forces globally in large numbers'. He says that the government must understand that 'the world's policeman needs a global presence'. He is particularly indignant that America (Obama) has embraced a 'policy of nonjudgmentalism in a world that still looks to America as a beacon of freedom'.Stephens conducts an array of faults in America's competitors such as China, Russia, and India, and concludes that these countries are not as great as some (e.g. Thomas Friedman and Michael Mandelbaum) and gets excited by the fact that rich Russians are visiting America and Chinese are sending their children to American schools. Thus he concludes that 'Declinists will always be able to point to visible evidence of everything that's wrong with the United States as evidence that our best days are behind us. But America's future lies, as it always has, in things unseen and persons unknown'.This book will be loved by the hawks (Republican and Democrats) but everyone else will be astounded for varying reasons. Some by the uninhibited ambition and arrogance that cry for a pushy, bullying America; and others by the fear that America might take Stephens seriously.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TAM19AZ0CR98/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846625#wasThisHelpful","R1TAM19AZ0CR98","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holslag freely and quickly admits that the title of his book is alarmist but he explains that in spite of his doubts, he believes that are causes for concern and the chosen title seems to him to best serve those concerns. The author's misgivings about the rise of China as an economic and military power are based on fears that the rest of Asia will be adversely affected. He gives a valuable and fact-laden account of China's rise and the implications that this will have on China's Asian neighbours.Holslag has not given a convincing account as to why China's rise bodes ill for Asia, and in this context, the title may be read as some not only to be alarmist but also mischievous. That is only the title; the rest of Holslag's book is analytical and provocative although there are parts in which the reader might be unsure whether he is mixing short term with long term predictions. China today is not the communist nation it was, nor is America the same freedom-loving capitalist nation today that it was before. And as Holslag noted, 'China is seeking security through power and power to enhance its security'. It is hard to argue that these objectives are different from America's.The author makes it clear that he is not a China-basher or taking the position that the dangers ahead for Asia is to be blamed on China. The broad question one needs to be clear about is whether China is indeed a danger to Asia? This book, well written as it is, might distract the reader from the context of China's actions, for China's actions are complex because they are partly action and partly reaction. It has constantly to stay alert to the actions of America in Asia, and then respond to that. The ancillary question is therefore, would China behave differently without an American presence in Asia? This question itself will admit of very sharp debate. But it is an important question. If China becomes an economic and political model that Asia can aspire to, then the American quest for the 'containment' of communism weakens.From another viewpoint, should China be a model for the rest of Asia, then why not the world? Will America countenance China's circling Canada and Mexico to spread the virtues of its system? What seems to be lacking from Holslag's book are the principles that the world should accept as universal in that they apply to China as they would to America - or any other country (Is Putin listening?).","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K9GBBO7BB4S5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=074568825X#wasThisHelpful","R3K9GBBO7BB4S5","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is a compilation of personal essays by people of different faiths (and different versions of the same faith) as well as people who have no belief in any kind of supernatural being. The writers ask different questions and provide their own answers. Pam Houston asks, 'If there is a God, why would s(he) waste all her time making hell?' She concludes her story declaring her faith in a God (although she cannot tell if God is male or female).Barbara Graham discusses her faith in Mother Meera. Barbara Abercrombie searched for God and found him everywhere. Caroline Leavitt understands quantum physics describes how illness moved her to believe in a greater force out there although her belief in this force does not include a heaven or hell 'or a God with beard who judges'.Christine Kehl O'Hagan's faith is Catholicism and she tells how she sensed God after one of her sons died although she tried to 'lose her faith' for a brief period. Aviva Layton gives an account of death in her essay entitled, 'Poof!' She quotes Julian Barnes' writing that 'Death is just nature doing its stuff'. Jacquelyn Mitchard shares her views as to why she is a 'good, God-fearing atheist' and Malachy McCourt comes upfront telling us that her essay is 'an antireligion rant'.Perhaps Victoria Zackheim, the editor of the book, is telling the reader, 'Everyone has his own idea of God and death, and the universe - what's yours?'

It is true that it does not have nice photographs that some other books might have, but the information in this 198 page book is incredible because it seems comprehensive, and is also lucidly and humorously written.

Yes, you can read about the fascinating 'kopi luwak too - but it also tells you what real 's***ty' coffee is.Then there is a chapter on brewing, the types of brew - including why Europeans don't drink café latte (not 'latte' as non-Europeans might refer to them) after breakfast. The chapters on how coffee is roasted; how to select the right cup; and how to find a good coffee shop, are also very informative . There are clear descriptions of 'Chemex', French Press, Hario V60, and how the Japanese took over 'siphon' coffee from the Germans and made it famous.There is virtually nothing about coffee that cannot be found in this book, and one is left astounded how all that information can be found in such a small book (13cm x 19 cm or 5.5 in x 7 in).","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1E00N0KXGO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1440582122#wasThisHelpful","R3V1E00N0KXGO4","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One reviewer suggests, with all good intentions, that we should not compare this book with `The Da Vinci Code'. I think that it is only by comparing this with the latter that we can truly appreciate that this book, though based on the Catholic Church and its history, is different in all other aspects, and is also extremely well written. The suspense that runs throughout the book at every page is not released until the very last paragraph. The story concerns the intended exhibition of a lost gospel, but the curator, Ugolino, stumbles on a secret that sheds light on a controversial Christian relic - the Shroud of Turin. The secret that the last Gospel held will change one's understanding and perception of the Shroud but it also threatens the dream of the Pope (John Paul) in reuniting the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church. Then one night, a week before the opening of the exhibition, Ugolino was found dead in the grounds of the Vatican City, with a bullet through his head. Who killed Ugolino; and why was he killed? Caldwell weaves a thoroughly spell-binding intrigue with several suspects and twists and turns that ensures that the reader does not put the book down. Many fascinating questions arise in the plot. First, did the Shroud of Turin belong originally to the Eastern Orthodox Church or the Roman Catholic Church? Secondly, was the carbon-dating that revealed the Shroud to be a fake, accurate? Thirdly, if not a fake, does the Shroud carry a true image of Jesus the Christ? Fourthly, why are the four Gospels contradicting each other in so many material aspects, and why is the Gospel of John so distinct from the other three? Finally, given the background of the events since 33 C.E. had the writers of the Gospels taken liberty to rewrite some of the history regarding Jesus, or recorded parts of the narrative in error? Caldwell makes one think about each of these questions through a novel that is evidently well-researched.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JW8HPD65U1A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451694148#wasThisHelpful","R1JW8HPD65U1A","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 246-page book is clear, comprehensive, and yet concise. In short, it is a wonder as far as history books go. The authors set out the narrative of their account in the context of the fact that 'Vietnam emerged as a southern extension of the great civilization of China for 1,000 years, and then went on its own way for a millennium, evolving into a distinct, cultivated and powerful East-Southeast Asian hybrid whose human and technological resources eventually led to all its neighbours to the south'.After a thousand years of encountering its northern giant neighbour, the Vietnamese language 'is peppered with Chinese imports'. It's imperial court and Buddhist and Confucian roots are also clearly imports from China. These were accumulated gradually and peacefully, but the Ming invasion (described in chapter 7) sought to impose Chinese culture and methods by coercion. The 20-year Chinese incursion finally ended through the resistance and guile of their first modern nationalist hero - Le Loi.After the Ming Chinese, Vietnam continued to attract invaders - the Japanese, the French, and finally, the Americans - who intervened because they feared a Vietnam that might turn communist. The Americans did not realise that one should not mistake nationalism for communism. The Viet Minh fighting the French were mainly nationalists, as were the Vietcongs who fought the Americans.The most illuminating parts of this gripping historical account are found in the last two chapters which cover the war with the French and the continuing one with the Americans. This covered the period from 1954 to 1975. The rise of Vietnam as a 'Tiger' is covered explicitly and astonishingly in just a little over four pages after that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S4TZQRTJTGE7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780233647#wasThisHelpful","R3S4TZQRTJTGE7","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There is no doubt that one would learn many things from this book if one were interested in the literary world. Sterling Lord is full of experience and has been extremely successful. His book tells stories about the pitfalls of writing and publishing, and the arbitrariness of success and failure. The small problem I found with this book is that it is too obvious that Lord is glorifying himself a little too much. If one does not mind that, an extra star can be added for the book. Although the book is successful because of the interesting people it covers (Kerouac, Breslin, J B West, David Wise, et al), Lord could have made it more charming if he places himself a little more subtly and less 'in your face'.The stories behind the people are also fascinating. The one I like best is about the tussle between the authors, publisher (Random House) and, of course, Sterling Lord on the one side and the CIA on the other, over the publication and sale of the book, 'The Invisible Government'.

"This 145 page book is about a complex subject -- the universe and our place in it. It is lucid, rational, and persuasively written; a small book on a vast subject which is best enjoyed by the reader personally. In brief, Alan Lightman tells us that the current scientific view which he, as a scientist, is inclined to agree, is that our universe is the result of a random coincidence of forces and events (his first chapter explains this). He also says that current scientific opinion inclines towards the existence of not just our universe but many others. Some may similarly have randomly created conditions that lead to life. However, he accepts that these are based on scientific theories and calculations that are rational, and irrefutable for the time being, there is no way we can prove that there is life anywhere else.Lightman is a self-confessed atheist although reading his thoughts in this book, one might be forgiven for thinking him to be a Buddhist. He certainly does not believe in the existence of any gods, and he does not believe in any life after death. He believes that we, like every living thing, grows in the time available to us in the space we are in, and gradually, we wither and are gone - like everything else that  once lived but are now dead - the one billion people who were alive in the year 1800, for example.Lightman agrees with the views of Richard Dawkins so far as biology, evolution and atheism are concerned. But he dislikes Dawkins' attitude. Lightman is amenable to people who wish to believe in a personal god or gods. He believes that the scientific people (not science) can live with religious people (not religion). He clearly does not think that science and religion are compatible, but scientists and religious people can be.It seems, therefore, such a brilliant piece of work will probably attract criticism from Dawkins and extremist religious people.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PILXMNUGHRW4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034580595X#wasThisHelpful","R3PILXMNUGHRW4","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Reading a book in which 50 writers write more or less a page each on the subject of windows is a temptation difficult to resist. The reader will long marvel at the imagination of those writers, the clarity of their writing, and the discipline and craft in displaying in words what went on in their minds. Why does one look out a window? To Orhan Pamuk, it is a way of 'checking to see that the world is always there, always interesting, and always a challenge to write about: an assurance that a writer needs to continue to write and a reader needs to continue to read'.One may not necessarily see different things when one looks out the window, nor does it matter that nothing changes outside. Karl Ove Knausgaard (Norwegian writer, author of 'My Struggle') says: 'I love repetition. I love doing the same thing and at the same time, and in the same place, day in and day out. I love it because something happens in repetition: sooner or later, the heap of the sameness, accumulated through all the identical days, starts to glide. That's when the writing begins. The view from my window is a constant reminder of this slow and invisible process.'To some, like Lauri Kubuitsile, it is relaxing to watch the birds as they search for the right word; to others, like Elmor Leonard, it is to clear the mind of unnecessary words. It is amazing what looking through the window can inspire. The next time the reader looks through a window, the view will most certainly have changed. Some may be amazed that there is a view at all.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRM9GD37MO84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159420554X#wasThisHelpful","RKRM9GD37MO84","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thailand is a deeply divided country and neither faction is likely to hold Andrew MacGregor Marshall's book in high regard. As often the case, history and politics have as many perspectives of truth as there are claimants of truth. A previous reviewer posted the review of Giles Ji Ungpakorn, who had claims that Marshall's book is misnamed because it has no relevance to Thailand's struggle for democracy. That is something the reader can figure out for himself. Ungpakorn, a British-Thai writer once in trouble himself for offending the Thai king, also claims that Marshall is a writer 'from the elite-gazing school' who has no interest in the mass movement. However, the focus of this book is clearly on the problems at the top, and even then, it is unfair to claim that the author has no interest in the mass movements.From the neutral reader's point of view, this book presents a clear and interesting account of the modern political history of Thailand. It is an account that connects the politics of the political parties, the military, and the royalty in the narrative. It may have some accounts that might understandably appear 'tabloid-like' (as some reviewers think). One example is the author's account that King Bhumibol became king only because the truth about his brother Ananda's death was concealed from the public. Ananda was the anointed successor to the throne but on 9 June 1946, he was found dead with a bullet wound through his head. Marshall's theory that it was Bhumibol who fired the gun may sound plausible but his only source of authentication was an article written by the author himself.The author constantly reminds the reader that King Bhumibol's death is imminent, and that in the current state of affairs, Prince Vajiralongkorn is likely to succeed to the throne; but he warns that Thai politics with its history of volatility, and the fact that the anointed successor often did not succeed, the heir is not apparent. However, it is clear from the book that whoever succeeds King Bhumibol is likely to be influential in the governing of the country.This book was published by Zed Books under its 'Asian Arguments' series which has many publications on Asian countries tending to cover perspectives that contain material that are controversial. Marshall's book on Thailand may not have the full truth (or it may) but it is a very accessible and interesting book that provides a good (if not the full) measure of the country's political problems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD1Y4SDEZLWI7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783600578#wasThisHelpful","RD1Y4SDEZLWI7","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Investment banking and investment bankers are the darlings of modern banking industry. Ian Fraser reveals in this enthralling book that there is nothing really to envy - the men at the top of the banking business do not understand investment banking; at least, not the dangers that come with poor risk management. Unfortunately, poor risk management comes with greed and ignorance. So when the bubbles are forming everyone enjoys a super high income and status. But bubbles inevitably burst.This book focuses on the way the three men who run the Royal Bank of Scotland ('the Bank') as its CEO in succession - Fred Goodwin, Stephen Hester, and Ross McEwan. The bulk of the story concerns Goodwin who was the principal villain; a megalomaniac who spends the Bank's money to satisfy his personal idiosyncrasy. He bullies his subordinates and hides crucial truth from the investors and regulators - that the Bank was not dabbling in subprime mortgages when it was steeped in it.Goodwin's craving for acquisitions and the men (like Larry Fish) who helped him acquire them for the Bank made no proper due diligence of the banks that they gobbled up for the Bank on both sides of the Atlantic. Essentially, they 'overpaid for rubbish'. The board was kept in the dark in many things that Goodwin did. The result was that there were no internal checks on the way he ran the Bank. Could this really happen to a major bank? The answer is clearly yes. The details in this book sound too horrendous to be true, but in the end, all eyes were opened when the bubble burst.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3120NY6WK3ZRY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780271387#wasThisHelpful","R3120NY6WK3ZRY","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the smallest book on my shelf of whisky books but it contains all the important information that every whisky drinker should know. The value of this book is enhanced by Greene's clear and jolly style of writing, and the book size is small enough (223 pages in quarto size). The differences between single malt and single grain; single malt and single malt scotch; blended and unblended whisky are clearly explained. The reader will find out what bourbon is and why Jack Daniel is a special kind of bourbon (using Lincoln County process).She also explains the distillation process and the importance of water during and after distillation (some distillers do not add spring water during distillation - hence their whisky have higher alcohol content). She surveys whisky made from the main whisky countries including Scotland, Ireland, United States, Japan, and India, carefully and clearly explaining the different approaches in the process and thus the different flavours they produce.There is a chapter with suggestions on how to build a whisky bar at home. This is useful to the novice whisky drinker. A previous distiller takes issue with a couple of her suggestions from Noah's Mill and Rowan's Creek on the ground that she wrongly classified them as 'grain to bottle distillers). She did, but she also mentioned that these distillers produce different kinds of whisky. She was probably referring to the small batch whisky (explained elsewhere in the book) here.There are also chapters on whisky glassware, as well as whisky cocktails. Importantly nowadays when more people are drinking whisky with their food, Greene has a whisky and food pairing section. And, of course, the common question about ice and whisky is has not been left out. If there is just one book that one will have in the home, Greene's will probably be the popular choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HWOL9JWGEFBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670016802#wasThisHelpful","R3HWOL9JWGEFBZ","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, we consider people at the terminal stage of life only when we have close friends or relatives who are in that situation or when we find ourselves at death's door. Thus, until then, we rarely think about our mortality seriously enough to feel capable of handling it when we or our loved ones are nearing the end of life.In this lucid book, Atul Gawande takes us to a close and personal view of several people close to him, including his wife's grandmother, Alice Hobson, and his own father, who is also a surgeon like Atul himself. We are introduced to them when they were already at an age many of us consider 'old', but they were still young in spirit and in flesh - vibrant and independent. Gradually, Atul describes the effect of advancing years on them, how for example, Alice began to fall frequently, how his father began to feel numbness in his fingers, and then we see them no longer physically strong, but frail and weak, and realise how age and illness are such devastating twin catastrophe we will face in a matter of time.Atul shows us why it is that old people resist going to nursing homes. He shows us the dilemma that family members experience when they try to let the obviously old and weak family members live the independent lives they want, and yet have the safety and attention they obviously need. Decisions as to where to house them are difficult enough, but as the author shows, there are even more difficult decisions to be made when a terminal illness is diagnosed. Do they go for treatment, and if so, which type of treatment- and bear with their debilitating after-effects - or do they forgo treatment altogether?In the course of taking us through the end of life of these people, Atul also takes us through a grand tour of the hospital, the nursing home, the hospice, and other alternative facilities for the terminally ill. More importantly, he makes us examine what it is that we understand to be the meaning of life because when we are nearing the end of it, we all have our personal reasons to fight for the extra year or two, or to gracefully accept the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JD1OHRE87D1Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1781253943#wasThisHelpful","R3JD1OHRE87D1Z","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Geoff Dyer shows us that the contest between China and America is reflected in several areas, from the military to the economy. But it is crucial to understand what exactly drives the contest. The motivations are clearly different. America has been the Rome of modern times and it seeks to maintain that status. China, on the other hand, has never been an imperial power like America and yet finds itself today doing many of the things that define American imperialism. It believes in non-interventionism. As Dyer says, 'The irony is that, from Beijing's point of view, the U.S. is the radical, revolutionary power trying to change the rules of the game...From Sudan to Zimbabwe, China believes it is defending a status quo the West once established but now wants to tear up.'It is therefore equally important how America perceives China as a rival, but in order to understand fully what kind of rival China is, America must understand China's perspectives. Again, Dyer makes the point: 'If the feeling takes root in the U.S. that China is presenting a worldview that will be attractive to large parts of the world, this will add real political edge to the competition. The temptation will grow in the U.S. to elevate the rivalry to a form of ideological contest, with echoes of the Cold War.'A discussion about a contest necessarily requires a discussion of the contestants. The focus of this book is on China, which the author sees as the growing giant, and America is discussed as if it were only the foil. Reading this impressive work at the superficial level may create the wrong impression, not only of China or America, but of both.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JQMYHG2QF7WQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307951235#wasThisHelpful","R3JQMYHG2QF7WQ","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the author says, 'Essentialism is not a way of doing one more thing; it is a different way of doing everything'. Many of us are 'majors in minor things', that is, we do too many things, most of which are non-essential. Given that we have limited time, the habit of doing unnecessary things affect the quality of the things we really need to do. That is the essence of essentialism - precision. Doing what needs to be done and no more.McKeown rehashes many of the ideas that R Covey has advocated in his 'Seven Habits of Highly Effective People', but he has done it in a very efficient way, and the success of his effort lies in the fact that the reader can finish his book in one evening and feeling refreshed with bright ideas and the inspiration to put them into practice right away.One of his points is that we should learn to say 'no' to projects that we have no inclination or use for. We must appreciate the fact that we have a choice, and the exercise of that choice in saying 'no' is crucial. When too many things impinge on our time and energy, something has to give. We must appreciate that. In this regard, he tells us that it is important to understand trade-offs. If we commit to something, we might have to give up something else. Choose which has the priority. It is as simple as that.Another useful habit is to learn to focus on only one thing at a time. That, as is now well-known but not fully understood, is not the same as multi-tasking. We can multi-task by, say, washing the dishes and listening to music. But we cannot multi-focus. We must therefore learn to eliminate the things that are trivial. Warren Buffet, McKeown reminds us, made his fortune on 10 big investments - not hundreds.How do we begin? McKeown suggests that we can start by eliminating and cutting losses. Discard things that are losing propositions, things we accumulate that are cluttering our lives. We must have the courage to cut losses. Be realistic and build buffers, he tells us, so that we do not underestimate the time we need to get a thing done.Finally, it is important to be decisive. We must be clear as to what the issue is before us, constantly asking what it is that we need to do and whether we need to do it. If the answer is not clearly yes, then, he says, it is clearly no.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16A5G7QAF6O2K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804137382#wasThisHelpful","R16A5G7QAF6O2K","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Publishers and editors are the invisible people in the book industry. Most readers do not think about the work of the editor, many do not know much about the publisher, and often the only comment might be, 'I rarely come across this publisher'. In this book, Juan Cruz Luiz introduces us to some of the most fascinating and captivating men and women in the publishing and editorial world.The range of topics discussed about the book industry is as diverse as the personalities that come through in the conversations. They speak freely and sincerely not only about their suspicion of e-books and Amazon, but also about their confidence in the published book. No matter their age -- Robert Silvers is 84 years old but he speaks with the enthusiasm of a much younger man.Through these conversations, one readily discerns the common bond of good editors and publishers. They are fiercely independent, fearless in the face of public opinion, thus, necessarily stubborn; but they get by with a sense of humour and a sense of destiny. The conversations in this book are with old school editors and publishers. These are people who have shown a marvellous intuition as to what is fine writing. They have the learning and wisdom to introduce good authors to their readers. In short, they are not publishers of books the public likes to read -- they bring to the public what the public should read.There are two other gems about this book. First, there is a list of the ten favourite books from each of the publishers' personal library. Secondly, the book is of an extremely good quality with a lovely and mesmerizing hard cover. The names of the people on that cover are the names of the voices within.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KNPC8KK37MCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8493949817#wasThisHelpful","R3KNPC8KK37MCN","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are several perspectives in the study of religious beliefs. One is to examine why we should believe in gods, or a God. Another is to examine why we should not believe. In this book, Columbia University's John Dewey Professor of Philosophy examines what religious people think they will lose if they were to exchange faith for secularism. The two main issues are: first, the claim that we would lose our values, our sense of morals - the `without God anything is permissible' argument; second, that without God our lives would be meaningless. There is a reason for this approach. Kitcher is promoting the case for secular humanism which he says begins with doubt. But one must move on from there so that it can be properly understood and lived as a rewarding way of life. Religions are founded on doctrinal statements that are accepted by the devout, and if we take those doctrines away, we find a void that may have to be filled. Secular humanism does that, and Kitcher provides a clearly written and well-reasoned case for this. Every page of this 159-page book is illuminating. Kitcher deals with the religious preoccupation with the transcendent life and makes an irrefutable argument against that belief. However, he knows that for the believers, no amount of rational argument would persuade them to abandon the idea that after this finite life, there is a better, infinite one. His gently leads the reader to look at the end of this finite life from different perspectives and thus allay fears of death and what comes thereafter. Does it bother us what had been going on 100 years before we were born? Probably not. Many of us do not even know our great-grandparents to have any special bond with them. Would the affairs of the world 100 years after we die bother us? Again probably not. Kitcher rightly points out that what bothers us about death is that we leave behind friends and family, and projects we want to complete. It bothers us that we cannot meet our tennis friends for the weekly hit, or the coffee after that. It bothers us that we would leave behind an unfinished book. `Absence from the period just after my death is poignant because so much of the stuff of my life will be continued in it. Whenever I die, people about whom I care most deeply will live on, and I should like to be there, sustaining them and being sustained by them.' But once we come to terms with that, we can come to terms with this finite life. Kitcher points the way to looking `forward to a future, to a world without you...where you will no longer be part of the show.' Kitcher shows not only that there is a firm, rational way to morality and ethics through the path of secular humanism, he also shows the contradictions and inconsistencies of establishing ethical beliefs from a religious base. Naturally, everyone who believes in God believes his God is the true God and that God wants us to live life according to his doctrines. The trouble is that that God cannot make himself universally clear and consistent. It is with the issue of the meaning of life that Kitcher is at his best. He weaves that subject seamlessly into the issue of our finite life, our living ethically without God, and shows what we need to do when our lives go awry - we `should be committed to salvage, not salvation'. He shows us that, ironically, it is the immortal life that is meaningless. It reminds us of what Seneca once said, `In hope of tomorrow, we forfeit today.' Kitcher's book is best read with Samuel Scheffler's `Death & the Afterlife', 2014 Oxford University Press.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMTMKP6UMKX5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0300203438#wasThisHelpful","RTMTMKP6UMKX5","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The size, cover, and format of this book indicate that the publisher intended this book to be a companion to the previously published 'Letters of Note'. I give that book a higher rating strictly because the content of that book is of greater interest to more people (I think). There many general readers of biography who would be keenly interested in letters written by and to their biographical subjects. But only specialist biographical scholars would be interested in random lists made by the subject characters.Lists featured in this book include those made by Marilyn Monroe, Susan Sontag, Sylvia Plath, Christopher Hitchens, Rudyard Kipling, Thelonious Monk (jazz pianist), Walt Whitman, Leonardo da Vinci, and Queen Elizabeth II, and many others.The contents of the lists printed are naturally varied and some are interesting - such as the one from a Mafia member which contains, 'Do not be seen with cops'. The page containing Peter Roget's initial draft Roget's Thesaurus is entitled 'Existence' and written in his own hand with a rudimentary list of various words such as 'reality', reference', and 'relation'. Harry Truman's list seems to be short descriptions of how his year has been - for example, '1920: One happy year; 1921: Going very well'. Scott Fitzgerald has a list of tenses with amusing examples.It is a fine coffee table book but that is about all.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DMC05SCAEJ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782114521#wasThisHelpful","R24DMC05SCAEJ9","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If we were to have a community of people who do not lie and do not fight, would that not be the epitome of a civilised society? But such a community does exist and is living in the heart of the Amazon jungle. They are the Zo'é. They live naked, incapable of telling lies and do not tell lies; they do not know about fighting and do not fight. They settle disagreements by facing their opponents and putting forward their respective arguments one by one until they reach an amicable conclusion. Salgado visited this tribe in 2009 and documented their life and personalities with his camera. Sebastiao Salgado is a photographer of outstanding skills. Like the legendary Henri Cartiér-Bresson, his photographs are at once enigmatic and also full of meaning that the viewer can mull over and over again. Some of those are found sprinkled across this book. But this book is an autobiographical account of his life and work, not a coffee-table book of lovely photographs alone. Salgado was born in 1944 in Brazil. He developed a love for photography and living with people and observing communities. This book not only traces his childhood in Brazil to his present abode in France, but also the development of his affinity with humans, society, and our relationship with animals and the land. We can see how his observations led him to form the kind of ideological and political views, his unconcealed disdain for the consumerism of modern cites and the economic greed that festers in such places. The nature of this human is best expressed in his own words (from p.106 -107): `I saw so much suffering, hatred and violence in the course of my reportages for ""Migrations"", that I emerged extremely shaken. But I have no regrets...Photographers are there to act as mirrors, just like journalists. So don't talk to me about voyeurism! The voyeurs are the politicians who stood idly by and the military who facilitated the repression [in Rwanda]...I have always tried to show people in all their dignity. In the majority of cases, they are the victims of cruelty, of events. They are photographed at a time in which they have lost their homes, seen their loved ones murdered, sometimes even their own children. For the most part they are innocent people who do not deserve the misfortunes that have struck them. I took these photos because I thought everyone needed to know. That is my opinion, but I do not force anyone to look at them. I am not here to lecture or set my conscience at rest by rousing feelings of compassion. I took these images because I had a moral, ethical obligation to do so. In such moments of suffering, you may ask, what are morals, what are ethics? It is when I am faced with someone who is dying and I have to decide whether or not to release the shutter of the camera.'","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233W80NQZOXR8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=8869655377#wasThisHelpful","R233W80NQZOXR8","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is partly a collection of the witticism of famous people such as Oscar Wilde, Mae West, Ogden Nash, and Christopher Hitchens. It is also partly a long essay on what wit is and is not. The chapters are arranged according to specific topics such as 'refreshments' (lots of comments on alcohol and drinkers here), 'romance', righteousness', and 'compassion'. The subtitle, 'Mastering the Art of Being Interesting' may mislead because this is not a 'how-to' book, and thankfully, it is not.It is an enjoyable book for a lazy Sunday, but the author's own attempts at witticism is only mildly amusing. For example, he writes (about Oscar Wilde): 'To return to the famous measure of overconfidence, Oscar Wilde would surely be a better-than-average driver, even if the automobile wasn't invented until he was in his thirties.' Some may say in the author's defence, that that is perhaps what wit should be, mild and pleasant without being over-powering.

"`A society is made up of individuals who strive to mould it into the ideal society' - is this statement right? Roberts thinks that it was right but the modern society is driven by a vast market economy that promotes immediate gratification, and technology that enables the market to manipulate the individual. The result is that the individual is being moulded to see himself (and not his society) as the centre of the universe.The market-driven economy goes for immediate rewards and quick fixes. It is addicted to constant growth that is measured by higher figures and greater numbers. Quality and values are suffocated by quantity and size. Innovations once seen as the means to improve the productivity of the worker is now used to improve the productivity of capital. Roberts blames the widening income gap to the twin evils - market economy and technology. We must not forget Adam Smith's warning: 'No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable'.The danger, as Roberts adds, is that this trend kills the concept of the commonwealth 'because it is no longer a wealth to be shared'. Instead of being members of a society, we become competitors against each other.There is a slew of books that touches on similar ideas and subjects - society, the individual, and technology. Nick Harkaway's 'The Blind Giant', and Paul Verhaeghe's 'What about Me?', as well as Susan Greenfield's 'Mind Change' will complement Roberts' book very well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27MQV83J3XYY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608198146#wasThisHelpful","R27MQV83J3XYY7","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you feel that you need an up-to-date version of 'The Complete Plain Words' (by Ernest Gowers), or have enjoyed 'The Elements of Style' (by White & Strunk) so much that you wish that there is a longer version of it, then Pinker's 'The Sense of Style' is what you are looking for. Chapter Four: `The Web, the Tree, and the String' may be the most important and useful chapter in this book because it teaches syntax, without which grammar becomes a wild horse. This chapter is technical and needs careful reading. My favourite chapter is chapter 6: `Telling Right from Wrong'. In this chapter Pinker takes a swipe at purists and pedants for misleading the reader and writer - 'in their zeal to purify usage and safeguard the language, they have made it difficult to think clearly about felicity in expression and have muddied the task of explaining the art of writing.'

"Aaron Klein sets out the chronology of events, and subsequently disclosed information, and raises some very pointed questions that discredits the official position. First, Stevens was killed in a building known as the CIA Annex. That was a building next to the main building which most people assumed to be 'the US Consulate'. Klein points out that there is only one official American consulate and that is in Tripoli. Under UN convention, no country can establish any facility without the host country's approval. The CIA annex was so top-secret that its existence was not known to the senior US administration. That means no one at that level was able to assess the security arrangements.The security provided for that facility is remarkable if we accept the information in this book. There were few trained guards. There were no watch towers in the compound. The main security was outsourced to a private security company. The outer compound was guarded by unarmed local guards. The inner compound was guarded by members of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, with known connections to Al-Qaeda. Klein asks, what justified this bizarre security arrangement? More crucially, what was going on in this compound? Klein alludes to secret dealings by the CIA in using the facility to trade in arms including ""MANPADS"" (Man-portable air-defense systems). Were the arms going to the rebels in Syria? The US had already destabilised Libya by bringing down the secular government of Gaddafi. Is it attempting the same in Syria?","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CXQRJ6A5SUH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1936488868#wasThisHelpful","R1CXQRJ6A5SUH0","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The coming generations of students face a twin danger. First, digital technology is altering the way they think even without them knowing it (See Susan Greenfield's 'Mind Change', Rider Books 2014). Secondly, they go to school and university/college not realising that the system of education has changed from the time of their grandparents and parents, from one of education to one of amassing credentials and resumes. They are taught, insidiously, not to take risks but to do what everyone else is doing and the  difference is that they have to try and do it better than everyone else.Deresiewicz sees the downward spiral that this kind of system causes to one's creative mind. He traces the history of the change and identifies the issues that need to be addressed before the education system can once again turn students from excellent sheep to human beings.

"The Twitter generation has no patience to read `War and Peace'. In short, people have shorter time span for long memos, long speeches, long meetings etc. Hold on, there are different matters that must not be confused for each other. Impatience and attention deficit disorder are problems that require solutions. In this regard, readers might find Michael Harris' book, 'The End of Absence', a useful follow-up to this one by McCormack. Brevity in our action and work is not the true solution here. Brevity is a virtue promoted by McCormack in this book because being brief makes us more effective people at work. It helps us more socially adept because brevity promotes clarity.After addressing (briefly) the importance and usefulness of being brief, McCormack provides some useful methods that help create a discipline for brevity. He explains that there is no need to panic over the 140-character squeeze imposed by Twitter because 'the ideal level of engagement is even lower'. Describing the sins of long and useless (tautology?)  meetings, McCormack suggests ways to overcome this time-consuming activity that will help the reader acquire a decisiveness in knowing when and where to be brief.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NKKWH1QE00TX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118704967#wasThisHelpful","R2NKKWH1QE00TX","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To some, this book may seem like making a great deal of noise over the virtues of silence. Although this book might have been more effective if it had been edited down to an essay, there may be something in the patience required to gradually absorb the details and anecdotes Prochnik expresses in his book.The plot, so to speak, is simple - the world is growing noisier and we are being distracted and rendered less effective by the constant noise all around us throughout the day. He points to research that indicates that unnecessary background noise affects the young in their effort to learn language. This failure to learn the language effectively is one of the causes of increasing numbers of autistic children in modern times.Physical soundproofing is getting more effective (and more expensive) but we can learn, less expensively, to block noise, and maintain a healthy diet of sound each day. Prochnik recommends that we learn to experience the quiet of the Zen garden and the Japanese tea ceremony which require silence and thereby, help one to appreciate the value of noiseless thinking.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21OXIIQCN4SF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0767931211#wasThisHelpful","R21OXIIQCN4SF1","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As one reads through this book, he is likely to forget whatever label he might have stuck on others or on himself. This book was written with a force of persuasion through the indignities inflicted by man on each other ('man' here includes women - both as oppressor and victim). Cohen tells the story of Hirsi Ali and her long journey from childhood to adulthood in Somalia and Europe, finding deep prejudice against her for her gender and her religion. The same goes with the story of one of India's most talented artists, Maqbool Fida Husain, who at age 94, finally renounced his citizenship because Hindu politicians made use of his art and his name to create political opportunities for themselves.Cohen wonders how British law courts would ignore John Stuart Mill's declaration that no one had a right to restrain another except to prevent harm, and blithely rule against defendants who were said to have defamed another even though no harm was proved by the defamation.This book provides numerous instances in which humans oppress others for no justifiable cause.

"This is a clear and comforting explanation of a vast and formidable subject to the layman. Reading it one has a better understanding why it is easier to simply believe that some supernatural being created everything and controls all the seemingly  inexplicable phenomena that occur in the universe. Stenger's book is not merely about cosmology, but also history, physics, philosophy, and religion.Although it is more up-to-date than Simon Singh's 'Big Bang', published in 2005, the latter has a more exciting and entertaining account of the chronological development in physics and cosmology than Stenger's drier account. However, Stenger has the advantage of explaining the two greatest discoveries in this area - the Higgs bosun, and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the study of radioactive waves indicating what were left over from the 'Big Bang'.Stenger explains individual topics briefly and simply - topics that include, 'the arrow of time', 'Black Holes', 'Quasars', and 'the relativity of time and space'. His last couple of chapters deal with the question 'Why there is something rather than nothing', and 'The God Hypotheses'. If the author or his publisher is reading this review he might wish to note the word 'by' instead of 'but' was used in the first line of the third para at page 375.

"This is an interesting book because Maisel is trying to merge Zen and psychology. You need to understand some psychology and Zen to appreciate what Maisel is trying to do. The problem here is that he has not expressed his ideas more clearly and as a result, we see the comments from some reviewers Amazon US saying that he has identified the problem but has no solution. Another attacked him for a being an atheist bigot.In this book, Maisel's points are as follows: We can deal with unhappiness by thinking more deeply and critically about the things that we value, asking if we truly value those things, and whether we can bring ourselves to do without them. Secondly, thinking is a rational activity but it is not only our rational selves that determine our happiness. Our emotional selves have a big say. We need to adjust our thinking and our feelings so that they harmonise with each other - enter, Zen. The clue is to divest ourselves of the perceived need to find meaning in everything. Some things will always remain a mystery, but we must think critically as to what truly is a mystery and what is simply false.Those who understand this book will already be living a happy life. Maisel needs to revise this book to help those who struggle to follow his ideas. His reference to 'smart' people might have contributed to some misunderstanding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5M1Y2SO7E6BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1573246263#wasThisHelpful","R5M1Y2SO7E6BO","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an amazingly fascinating 'bio-criticism' - a combination of biography and literary criticism. It is topped by the fact that the author of this bio-criticism was the long-time translator of Haruki's books, Jay Rubin. The life of Haruki is told and at each juncture, relevant portions from Haruki's novels are brought up to show the relationship between fact and fiction in Haruki's life and work. They are so intertwined that only one who knows both subjects as well as Rubin could have pulled it off. Rubin also shows us how Haruki's love for music and the evocation of nostalgia are revealed in recurring themes in Haruki's books.We are also enlightened by the choice of words Haruki made (in Japanese) and the relevance of his use of 'boku' for 'I' as the narrator. It is not the conventional 'watashi wa'. These are important illuminations which are not apparent in the translated novels. It makes one desire to immediately re-read all the Haruki novels that one had enjoyed through Rubin's translations, knowing that there are gems yet to be discovered.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M353Y91ATDSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099455447#wasThisHelpful","R1M353Y91ATDSG","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an in-depth exploration of the psyche of the punisher in America. This fascinating book about punishment is not about the competing theories of why we punish or how we should punish. It is about why the urge to punish - and punish so severely. It examines all the institutions that have a role in the punishment regime - from the legislature to the police, the prosecutor, the court, and the prison guard. Ferguson studies the people in these institutions to help the reader understand why the American culture for punishment is so strong, and what can be done so that the punishment of offenders will be fairer and more just.Ferguson forces the reader to think about the punishment meted out to offenders more deeply. When the prison guard takes the criminal away after the court has handed down the sentence, the punishment begins for that criminal. But to the rest of the society, that is the end of the story. Do we know what happens after sentence is passed? That is the compelling question that Ferguson tries to answer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36M93VZ1IBYRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674728688#wasThisHelpful","R36M93VZ1IBYRO","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a book for egomaniacs. It is the opposite - it glorifies those who work hard and stay out of the limelight. It is about a breed of professionals like structural engineer Dennis Poon, a specialist in designing the structural strength of super-high buildings. Most people do not know him whereas they might know the architect. Another example is David Apel who creates fragrances for the big name fragrance houses.The idea of this book is not just to contrast the two conflicting personality styles, but also to show which the author David Zweig, thinks is the more admirable. He believes that modern culture inclines towards self-promotion and almost everything we do must have a self-promotional angle to them; but this is what reduces the value and quality of what we do.This is a book in praise of humility and conscientiousness - qualities of professionals.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R344HGJ8HEZT30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159184634X#wasThisHelpful","R344HGJ8HEZT30","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A young Japanese boy, Seido,was sent to a Buddhist temple to be trained as a priest. Neither he nor his older brother knew why he was chosen from among the four children in their family. When Seido was in the temple, his family perished in a fire. As a grown man and schooled in Buddhism, Seido was sent to build a temple in Brooklyn. Learning to adapt to Western culture and falling in love with a woman, Seido learnt the meaning of Buddhism in its fullest sense. He also understood a long forgotten event which shed light on the question why he and not his sibling was chosen for priesthood.This book is at times humourous and amusing, but for the most part it is a tract on the difficult questions of life and the Buddhist way of dealing with them. It deals with the problems ignorance can bring, but knowledge is not necessarily a boon unless one knows how to handle it.If you enjoy this book, you might also enjoy his first novel, 'The Hundred-foot Journey', now a motion picture, starring Helen Mirren.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ0SVYWVR7ZER/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451669232#wasThisHelpful","RJ0SVYWVR7ZER","A179RWZZ4611EB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A179RWZZ4611EB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My chief complaint about the SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop is that it begs to be used.  I work in a dining room which is only a dining room by name, it became the office (for all but a couple days of the year) shortly after moving into this house.  Because it still has some of the trappings of a dining room (glasses, china, bottles, things in frames), it's probably not the BEST place to be shooting mini hoops while working.  Er, after working.  So then there's the family room, with the obligatory big flat screen, the game system, home theater components (and the dogs who desperately want to catch and run with the ball).  Also not the best place.  The bedroom, well, not the best place either, I'll grudgingly accept.The point is that this is a fun and well-designed hoop set.  The chain net not only looks good, but is somehow more satisfying while also doing a much better job of giving the ball a straight drop down (important with obstacles and hazards like german shepherds).  I've had a little bit of trouble keeping air in the ball from one day to the next, but, ah, that could be my fault (see the bit about the enthusiastic dogs).This would make an outstanding gift for a kid (or an adult kid) who likes to put the ball through the hoop here and there.  Looks good, easy to set up, and will slip right over any common door for placement  The rim is on springs, so even rough play will allow a satisfying give without marring the door.  Great toy.  Just need to find the best place to put it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE32WB479PDUR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008X3BMKS#wasThisHelpful","RE32WB479PDUR","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a lot I can and will probably say about this woofer.  But I want to make one point cleanly.  I had a very expensive subwoofer die many years ago.  It was wonderful.  12"" box, intensely powerful without losing clarity and control, highly attractive, and you could push it as far as you might reasonably (or even unreasonably) desire without it turning on you.  When it died, I simply couldn't justify replacing it, and even repairing it was going to cost more than twice the cost of reasonably priced options.  The SB-900-BLK comes surprisingly close to the performance of that old, dead woofer, at what amounts to a bit more than a quarter of the price.  It could well be that time and technology has caught up -- but I've gone through a number of models with lower (in this range) price points that just made too many sacrifices.  There were the big huge woofers that had great sound.  There were the small ones that didn't.  Here, finally, is a discreet unit with room shaking clean bass, at a price that (given the footprint and performance) elicits frequent 'wows' from those who hear it.Easy to set up.  Clean and clear controls on the back.  Creates a strong stage from a lot of different locations.  To my surprise I've got mine nestled in between a secondary component rack and a small computer stand, facing out laterally into the room with a wall shortly behind it.  Despite this very odd and less-than-ideal placement, when things should rumble during a big part of a movie, or shake lightly during a meaty part of a song, they do so cleanly throughout.  It's had near daily use at my home for quite a few months now, and it sounds as good today as it did when I first took it out of the box.  Within a week I had retired my old (oversized) woofer to the basement, where it has lived ever since.  I pair the SB-900-BLK with a 5-point Martin-Logan speaker set powered by an older but still capable Denon AVR, and I'm getting far better HT and music sound than I probably deserve given the age of some of the parts.Very happy, absolutely worth checking out if you're in the market for a (or a pair of!) subwoofers for your setup.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R63B4WQNJFCI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CUC8BW#wasThisHelpful","R63B4WQNJFCI9","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've really struggled trying to write this review in my head.  Not so much in relaying how I feel about this tool set, but more in terms of tying it all together into a cohesive message.  I think (based on how I've chosen to start writing this) that I'm just going to set aside any attempt at cohesiveness and just simply explain what I like and what I don't.Let's start with the don't, because (for my own use and style -- and that's a key qualifier) it's the don't that will keep me from putting these somewhere in my kitchen where I will use them frequently.  My biggest issue is the thickness and, for lack of a better word, clumsiness of the instruments themselves.  Not so much along the shafts which are thick and comfortable to hold, but in the functional ends.  The flat edged paddle scraper, for example, lacks the sort of precision in use that would come from something that was worked down to half its given thickness.  The spoon -- all I can say there is that I can't imagine a single kitchen use for that instrument beyond tossing a salad, or perhaps being turned into a ""let's bang on things"" toy that would be a fulfilling delight for a kid, and a nightmare for a parent.  Again, it's about the thickness of the tool, the big slow rounded edges, and how this speaks to a loss of practical value in the actual cooking process.  The silicone scraper is great, the highlight of the bunch.  The tongs beautiful (more on that below) but clumsy enough that no one is going to reach for them over a simple set of metal chef's tongs when something needs to be lifted or turned.  Precision.  That's the key word here, that's what these tools (to a last) lack.  So read this last paragraph with your own purpose and intent in mind.  Are you looking for wooden tools with which you can cook?  I can't recommend them as such.  To display and serve salads, sure.There are, despite the above, a lot of positives.  This is a beautiful set.  Alternating shades of bamboo in tools that have pleasing, gentle curves, and feel *and* look great in the hand.  As much as they may lack in precision, they make up for in terms of visual appeal.  So again, consider your needs.  They seem and feel durable, even the tongs with the resistance coming from two 'spring' bands of bamboo look and feel like they'll hold up for years and years, with the proper care and maintenance.I wanted to like these a lot more than I did, but it could well be that my particular needs (function over form) just stray away from the strengths (form over wide function) of this set.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HKQ8ORF79ADO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047YVEKU#wasThisHelpful","R1HKQ8ORF79ADO","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked this portable little speaker the minute I saw it.  Clean lines, good aesthetic, simple controls, convenient carry loop, and there's something decidedly fun about the sneaker-like 'combed' rubber bottom on which it sits.  I had tempered expectations about sound quality.  I just wanted something to which I could stream (via bluetooth) music from my itunes playlist on the phone, and I hoped it would at least be loud enough to hear outside over typical ambient yard noise.So what I wasn't expecting was the rich bass and impressive range and depth of sound.  I wasn't expecting it to be bright *and* pull off meaty thumps when the material called for it.  Within moments of turning it on I was throwing a wide range of music at it, and it continued to impress the more I listened to it.  This is *not* a speaker that you're going to put out in the back yard while you mow the lawn.  But if you're lounging out back, sitting around with friends on a deck, or just somewhere where portability trumps power -- this is an amazing option.  I've had people ask me what it is, and I always respond by just powering it on and playing something through it.  The SOLEMATE speaks for itself on that front.Pairing with an iPhone5 was ridiculously easy, as one would expect and require.While I can't claim to have a regular need for the SOLEMATE, I love that it's sitting there waiting for its next opportunity to impress, and impress it always does.

"Some time ago I received and reviewed the Rockwell RK2515K2 LithiumTech 3RILL 12-Volt 3-in-1 Impact Driver and glowed about it.  I really liked the power and portability, I loved the front facing (of course) light, how it felt good in the hand and impressed with the power and range of function that one would normally expect only of a heavier tool.  The one issue with the 3RILL that I lamented was the lack of a traditional chuck meaning it required hex shafted bits.  The 3RILL required an accessory chuck to use traditional round bore bits, and that was a curious knock on what was otherwise a great tool.Bosch, of course, has done it right.  All the power and flexibility as described above, but with a much more convenient keyless traditional chuck that is ready for any bit that you've had floating around in your tool chest since ... well as far back as you might reasonably go.  What you have here then is a tool very comfortable in the hand, very ready for any normal job around the house, yard, or even in real work environments.  You're not going to go shoot a 1"" hole through cinderblock with it, but of course that's not the point.  It's a well designed, durable, quick charging tool that marries power with portability and convenience, and it's a terrific addition to my tools.  The 3RILL, as much as I liked it, will now retire to its bag, to be stored with the rest of my generally untouched extras (that random orbit buffer that was going to make my car shine just hasn't done a ton of shining yet, woops).Bosch comes through.  Takes a charge reasonably quickly, holds it well, impresses with the power from such a small, light body, and this truly makes the ideal compliment to a heavier more powerful drill that can now be left behind with the jobs require more agility than strength.

It's aesthetically attractive, the LEDs unassuming but plainly visible, and mine has now found a home sitting next to my wideband modem and Airport Express Extreme router.I've had little issues here and there that I attribute more to my own network and systems than anything else, but I bring them up because it has recurred a few times.  Rarely, when copying a lot of data (more than a few gigs at once, let's say) from one of the computers on the network to this drive, my network simply stalls -- nothing short of resetting the router itself brings it back.  Again, this would seem to be more about my router than the drive, but there's the one headache I've had with this setup.I'll plan on updating this review in a few months if there's anything to note about its durability, but so far everything has been wonderfully smooth and easy.  You're up and running (even on a PC) within moments of getting the box open, it's quiet, attractive, and at 3TB huge.  Can't ask for much more than that if it's also reliable over the long term.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDAQHSQ5TBIDX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HQHPC4#wasThisHelpful","RDAQHSQ5TBIDX","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit to just not trusting space heaters.  I'm sure that's because of the media's love affair with dire warnings about fires caused by ancient, ill-maintained, and improperly used equipment that only loosely falls into the same category as the the ANNA Little Ceramic.So when I unpackaged this little heater, I took heed of the warning about not not covering it while on (herp derp), and not having combustibles (like paper, cloth, etc.) within three feet of the sides.  We plugged it in (my only complaint with the ANNA, to broadcast how positive this review is going to be, is that I wish the cord was longer), and let it go.  We like to keep the house pretty cold during the winter months.  Cold enough that you look forward to blankets, appreciate a hot mug of whatever, and where it's worth digging out old flannel shirts that are more about comfort than they were style back when Temple of the Dog was a big deal.  In our dining room, which functions as a makeshift office for all but a couple days of each year, with its large front facing and not-so-well-insulated window, sometimes that means that ""cozy cold"" translates into ""boy it's sort of hard to make my fingers move enough to find the right keys on the laptop.""  Enter the ANNA, which is perfectly happy sitting on the table blowing nice warm clean air out that has no unhappy scent, and is no dryer than any of the rest of the air in the room.  It's a comfortable sort of heat, depending on your control adjustment of course, in a relatively limited area (another positive) that you're happy to reach for and enjoy periodically as a comfort or even a reward (I get to warm my hands once I finish this review!)Because I don't really trust space heaters, I worried about safety.  We'll never run it unattended.  We do sometimes have papers within 3 feet.  But even when it's running you can touch the top, back, and sides with a bare hand and experience no discomfort.  Where the heat is coming out, well, that's as hot as the air itself, but even there I can't imagine that I'd actually burn my hand if I picked it up that way while it was running.  What I mean to say is that if this fell over, I'd neither be concerned about picking it up or it causing some sort of dangerous situation for a moment on the carpet.It's small, reasonably attractive, the fan noise it emits doesn't distract us even when what we're doing requires listening to the spoken word.  It's a welcome addition to our work space during these cold months, and a new reason why we're perfectly happy telling our beloved Nest thermostat to go ahead and leave the daytime temps around 62.Very happy with it, just as happy to recommend it to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RW6BA6N98TQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005V9W14S#wasThisHelpful","R2RW6BA6N98TQI","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Already impressed by Epson's new line of wireless printers, I was excited about the prospect of a wide-format all-in-one.  Epson didn't disappoint.  Just like the Workforce 845, the WF-7510 can print from, and be controlled by, iOS devices (Android as well, as I understand it, although I can't speak to that) by way of the free (and well-reviewed) app available in the App Store.One enjoys instant and (importantly) intuitive access to a level of connectivity and control that exceeds offerings from earlier generations of printers. Moreover, the print quality on plain-text documents rivaled that of my 7 year old laserjet (to the point that they are near indistinguishable), the photo print I ended up with after printing wirelessly from my iPhone isn't going to be confused with what you'd get if you took a shot from a high-end camera and had a professional printer produce an image for you -- but that's not what I was expecting from (a) my phone, and (b) an economical all-in-one printer. The image I got, on my first try, from a phone camera, dramatically exceeded my expectations.As with the 845 (the machines are virtually identical aside from the wide-format in the WF-7510 the printer itself is handsome; gloss black, the tilting touch-screen control panel an impressive touch -- but beyond the pleasing aesthetics what you have here is a workhorse that is clearly ready to do everything I ask it to do, whether I ask through a computer, or through the iOS app. I love that the ink colors are individually tanked so that if one runs out I don't have to lose the remains of the rest in order to restore full color (a complaint from my old machines). I love that I can double-side print without being there at the machine to flip over and properly orient the page. I guess what I'm saying is that after a month of pretty regular (and at times quite heavy) use, I'm a big fan of the machine.Set-up was incredibly simple and uneventful.  Out of the box, remove the packing tape, plug it in, power it on, and then just follow the on-screen prompts that will walk you through your own configuration including (but not limited to) connecting to your home network (wirelessly or not).  After an identical experience with the 845, I had the WF-7510 from box to printing in less than 5 minutes.My 'tag' for the 845 was that Epson had restored my lost faith in inkjet all-in-ones.  The WF-7510 is all that, and more, given its wide format.  Anyone needing (with any degree of regularity) to scan or print legal or other wide-long format pictures and documents will benefit from the quality and accessibility of the WF-7510.  Epson continues to impress with this line/generation, and I find myself extremely happy with the printer in terms of its functionality AND form.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L8MHAM7N5ZF1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006Y7WZG0#wasThisHelpful","R1L8MHAM7N5ZF1","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pulling this tiny projector out of the box, I had relatively muted expectations.  Frankly, I expected to see it struggle with image clarity and brightness when stretching the distance/size of the projected field.  I expected it to have a bit of a delay.  I expected it to be loud.  Understand that I expected to still be pretty impressed despite these issues.  I mean, what I was holding in my hand (and it's so small that it was in one hand) was a fraction of the size of like-featured (and generally more expensive alternatives).  I was ready to mentally trade function for the reduced size.  Happily, I didn't have to.The 3M is bright and highly responsive.  After plugging it into an older Netbook running Win7 it was quickly identified as a second monitor (with no other interaction or intervention from me than plugging in the USB cable) and I had a live/real-time, smooth projection of my desktop right on the wall.  No delay or stuttering as I fluidly moved the mouse pointer across the wall, onto a curtain, and then up onto the ceiling (yes, at this point I was the emotional equivalent of an 8 year old boy who was just given a new toy).  I was blown away by the brightness and clarity -- focusing was as simple as making small adjustments to a conveniently placed lateral slide placed above the lens in the top-front surface of the device.  As I backed the projected well away from the wall and asked it to really stretch its limits (around an 8ft diagonal projection), the clarity held up and the brightness was impressive in a darkened room (no hedging there -- you WILL be surprised by how bright this little projector is, particularly at smaller projection sizes).How could the MP410 be better?  I do have ideas here.  I want to be able to stream video from my iOS devices.  Built-in bluetooth would be amazing (I understand one can order an accessory to accomplish this, but I'm just talking about my 'dream' device now).  I'd like to have an included remote (again, one can order one separately).  I'd like it to support a broader range of video formats natively, so I could load a movie onto a USB stick in, say, .m2ts format and it will play it cleanly (right now that format ends up with a lot of stuttering and pixelation -- a product of the streaming format it's in more than anything else, I suspect).  Here's the thing about all of these ideas though, and this is why I haven't brought the MP410 down in my rating because it lacks them: what we'd be talking about at that point would be a much more expensive (at least at the moment), and perhaps a bigger device, and then it might not be the wonderful marriage of small size and powerful performance (overall bang for the buck) that it is now.  Nonetheless, I'll hope for a new generation that does offer those features, and truly impress people in the meantime with the MP410 tethered to a laptop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROEGMOJTCNU3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007DC89OW#wasThisHelpful","ROEGMOJTCNU3V","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've enjoyed quite a few docking/speaker systems for iOS devices over the last 5-6 years.  Pioneer, other Logitech models, etc., they've all managed (to varying degrees) to take your little phone and blow it up into room-filling sound.  I've loved (and continue to use) many of these older devices, each of them requiring that I actually dock the iPhone in order to play the music -- and *that's* where the UE Air immediately stands out.I pulled it out of the box, plugged it in, and then docked my phone.  The phone immediately prompted me to install an app, which (in turn) auto-configured the phone for an alternative audio out (the same functionality that allows the phone to stream music to my vehicle).  I removed the phone from the dock, slid it back in (the dock attractively slides out from the base), opened iTunes, selected a song, engaged the alternative out, and hit play.  After a short second the room was filled with rich sound.  I left the room, went to the other end of the house and adjusted the volume on my phone.  In real time the Logitech adjusted the volume and the sound stage spread throughout the house and continued to impress me with the richness of the sound, the range, the depth of the bass.As I tend to do when exploring new speaker sets for the iPhone, I presented the UE Air with a pretty wide range of songs, each requiring different 'needs'.  The UE made them all sound terrific, and it really stood out in terms of its ability to really power out and project the music.It's wonderful, anywhere in the house, to be able to just tap the iPhone (or iPad) screen a few times and hear my song selection broadcast out from the UE Air's new perch on our hutch in the dining room.  It sounds great playing quietly if I'm sitting in that room.  It sounds great playing loudly if I'm working in the kitchen.  Logitech continues to innovate and impress, and the UE Air is a true step forward in this arena.  They've stepped up their game (an already STRONG game) in audio quality, and taken a huge step forward where they've removed the need to have the iOS device physically attached to the dock.The UE Air's form is (to me, clearly this is an entirely subjective area) as appealing as its function.  What you're looking at in the product picture is the whole of the device.  A meshed black 'flexing'/lightly bowed speaker face with a gloss black (and functional, as above this is where the dock slides out) base.  Gloss black top/back surface with three brushed silver/chrome buttons (one a dial) set into the surface.  Highly attractive without being assuming at all.  As I said, I've placed mine in my dining room, and it's a welcome and subtle addition, visually speaking.No complaints after a month of use.  Love love love the option just to leave the base on and be able to stream music to it without touching it (let alone being near it).  Highly recommended, very happy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I5U0T9GQLJOY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JW6WQU#wasThisHelpful","R2I5U0T9GQLJOY","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Nest is elegant, attractive, intuitive, and efficient.  Installation was almost absurdly simple, a lot of thought went into every step in the process.  This device brings (or helps to bring) thermostats into the information age.  Support is wonderful, and my experience only continues to improve.PACKAGING (5/5):Brilliant.  The Apple roots are evident here.  Easy to open (always a bigger deal than it sounds in a review).  Easy to access.  Every reasonably conceivable need is provided.  An egg-shaped (more comfortable and functional than I expected) screwdriver with a variety of tips stored in the handle, a wide variety of mounting hardware, and optional base plates.  Short of paint and spackle, everything is provided right in the small and attractive box.INSTALLATION (5/5):Roughly 20 years ago I spent some Summers working as an HVAC installer.  So I had some background and a measure of confidence going into the process.  Ultimately, I didn't need any of it.  After turning the power off to your HVAC system you pull the face off of your existing thermostat.  Take a picture of the low voltage wires as they connect to your current base so you have a frame of reference.  Go to the Nest website and enter the wire values (for example: Rc, W1, Y1, G) into their compatibility check -- that will let you know if you're compatible, and where the wires will be going in the Nest.  Disengage the wires and remove the old plate from the wall. The base for the Nest has a level built in.  All the mounting hardware is provided whether you're going into drywall or (better still) into a wall stud.  Screw the Nest base into the wall, plug the wires into their respective ports (no tools needed with push button access), snap the Nest itself onto the base plate, and turn the power back on.  You're all but done.  Enter some information, connect it to your wireless network, and that's really it.  The whole process took me about 15-20 minutes, and that was with patching old screw holes and applying a little paint to the wall.  I bought one for my brother who has no HVAC experience at all, he found the installation just as quick, just as easy.  The other one I bought for my mother (no, really, Nest has won me over -- can you tell?) will be easy for her to install.FUNCTION (5/5):Programming the Nest, particularly through a web browser, is as easy as dragging and dropping dots with temp values on the daily/weekly time lines.  Beyond the Nest's impressive capacity for learning your needs, I've never enjoyed such easy and intuitive access to a thermostat.  In comparison, if I wanted to change the overnight 'sleep' temperatures for a single night in my old 'smart' thermostat, I had to cycle through the entire week to do so.  You're just drowning in smart features with the Nest though, many going well beyond programming.  Everything is focused on saving you power (and thus money), everything is about efficiency.  The Nest learns how long it takes your home to go from one temperature from another.  As it approaches the target temps it will turn off your outdoor unit and continue to cool your home with the residual coldness in your indoor coil.  You're air conditioning your home for 15-20 minutes with nothing but the indoor fan!  If you enable the feature (it defaults on), Nest will pay attention to when you leave the house and when you come home; saving you a significant amount as it will let your indoor temps relax to your 'away' values but bringing it back to where you like it before you walk back in the door.  The iOS apps (for both the iPad and the iPhone) are brilliant.  You have easy access to how long your system ran for the previous 10 days, it even tells you why (higher/lower outdoor temps, temperature adjustments indoors, etc.) you may have used more or less 'on' time than normal.  You can make real-time adjustments to the mode and temperature.  Too warm in the middle of the night?  Reach over, grab your phone, and three taps later and you've dropped the house a degree.  Best of all, the Nest keeps getting better.  Over time new updates come in with new features -- including a monthly summary via email to give you an overview of your usage and efficiency.AESTHETICS (5/5):I find the glossy, dark-screened, silver-bezel(ed) positively attractive.  As you walk past the Nest it comes to life with a blue (cooling) or red (heating) backlight and your current temperature.  It's clean, simple, modern, and appealing.After a few months, I couldn't possibly be happier.  I've thought long and hard about negatives (or even potential negatives) that I could discuss for the sake of a clear-eyed and balanced review.  I've got nothing on that front.  I've read comments about problems with updates (I've gone through two and have had no issues).  I've read comments about problems with the way Nest keeps its internal battery charged with newer outdoor equipment -- my condensing unit is less than a year old from Carrier and I have no issues whatsoever.  I've read concerns about not being able to replace the battery -- I can't speak to (nor can many/any others, yet) what the life of this battery will be and what our options will be if/when it fails.  Security?  The Nest is connected to and controlled by external devices over your network, and it's connected to the internet.  Is it conceivable that some ne'er-do-well can figure out a way to change your temps?  Sure.  That has little (or nothing) to do with the Nest itself though.Brilliant product that starts paying for itself as soon as you've installed it.  Its Apple roots are evident in the intuitiveness and attractiveness of the design.

" 2:00 MinsIt's all but impossible, I think, not to draw direct comparisons to Beats Studio by Dr. Dre.  The STREET by 50 both benefit and suffer as the result of such a comparison.Audio Quality (Advantage STREET): Where STREET may lack some of the skull-shaking mid-bass as the Beats, many will see this as an ultimate positive insofar as the trade-off is better reproductive accuracy and clarity.  While few will be left wanting in terms of bass, STREET certainly delivers on this front, it seems clear that SMS Audio and 50 were acutely aware of one of the biggest knocks on the 'granddaddy' of this music mogul-inspired/endorsed headphones arena, and sought to directly address it.Noise Cancellation (Advantage Beats): STREET suffers here in contrast.  Beats enjoy battery (AAA) driven active noise cancellation that is immediately apparent and very effective from the moment you turn it on.  STREETs passive cancellation just don't hold a candle to it, and the end result is that you're a little less immersed when listening in an otherwise hostile (audio-wise) setting.Build Quality/Comfort (Advantage Beats): I find this area to be a bit of a wash, though I'll give a slight edge to the Beats for two reasons.  (1) The Beats have metal slides that result in much more smooth and precise movement as one opens and/or closes (expands and/or contracts) the size of the headset.  (2) The Beats fold into a smaller profile for carrying or storage, STREET does not.  They are both comfortable on the ear and around the head, both aesthetically pleasing in their own right.Packaging/Extras (Advantage Beats): While this is the most minor of minor considerations, some engineer at Monster clearly put serious time and effort into making the packaging on the Beats both luxurious *and* functional in terms of ease of access and use.  Everything fit together perfectly, opened easily, and the whole thing just smacked of quality.  As my video might suggest (where I fast forward through wrestling the package open even after cutting through the taped points), that's just not the case with the STREET.  While the core blue box itself is nice enough, there's just no real comparison.  But then, we're talking about packaging that you're going to open and then probably discard, so there's that.  There are two points here actually worth making though.  The Beats come with a semi-rigid but still small-profile case -- one that serves to both protect and neatly store, and this is (I think) a superior option to the bag that comes with the STREET.  Additionally, Beats come with two cables, one with a mic and one without -- STREET simply comes with the one (shown in the video) that has a mic.  May not matter to some, may to others.One might scan through all of this and come to the conclusion that I think the Beats are superior -- the truth is I just think they're different.  Even as I give the advantage in more categories to the Beats, I indicated that STREET has the edge in audio quality even when the fare needs that extra mid-bass response because of the improved overall accuracy in audio reproduction.  As audio quality is going to take center stage over the likes of packaging, and situationally over noise cancellation -- I really do see STREET coming out on top.At the end of the day, these are (as the Beats are) a great set of headphones that are really going to impress those in the market for a set of urban-style, durable, high quality, dual-function (listen to music, send and receive calls) phones.  True audiophiles need not apply, there are other options out there that will probably be a better fit your needs/bang for your buck (see: Sennheiser, Phiaton, Audio Technica, Grado, Shure, etc.) and so I'm not focusing this review on how they might respond to these (I'm guilty of being a bit of an audiophile myself, but I approach and value headphones like this on their niche (as I see it) purpose).Great phones, only knocking a star off because the active noise cancellation of the Beats better fits my own preferences.  Despite that, I find superior audio reproduction here so at home, these will likely be my go-to headphones.  Would absolutely recommend these to others (with the limitations above), particularly those who wanted bass-focused dual-purpose phones but were put off by the 'muddiness' of the Beats.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SR31IT90QZC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006BUN6ZE#wasThisHelpful","R22SR31IT90QZC","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Casual users who want to pull a product out of a box, plug it in, and with an intuitive process want to be online and running in a short period of time are, I think, just going to be quite happy with this solution.  So my point is that *most* people are going to find this a welcome and powerful option that actually offers some forward thinking and readiness in terms of the IPv6 functionality (a little wiki searching will produce a wholly accessible explanation as to how, why, and when the internet as a whole is and will be making a migration from IPv4 to IPv6 that doesn't read like a technical paper).  The point there, for those aforementioned casual users, is that you'll have what you need in place when your favorite sites offer IPv6 options.I suppose I should qualify ""casual users.""  I mean those who (for a lack of need/interest or simply a lack of comfort, knowledge, and/or familiarity) are not going to go beyond the easy, largely automated WPS set-up process that this device (and some others like it) offer.  For those who aren't going to be configuring more detail-oriented options like MAC limiting, extensive port forwarding, or any one of the other more advanced (and almost always advisable but not always practical/accessible) options that this router absolutely offers, but not by way of an interface and degree of functionality that more advanced users are going to want.  It simply doesn't afford the flexibility and technical freedom to customize that something like the ancient (but still heavily used for the customization potential) WRT54G.  But we come full circle back to the reality that the typical home user just isn't going to want and/or need that.There are some concerns about security that are well documented in other reviews, but these are concerns about WPS itself and are thus about an entire segment of the router population and are not limited to this particular brand or model.  I'm not going to spend a lot of time focusing on those because (a) the information is already out there, (b) it will be resolved in a patch at some point, one has to believe, and (c) no network device is going to be 100% secure -- so it becomes a question of what is secure enough for your purposes.  Practice basic/essential security at all levels (within your local applications), above that at the computer level, above that at the network level, etc., and you're largely doing everything you can to at least make it more of a hassle to intrude.  No device or system is 100% safe.  But, I am neither an IT nor security expert, so I'll leave the detail of such discussions, debates, and considerations to others.  This system offers the same basic security options as any other -- please do make use of them.Good range, good (in my experience) speeds to a number of devices.  I'm now using this as a router for our back-up connection (conduct most or all of your business online and that too becomes a modern necessity) and just don't see a substantial difference (positive or negative) between this and my (similarly priced) Airport Extreme 802.11N (5TH GEN).  The LinkSys, it's worth noting, also seems to be iOS device-friendly, I suffered regular drops with an older Netgear with our iPhone and iPad (driving my move to the Airport Express) and none of that is apparent with the Linksys.All in all, this is a great and powerful option for the typical user.  I note the concerns of the more technically proficient amongst us in the other reviews, and acknowledge them as entirely relevant concerns -- just not generally for the average person who wants to fire it up, quick configure, and then never worry about it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUGPNV9THHD0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0068ALV8Q#wasThisHelpful","RUGPNV9THHD0L","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You will almost certainly, as other reviewers have noted, end up disabling the buttons on the side of this mouse.  Inevitably you will hit them when you don't intend to, resulting in entirely unintended effects in different games and applications.  While I have not (yet) played Diablo III, I absolutely intend to upon its release, and look forward to using those same buttons for quick and easy access to potions -- until then, they're simply (for me, and apparently for others) sort of a poorly placed inconvenience.That aside, there's not much to dislike about this mouse.  It's well designed, comfortable in the hand, the same rubberized feel you're going to get with a lot of higher end mice, with a low profile and lighter (nimbler) feel in the hand.  It is as precise and clean in wheel and button function as any normal gamer might require.  Casual users may find the lights a little more garish than they'd prefer in a non-gaming environment, but the aesthetics stop well short of being distracting or intrusive.This is, all around, a great mouse even if one doesn't intend to tether themselves to Diablo 3 long-term upon its release.  It offers many of the features and feel of more expensive options while providing an extra edge to that particular game.  The software is easy to work with, those side buttons easy to disable (rendering any complaint I might have about them nearly moot) -- I'm simply (quite) happy with the mouse and the value it represents.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSUDBY1D35KYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005L38QK2#wasThisHelpful","RSUDBY1D35KYJ","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sharp right angles aren't particularly common in all-plastic storage containers because, one would assume, how these would represent stress points that would be prone to cracking and/or complete breakage.  So the immediately apparent advantage one sees to these boxes is that you're going to be making a more efficient use of space when you stack these, or store them next to one another on a shelf somewhere.  No (or significantly less) lost space between, under, behind, etc.  So the clean and squared-corner geometry is immediately a selling point, and Bankers Box then at least partially nullifies the benefit of the translucency of most plastic containers by adding in its own pair of large clear plastic windows giving you a clear and near complete look at the contents of the box.  Of course, should you not want the contents of the box on display, these windows are only on one side so it's easy enough to face them into the back wall of your closet (for example).The boxes are easy enough to assemble, of as solid/sturdy construction as one is going to get from this material while enjoying all the lightweight benefits of the same, and the pattern printed on the exterior brings an unobtrusive sense of clean style.  The plastic handles add a level of comfort and structural reinforcement when moving the boxes around, at the cost of there forever being two substantial open holes to the box on either end -- not the end of the world insofar as you'll never be using these for archival or otherwise delicate purposes, but it does mean that anything stored inside may not come out as 'fresh' as it goes in.The cost per unit is comparable to the average plastic alternative, perhaps a hair on the high end of the same, but the aforementioned benefits it brings over the same are worth (in this reviewer's mind) the additional expense.  Good, all-around solid, solution.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Y558CBYNCAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060J6AN6#wasThisHelpful","R27Y558CBYNCAY","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of ""if"" qualifiers are floating around in my head as I start to think about the shape of this review.  So let's see how it plays out.  The Rockwell 3RILL (""Thrill"") is a terrific solution if:- You already have more powerful drill for bigger, more demanding tasks.- You want it as a quick, easy, and conveniently manipulated (changing bits) option for driving screws, punching quick and small holes, as a power nut driver, etc.- You're not determined to have all (or most) of your power tools share the same battery set.- Light, small, and accessible are selling points for you.I like the Rockwell a lot, but then it's not at all the only driver/drill I have in the house.  When available as an alternative to a much heavier and more powerful option(s), it often is a much better fit for the lighter-faster jobs I have around the property.  So it's with that primary caveat (it's a better supplement than takes-on-all-tasks solution) that I'm able to sort of glow about this little, green, lithium-powered machine.The lithium batteries take and hold a charge quickly and well, respectively.  There's sufficient power here to do heavier jobs even if this may not be the ideal tool for them, which is to say that you're more than covered for any of the normal/lighter stuff you might be doing around the home.  The size makes it more accessible to the whole family, and the ease of use of the hand chuck makes it accessible to all without regard to their experience and comfort levels with powered tools.Like other reviewers, I wish this had come with a chuck adapter allowing you to use any of the standard round-bore size-varied bits you may already have around the house.  As is, the Rockwell requires the hex base present on all of the five bits and heads that come with the drill, which is to say that you're not going to just buy this driver and then drop your existing bits/heads into it without an additional purchase (unless of course they already feature that 1/4"" hex base).So, as I opened, there are a lot of ""if"" qualifiers.  Consider the totality of the ""ifs"" raised in this and other reviews, and you may well still come to the conclusion that they are selling points and not detractors.  I did, and that's why (with the aforementioned qualifiers that represent the core focus of this review) I find myself feeling and writing very positively about this little, convenient, but still powerful, tool.  Extra credit to Rockwell for putting the inline light on the tool, it's a marvelous and entirely welcome perk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NTNU479PIFGI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004U4BAI8#wasThisHelpful","R1NTNU479PIFGI","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everyone has different needs and priorities when it comes to a pair of gaming headsets.  In my case, I wanted something I could use while my wife and the dogs slept that would still allow me to pick up the important/relevant audio elements of the game I was playing (most recently (while using this set) Battlefield 3 multiplayer).  Not surprisingly, the audio quality is on the better end of the scale.  I expected as much from Sennheiser, and while I wasn't blown away and won't be confusing these with a pair of high end audio-only phones, it was still every bit as good as you would want.  But, unfortunately, that's sort of where the strong positives end.My immediate concerns are about how they connect, how comfortable they are (or aren't), and how the microphone's non-adjustable sensitivity threshold may be causing some communication issues when you're trying to be quiet (and why wear a headset when you're not trying to be quiet?).The connection issue isn't going to be a problem for those not using HDMI or fiber for their audio.  I go straight from the 360 to a Denon receiver with fiber, and then from the receiver to speakers with MIT cables.  At no point in the equation (at the 360, on my tv, or even on the Denon do I have easily accessible RCA jacks.  The instructions indicate you should just plug it into your tv -- this is terrific if you're using your tv for audio -- I'm not, others don't, so consider that issue and how you'll resolve it before buying these.  So that connectivity is an issue for me and will be for some, and with that issue comes a little less convenience in terms of setting them up and breaking them down before, and then after, a gaming session.  The same could be said about the wires themselves.  Microsoft placed a premium on disconnecting gamers from the hardware, giving them the freedom to move around as they please.  With a standard pair of 360 phones you're tethered to the wireless controller (unless you've splurged for the on-ear wireless option), but not the console.  With the Sennheiser you're tethered to both, and to something else as well.  Jack into the controller, USB into the console, RCA into your TV or perhaps your receiver (as long as that's close enough to the rest -- another issue that confounded me).  I want to just say I wish this had been a wireless solution, that if I can send and receive audio through the controller jack with other headsets I should be able to hear -- and I do wish that -- but I can't speak intelligently to why Sennheiser felt it necessary to create this web of connections, there may well be a valid reason.  Whether or not that's true doesn't change the fact that it's an issue.On the mic, the bottom line is that it's just not going to 'believe' that you're talking sometimes.  The real world result is that you're not going to be sending a lot of ambient noise to others.  When I'm playing BF3 I can, at times, hear every sniffle and huff someone makes on the other end.  That's not going to be the case here as the headset does a good job of isolating your voice.  In my own experience, however, that means that sometimes the first part of what you say isn't going to go through, and sometimes you may be told they can't hear you at all if you're not speaking with a normal conversational volume -- a level of volume that you may well be trying to avoid if you're playing at night and a certain potentially grouchy someone is being a more responsible person and is trying to sleep just a few feet away.Finally, comfort -- eh, it's okay -- but just okay.  The mic boom rotates up and down but not laterally, nor does it telescope in and out.  The top band is sufficiently padded and the phones themselves are not terribly heavy, but you're never going to just forget that you have them on.  The ear padding and just the feel of them on your ears is on the better end of acceptable.  ""Eh"" sort of says it.  They're fine -- not bad even over an extended gaming session, not great, good enough.Bottom line?  I wouldn't advise someone not to get these headphones.  Despite the greater focus on the negatives above, I find these a solid enough option, and the alternatives (those with which I have familiarity, anyway) similarly flawed enough as to not represent a major advantage.  If you want both the game audio and the chat audio in your phones, these are a good option with the caveats mentioned above.  Just think about where and how you're going to plug them in, and put a towel or blanket over the wires on the floor in case you have dogs that like to move around at night and trip on hazards connected to multiple electronics.  >.<tl;dr -- Good, not great.  Wires are bad.  Voice sometimes gets cut off.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D47VS9PKBM5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005JVKAY6#wasThisHelpful","R2D47VS9PKBM5F","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you cook and/or bake, you have a scale -- or you should have a scale.  Soehnle has sort of become to go-to for home-casual options on this front, and for good reason; they're affordable, usually attractive (or at least not unattractive), and generally accurate.I have an older Soehnle that looks a little alien.  It has three cylinders as a base, connecting by posts to a disc in the middle which then, in turn, supports the glass measuring surface that is sort of standard for a Soehnle scale.  What's nice about this design is that you have the display and controls on the top visible surface of one of those cylinders, and then the top of one of the others acts as an easily accessible switch between grams and ounces.  It's the latter distinction that brings me to draw a comparison between my older 'alien' Soehnle (I simply don't know the model number anymore and it no longer seems to be available) and this new Siena.  On the Siena (which is smaller, and has a lower max weight -- but these are non-issues as far as I'm concerned as there are costs and benefits alike), the g/oz switch can only be toggled by picking the whole scale up and flipping it over.  It's on the bottom, like the battery cover.  I won't belabor why this is less convenient except to say that if you're working on more than one recipe and they use different units of measurement, it's a simple truth that easy access to these functions is the better option.So it's with that 'ding' that I say that this is a fine scale.  It has a very clear and easy-to-read display, the controls are as simple as any other Soehnle (press and hold the button to zero out, put whatever you want to weigh on the glass, near-instant results), it has a smaller footprint than a lot of other options (important for those with limited counter real estate), and while it's clearly designed for lighter use than some of the other models, its capacity is still going to be greater than most anything you'll be weighing in a home kitchen.  This remains a economically and functionally efficient option, one I'm happy to have added to my home -- I just wish that one little switch was on top somewhere.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZN81EC5W04M8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VSBU3M#wasThisHelpful","R1ZN81EC5W04M8","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had color inkjet printers in the past, I've also had them in all-in-one configurations such as this.  I was never happy with the print quality with those devices, in terms of either the depth of color and the resolution of the color imagery -- or (most importantly, for most printing) in terms of the quality of plain old black text.  So I eschewed color for a simple laser printer with the big, heavy, expensive, (and sometimes but rarely) messy toner cartridges and I was happy enough.  As secondary background, I am an iOS device user.  I looked for a variety of solutions that would allow me to print directly from the iPhone4 and a 1st gen iPad.  Google offered functional but limited-to-email support through their own system, apps (free and not) were offered in iTunes, and every once and a while I could find ways to print from these devices to the aforementioned laser printer.The WorkForce 845 sort of reinvented everything I wanted and expected from a printer within moments of arriving.  In retrospect I wish I had recorded video of the unboxing and setup because it would have made a pretty compelling video review.  It would have been about 5 minutes long, and within that 5 minutes you'd have seen me go from an open box to printing out a spectacular full 8.5x11"" glossy full-color, high-resolution shot of one of my dogs from the iPhone.  Had the video gone an extra 2-3 minutes, it could have included me scanning in a document I put in the 845 directly to the same phone, which I was then able to easily email to someone else.  The point here is that I had instant and (importantly) intuitive access to a level of connectivity and control that has escaped me to date.  Moreover, the print quality on plain-text documents rivaled that of my 7 year old laserjet (to the point that they are near indistinguishable), the photo print I ended up with isn't going to be confused with what you'd get if you took a shot from a high-end camera and had a professional printer produce an image for you -- but that's not what I was expecting from (a) my phone, and (b) an economical all-in-one printer.  The image I got, on my first try, from a phone camera, dramatically exceeded my expectations.The printer itself is handsome; gloss black, the tilting touch-screen control panel an impressive touch -- but beyond the pleasing aesthetics what you have here is a workhorse that is clearly ready to do everything I ask it to do, whether I ask through a computer, or through the free app provided in iTunes (I understand Android is supported as well, but I can't speak to that).  I love that the ink colors are individually tanked so that if one runs out I don't have to lose the remains of the rest in order to restore full color (a complaint from my old machines).  I love that I can double-side print without being there at the machine to flip over and properly orient the page.  I guess what I'm saying is that after a month or two of pretty regular (and at times quite heavy) use, I'm a big fan of the machine.More so than I expected, otherwise I might have had that video of the process up to supplement this review.  Count me a happy reviewer, and one that would have no hesitation recommending this printer to friends and family.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30IHW8ZE52URD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IVL0RS#wasThisHelpful","R30IHW8ZE52URD","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I said in a recent review for the larger Celebrate with a Crowd offering from ig4U, you start with a deep and attractive basket, then fill it (above a buffer) with a variety of tasty and unusual treats ranging from hard pretzels, to delicate truffles, imported sandwich cookies, unusual grain mustard, and number of other welcome surprises, and you have this well-stocked gift basket.  ""Celebrate with a Friends"" is a good size for a small(ish) family or modest group of friends.The contents are attractively arranged, in many cases they've got their own printed boxes as a presentation/organizational layer with the original wrapping underneath (which is to say that you may open a box that indicates pretzels to find a bag of pretzels within).  The basket is no Longaberger, but the one I received was of a relatively high quality construction level and was genuinely handsome.  The whole package is wrapped in plastic and then a rich brown ribbon with a card -- all in all you're left with a gift that is likely to give the impression that you spent more than you may have.I was pleased with the basket, delighted to discover some new treats with which I was previously unfamiliar, and in general found myself very happy with what I received.  It's worth noting that some of the exceptionally poor reviews below are entirely accurate and not at odds with my own experience -- indeed, even the harshest echo my own feelings about the product as it was represented in prototype in late October.  Without speaking for the company, my understanding is that many of us received prototype packages that saw the aforementioned original packaging represented by things like empty individual serving cereal boxes wrapped in inkjet printer paper.  The end result was, as one reviewer put it, sort of creepy.  The company replaced these prototypes with their final version, and I have gone from seeing this as a 1-star product worth (as others have) warning prospective buyers away, to feeling like they really represent a fine value.  I would have no problem whatsoever buying one of these as a gift for a group of friends.  So my review is based on the 'final' version of the product as it was received in late Nov/early Dec 2011, and not upon the late Oct prototype received.  I only make this distinction for the sake of browsers being able to consider the totality of the currently available reviews, putting the product change timeline into perspective.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IIWXLW6HD2L0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EF0HSG#wasThisHelpful","R1IIWXLW6HD2L0","A1VKAY0XWLA2CY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VKAY0XWLA2CY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Virna De Paul is a well known author but she’s completely new to my reading world.  So I was excited to check out her latest release, Filthy Rich –  the blurb tugged at all of my must read triggers.  Money, power and sexy characters – woohoo!! I could wait to start it.​After a chance encounter at a work related party, Cara and Brendan share an intoxicating moment of lust. It’s brief and intense but it clearly leaves it’s mark on the two.  The scene captures your attention and you are definitely intrigued by this budding couple.  I thought they were charming and quick witted.  Their intelligence and drive made them incredibly alluring characters – I wanted to know more about them both.Their story jumps forward from there and the plot moves along swiftly.  There’s lots of intrigue and mystery surrounding the company Cara works for as well as her new relationship with Brendan.  Someone seems to be out to get them both – it’s very exciting.  There are several jaw dropping moments as well as more highly erotic moments between Kara and Branden.  It is awesome.I thought Filthy Rich started kind of slow but it gradually increased its intensity right along with the build up of passion between the two main characters and that overall it flowed very well.  It wasn’t a book that I would say drop everything and read – however if you’re looking for an enthralling and suspenseful read to fill an afternoon, Filthy Rich is definitely a good choice. It will keep you entertained and get your lady bits tingling.  It will leave you feeling satisfied.So don’t miss out on Cara and Brendan – their adventure was fun and I absolutely suggest you read their book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21V1JDAPBOI3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCHXMHK#wasThisHelpful","R21V1JDAPBOI3M","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sawyer Bennett is one of my absolute favorite authors and I was completely giddy to dive into her latest release from the Legal Affairs series.  Each of the previous books in this set were sassy, tantalizing reads that I could not put down.  So I was not surprised that Friction was highly enticing legal romance; one that was oh so much fun to read.Leary and Reeve are both intelligent, quick witted and highly sexually charged individuals. They work for two very different types of law firms and are currently opposing council for a huge case.  The plot moves along swiftly.  Most of the book is leading up to the actual trial but their verbal foreplay and their competitive personalities make for spectacular reading.  You're completely invested in the outcome of their case and rooting for them to overcome the pitfalls of being adversaries.Right from the first moments together, Leary and Reeve kept me on my toes.  These two were completely engaging and captivating characters.  I never knew what was going to come out of their mouths or what lines they would cross with their behavior.  It was awesome - I spent the majority of their book with a smile on my face.What was even more impressive was the chemistry between Leary and Reeve - it was monumental.  Their connection was freaking intense and highly sensual.  They could barely keep their hand off each other and as a reader, you are psyched that they cannot.  The passion and lust they exude makes your lady bits tingle and has you devouring page after page.  I loved it.Overall, I thought that Leary and Reeve's love story was incredible - a can't miss romance.  I definitely recommend you read it as well as the other romances in the Legal Affair series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y184WBTH3CML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XCAOXI0#wasThisHelpful","R1Y184WBTH3CML","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Her characters are always enticing and their drama is highly entertaining.

They know one another from the ranch plus Sam's best friend is married to Gibson's brother.  The trouble is that they both believe they're Doms and that makes future opportunities between the two bleak even though their connection is palpable.  However, one of them is lying to themselves as well as to the other.  It's not done to be malicious - more so because the person is terrified admit some very hard truths.Break Me Down is the story of Samantha and Gibson reaching for the truth and their own version of happily ever after.  And while I really enjoyed their story, I wish it had been a full-length novel. The relationship between these two characters was complicated and intense - it felt a bit rushed at times and I didn't care for that.

"I am already in love with this new Pier 70 series from Nicole Edwards. Holy hotness!!  Reckless gives readers and fans of this author a whole new set of characters to lust after and to devour. It’s freaking awesome.The storyline in Reckless pairs up Cam and Gannon.  Their relationship builds slowly and even though they are highly attracted to one another, they become friends first.  They find that they couldn’t be more different personality or interest wise but their hearts are telling them that they completely work together.But it’s not as easy as they would both like.  There is a certain level of complexity to their relationship. Yes, it’s intense and filled with passion but they both carry a bit of baggage.  The push and pull dynamic of their desire for one another is really coupled with major hurdles they need to overcome.  They both need to get over their individual fears to make their relationship work.  That additional aspect of personal growth really adds to the book and heightens your empathy for the two characters.As Cam and Gannon really connect and fall deeply in love, so do you as a reader.  You want them to work it all out and to get their happily ever after together.  Their story makes for a great romance and a highly entertaining read.Since Reckless the first book in the series, there is also a lot character and sub-plot introduction.  The point of view switches several times to the other owners of Pier 70 Marina and after meeting Cam’s friends, I honestly cannot wait for more from this group.  I think this is really going to be a sexy, fun set of characters.Definitely don’t miss out on Reckless it’s a must read a fans of M/M erotic romance as well as for anyone who just enjoys well written love story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJTMNN2W8ULY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015DQEFE2#wasThisHelpful","RJTMNN2W8ULY3","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As you may or may not know, I LOVED the first book in this series, Typecast. I pretty much begged Kim Carmichael to notify me as soon as the second book in the series was available because I couldn't wait to get my hands on the continuing saga of the Hollywood Stardust crew.  So I was pumped when I finally got to read Limelight.Here is the deal with this series. Twenty years ago, a group of four young adults made a movie that changed a generation. It was about a cross country road trip to California with three guys and one girl  - they're all friends but they're all also all in love or lust with Erin. Off-camera the actors basically are living through a similar story line except for Erin who is really only in love with one of the three boys.  And who it is a huge secret.Like any good romantic drama, there's an incident and the results from it changed the life paths for all four.  It also almost destroys all the friendships.  Drew disappeared - changed his name and got started on a completely different career path.  He hid himself from the world and especially from Erin. For twenty years, Erin has been searching for a Drew - to mend and correct the errors she made when she was a foolish kid.So when Limelight picked up where Typecast ended with Drew showing up for the twenty year reunion - you're beyond excited to finally get Drew and Erin's story.I was quickly sucked into their world and their drama.  I didn't really like Erin the first book - I thought that she was kind of bratty and spoiled but the author has given the reader more insight to what really makes her tick in Limelight.  Suddenly I found myself having more empathy for her.  I slowly began to like her and I was completely invested on her journey of self-discovery and reclaiming her lost love.  I wanted her and Drew to work things out.It's not an easy path for these two to get their happily ever after. There is a lot of mistrust and insecurities that makes it difficult to move forward and overcome the heavyweight of their past mistakes.  But they are amazing together.  Their scenes made me laugh, and swoon.  They're sexy and sweet.  I loved it.Erin and Drew's story makes awesome reading and the plot incredibly entertaining. I devoured Limelight in just one afternoon because I couldn't put Drew and Erin's romance down.  This book is a top recommendation from me.  Don't miss out on this series!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36C93EIH71G0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015Y70RXS#wasThisHelpful","R36C93EIH71G0Z","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best part of this series is that each book is better and more impressive than the last one. River Savage just continues to increase the passion and intensity between her characters all the while making their storylines more addictive and satisfying reads. It's awesome and Infatuation knocked my panties off - I loved it!!Mackenzie was one of the women that Beau helped rescue from a seriously bad marriage and even though they only spent a few days together, a rock solid connection was formed. She trusted him enough to turn to him once again in a time of need. Maybe because she knew she would be safe in his custody or maybe because she was curious about knowing him.For whatever reason, her arrival changes everything. No one misses their sexual chemistry and every scene with them makes your heart pound. You highly anticipate the moment that they surrender to one another.But their relationship is crazy, complicated so that moment is not one that comes easily. Beau desperately wants Mackenzie but he worries that all that he desires and needs sexually will just be too much. And while Mackenzie is timid, she's more than a little curious what it would feel like to be taken. Craved. Overcome with lust. But all of that takes trust and she's not sure if she will ever be able to give herself fully again nor does she believe in her own judgement.There budding relationship is combined with the mystery surrounding Mackenzie's husband. The club is trying to help at Beau's insistence but all they see to be finding is dead ends and more chaos. Mackenzie's problems create new enemies and problems. It was an excellent sub plot and I loved the scenes with the club members.Overall, Infatuation is just a must read story. Whether you've read any of the other books in the series or not. River's latest book is both suspenseful and engaging as well as sexually arousing. I definitely recommend that you do not miss out on Infatuation, it's a highly entertaining read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ER5PX8OEATD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015BHRN4W#wasThisHelpful","R3ER5PX8OEATD5","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love a good dark romance book. They're thrilling, seductive reads and when they are written well, you become fully immersed in a world that you never step foot in real life but love reading about. The Stripped Series is an amazing dark romance set of books. It is filled with crazy characters whose lives are so freaking entertaining and alluring.If you're like me, you've read the previous books and have experienced the brief moments with Ivan and Candace, so you're pumped to finally be getting their story in Pretty When You Cry. I have made so many assumptions about these two, that I almost felt desperate to know what really is their relationship. Are they lovers? Are they friends? Foes?What I got blew my mind. Their relationship is complex. Naughty and erotic. It's a twisted and lonely love. Honestly, I promise you that everything you thought you knew about this couple is nothing compared to the complicated relationship that Skye Warren has crafted.Candace always came across as this angry, needy addict to me. However, she would show these random acts of kindness and I think those moments are what made me the most curious about her. As you read, you find out that she's hiding - desperate to escape her past and a man that fills her night mares. And once you understand her, your empathy and compassion for her grows. You want her to find solace and to get her happily ever after.Ivan and Candace's journey together is intense. She wants something more with Ivan - she needs him to fulfil her heart's and body's desires. She loves him. Candace wants a future with Ivan but he cannot see her as anything more than the fragile girl he found. Since the book is completely told from Candy's perspective, you never get a true glimpse inside of Ivan's thoughts or his heart - so you don't truly know how he feels.I loved every moment with their unfolding story. Pretty When You Cry was an awesome addition to the series and even if you haven't read the other books, it would still be enjoyable. That is because it is an exciting and powerful romance. One that completely captured my attention - I was consumed by Ivan and Candace's love. Definitely check this book out today as well as the other books in the Stripped Series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WTCJAQ9N83R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016SFKK0U#wasThisHelpful","R1WTCJAQ9N83R2","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ginger Scott's Harper's boys have totally charmed me - I love them. Underneath their tough, bad-ass exteriors lie the hearts of sweet, generous and kind men who have been dealt a tough set of cards in the game of life. These sexy beasts will take on the world to protect their girls. So to say I was a little excited to be read Andrew's story after meeting him in his older brother's book is an understatement.And what freaking book. Wow.Wicked Restless, Andrew and Emma's story gutted me. Their romance started in their teens and it was so innocent - you're completely enchanted by the couple. Their connection is delicate and sweet, yet it's filled with temptation and all the desires that teens feel for their first loves.So I was crushed when one mistake changed the course of their lives. I felt heartbroken. My heart raced as I delved deeper into their lives and the fall out for these two; I was horrified that life could be so unfair. The consequences and price they paid for love was high.When the two reconnect years later, it isn't a happy or joyous reunion. It's filled with secrets and deception. Anger. Lust. My emotions bounced up and down with each new page. Andrew and Emma created this tangled web of lies that you almost cannot see how they will walk away unscathed. They seem to need to experience every moment of pain so that they could be rewarded with ones of happiness and love.I highly suggest you read any thing that Ginger Scott writes - she is one of my favorite authors. Her characters will endear themselves to you and you will devour their happily ever after moments. Emma and Andrew's journey just another example of her genius. Their story is a must read and a top recommendation from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2USG3LG4TUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015UFJP5U#wasThisHelpful","R3N2USG3LG4TUB","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh, how the mighty have fallen.If you’re a fan of the Rule Series by Monica Murphy, then you’ve been waiting patiently (or not so patiently like me) for Tristan’s romance.  I couldn’t wait to read his story, Slow Play and to see if I would fall in love with Tristan just like I did his best friends.  He was just so anti-love that you knew when he got knocked on his ass by a woman that it would be a page devouring read.Tristan’s pursuit of Alex left you feeling enchanted and your lady bits tingling.  He’s a moody, angry manwhore and she’s a feisty reformed princess.  Their push and pull dynamic leaves you craving more because as a couple these two are erotic and fun – it’s highly entertaining.  But what starts as a case of insta-lust between the two became a friendship – one with a deeper understanding for one another.  Their connection and chemistry grounds them.  It makes them whole.​I could not get enough of this book and this couple. Slow Play kept me on the edge my seat with anxiety – I kept waiting for Tristan to let me down because it felt like it was going to be inevitable.  You expected his sharp tongue or anger to get him in trouble.  You expected him to make a poor choice or to let Alex or his friends down.  So when he shows up and exceeds your expectations, you’re swooning.  You completely understand how he stole Alex’s heart.He wasn’t as easy to love as Shep or quite as charming as Gabe but once Tristan creeps into your heart, you never want him to leave.  I get why he turned out to be the author’s favorite of the trio.Tristan’s story with Alex, coupled with the hilarity of his friendship with Gabe and Shep makes Slow Play a must read conclusion to an incredible set of books.

"I love the start of a new sports romance series – especially ones about hockey players. These professional athletes are intense and just as badass as any biker or man in a three-piece suit. And it’s because you know that to achieve the level of success they’ve reached, they’re incredibly passionate and driven. So the idea that an author is taking on a team full of those type of characters and having them all fall in love – it’s nirvana for me.However, Major Misconduct isn’t just another book about some hot hockey player.  It’s a well told love story that is about one women finding her true self while meeting her romantic match and it is seriously fabulous.I thought that Lovey was completely relatable and I got caught up in her zest for living.  She worked at finding the best in situations, people and basically out of life.  She’s only just words on a pages in a book but I wanted to be around her and share in her glow.  I devoured her story and her romance with Mark.Lovey seemed a little lost and unsure of herself but it’s only because she grew up in the shadow of her brother, Duncan, who had a major talent in hockey and was able to make a career out of his passion.  Lovely didn’t initially have that – she needed to bounce around life a bit to find her place.  As a reader, I could imagine her life and put myself in her shoes.  So I was more than a little excited for her when her new career started taking off and then when Lovey and Marc give into their feelings for one another.  (I think I might have cheered out loud a little bit.)Their connection was instantaneous – you’re almost knocked over by their desire for one another.  Every stolen moment between these two is freaking HOT.  They have this understanding for one another that heightens their sexual chemistry but that also made them friends. Their romance was kind of taboo and that made it fun to read.  Experiencing them falling in love made me giddy and created or reminded me of that crazy feeling in my chest one experiences when they find their true love.So when they encounter road blocks and emotional hurdles, you are rooting for them.  These made up characters feel real and you want them to win at love.  They are the friends who turn into lovers that you desperately want to get their happily ever after.  That’s what made this book a must read recommendation from me.I thought Kelly Jamieson’s latest release Major Misconduct was awesome. I absolutely loved it. The characters and their romance left me feeling hot AND they made me laugh – I’m completely hooked on the players from the Chicago Aces.  I will purchase every book from this series and I would definitely recommend you do the same.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PCT7C5M1IT56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWEMG5M#wasThisHelpful","R1PCT7C5M1IT56","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I met Tazen and Quinn last night and OMG – these two are hilarious! And intense. Holy hotness!!  Hard to Break is seriously, seriously awesome.  I loved it!!  Bella’s An Alpha’s Heart novels might be my favorite books from her – ever.  They are entertaining and incredibly sexy reads.Quinn is completely badass – she made me want to run out and learn the difference between an alternator and drive shaft. (Or at the very least, she made me want to stare at hot peeps who know the difference)  Anyway, at the start of the book, her life is beyond chaotic.  Her father is drinking himself to death and their business is dying right along with him.Enter Tazen.  He’s a successful custom car builder and he wants the property Quinn’s auto shop resides at.  He also wants Quinn, has a past, and several mistakes that he’s trying to outrun.  Did I mention that he’s also sexy as all hell?!? You will love him.The intense attraction between these two is instantaneous.  They fight it at first – battling their lust with quick wit and snarky banter but that only makes you anticipate the moment that they surrender to their passion.  As soon as they stop fighting, their lives become completely entwined and you are bewitched by their connection.  I devoured their story because of it.  Everything about their journey toward happily ever after was enjoyable and I finished the book simply feeling happy.One of my favorite things about this series is that it is about females who excel in male-dominated professions.  I loved Quinn’s rebellious and fierce personality – her determination to succeed freaking rocked.  I was cheering her on and psyched that she didn’t except less than she knew she was worth.  It’s nice to read an erotic book about a renegade character and to have that person be a women.Hard to Break is a top recommendation from me, as was Hard to Fight and honestly, I cannot wait to read the final book Hard to Forget because I think it’s probably going to be awesome, too.  Bella Jewel has another winner with this series!!  Definitely meet Tazen and Quinn today!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCJT0Y3ORBYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRFUEK2#wasThisHelpful","R1OCJT0Y3ORBYH","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I almost passed on Alasdair.  I'm so freaking over vampires and I'm not a huge paranormal romance fan. But I just couldn't miss out on a book written by Ella Frank - I  love her stories. Her books and her MM romances are some of my all time favorites, so I had to read her latest release. Even if it was about vampires.I now want to kick my own ass for almost making a huge blunder.  I'm so thankful that I went outside my reading norms because Alasdair was INCREDIBLE. The characters and their story blew me away, it's really all quite brilliant. The plot is intense and seriously, seriously make my panties incinerate erotic - plus it's only the start to what I can only assume will be an epic adventure.  I cannot wait for more.The Masters Among Monsters series starts with Alasdair's book.  He spotted Leo one evening and from that moment on, he was completely bewitched. Alasdair's attraction and desire for this man was unlike anything he had felt for thousands of years. They seem to have this enigmatic bond and that makes Alasdair weary. But he's not the only one - Leo is not sure what the hell is going on with his life.  He finds himself in an incredibly dangerous situation and while he's scared, he's fascinated by this strange man that he is desperately lusting after.The book's perspective alternates back and forth from their personas and I was completely entralled by all of it. I thought there was a lot of character development and ground work being laid out for the entire series in Alasdair.  You're introduced to all the various characters that will be important throughout Alasdair and Leo's journey. And while the book focused on the passion between these two main characters there really wasn't a lot of romance, however I believe their relationship will develop into more in the following books.At the core of this story is a lot of Greek mythology, a mysterious plot and lots enticing M/M vampire sex.  Alasdair and Leo's lives are obviously entangled for a reason and I believe that the purpose of their bond will slowly unfold throughout the three books.  I have no clue what the author has in store for these two but Ella started this series with a hit.Alasdair is an alluring and captivating book - an absolute must read. Definitely start it today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R200NUIRD1N344/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122DD7HU#wasThisHelpful","R200NUIRD1N344","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything I Left Unsaid was one of the most beautiful and raw stories I've ever read. It was my first book from Molly O'Keefe and I absolutely loved it.  It is a must read recommendation from me.The story all starts with a phone call and a man - a stranger asking her if she was safe. But Annie was far from ok - she was on the run and all alone. Terrified. You can feel her desperation. It oozes off the pages and you want her new home to be a place of solace. You want the world to be a little less lonely for her.But you'll find that you quickly want that for Dylan, too. They're both so scarred from life that you cannot help feel hope that fate has brought them together for a positive reason.  Even though their verbal foreplay is AWESOME, you want the voice on the other end of the phone to do more than awaken Annie's sexual being, you want Dylan to be the man who gives her a happily ever after.There is an edge to their romance and it's thrilling.  The passion and intensity of this couple, before they ever even meet rivals any of the romances novels on the book market. The push and pull of boundaries is incredible. Dylan's drive to fill Annie's desires and to awaken everything she has repressed, is tantalizing and seductive. Erotic.I devoured their conversations. They left my heart pounding and aching for more. And when they finally meet and touch - I was blown away by the magnitude of their connection. Annie and Dylan's journey tugged at my heart as well as my panties. It's spectacular.Everything I Left Unsaid is the first book in this series and it's conclusion left my jaw on the ground. (This book is not a standalone) I cannot wait to read the next installment and to see what the author has in store for this couple!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMWXWVFRT7SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WM#wasThisHelpful","R1GMWXWVFRT7SA","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Everything about Dirty English kicks ass - I freaking LOVED the twins and Declan's romance with Elizabeth.  The time I spent in their world kept me completely entertained and I  am addicted to this new set of characters Ilsa Madden-Mills has created.  It's an awesome love story and an absolute must read.The story starts with a heartbreaking prologue.  Within just a few pages, she had my empathy and I genuinely hurt for Elizabeth.  When the jumps forward two years, I understood by she guarded her heart and why she made the vow to never love again.  Elizabeth is a truly a remarkable character.  I was impressed with her drive to move forward and I liked how she knows where her personal boundaries are but yet still tries to push herself beyond what makes her comfortable.Enter Declan.  He's all kinds of panty melting goodness.  One half of a hot British duo, Declan is a fighter and a protector.  He's enticing - his personality is both sweet and sexy.  His reaction to Elizabeth is what every single female truly wants.  He's captivated and enthralled by her; unwilling to give up on the attraction he feels for her even though she consistently rejects his advances.And she does that because Declan makes Elizabeth feel to much. Her heart races and she is consumed by her attraction to him. So much so that even though he's everything she does not want and hopes to avoid, she eventually cannot resist his charms or her feelings toward him.  Their relationship and connection is intense much like their personalities.  They're both a little damaged but together they're stronger.  Better.Their romance was fun to read even though at times my heart ached for these two. The author did an incredible job balancing out the right levels of angst and hopefulness - you're easily and emotionally attached to both characters. I loved it.I definitely recommend Dirty English and I'm praying that it is the start of a new series revolving around this set of family and friends. (I desperately want Dax's book next!!)

"Arrrggggg!!  I'm not sure if I like this series or not. Don't jump up my butt - I know people really love it but I feel seriously exhausted after reading the first two books. Brooklyn's life is one freaking hot mess and her crazy saga continues in Brooklyn's Survival.Brooklyn has a very dangerous stalker/murderer after her. He is cruel and relentless in his pursuit of her - killing women who look exactly like her left and right. Hurting the people that Brooklyn loves. He's always present. Taunting her. You're not sure if he wants to get her angry and engaged in his crazy game or if he desperately wants to break her spirit.I loved this aspect of the story.  It's exciting and intense.  Suspenseful.  It made me want to recommend this book to everyone.However, this drama is coupled with the ongoing adventure that is Brooklyn and Mark's relationship. Sweet Jesus. These two made me feel angry and frustrated. You know they are souls mates and that they know it, too. Their connection and history ties them together but is almost too much to overcome. Yet they cannot stay away from one another and whenever they are left alone they cannot ignore their passion for each other.  I was left screaming at my Kindle - GET IT TOGETHER ALREADY!!  They made me feel a bit stabby and after a while that feeling got old.Elizabeth York's writing style was tough for me. I almost want to describe it as being too fast paced but that wasn't it. I felt her story telling jumped around and she inserted details or people into scenes that were meant to have your jaw dropping but instead it felt like she was trying too hard to shock the reader.  Several times while I was reading,  I had to stop and go back to reread a scene because I wasn't sure what exactly was happening.  I had a lot of WTF moments in both books.Overall, the plot and the characters (while irritating) in Brooklyn's Survival are interesting and entertaining. I am looking forward to reading the final installment and meeting the evil behind all of the misery as well as the happily ever after for this couple.  I would definitely suggest that you check the Brooklyn series out and see what you think of it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7B8865VMA494/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0160R8ZP8#wasThisHelpful","R7B8865VMA494","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewer’s Note – Sinner’s Steel is the third book in the Sinner’s Tribe MC series.  I did not realize that fact when I started reading it but I was still able to enjoy this storyline even without knowing the past misadventures of the group and finer details about their rivalry with the Black Jacks. The author gives enough of an overview that you quickly know who is who and what their role is within the club. However, I would strongly recommend reading the books in order because I think Sinner’s Steel would be even more satisfying with the back stories.* * * * *I was so excited when I stumbled upon Sinner’s Steel.  I absolutely devoured Sarah Castille’s extreme fighter’s series and I could not wait to check out her MC books.  Her stories are always provocative – plus with each new publication her books get hotter and more stimulating.  So I knew she would give me a bunch of incredibly badass alpha men to enjoy.  And I was not wrong – holy hotness – I loved this group of ruffians and their kinky ways.  I cannot wait to get to know them all.Zane, Evie and Jagger (who is the President of Sinner’s Tribe) have best friends with each other since they were kids.  Long story short – as young adults Zane and Evie’s feelings became way than just friendship but tragedy struck and the future they dreamed of together was crushed.  They both feel betrayed by the harsh realities of their lives and have carried the weight of their past mistakes for nine years.Sinner’s Steel is Zane and Evie’s second chance love story.  Zane was a freaking severe and powerful character.  His smart, dirty mouth will get your lady bits tingling; while his protective side will have you swooning.  Everything about him will make you want to rip off your clothes and tie yourself to his bed.  He is balanced out with a completely kickass female lead in Evie.  She was just as fierce as Zane as well as smart, clever and independent woman.  Honestly, these two were quite the duo and I was consumed by their scenes – I couldn’t put their book down.This couple’s road toward happily ever after is rough and under heavy gun fire.  They need to deal with all kinds of crazy MC drama which impedes their already complicated reunion.  It’s a hot mess but it makes for especially entertaining reading.I absolutely loved every moment of this story and definitely recommend this MC romance.  No one wants to miss out on the intense and erotic connection Zane and Evie share.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y2EB4NBWTQ08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V3B0TWY#wasThisHelpful","R2Y2EB4NBWTQ08","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a competitive person by nature, so I really enjoy books where the main couple's unfolding romance initiates from a competition.  If it is written well, this type of storyline can be incredible. The character's ensuing battle to further their own personal ambitions versus what their heart desires can be the foundation to hijinks, work place hilarity and some serious sexual tension - thus giving a reader a impressive book to enjoy.  So Irresistibly Yours' blurb called to me like a siren's song and I could not wait to read it.As someone who has not read any of the Stilettos books, (an error I plan to correct asap) I had no clue the greatness that was waiting for me inside the pages of Irresistibly Yours. It was seriously amazing - I was completely enraptured by everything in this book. The friendships. The romance. The quick wit and banter. The plot.  I devoured Cole and Penelope's book in one afternoon because I just didn't want to stop reading their story.Cole and Penelope's relationship was lust at first sight but initially they stay just friends because of their delicate work situation.  Their personalities play off one another well and it created a fun dynamic.  But that connection was nothing compared the intensity of their feelings once they gave into the attraction they feel for one another.  That was truly spectacular.I think this author consistently creates characters that make you feel engaged with while you are reading their developing story - you want to be apart of their world. This group was seriously hilarious and entertaining.  After a few chapters, I wished I could just show up at the Oxford office so I could take the guys out for a beer (so I could flirt and drool). Or be friends with their wives so I could get invited to their dinner parties and gossip. (Their scheming and match making was the best!!) The scenes when they're just being friends, mocking and bantering with one another made laugh out loud.Irresistibly Yours is an awesome book and Lauren Layne is the master of writing fabulous romances.  Her characters gave me all of these great moments that made me happy plus a delectable love story that left me swooning.  I just loved it all.  I definitely suggest meeting Cole and Penelope as well as all of their friends - they are remarkable group of characters and have a can't miss romance.This book is a top recommendation from me and it already has me anticipating future books in the Oxford series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12ZBK413IYAL6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ONUYEZA#wasThisHelpful","R12ZBK413IYAL6","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"September had me emotionally revved up. Sweet Jesus. I was furious at Mia a few times – screaming at my tablet – DO NOT EFFING DO ANYTHING YOU’LL REGRET. It was stressful. I ended up binge eating all my kids snacks to help get over all the freaking drama Audrey Carlan decided to put me through this month.Yep. September gave me all kinds of the feels. Sad. Happy. Angry. Scared. Generally stabby.  That’s a lot for only 105 pages.So much occurred in a small amount of time. It felt like everyone was in some sort of crisis and Mia’s heartache filled the pages of this month.  It was an emotional ride and I desperately needed to know how all the various situations were resolved.  I think I devoured it all in less than an hour – September was incredible an reading experience.  It was suspenseful, entertaining and it left me curious what was next for Mia.The Calendar Girl novellas are hands down my favorite serial series and I’ve got everyone I know hooked to Mia’s year long adventure.  Every month has a fresh plot that carries certain elements forward from previous months.  You never know where the author is going to take Mia and you – it’s exciting and I absolutely love it.If you’ve some how stumbled across this novella and are unsure whether or not you want to start the series; I highly recommend that you take a chance and read the first few months because I believe that is all that it will take to make you a fan as well. Mia’s story is a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2254GPHYN4FJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013T97LTQ#wasThisHelpful","R2254GPHYN4FJH","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely adored The End Game.  It was entertaining and the characters were so driven that I couldn't help be captivated by the paths their lives were on.The book starts almost in the present and then it jets backwards a few years to when Brody and Jordan first met. Experiencing the two falling in love during their college years was fun and sweet but it was also incredibly tantalizing and alluring. Holy hotness!! It's excellent reading - definitely a book that you will not want to put down.The drama of their romance comes when the two move forward in their chosen careers.  Both are completely dedicated to competing in professional sports as well as to one another.  Except their new lifestyles tend to not allow for successful relationships. The physical distance is toppled with the pressure to excel and it all quickly becomes a heavy weight to carry.  How can you reach for a happily ever after with another when you are aiming for almost unreachable or unattainable stardom for yourself?!I thought that The End Game gave a realistic glimpse into what it's probably like for college athletes whose careers are turning professional. The hurdles and challenges are overwhelming but the author expressed it all well.  She created people that you felt such empathy for that as you read it felt like you were struggling through their issues with them.I was rooting for Jordan and Brody.  My heart was pounding for most of this book and I felt everything - the passion and the pain.  Highs and lows.  And I loved it all.I thought this was an awesome book.  It has everything you could ask for from a romance book - swoon worthy moments, laugh out loud scenes and amazing characters.  I highly recommend The End Game, get it today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZYNL2J8TIOHG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014IDFDQU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZYNL2J8TIOHG","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a few books from M.S. Parker and they are consistently intriguing stories filled with interesting characters. The Wicked books, her newest series might be my favorite one yet from her – simply because I could not get enough from the characters. Their story is intense and was always leading me down an unexpected path.  It is truly awesome.In the first book, you are introduced to all the various characters and learn about their connections to one another.  Shae and Allen have a basically happy marriage and normal life – all seems well with them both.So when the plot shifts, you feel completely blindsided.  The safe cocoon of their world is rocked and suddenly you are curious as to what the hell happened.  Everything you knew is gone and where you imagined the story was going to go is nothing like the genius the author wrote.  Again, it is awesome.Honestly, as someone who has read this entire series – my recommendation is to save yourself time and just purchase all three books now.  Thanks to the thrilling and jaw dropping conclusion, the instant you finish A Wicked Lie, you will want to know what happens next.Definitely check this series out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27JMT494ZSKLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013O29MXQ#wasThisHelpful","R27JMT494ZSKLQ","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely cannot miss out on anything Kindle Alexander writes.  Her romances are always AMAZING and her latest release, Closet Confession was everything I could have wanted from a novella.  I devoured it in one sitting and would definitely recommend it to fans of this author or to new readers interested in m/m romances.  It was filled to the brim with enticing men who are way sexy as well as incredibly sweet.The novella dives right into a busy evening at the ER with Dr. Derek Babineaux and Justin Delacroix. Their story alternates from both of their perspectives and they are equally intriguing people.  After a few chapters with them, I was ready to fake an illness and head to their hospital.  Because seriously - holy freaking hotness!!  Intelligent and altruistic men are completely alluring and arousing - especially when they want each other.  I loved these two!For the majority of the plot, it feels like Derek and Justin are strangers but then you realize there is much more to their connection.  Since this is a quick read, I don't want to give away too many details regarding what is going on with them but not knowing all the particular facts about their lives was a bit confusing at times. However, this was not a flaw for me - it only cemented my desire to know them better and to read faster.You definitely get to a point in Closet Confession when everything all just clicks into place.  There is just enough story to be satisfying without leaving you as a reader feeling like you need more time or history from the characters, Derek and Justin.  Plus, I loved that this novella was freaking erotic and realistic.  It hits on all the right whoa momma triggers and left me with a huge smile on my smile.  It's awesome reading and you will completely enjoy getting to know these men.I think that Kindle Alexander does an excellent job creating characters that you're easily invested in.  She does this by teasing and tantalizing you with their lives, making you want just a few more pages and private moments. Everything she has produced is a top recommendation from me, including Closet Confession. I highly suggest you read it today!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQTT7Q8I8MLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014RVEJ4U#wasThisHelpful","RWQTT7Q8I8MLW","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As I finished the latest Cold Fury Hockey book, Ryker, I realized had the biggest smile on my face. I felt satisfied and happy in that way only an awesome romance can make you feel. I was all melty and in love.  It was amazing.When I originally saw the information for Ryker’s book, I could not wait to read his story – although it might have had something to do with the cover. Holy freaking hotness.  But then I met him in Zack’s book and I desperately wanted more because I instantly liked him.  He was loyal, smart and funny – his personality was sincere. Even though he came to the team with a broken heart, his two kids and a ton of baggage; I knew he would be a strong leader as well as an amazing addition to the team.Gray Brannon was the mastermind of bringing Ryker to the Cold Fury team but that isn’t what has her standing out in this story.  Her father just promoted her to be the General Manager of the team and she is the first women to ever take on this position.  The pressure to succeed is intense and Gray does not want to let anyone down.  Not her father, the team or the fans.  So her attraction and connection to Ryker could not have come at a worst time.As the season continues, the two realize that they have to hide their relationship even though they both want to share what they have found with their friends and family. However, there it too much is on the line – championships, careers and ultimately public opinion of everyone involved.  It tugs at your heart and you constantly carry the hope that it all works out.  That some how they all end up winners in their individual lives and in love.Gray and Ryker’s love story unfolds exceptionally well and I could not put it down.  Every moment between the two captured my attention and their story deepened my affection for the players on this team.  I absolutely loved this book.I cannot recommend Ryker or this series enough.  Definitely become a Cold Fury hockey fan today!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NC40LUR4IEED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R04OXC0#wasThisHelpful","R3NC40LUR4IEED","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy crap. Being welcomed into Miguel and Blake's world (and their bedroom!!!!!) felt like a gift from the smutty book gods. Unsaid was filled with an oh so delicious and tantalizing plot as well as a spectacular love story.Fans of this series have been waiting a long time for Miguel and Blake's relationship to happen. We've been teased and tempted - desperate for this connection and attraction to no longer be ignored. And it was well worth the wait. Miguel and Blake are freaking intense sexy beasts who love fiercely and who like to play rough. They are perfect for one another.Thanks to a little interference from their friends, Miguel and Blake are given a chance to explore their chemistry. Except the road toward happily ever after for these two is a long and arduous one. They need to get past their previous relationship mistakes and their own individual fears. They have to learn how to be intimate with one another and most of all, they have to learn how to trust in love.Also thrown in for the reader's pleasure are updates on all that is Vive, Taddy and Lex - Blake's best friends. The drama and chaos of these four friend's lives on top of the boy's love story makes for such entertaining reading. I couldn't put the book down because of it.Overall, the sexual moments in Unsaid are incredible, but the storyline in the book is so much more. Miguel and Blake's romance balances between being hilarious to sexy - sweet to intense. I loved every moment of their journey. This book was seriously awesome and I highly recommend you check Unsaid out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FWH2F92QD8I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQS3NBA#wasThisHelpful","R12FWH2F92QD8I","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The conclusion to the Stark International trilogy, Under My Skin was incredible. J. Kenner not only wrapped up Jackson and Sylvia's story with the same passion that she started the series with - she exceeded all of my expectations.Diving back into their world, I remembered all that overwhelmed this couple. Criminal charges, extended families and their minor relationship issues. These two characters have to fight so hard just to enjoy their lives and one another. And the more I read, the more I honestly could not wait to see how Jackson and Sylvia would find their solace and get past all that troubled them.Their journey toward happily ever after goes back and forth quite a bit. Jackson struggles to depend on Sylvia because he fears his future; while Sylvia battles her own insecurities regarding what will become of their lives. With all that they have endured, you almost feel desperate for them because you feel their love for one another and it makes you want them to figure it all out.Overall, I truly liked this trilogy and how the plot played out. The characters and their drama kept me entertained for three books - I think I could have done without a few things but I am glad I found this series. It was an intense and passionate read - one that I definitely recommend you check it out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20S3N3KSYZTMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1DLIC#wasThisHelpful","R20S3N3KSYZTMY","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So many long, hidden truths were revealed this month.  It.  Was.  Freaking.  AWESOME.August picks up right where July left off - with a happy and settled Calendar Girl.  Mia's year long journey to pay off her father's debt is past the half way point and she's truly feels like she's taking her life in the direction she wants it to go.  She's excited about the future and eager to finish her last few jobs.This month, Mia is off to Texas to pretend to be a version of herself for a wealthy cowboy named Maxwell Cunningham.  (He needs someone with her name and birthday for a specific reason) Max and his family is very nice and welcoming to Mia - it almost feels like he wishes their lie was the truth.  And before long Mia does, too.  However, there is something a little off to the whole situation.As the story unfolds, you're emotionally drawn into Mia's life more so than previous months.  It wasn't all about Mia interacting with some hot, sexy man candy - a new and shocking reality hits her hard.  Everything Mia thought she knew about her life might just be a lie.It left me desperate for more. Honestly, I'm not sure how I am going to feel at the end of this series - I think I'm going to have to grieve the loss of Mia's debt and the end of her career as a escort. I anticipate each new month and it's because the latest release is always better than the last installment.The Calendar Girl series completely surprised me.  When I first heard about it, I didn't jump at reading it.  I figured it would just be 12 installments of same erotic sex scenes with 12 different strangers and I wasn't sure that I could read it without eventually judging Mia's character.  But Mia has had the most incredible odyssey of self discovery and I'm glad I'm on it with her.  It has been an especially entertaining and ever evolving storyline.I love it and the Calendar Girl series is a top recommendation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FO4H4UWNYOVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012PDB95O#wasThisHelpful","R1FO4H4UWNYOVW","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So if you ever meet me in real life, you will find that I have OCD.  I love order - I need everything to be black-and-white.  See a problem. Fix a problem.  (I totally appreciate the grey aspect of life but prefer structure) I tend to not be a fan of paranormal romance books because they go to places that my brain usually has difficulty accepting.  However, I find myself addicted to the Dr. Charlotte Stone series by Karen Robards and it's all about loving the most unavailable man ever.A quick refresher or introduction to this series.  Dr. Charlotte Stone aka Charlie is an expert in criminal pathology and she studies serial killers that are on death row at a local prison. (Sounds like a good time, right?!)  Anyway, Charlie met, interviewed and fell in love with Michael Garland - man convicted of murdering quite a few women.  However, he is now dead and comes to Charlie as a ghost. The man she is in love with is an apparition. A freaking ghost!!Anyway, moving forward in my review - we're onto book 4, The Last Time I Saw Her, the authors latest release in this series. Charlie has just returned home after helping the FBI with a case and her life is in shambles.  She's lost the love of her life and karma has placed what looks like his identical twin in her face. Feeling like she finally has the missing piece to the murders Michael was convicted of - she is on a mission to prove his innocence.Except it all goes to hell. Charlie's world becomes absolute chaos. As it unfolded, my jaw was on the ground and I was swept up into the drama. Charlie is in danger and trapped. She's putting so much fear and desolation out into the world that Michael feels it. And their love for one another is so powerful that even death cannot keep him from trying to save her.Everything that follows that moment on and until the end of the book is spectacular. Some scenes require you to suspend your disbelief in reality but you're so invested in this couple getting their happily ever after that you do it willingly.As a fan of romantic suspense books, there isn't a moment in this book or the other stories in this series that doesn't do it for me. The criminal mysteries are awesome. They're intense and captivating. The love between Michael and Charlie - it's the stuff that we romance lovers dream of. A love that cannot be forgotten and will follow us even if we are no longer of this world.So I guess I will leave my review with this - Karen Robards is a masterful writer.  Her books about Charlie and Michael are a top recommendation from me.  They make my heart pound because of the chemistry between the main characters and the from the undying connection they share.  Definitely don't miss out on The Last Time I Saw Her.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROLOTLHVRK4KG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PP3DN7Y#wasThisHelpful","ROLOTLHVRK4KG","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series is like a freaking onion - there are so many layers that you need to peel away to get towards the center and find the truth of Shae Lockwood's love life.Shae is trying to move forward and is learning to cope with shocking reality surrounding the death of her husband, Allen. She is struggling through the legal battle with Allen's family, mysterious threats and learning how to run their vineyard. Through it all, Jasper has been her friend and companion in grief. However, in the second book their relationship changes. It develops into something more and it felt like I could finally sigh in relief for Shae.That feeling did not last long.Because M.S. Parker hates Shae and is determined to put her through all kinds of hell. Although it sucks for her - it makes for crazy, entertaining reading.  This book's plot is seriously awesome and I devoured A Wicked Kiss in one sitting. I was on the edge of my seat, waiting for the next moment of passion or danger.  (The scene in the closet!!!!)I didn't think after the conclusion the first book, A Wicked Lie, that the deception or drama could get any crazier and then I finished A Wicked Kiss. Sweet Jesus. I still don't think I've picked up my jaw up off the ground. My inner romantic is determined that Shae finds some peace and happiness  because it refuses to believe there is any legitimacy to all that I fear about some characters.  Even though I have a few doubts (well planted seeds M.S), I will accept nothing less than a happily ever after.Overall, this book left me feeling desperate to get the final installment next month and find out the truth.A Wicked Kiss is not a standalone - you need to read A Wicked Lie first to understand all that is going on in the second installment.  I highly recommend you get caught up on this highly erotic suspense series today - then you will understand why I think it is a must read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37HT7E4DRWARA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CGOUOY#wasThisHelpful","R37HT7E4DRWARA","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise of this series is incredibly fun. Three wealthy, attractive playboys who are all best friends are going to have their feet knocked right out from beneath them by a little thing called love. The first book was awesome (I loved Shep!!) so I was desperately waiting for In the Dark - Gabe and Lucy's story.  I was slightly worried that I would not like it as much as I did Fair Game.  But I was wrong.  I LOVED Gabe.  He constantly surprised me and his romance with Lucy made me smile.Every summer, Gabe is required to spend time with his family.  He usually endures the time drinking and sleeping his way through the local female population - taking nothing seriously because his life is already planned for him.  He will work in the family business.  He will marry the appropriate woman and not only will she be 'perfect'  but she will also bring some sort of beneficial social or business connection for the Walker family.  The idea of it all makes he miserable.So when Gabe starts spying on the hottie who lives in the house beside their vacation home, he just thinks it will be another fling.  He has no clue that his heart has found his mate and there will be no other choice but to surrender to it.Lucy is the girl next door and she is nothing like Gabe assumed she is.  Funny and kind - you instantly like her. Plus she doesn't fall over herself to get Gabe's attention even though her heart pounds in her chest whenever he is near.  As their romance blooms, you're quickly enchanted by the couple. You are quickly caught up in their sexual chemistry and passion.  It is intense and exciting.But both Gabe and Lucy have secrets hanging over their heads.  You are anticipating the moment that their truths are revealed - that Gabe can only marry someone his family deems worthy and that Lucy's life is nothing like the image he has painted in his head.  Reality finds them both when they return to university in the fall.  When it all falls apart, you're holding your breath.  Hopeful that they can work it all out and find their happily ever after together.Monica Murphy's In the Dark captured the feeling of being young and how it felt to have a summer romance that was suddenly so much more.  It was spectacular.  I highly suggest you read it as well as the other books in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4854S4WKE3UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TL9S4U#wasThisHelpful","R4854S4WKE3UP","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am squealing out loud while doing the Larry/Balky Dance of Joy. I LOVED JULY!!This month we are off to Miami for an adventure with the super enticing and amazing Anton Santiago. He was so completely different from what I expected and I absolutely loved him for it. Her time spent with Anton provides Mia with a safe harbor to overcome and heal from all that happened last month.  Her transformation emotionally from the start of the book to the end is incredible.But that isn’t what has me so freaking giddy.Each month in the Calendar Girl series readers have been introduced to new and for the most part fabulous characters. Individually and as a whole they have impacted Mia’s life. However, there has been one person who changed the course of her life more than anyone else.  In July, a huge part of the storyline is about Mia being honest with herself and with him.It’s a huge leap of faith for her. And it is FREAKING AWESOME!!July might have been my favorite month but the lead into August has me stalking Audrey Carlan for teasers and hits.  I can’t wait to read it – this storyline just keeps getting better and better!

"I LOVED this book – Chaos seriously rocks.Each time Jamie Shaw releases a new book in the Mayham series, I anticipate how she will outdo the previous story.  I get absolutely consumed with each book’s plot and even when I think her romances can’t get any better, they always do.  With her latest release, Chaos, this author gave me everything I wanted as a romance reader and more.Kit Larson is incredibly bad ass. Fierce. In Chaos, she has decided come hell or high water that she is going to achieve her dreams – she wants to be a professional guitarist with the band The Last Ones to Know. But more than that – she’s wants to be a freaking rock star.There are only a few obstacles standing in her way.  Because even though her goals are her own and she will achieve them – her life is now entwined with that of Shawn Scarlett. The only other item her heart desperately aches for and craves.Kit and Shawn as well as the other members of the band went to the same high school.  However, other than one moment in time, they have no ties or history between themselves. But in the present, they develop a friendship and connect on a deeper level because of their love for music. They mesh together like they’re two parts of the same whole.It’s spectacular reading. But not nearly as amazing as the moments when Kit and Shawn give into their attraction for one another. The passion and lust – you feel it to your core.  I could not stop reading their book because I craved more from them.* * * * *The thought of being trapped on a tour bus – even one filled with ridiculously hot men – for any extended period time does not sound enticing.  At all.  However every time I join The Last Ones to Know on tour, I realize something. I would totally run over my grandmother to spend time with this band.It’s because they make me laugh. They make me swoon. They get my ladies bits tingling. I devour every moment in these books and I am often ready to start all over again once I reach the last page. It’s awesome.Chaos was a great addition to the series and is a top recommendation from me.  Definitely take the time to read the Mayhem series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W2RB92CYG0N0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N81I66I#wasThisHelpful","R3W2RB92CYG0N0","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Secret Sister is the perfect example of how a well written book can mix a dramatic and  suspenseful tragedy with a sweet and romantic love story. The author plays the two aspects off one another, intensifying the characters connection to each other - creating a more solid bond as well as entertaining plot.Maisey returned home to help her brother overcome his personal issues but maybe more so to try and heal herself. The last few years of her life have been more than a little painful. She lost a everything she held dear. She hopes coming back her childhood home will help her reconnect to who she once was and to find a bit of solace.However, she discovers more than she ever bargained for. First Maisey stumbles upon Rafe, a boy she briefly knew a life time ago and the man he has become is someone she cannot forget or ignore. Then she discovers the possibility of a murdered sibling she never knew she had. All of this is coupled with her reunion with her not so lovely and very controlling mom.It soon felt like Maisey was questioning everything but finding very few answers. It's the perfect storm of plot chaos but it works. Each scene flows into the next and there is never a spot where you want to stop reading. It all works out beautifully and it's why Brenda Novak is one of my favorite authors - her storylines are simply incredible.I seriously devoured The Secret Sister and I highly recommend it. It's a great book and one you definitely want to read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CEIS13BAS3BM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S503T50#wasThisHelpful","R1CEIS13BAS3BM","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy freaking hotness - I want my own Woolf Jennings.  Or maybe just a night or two at his club.  Wooziers - this man is one sexy cowboy and I cannot wait to get more from this series.  Sawyer Bennett's Wicked Fall was a tempting and passionate read - one that will ignite your desires and get your lady bits tingling.If you've read Shaken Not Stirred, you were already been introduced to Woolf. However, during Tenn's romance you never got a good feel for what was going on in his life - he was just portrayed as a wealthy player unwilling to settle down.His book, Wicked Fall is the start of the Wicked Horse Series and it is awesome.  You quickly learn that Woolf has a lot on his plate and it's not that he doesn't want to take on responsibility of his family's business, he just wants to make sure that he is also fulfilling his dreams.Driven by his own sexual curiosity and life style, Woolf expands his brand to own a bar as well as a sexual fantasy club with his closest friend. He thinks his life is now perfect - he finally has everything he ever desired.So karma hands him Callie. This spitfire storms back into his life and turns him inside out. Their feelings for one another run deep and have been ignored for a really long time. So when they give into their lust - it's explosive. Intense. Carnal.Their love story is exciting and I absolutely devoured every page. Because when Sawyer Bennett wants her characters to get naughty and downright sexually erotic - she nails it. EVERY SINGLE TIME. But she always balances it out with the right amount of romance and sweetness. It makes your heart beat a little bit faster and reminds you of what it feels like to be swept up in love.It's for all of these reasons, Wicked Fall is a top recommendation from me.

"Argggg!! So I devoured this book. It had a suspenseful plot filled with surprises and plot twists that left my jaw on the ground.  I really liked Relinquished and would recommend you check it out.Jules' world was dark and dingy.  It's a sad place that you desperately want to rescue her from.  This is coupled with her HORRIFIC past.  She is barely surviving and the only potential bright light in her life is her budding friendships with Holden and his brother, Dante.  They are the first people to ever show her any kindness, ever.  Their book is exciting and a bit thrilling.I did struggle a bit with the character's connections and the way the author shared their thoughts.It is Jules' story and it is told from both her perspective as well as Dante's.  So I honestly felt confused - the author was telling me about this romantic bond between Holden and Jules. Yet, she was sharing Dante's voice and story - one that was only connected to the suspense plot but not romantically.  I was baffled - I didn't know if eventually there was going to be an awkward love triangle or what was going on.  It left me with a weird feeling as I read.However, the book's plot plays out incredibly well.  The way the author blows everything you think you know up is amazing.  It almost completely redeemed the awkwardness for me.  It definitely made the story interesting.Relinquished is an entertaining story and my minor issues with the book should not discourage you from reading it.  It really is an awesome story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2054F7WFK8G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010YRNCSK#wasThisHelpful","R2V2054F7WFK8G","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mia Kayla is new to me author but after reading her latest release The Scheme, I'm now a huge fan. Her book was so much fun to read and I highly recommend you check it out.The Scheme's plot is all about Kendy landing her perfect man. She moved to New York for a job and to fulfill an old prophecy given to her by a psychic when she was a teenager. She has it in her head that a certain doctor is everything she wants and needs.Enter Brian - an old acquaintance from back home.When an opportunity arises to make Dr. Hot Pants jealous - she jumps at the chance to use Brian in an attempt to get what she desires. However, it turns out completely different than Kendy expected.  Brian and Kendy start spending their free time together and then their feelings and desires erupt - almost uncontrollable in nature.  It's confusing for the two but awesome to experience.  I loved it!!Brian and Kendy's romance was light hearted and sweet. Their ploy to entice the good doctor is filled with hilarity and you know what will eventually become of the two. But that doesn't make their journey any less enjoyable or boring. Their quick wit and banter pulls you in and you're completely enchanted by their relationship.I absolutely adored this story.  It was entertaining and a must read for any fans of contemporary romance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSABMTZWE6CRO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012LE38CO#wasThisHelpful","RSABMTZWE6CRO","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The latest release in the Knights Rebels series, Desertion, is a book I have been dying to get my hands on.  I desperately wanted Jesse's story and to meet the woman who would kick all the floozies out of his bed.  I knew when I started it would be entertaining and erotic - how could it not be?!?  This was Jesse.  But his story turned out to be so much more than I could have ever expected - I loved it.Jesse and Bell are two characters who are barely living.  They are hiding so much sadness and despair from their friends and family because have just accepted their fate... that true happiness is not in their future. Even though they find solace and incredible passion with one another - I wondered if they would be able to help permanently soothe each other's inner demons.Because Jesse doesn't want to forgive himself for things that's were beyond his control and Bell refuses to stop trying to make up for a lost life. Their journey wasn't about anticipating them surrendering to their lust because they did that easily. It was more about the moment they would finally move past their pain and accept that they deserved love and comfort.It was what made their romance feel so powerful and had me devouring their story. I was rooting for them to succeed and to find their happily ever after together. It's an awesome story.I have enjoyed all the books in the Knights Rebels series. I think it is because of River Savage's characters - she creates these raw and intense people and you're drawn into their world. Once I meet them, they always crack open my heart and sneak inside, captivating me with their abrasive personalities. Because beyond all the gruff, they are the most loyal men who love with all of their hearts - even before they realize they're doing it.It makes for a highly entertaining reading experience that you really don't want to miss out on.  Definitely check out the men and women of the Knights Rebels MC series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW46U6UT4317K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3GI5MC#wasThisHelpful","RW46U6UT4317K","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent last week dialed into the violent and gritty world of Amity Cross's Royal Blood series. It's a dark environment filled with seriously nefarious characters.  A place where no one seems safe and where situations are so bad, people are risking everything to be free of it. However, I loved being there. I was completely immersed in Mercy and Xavier's romance because their love and relationship was this strangely beautiful light the shined through the chaos of it all.The latest installment in this series, Devil's Blood, didn't feel like it was about revenge as much as the previous books. It was more about this duo finding their new normal. Xavier and Mercy are unsettled - where do they go now?  They struggled quite a bit emotionally and to move forward but they had some major roadblocks in their way. It almost made me feel like their love wasn't going to be enough and it only made me root for them more.And then the Amity drop kicked the plot into high gear and everything goes to absolute hell for the couple. It was amazing.  I was on the edge of my seat worried for them and where I was once only curious about their future, I now was terrified that they might never get their happily ever after.I shouldn't have worried.  The way the author concluded their story was incredible - it unfolds in a manor that leaves you feeling addicted.  I devoured page after page and I loved every single moment in this book.I thought Devil's Blood is intense and emotionally charged. The sexual connection between Xavier and Mercy alone will leave you panting and wanting more. Add to that the drama and suspense surrounding Xavier's past and you're unable to put Devil's Blood down. It is an awesome book and I highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EK413S7Q2XBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RX1Z94#wasThisHelpful","R1EK413S7Q2XBA","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet Jesus – what have you done to me, Tracie Redmond!?!  I am suffering from a crazy book hangover. Her book, Guided Love has me wanting to drop f-bombs left and right because this book infuriated me. It’s characters made me swoon. They made me laugh. And cry.  ARGGG!!  It created a mother load of feelings within me.I am not even sure where I want to start this review – so much happens in this book.  The gist of it all is that Sam is in love with her best friend, Camaron and he is a giant, selfish prick.  I wanted to lambaste him for his horrendous behavior. Seriously. He is the worst best friend ever. EVER. He made my heart ache for Sam.And let me just state for the record, I wanted to smack Sam upside the back of her head for seventy percent of this book. Or kick her in the shins really hard. And then I wanted to give her a bear hug. This girl, Sam was amazing. Smart. Loving. Hilarious. Yet, Sam had absolutely no self-confidence and every single time she accepted less than her worth, I wanted to kick her butt.However, the person I actually wanted to hurt was Camaron. I disliked him more than any book character I have meet in a while. No, that isn’t true – I absolutely hated Roni.  I think I’d like to harm Roni. (I told you this book made me impassioned – now I want to beat up these made up characters!!)Thank goodness all of this is balanced out with Axel.  Oh my swoon worthy man.  I loved him.  I would take a million scenes with Camaron and Roni just to get a few more with him and Samantha.  He was sweet and loyal.  Badass.  Enticing and sexy.  Did I say I loved him yet – because I did – I LOVED this character.All that Sam and this misfit gang of pricks endure – good or bad – captivates your attention. I especially thought Sam’s journey toward finding herself and then love was incredible.  The life she creates versus the one she expected will leave you feeling proud.  It is an awesome story and I can’t wait to read more. Don’t miss out on this experience.  Read Guided Love now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMA32BJB84PGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010O2Q57A#wasThisHelpful","RMA32BJB84PGF","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sweet mother of all things tempting.  I am completely addicted to The Scene series and I am PRAYING that certain people are not who they are be alluded to being.I thought the follow up installment in The Scene series was much more intense than the first one.  It feels like Nicole is digging deeper and deeper into the mystery that is her brother's death, only to find out she might not truly want to learn what happened. What should be helping her find peace is creating havoc in her life.However, that is nothing compared to her confusion about of her connection and attraction to Xavier.  Her brain is telling her one thing but her heart and body are telling it to shut the hell up.  She can't resist him and when she gives into her lust for him - wooziers - it's all kinds of erotic hotness.I am seriously loving the excitement and intrigue of it all.  The second part in the Scene series moved along swiftly and the reader is given a lot more details of Eli's life and his death.  We're introduced to a few more characters and it ended on a bit of a terse note.  I'm not sure how all of this is going to play out, but I honestly cannot wait to read it.I definitely suggest you purchase and read The Scene serial series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ROCAATASNJG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0125RC6Q6#wasThisHelpful","R3ROCAATASNJG5","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely loved A Taste of Summer. This book created a slow aching burn in my chest the entire time I was reading it.  I couldn't put it down and it is a top recommendation from me.Summer and Carrie Ann fell madly in love while they were in college. They were each other's everything until their world crumbled when things didn't go exactly as they planned.  Ten years have passed since then and Summer has decided it is well past the time to fix their relationship. He wants Carrie Ann back and is ruthless in his dedication to prove himself and his love.Except Carrie Ann is holding on tightly to her pain and a few secrets.  Even though no one has touched her the way Summer did all those years ago, she is stubborn in her refusal to forgive.  It left me wondering and anticipating what would be the moment when Summer finally reached her.  What would it take for her to forgive and more forward?!I felt so much while reading their story that my heart hurt.  I felt the anxiety and stress of their reunion as well as the passionate connection that could not be ignored between these two main characters. Their journey was emotional and painful at times but their moments of sweetness blew me away.  I laughed out loud at the witty banter.  I shed a tear when I learned the truth of their destruction. Basically, I fell in love with Carrie Ann and Summer.Each book in this series is incredible.  To experience the romance and attraction between Beverly's characters is something you do not want to miss out on. Their stories unfold well and I am always caught up in the drama as well as the love story.  Definitely check out the Mathews Family series, especially A Taste of Summer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26T44QKBJHW0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111N2CO6#wasThisHelpful","R26T44QKBJHW0W","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Holy hotness. I didn't think that Dex and Raine's romance could get any more intense or erotic - but I was completely wrong.  Not only did their book get my lady bits tingling and my heart pounding but it also kept me on the edge of my seat - captivated and entertained by the suspenseful sub-plot.  The conclusion to their story was incredible and everything I could have wanted for this couple.Devouring Raine essentially picks right up where Taming Dex ended. The band is almost finished with their tour and all seems well. Dex and Raine's connection feels more solidified, thanks to their budding Dom/Sub relationship and the fact that they have no secrets between them.  They give and take what they need. Not in a selfish way but more so because they find solace in each other.Their second book's storyline moves quickly. Moving around between their training (which is highly arousing and seductive) to the unfolding drama of Raine's stalker issues (which was the right level of scary and tenseness). It's all seriously awesome. Both sides of the story balance well - escalating at a dramatic pace without it feeling overwhelming. It all just pulls you toward a thrilling and epic conclusion.I loved the addition of this couple's love story to the 69 Bottles series. I never reached a point where I wanted to leave Dex and Raine's world.  I would definitely recommend both Taming Dex and then Devouring Raine - they are can't miss reading!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYMZQR43A68ZX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010D0IEQ8#wasThisHelpful","RYMZQR43A68ZX","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was consumed by the second book in the Capital Confessions series.  Playing with Trouble was an incredibly fun and sexy read that I devoured in one sitting.  Blaire and Gray’s passionate journey toward finding happiness and solace in their lives is one you do not want to miss out on.I loved how nothing about this affair on paper makes sense.  Their student/teacher connection makes a relationship taboo.  The age difference is a stumbling block.  Yet when the two are together, it feels so right and so unavoidable. I was rooting for them.Blaire and Gray are at Hannover Law School rebuilding their lives – basically hiding out from their own harsh realities.  They’re both desperate to end the chaos of their lives. So they have carefully crafted plans to overcome their very public reputations and to secure their futures – all in hopes of finding a little bit of normalcy. They thought they could just lay low and regroup.  Neither one of them was expecting to find someone to care about or to experience the intense lust they feel when they meet.  It’s overwhelming and they almost have no clue what to do with it all.Their lives are a hot mess of drama.And the longer I spent inside of Blaire’s world, the more it felt like I was looking at a picture in a coloring book. Blaire’s picture (aka her life) has been completed as it was expected of her – delicately colored within the lines and done to perfection. Except Blaire’s life has been rocked and she was pushed to color outside lines. Her imagine will never be exactly as it was originally designed but the longer Blaire looks, the more she likes it the way it is. It makes her want to chase after what she desires and needs – Gray.  I loved it.I seriously could not get enough of this duo.  Every scene with Blaire and Gray kept a smile on my face.  Whether they were in class using verbal banter as their foreplay or being privy to their private sexual thoughts and actions – it all left me completely entertained and wanting more because their passion for one another jumps off the page.  They capture your attention and makes your lady bits tingle.  It is spectacular.Playing with Trouble is a top recommendation from me, as was the first book, Flirting with Disaster.  Definitely check out the Capital Confessions series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XX6E6TO6KE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TY3ZNRY#wasThisHelpful","R3XX6E6TO6KE","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fighting Fate is not your typical happily ever after feel good romance book. The hero doesn't court his lady love. He doesn't bring her flowers or take her on glamorous dates but Ivy and Dax's journey together makes you enchanted anyway and somehow that makes you appreciate their love for one another so much more.Ivy and Dax are strong-willed survivors whose relationship starts with a crazy and intense situation. Nothing about their circumstance is normal and they are both trapped in their current predicament.  While this makes them understand each other better, there is a hesitation to truly commit. They know the other will manipulate and mold themselves to be whatever the situation calls for so they both worry that they are being emotionally deceived.Neither knows what is real or how a future together could be possible. Yet, you feel their connection and it snatches a hold of your attention until the very last page.  Scarlett Finn's characters are incredibly entertaining.I absolutely loved how the author has the plot playing out.  The couple's feelings had me feeling wooed and curious - I was devouring page after page - I mean, how can something beautiful be created out of something horrific?! I thought Fighting Fate's tale was a dark, twisted story that was completely seductive and highly erotic. It's awesome.I definitely suggest you meet this duo - their book is one you will not forget.

"Have you ever read a book that you absolutely loved and wanted everyone to read but you’re not totally sure how to express the genius hidden between the covers without sharing the plot twists?!? That’s me right now. This book blew me away. The romance between Alexis and Oliver in King of Hearts went beyond all of my expectations. I absolutely adored their story.Right from the start, I was amused and entertained by Alexis and Oliver. Their quick wit and banter made me giggle and I was crushing hard on the two. I thought they were both charming and incredibly engaging. I loved every moment they pushed each other’s boundaries while fighting their attraction and lust for one another. I highly anticipated the moment their relationship would change from coworkers to lovers.It was evident from the start that Alexis and Oliver belonged together but their journey toward happily ever after was not at all what I envisioned after reading the book’s blurb. The hardships and troubles that they had to overcome tugged at my heart and endeared their characters to me. It’s truly a spectacular story.King of Hearts is a top recommendation for me.

"When I first started reading, I wasn't sure how invested I would be with the characters and plot in Mine. I was worried after the first few chapters that it was just going to be a quick novella filled with a erotic scenes and vulgar words but not a whole lot more. Don't get me wrong - that type of story is entertaining but I like my serial series to be more. I need to truly be enticed into wanting the next installment. My mind needs to be tempted while my lady bits are tingling.So I was more than pleasantly surprised when I kept reading Mine. The characters turned out to be alluring as well as arousing. Nixon and Brooklyn share an undeniable connection - one you want to spend more time with. It's awesome.They both clearly carry emotional scars from their pasts and have too many secrets. I felt more than curious to know them better - by the end I was desperate for more and for them to give into their attraction to one another.  These two - holy hotness!!

"Inside Game was everything I wanted and could have asked for in a sports romance book. Dramatic. Suspenseful.  Intoxicating.I have been waiting for this book since I started reading about the men of the New York Kings baseball team. I was more than a little curious to know what was going on with Drake Schultz. Why was he so bitter and angry? Had he been scorned by a woman? Was he living with a terrible secret or tragedy from his past? What made him so mean? But more than wanting to know all of that, I was desperate to meet the person who would help him heal.Drake's story was awesome. Not only did my opinion of him change completely, I ended up really liking this character.  He earned my respect which surprised me after reading the other books.  With each new chapter, I had a better insight to what caused his issues and life complications. It's an incredible plot.Drake's drama is coupled with his budding romance with Eva, his sober companion. Eva has no clue what she has meant to Drake over the years but she's nervous about what she is becoming to him now because their relationship cannot happen.  She's committed to helping him even at the cost of her own feelings.  The two fighting their lust is almost as spectacular as when they give into it.Their story makes for an exceptional read.  It's intense and enticing.  The connection between Drake and Eva leaps off the page and you feel their attraction to one another.  I absolutely loved it and definitely suggest you check it out.  Inside Game is a top recommendation from me as are all of the other books in this series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5LKY5A26KDR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BZHTGQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L5LKY5A26KDR","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Roxy Sloane is an word temptress. No wait - she's more like a dealer and she has made me a junkie to her product. Her characters and their worlds - sweet Jesus. Addicted doesn't seem to be a strong enough description to what I feel when I read her various series and I always need more.The first installment in The Scene was freaking enticing - thanks to the introduction of Nicole to Xavier.  Holy hotness.  (Plan to have your panties incinerated.) Roxy lures the reader into their lives with each page - curious to know more about them. To learn their secrets and to find out what happened to Nicole's brother. It is awesome.The Scene reads quickly and ends with a jaw dropping cliff-hanger that wasn't surprising but still left me squealing. That's the power of Roxy's stories. What should be predictable is entertaining.  I love it.Every time Roxy writes a new serial series, I make myself a promise. Don't start reading it until all the parts have been released. Save yourself the anxiety and stress of craving something you absolutely cannot get your hands on for weeks.Then I remember, I'm a junkie and I ignore my promises. I can't help myself - I love being addicted to her words. The anticipation and excitement of not knowing when I'll be cut off, makes each scene feel more intense - it's why everything Roxy Sloane writes is a must read.

"Laguna Nights was more than a sweet and sexy second chance romance. It is a well written book that will capture your attention and a bit of your heart.  The two main characters, Josh and Madison were high school sweethearts whose relationship was destructed in a very public and heart-aching way. Laguna Nights is their story about healing and finding their way back to one another.When they are reunited it seems like fate is stepping in to right past wrongs. However, as I read more, I felt confused. It seemed like there is something underhanded going on behind the scenes.  It had me devouring chapter after chapter - trying to understand what really is going on. I was not sure if I could trust what the characters were saying and doing. There is a lot going on in this book.It makes for entertaining reading.The plot unfolds well and by the time you reach the conclusion you're very much enchanted by Josh and Madison. You will experience a full range of emotions with these two - it's great.  I ended up rooting for them and wanted them to find their happily ever after moment.Overall, Laguna Nights is a very enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA46T63LS2UBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YT5S482#wasThisHelpful","RA46T63LS2UBC","A3151TYHOMY2CK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3151TYHOMY2CK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am absolutely loving Harper Sloan's spinoff series Hope Town. The children of the Corps Security men and women are just as fabulous and enticing as their parents were - if not more. The second installment in this series, Bleeding Love was spectacular. The entire time I was reading my heart was pounding, excited and happy to be falling in love with Liam and Megan.This book was honestly so much fun to read. Liam Beckett is on a mission. He spent his entire life watching his parents be completely in love and has been searching for the same type of connection and affection for himself. He knew instantly upon meeting Megan again that she was his one. So be prepared to swoon - Liam is going to melt your heart and his charming ways will wreck you for all other book boyfriends.It's completely an uphill battle to win Megan's heart. Her character is grieving and scared to truly live. I wanted to give her a hug and then shove her into Liam's bed. Not just for her - I wanted to be there too - listening to Lee whisper his desires and all of his naughty thoughts.Their journey together moves swiftly and before you know it you devoured their entire story.

"My wife liked these teardrop gold earrings and found that they are of generally good quality and more importantly, look nice. The earrings are not large at all and fit comfortably. All in all, a nicely crafted earring at a reasonable cost.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K7S3EETY8GJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX6MME4#wasThisHelpful","R3K7S3EETY8GJR","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great overview of the band that covers the 1974-1980 timeframe which finds the group at the height of their cultural influence. I generally liked the track selection, although I was never fond of Audio Visions (1980) so those tracks did nothing for me. Overall, the emphasis of this 2 CD set is on their progressive material; the ""boogie"" tracks are not represented.The tracks are presented chronologically and are largely taken from the studio albums with the exception of a single demo (Can I Tell You); a ""new"" track written in 1994; and live versions of Death of Mother Nature Suite, Incomudro: Hymn to the Atman, and On the Other Side. The sound quality of the live tracks is not bad, although the sound level varies a bit track to track.As a long-time fan of progressive music, it is the lengthier tracks that hold my attention, although the playing is top notch on just about everything they released (yes, even the ""boogie"" tracks). One thing that I loved about Kansas was their ability to make a 7 or 8 minute song seem to last for 20 minutes - they did this with a lot of instrumental preludes and interludes.  I also liked the energy of their music - these guys could simply rip, even in 7/8. Because the tracks are laid out chronologically, you can hear the gradual shift from more complex arrangements to a more straightforward approach by 1980.  I am of the opinion that the group hit an absolute peak in 1976-1977 with Leftoverture and Point of Know Return, respectively. I also enjoyed the Monolith album (1979), which is represented by three tracks. The last track on the set was written specifically for this box set and it is really nice; I prefer it over the three selections from Audio Visions.This ""box set"" is generally nice and features an informative booklet with photos of the group.  The sound quality is not bad at all, although there are issues with the sound level across tracks. Then again, this set predates the remasters so the sound quality is not as good as it could be. I should note that there are other compilations out there that offer better sound quality (Kansas: The Ultimate Collection comes to mind). I just got this box set for the demo, live tracks, and the new track Wheels.All in all, this is a great compilation of some of the finest material released by Kansas during their heyday. I now realize, some 30 or so years after the fact, that Kansas made a truly original contribution to progressive rock. If you are new to the group, you can't go wrong with this compilation. It does a good job of summing up their unique combination of sophisticated arrangements; blistering hard rock; and insightful lyrics that address the spiritual quest. Recommended along with the following albums: Kansas (1974); Masque (1975); Song for America (1975); Leftoverture (1976); Point of Know Return (1977); the live album Two for the Show (1978); and Monolith (1979).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5NPJ7263L3J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002ALT#wasThisHelpful","RQ5NPJ7263L3J","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife has been using this iHealth device for about two weeks now and generally likes it. The device tracks her steps per day, and total distance traveled; I do have issues that the unit will record a ""step"" just by moving your arm somewhat vigorously. This shortcoming aside, my wife finds that the unit motivates her to do more steps and believes that the output is accurate. After installing an app on her phone, my wife can now view historical data and track her progress. Apart from my issue with inaccurate data, two inconveniences that she noted was that (1) the instruction booklet is not the easiest to follow and (2) it is very hard to read the device in the sun.All in all, this is a decent way of keeping fit and tracking your progress as you go. My wife certainly likes it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W2BS3J03PY7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPUEWD2#wasThisHelpful","R1W2BS3J03PY7K","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This twister set is a lot of fun for our kids (ages 7 and 8), although it is a bit annoying for certain adults.  Ok ok, my wife and I found the music to be irritating - it is not particularly pleasant sounding to my ears and it is pretty loud.  The annoyances with the music aside, the game is a lot of fun to play; especially with two players.  The game is easy to set up and seems fairly sturdy - this is important because there is a lot of foot stomping involved.  The unit takes 3 AA batteries.All in all, this is a neat variation on the classic Twister game.  Although I prefer the old version (the mat on the floor), this should prove to be a lot of fun for the kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6XHHDC4M03GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SDJG5FE#wasThisHelpful","R6XHHDC4M03GJ","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a decent grill that we have used for a variety of foods including chicken breasts, hamburgers, grilled sandwiches etc. Because we use this indoors, I was a little concerned about smoke issues, but there are none, at least when preparing the food.  I should note that the grill smoked quite a bit when I first turned it on - rather, I plugged it in (there is no on/off switch).  I unplugged the unit, let it cool, wiped it down with a wet paper towel, and plugged it back in - that took care of the ""smoking"" issues. The overall construction of the grill is a bit cheap, but sturdy enough for general use. It is pretty easy to clean.All in all, this is a good grill suitable for indoor use. Just make sure to wipe it down thoroughly before use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LHCOYDSV3PRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","R2LHCOYDSV3PRB","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our 7 year old daughter loved this Anna and Elsa tandem bicycle set. She was also delighted that it came with Olaf to ride in the basket in the front of the bike. The details of the bike are also pretty cool  - Anna and Elsa fit snugly into the bike pedals and move their legs when the pedals are moved. The music from the movie only plays when a button is pressed - short snippets only (maybe 10-15 seconds tops).  Overall, the quality of the toy is very good.All in all, this is a great toy for all fans of Disney's Frozen - our daughter is apparently obsessed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q6YKPF5V0981/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7FDM60#wasThisHelpful","R2Q6YKPF5V0981","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife seems to like this skin toner.  She has found that it leaves her skin looking smoother without irritating or drying her skin out.The toner has a light ""floral"" scent that is not overpowering, with just the slightest hint of witch hazel. I also smelled a touch of isopropyl alcohol - there are alcohols in the toner including benzyl alcohol. Apart from some useless information regarding the percentage of natural ingredients (including those derived from organic farming), the composition of the mixture is not clearly printed on the side of the container. So, unfortunately, the consumer does not know what relative percentage the alcohols comprise (shooting from the hip, I can't imagine it is >1%).  Suffice it to say, that if you are sensitive to alcohols, this might not be the best skin toner for you. There are, in fact, alcohol-free alternatives out there that may be a bit cheaper.The toner has the consistency of water, so the application is neat and does not stain clothing. My wife has found that she does not need to apply a lot, so this 200 milliliter (6.8 fluid ounce) container has lasted a long time.All in all, this is good skin toner that has a light, pleasant fragrance. The toner is easy to apply, neat, and despite the presence of alcohols, has not dried my wife's skin out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCPS4HHOK26YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WB85VV2#wasThisHelpful","RCPS4HHOK26YJ","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our 7 year old daughter loves this toothbrush. It used to be the case that brushing teeth was a chore where we had to...pull teeth just to get the brushing done. Fortunately, the interactive part of the toothbrush keeps her engaged by allowing her to watch short videos on her iPad that show her how to brush. Although there were some slight hiccups downloading the application to the iPad, the problems were solved quickly.I think that the blending of an interactive video with what is such a mundane chore was actually kind of clever.  It has certainly made the bedtime process that much smoother - that, and she is now brushing her teeth regularly and actually enjoying it.All in all, this is a great tool for getting the kids interested in brushing their teeth. It certainly worked wonders with our children.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24J22HRYFWF6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR7ZL6#wasThisHelpful","R24J22HRYFWF6X","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1969 release is fantastic.  Over the years I must have listened to this thousands of time - and I never get tired of it. For me, the appeal lies with the energy of the music, and the fact that the distinctive sound of the group had gelled.  This was riff-heavy bravado, yet with a subtlety and sophistication that would characterize their later output.Some of my favorite tunes are on this album including the bass guitar-heavy The Lemon Song, Ramble On, and the delicate Thank You.  Overall, the music presents a nice balance of heavy riffs and some quieter moments.  There are also nods in the direction of jazz-rock (What is What Should Never Be), some classical (Thank You) and English folk rock (the introduction to Ramble On. Although some of the lyrics are not to my liking (The Lemon Song comes to mind), there are the first signs of the middle earth references that would be in full bloom on later albums.  Ramble On comes to mind, where Robert Plant sings of meeting a girl in darkest Mordor, only to have her run off with Gollum. The blending of the Lord of the Rings with some of the uh, cheekier lyrics on the album makes for an interesting combination.The version of the CD that I own is the 1994 remaster, so this review should not be confused with any other version floating around out there - and there are several.  The sound quality is not bad, although there appears to be some distortion on a few tracks - this is especially apparent on sections where the drums, bass, and electric guitar are going full steam ahead. There is not much in the way of liner notes, although the inner gatefold was reproduced (based on what I remember of my old and dearly departed LP).All in all, this is one of my favorites from the group.  It has power. It has emotion. It screams, breathes, and sweats. And above all else, it just plain rocks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAOLWTNFVLTY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002J03#wasThisHelpful","R2LAOLWTNFVLTY","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great charger cable that we use to charge our Apple devices including iPhones and iPads. The sturdy construction is a welcome feature - we seem to destroy charger cables at an alarming rate - the kids just wreak havoc on them.  The cable is long enough so that you can charge your device using those out-of-reach sockets while simultaneously using the iPad or other device - no need to stash the iPad out of reach.

"This Queen Size Serta Regular 9"" Stabl-Base Foundation was delivered in a large box. The mattress itself was covered in plastic which was a nice touch. Although the boxspring is light, it is bulky which makes maneuvering up the stairs a little difficult. Furthermore, because the boxspring is rigid, there is no way that it would make it up a really tight stairwell.  This is just food for thought though and not so much a criticism.The boxspring is sturdy and can stand up to the rigors of two children jumping up and down on it.  The colored pattern along the side is a nice touch too, although it helps if you have a nice bed frame and nothing under the bed.  We used light cloth ""concealers"" to cover our old box spring and the junk under the bed. We still use the concealer though - it just looks a little nicer.All in all, this is a nice boxspring from one of the better manufacturers out there. Although there does not seem to be an appreciable difference from our old boxspring, it certainly does its job well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TVTXLZ7AZLN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WO0THBW#wasThisHelpful","R3TVTXLZ7AZLN3","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife used these patches to address a few wrinkles around the forehead and mouth. The gel patches were a departure for my wife, who typically uses a cream or serum. As she described, the patches were applied for 10 minutes and felt cool on the skin. There was also a slight tingling sensation. Nothing too horrific though - even when left on for longer than the suggested 10 minute application time.

"This live 1981 release came out at a time when I had just discovered Rush and culls performances from the Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures tours of 1980/1981. I had attended the Moving Pictures tour (and the subsequent Signals tour in 1982, which was my last Rush concert). As such, I found that this album brought back some fond memories and is a great souvenir from a time when Rush made some of my favorite music.The track selection is great and Exit...Stage Left could easily double as an excellent compilation.  The fact that the sound quality is so good, and the audience participation has been severely limited also contributes to the ""compilation-like"" quality of this album.  I think that the performances are excellent and the tunes, although largely played as they appear on record, are changed subtly here and there.  Nice additions include the drum solo on YYZ, the acoustic guitar solo piece ""Broon's Bane"" that leads into ""The Trees"" (and then Xanadu), and the extended electric guitar introduction to a searing version of La Villa Strangiato.Although some people have complained that this album is too polished, the smoothness does not bother me one bit.  I don't like attending live rock performances because of the obnoxious crowds, so the limited audience noise at the end of each track (and the sing-along on Closer to Heart) did not bother me too much. This is a live album after all. The sound quality is excellent, although the fact that this was originally presented as a double record with ""sides"" that had to be turned over does turn up every so often - Passage to Bangkok seems to come out of left field.All in all, this is a fine souvenir from the height of their powers. Recommended along with 2112 (1976), Farewell to Kings (1977), Hemispheres (1978), Permanent Waves (1980), Moving Pictures (1981), and Signals (1982).","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E2W4SILKPSK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001ESR#wasThisHelpful","R2E2W4SILKPSK7","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This phone is great for just about anything - it is somewhere in-between a tablet and an iPhone, so the kids have been using it for games, in addition to general phone use. I don't think the camera/video quality is all that hot. The quality of the images on the phone are fantastic though - colors are vibrant and the images are crisp.  If you listen to music through a phone - I prefer a proper sound system - you might not be that thrilled.  The sound quality is weak. When played through a remote speaker, however, the sound improves a little. I personally find the larger size of the phone to be a bit bothersome - I like the smaller size of my iPhone much better. All in all, this is a nice phone that reflects current trends in personal phones - they seem to be getting larger. For the person that needs a no-nonsense phone to simply make calls, this may be a bit much.  However, for those people that use the phone for recording videos, playing games, accessing the internet, in addition to making calls, this really is a nice phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EIS291RBW6QM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PYWQ7R4#wasThisHelpful","R2EIS291RBW6QM","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 2012 compilation from Rhino is actually not bad at all. Although I am not generally fond of compilations, this 2-CD set works pretty well and is great to listen to in the car - I have a fairly long commute. Overall, as a long-time Yes fan, I found that this made a nice addition to my Yes collection although there were things that I liked and disliked.I liked the overall package, which (inexplicably) contains some of the cover paintings from the live Yessongs album (1973) and comes with a cover for the CD case. There are also some liner notes that, while not breaking any new ground, will provide the new fan with a nice overview of the group. I thought that the track selection was pretty good, even though the emphasis on CD 1 is on three albums released during the 1971-1972 timeframe (The Yes Album, Fragile, and Close to the Edge). In fact, Close to the Edge is featured in its entirety, which is pretty cool - most people regard it as their best album. One of my favorite tracks from Tales from Topographic Oceans (1973) made it on CD 2 in its entirety - this was another plus. Generally, I prefer CD 2 because of the wider range in tracks/albums. I also thought that the time period covered was good too (1970-1983). This was the time during which Yes made their biggest cultural impact.I never liked albums such as the not-so-great experiment with an orchestra on Time and a Word (1970) or the arena rock of 90125 (1983) so those selections did not do much for me.  I also did not like the fact that Relayer (1974) is only represented by a single edit (Soon) and that the 1969 debut and Tormato (1978) were ignored. An (ostensibly) representative overview for the new fan should try to include something from every album. I also did not like how the sound quality varies from track to track - some tracks are ""hotter"" than others so you will have to adjust the volume between tracks. The sound quality is not bad overall.All in all, this is not a bad compilation and may be the best Yes compilation out there for the fan (old and new alike). You also can not beat the low cost of this set - you definitely get a lot of tunes for your money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3823DLZRJYT60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B1ISAM0#wasThisHelpful","R3823DLZRJYT60","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For years, we have been stuffing our valuables into a very small safe - something about the size of a lunch box - the stuff that we could not fit was relegated to boxes. This safe is fantastic because it has just enough storage space that we can fit all of our valuable stuff in, with lots of room left over.The safe is very heavy so we keep it on a dry concrete floor in a storage room.  I am not concerned about moisture, because our storage area is very dry. Moisture, however, might pose problems in some situations - I would not, for example, keep the safe in a moist basement.  Although there are desiccant bags included with the safe, the amount of effort required to keep the safe moisture-free might not be worth it for some people. The desiccant bags have to be replaced every six months or so - maybe more frequently if the moisture levels are high. It is certainly not something that I would want to be worrying about.The safe comes equipped with a small drawer and a large drawer.  The large drawer can accommodate a large shoe box; the small drawer is good for smaller items such as jewelry and important documents. The safe keypad lights up when you touch it; programming the safe code is pretty easy. Whatever you do, make sure you have the code handy - we entered the code incorrectly one too many times and the alarm that went off was extremely loud. We use the code/key combination for extra security.All in all, this is an excellent safe that is large enough that it should handle the needs of most people.  The safe is extremely well-constructed and extremely heavy. It is, however, not so large that it can't fit in the corner of a storage room or similar setting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BOOFQSM1LP9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R1ZM5RI#wasThisHelpful","R2BOOFQSM1LP9M","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife liked this facial treatment and seems to have noticed a slight improvement in the smoothness and tightness of her skin. She applies the product in the morning and at night as a light coating that she rubs in. She has found that very little is required and that the bottle lasts for quite some time.The product is largely odorless (although there is a very faint sourness), has the consistency of water, and contains an alcohol yeast extract ""Pitera"" (the non-trade name for the yeast extract is Saccharomycopsis ferment filtrate). This is the ""miracle"" anti-aging element that gives this product its elevated status and price tag. Yeast extracts are encountered in the fermentation of sake (Pitera) and beer, not to mention lots of cosmetics, including cheap products that you can find just about anywhere. Very little data have been published by Proctor and Gamble (they own SK-II) as to the effectiveness of Pitera relative to other yeast extracts. There is also a dearth of published peer-reviewed journal articles that indicate the effectiveness of Saccharomycopsis ferment filtrate itself.What this product does is hydrate the skin, which in turn contributes to the ""plumpness"" of the skin - the plumpness is achieved as the skin swells. This will make wrinkles seem to disappear and smooth out other imperfections.  I think this is what my wife is noticing, and if it works for her then that is OK by me.All in all, this is a good skin care product that seems to have generated somewhat positive results for my wife with no ill side effects.  As with any skin care product though, if you have issues with your skin to start with, consult with a proper dermatologist before using this product. Furthermore, before plunking down money for this stuff, experiment with other products - you may experience similar results at a lower cost. In fact, even my wife commented that she expected more ""bang for the buck"".","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ERV8IO3GZRKE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H723LU#wasThisHelpful","R3ERV8IO3GZRKE","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife listens to her iTunes through wireless speakers quite a lot and absolutely loved this speaker by Braven. We have owned other bluetooth wireless speakers but have not been satisfied with the sound quality of wireless speakers until now.I have to admit that the bass response of this speaker is impressive given the small size. The speaker is water resistant so it can be used in the bathroom while taking a shower or in other moist environments. The speaker is very easy to set up and pair with your devices and holds a charge for quite a long time - my wife used the speaker for one hour each day for a period of five days without having to re-recharge. The only drawback to the speaker is that it does not come equipped with a light that tells you when the unit is on and off. Although the speaker generates a different tone when being turned on and off, a light would make a world of difference.All in all, this is a great wireless speaker that boasts great sound quality.  It is compact and can be used in a range of environments.

"Just like every debut album, this 1995 release from Norwegian post-progressive outfit White Willow has some fine moments, but also stumbles at times. Fortunately, as the group matured, their sound gelled, and the sophistication of the compositions increased (especially with the addition of keyboardist Lars Fredrik Frislie). I generally liked this debut though, and Ignis Fatuus is important because the band was up and running. Then again, I am a huge fan of the group and absolutely have to get everything they released.The tunes themselves are generally on the quiet side, and at times pastoral. One of the things that I like about this group is their blend of current indie rock and the best of 1970s progressive - I did not hear that blend on this debut. There are snippets of medieval English folk music here and there (Gryphon comes to mind). Unfortunately, these passages are not too well integrated with the rest of the tracks and seem at odds with the overall feel of the album.  The playing is very solid though, and both the guitarist and keyboardist turn in some good performances.Although I think the shorter tracks work very well, the longer tracks seem to meander aimlessly at times - there is little dynamic contrast, the melodies are not developed, and there is no sense of long-range planning.  The gloomy moods/textures that the band creates makes up for it though - this is dark stuff with a few nods in the direction of Swedish post-progressive outfit Anglagard. I thought the female vocalist was quite good - unfortunately, there are other (male) vocalists that do not quite hit the mark.The production quality is pretty good - there is a good balance of individual instruments and everything sounds crisp.  The CD comes with a booklet that features the lyrics, recording credits and some arty images.  I thought the package was very nice and have no desire to seek out the remastered version of this album.All in all, this album is significant in that White Willow was up and running.  Although most of the White Willow sound is present, they would release better developed records as they matured and gelled as a group. This applies to the excellent follow-up album Ex Tenebris (1998).","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VU9I9F19KIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001I51QE#wasThisHelpful","R39VU9I9F19KIO","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I spent a little time in the National Park Service as a field biologist during my undergraduate days and became very familiar with the use of two-way radios, the ten-code, how not to freak out over the radio in an emergency etc. I found that the most critical element of the radio was its ability to hold a charge - no power and you are up a creek (the units were old). We had been looking for a two-way radio as a means of alternative communication when on a family hike, keeping tabs on the kids, local stuff mainly. When we saw this unit, we snapped it up- it really suited our needs - I also made doubly sure that it came with a reliable charger.Although much smaller than the government radios I used, these things more than make up for it in features and ease of use. The radio is equipped with a small, yet powerful light that doubles as a flashing signal and an FM radio - the sound quality is what you might expect from a speaker the size of a silver dollar (kind of tinny and thin). With respect to the ease of use, simply turn the unit on, make sure both units are locked at the same frequency, and depress the PTT button to communicate. Our kids love these radios and use them quite a lot while playing outside - they are really good at using them and have learned not to change the frequency setting while using them.I have not been able to test the limits of the range of the radio, however. We have only used it while out of sight of one another in the woods, but still in close proximity (100 -200 feet). I have also not made use of the programming ability of the radio. The manufacturer has a decent website that has various software available for download and the programming of the unit seems fairly simple.With respect to the quality of the radios, they are generally well-made and solid.  The kids are a bit rough with them at times, but they have held up well to being dropped on the ground, buried in snow etc. The speaker is really good at handling higher volumes, and communications are broadcast with crystal clarity. Now for the charger - it works very well. The cradle holds the radio snugly, so there is no chance that it will not charge properly. The radios hold a charge for an extremely long time by virtue of design - during times of light use, ours have gone without a charge for at least 2 weeks. This will vary with the amount they are used though - if you use them 8 hours a day, you will likely have to throw them on the charger overnight for use the next day.All in all, this is a perfect two-way radio for use on a hike, a short trip, or during play. It is a high quality unit that reproduces communications with high fidelity. Oh, and the charger works really well too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18V8XGIXWFZA2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QRHNSZO#wasThisHelpful","R18V8XGIXWFZA2","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was the last album released by the entire group; drummer John Bonham passed away shortly after the release of In through the Out Door (1979).  Although I do not rank this up there with my favorites by Led Zeppelin (III; Houses of the Holy; side 3 (vinyl LP) of Physical Graffiti), there is enough of the Led Zeppelin “thing” on this album that I generally liked it.  Come to think of it, I really liked the tune All of my Love back in the day, so this album also has sentimental value.The album has an overall softer sound to it and seems to me to be more reflective.  I don’t mind this one bit – Led Zeppelin always had a softer side to them, so it really was not that much a departure. I think the playing on the album is actually very good and Jimmy Page got some great tones out of the electric guitar.  I also like the use of synthesizers too (mostly Yamaha GX-1) – it lends the album an atmospheric feel. The greater use of synthesizers likely reflects the fact that John Paul Jones (and Robert Plant) did most of the writing. At the time, Jimmy Page and John Bonham were struggling with substance abuse problems.The only track on the album that did not sit well with me was the rockabilly of Hot Dog – although I appreciate the fact that the group was trying to shake things up a bit, this one tune did not work for me.Although the version of the CD I have has not been remastered, the sound quality is not bad at all. The CD booklet comes with some basic recording credits and a few arty images. The cover (by Hipgnosis) is pretty cool.All in all, this is a decent album that has a least a few gems on it. It is a little quieter than other Led Zeppelin albums but has enough of the Led Zeppelin sound that it makes for a pretty enjoyable listen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SLJ16JCHH0V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002JSP#wasThisHelpful","R2SLJ16JCHH0V2","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After watching this excellent biography of Rush, I now realize the extent of the camaraderie that has kept them together through thick and thin. I was also provided with insights into their characters that I was not fully aware of, adding yet another facet to a group that I thought I knew inside and out.The care and attention that went into making this film is nothing short of spectacular; the sound quality is excellent and the interviews with the band members were generally insightful.  Of the three members, I found myself relating to Neil Peart the most, and no, I don't regard him as a sourpuss because he values his privacy.  His lyrics have been an inspiration ever since I started listening to the group, and his drumming is, well, mind-blowing. Come to think of it, I might pick up his book Ghost Rider, which chronicles the road he traveled (literally and figuratively) while recovering from the tragic loss of his wife and child.The film is laid out chronologically and nicely illustrates the changes that their music went through decade after decade. At the beginning, there is some cool footage of Alex Lifeson having a passionate discussion with his parents recorded sometime in the early 1970s- it paints a nice picture of an idealistic and principled young man. The film then progresses through their career, and the viewer is treated to live performances, excellent insights from producer Terry Brown, and tidbits on the recording process. Overall, the emphasis was on the 1970s material, and to a lesser extent the synth-heavy albums of the 1980s. My general impression was that the albums from the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s were somewhat glossed over, with the exception of Vapor Trails, which was the big comeback for Neil.There are also interviews with various musicians (Kiss, Uriah Heep, Max Webster, Dream Theater, Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against the Machine, Foo Fighters, Sebastian Bach, Tool, Nine Inch Nails) and actors (Jack Black). Although I found the commentaries from the musicians and actors useless - OK, I will admit that Gene Simmons [Kiss] was pretty funny and the guy from Uriah Heep cracked me up-some of the interviewees did give you an idea of the broad spectrum of younger musicians that Rush influenced and continue to influence.The overall vibe that I got from the film was that the guys in Rush care very much for each other and are sympathetic to the needs of each; this became especially apparent when the personal losses of Neil Peart are discussed.  I also got the sense that while excellent musicians, they were very much down to earth; there are no huge egos on display here and Neil can almost be self-effacing at times. One other thing that I found refreshing was that there was not an emphasis on drug/alcohol use.  Although the use of alcohol is briefly mentioned, there was too much going on in a typical Rush piece for them to go on stage with their senses dulled. As such, drug use does not play a role in the story of Rush.All in all, this is one of the finest rock biographies I have ever watched and brought back some great memories of watching them in concert circa 1980-1981.  It focuses on the facts and the music; there is no drama, no ridiculous ""arty"" imagery, and no hysterical interviewers. Above all else though, this biography was just plain fun. So much fun in fact, that I have watched it well over ten times.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9NVI8IKGOGF7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003J27WFW#wasThisHelpful","R9NVI8IKGOGF7","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This SKLZ Quickster Soccer Combo System is a great net for our 5 and 7 year olds and they love using it for sports and just plain goofing around. The net is pretty durable and easy to set up. The fact that it serves as both a net and a ""rebounder"" is also nice - I think the kids liked using the rebounder a bit more than the goal net. My general impression is that this is a fun and durable net that offers our kids a great opportunity to get outside and get some exercise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315XA5VLO0NU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HA9EOV0#wasThisHelpful","R315XA5VLO0NU1","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This base is, by virtue of design, heavy and stable. The adjustable knob is a nice feature and should accept umbrella poles with a variety of diameters. Although a minor inconvenience, the packaging for the stand was such that it made it difficult to get the stand out.The one aspect of this stand that has me a little concerned is the fact that the stand is composed of steel.  Although the outer covering may be weather resistant, the covering has the potential to wear off causing the steel to rust. At least that has been my experience with similar types of outdoor furniture while living in the northeastern US. We have not, however, owned this long enough to determine if it will rust.All in all, this is a nice stand that seems fairly durable although it may be prone to rust. Regardless, it will be kept under a table, so it might not be that big of a deal if it rots out.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIJ0LFQZUK1XY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GAXLLXQ#wasThisHelpful","RIJ0LFQZUK1XY","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We selected this air filter because our son suffers from asthma that is triggered by allergies to various air-borne particulates including animal hair and pollen. Because of this, we have steered clear of owning pets (cats and dogs) and we were also interested in a high efficiency air filter that would remove other particulates from the air, yet would not require an HVAC technician to install.  This air cleaner from Electrolux certainly fit the bill.The air cleaner is very simple to assemble and the parts all fit together snugly. The filters are arranged in series such that air passes through a fine-mesh screen, a HEPA filter, and finally a charcoal filter.  According to Electrolux, the HEPA filter is capable of trapping particulates as small as 0.3 microns (dust, pollen etc).  To put this in perspective, my understanding is that maples generate pollen with a diameter generally in the 23-36 micron range - my hope is that the HEPA filter will cut down on pollen this spring. If I read the manual correctly, the unit also acts as an ion-exchanger - this is just a fancy way of saying that the PlasmaWave technology uses positive and negative charges to convert harmful substances in the air to harmless substances such as oxygen.To test this unit out, I placed it in the kitchen where most of the hustle and bustle of daily life occurs - we had it in the bedroom but the air there is pretty clean so there was not much to observe. We just turned it on and let it work its magic - it really is that simple. To make things even easier, the unit comes with a remote - this would come in handy if you use it in the bedroom at night. With respect to the operation of this unit, it is generally very quiet and does not have a lot of bright, blinking lights.  In fact, Electrolux has built a light sensor into the unit that will automatically dim the lights on the control panel at night.  Although I say quiet, the unit will make a little white noise when the fan is in ""Turbo"" mode, which generally occurs during cooking. The fan will return to quiet mode once the odor is gone.  Overall, I was impressed with how quiet the unit is, particularly during conditions when air quality is good.  For those of you concerned with having a bulky air cleaner in your home, the unit is actually fairly unobtrusive.  We have it in the kitchen and because it is charcoal grey/black it blends nicely with the hardwood floors/stainless steel appliances and does not take up a lot of space.The maintenance of this unit will vary with particulate density - if there is a lot of dust/pollen you will have to check the unit more frequently.  The one component that I check frequently is the fine mesh screen - this acts much like a lint trap in the dryer.  The more particulates that get impinged on the screen, the lower the air flow, and the less efficient the unit will be so keep it clean.  According to Electrolux, under normal operating conditions, the filters are designed to be replaced annually. I went on to the Electrolux website and found that a package containing 1 HEPA filter and 4 charcoal cartridges costs approximately $80 (at the time of this writing).  There are cheaper options on the website to the cost I have cited, however - it just depends on what you want to replace. Of course, the filters are washable so you could probably get a slightly longer life out of them.All in all, this is an excellent filter that keeps the air in our house clean - this is especially important because our son suffers from asthma that is aggravated by allergies to pollen and other particulates in the air.  It is quiet, unobtrusive, and does not appear to use lots of electricity (it is an Energy Star product).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YL3ACX7XNOJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IABVZGY#wasThisHelpful","R2YL3ACX7XNOJ7","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the heaviest of the first eight Black Sabbath albums with Ozzy Osbourne on lead vocals, both musically and maybe lyrically too. In fact, for those younger folks that are just getting into Black Sabbath, Master of Reality (1971) may be the one to start with - it seems most closely aligned with the current perception of 1970s Black Sabbath. In fact, Seattle grunge group Soundgarden covered Into the Void sometime in the 1990s.Musically, this album features bludgeoning electric guitar played at a crushing volume and a bulldozer-like rhythm section. Loads of riffs, often played in unison on the electric bass and the electric guitar, are major components of each track. Of course, there is the quieter, progressive side of Sabbath too, with the delicate acoustic guitar track Orchid and the quiet closing track Solitude. I should note that this is what makes Sabbath one of the most interesting of the British heavy metals groups (Along with Zeppelin) - their desire to experiment. This experimentation is in its infancy on Master of Reality but is present nonetheless.This version of the CD was released by US Warner Bros. The sound quality is OK and the liner notes feature a little blurb on the group. I am not, however, a fan of the US Warner Bros releases of the 1970-1978 Black Sabbath albums because most of them suffer from sound quality issues. In my search for an inexpensive alternative, I stumbled across a version of Master of Reality that was issued by Creative Sounds. I own both the US Warner Bros. and Creative Sounds versions, and feel that the sound quality of the Creative Sounds version is a little better. Then again, based upon my (foggy) memories of my old vinyl LP, the sound quality of the record was not that hot either. While the audio quality is not bad, the Creative Sounds version of the Audio CD is about as bare bones as it gets - there are no liner notes or recording credits. To their credit, however, Creative Sounds tried to mimic the cover of the old LP- on the LP, only Black Sabbath was visible (in purple), whereas the Master of Reality title was in black raised letters.All in all, this is a great album by the group that finds them starting to change their overall sound. Highly recommended along with the debut Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970), Vol. 4 (1972), the excellent Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973), and my favorite Sabotage (1975). Although Technical Ecstasy (1976) and Never Say Die (1978) have received mixed reviews (most fans don't like these two) I personally think they are great. However, I would start with the first six, then move onto Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1L2IEL412QUYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002KDO#wasThisHelpful","R1L2IEL412QUYH","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1975 album is very sophisticated and seems to be presented as a song cycle of sorts - all of the tracks blend into one another. The desire of guitarist Tony Iommi to incorporate elements of progressive was really beginning to show.  Although I love all of the albums from the years with Ozzy Osbourne as lead vocalist, this one really stands out.  I especially appreciate the detail in each track, the variety in tone colors, a nice dynamic range , and above all else, the sheer power of this music.Although this album is dominated by the crushing volume of their unique take on heavy metal, there are quiet acoustic guitar passages, sections that feature a choir and synthesizers/mellotron, and sophisticated songwriting and arrangements.  Overall, this album is a good example of how many groups incorporated elements from British progressive rock into their music.  I love the moods on the album, which range from haunting and plaintive to heavy, with everything in-between. I also appreciate Tony's playing and the tones that he gets on Sabotage - his performances are both thoughtful and blistering.This version of the CD was released by US Warner Bros and features good sound quality and a little blurb on the group in the liner notes.All in all this is a great album that was the last to feature a unified group approach during the ""Ozzy years"". After this, Tony's interest in progressive created great friction within the band, particularly with Ozzy, leading to the ultimate dissolution of this lineup in 1978 or so.  This album is very highly recommended along with the debut Black Sabbath (1970), Paranoid (1970), Master of Reality (1971), and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973). Although I think the follow-up to Sabotage is pretty good (Technical Ecstasy, 1976), not a lot of people have warmed up to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IFQYKIRXVRFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002KFJ#wasThisHelpful","R2IFQYKIRXVRFF","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although designed for the upholstery and carpet in your car or truck, we have used this spot cleaner on a number of things including sofas.  The machine worked wonders on the sofas- we thought that our toddlers had destroyed them beyond the point of no return, but the Bissell brought them back to life. I would also use this machine to clean spots on carpets in the house.The machine is lightweight, easy to use, and extremely loud.  While the loudness is not an issue outside or in a garage, it is a bit much for use indoors. The machine is very effective at removing stains, although you have to work a bit with the brush attachment at tougher stains - this is no different from any other spot cleaner we have owned. If you are concerned about making the carpet/upholstery/sofa too wet, just go easy on the water application and constantly  vacuum the water up as you go.The machine comes with a container of Oxy(gen) Boost stain remover and a container of Spot and Stain. You only need to use the Spot and Stain, whereas the Oxy Boost is reserved for the tough stains.  The Spot and Stain is concentrated (factor of 2) so you only need a small amount. This is nice, because the cleaner is just an additional expense.  Although it would be nice if the machine had a retractable cord, the cord that it comes with is not too inconvenient. Moreover, the cable is pretty long (approx. 15 feet) so it works just about anywhere.All in all this is a great cleaner that has a wide range of applications (all of them small jobs) The machine does a great job of cleaning, even with the tough spots and is easy to use.

"My son (age 6) absolutely loves this Matchbox truck and has not stopped playing with it since it arrived.The appeal lies with the moving parts that the truck has: the snow plow extends, the cab of the truck flips up and the top opens up, the side walls flip out and so on.  To add to the fun, the truck comes with three characters with oversized feet that allow them to rock back and forth - very much like Weebles. The smaller characters can be launched off of the side walls. There is also a net that can be used to capture the Yeti.The truck is constructed of durable plastic.  Although the moving parts seem a little flimsy, they have definitely held up to the rigors of playtime. While there are no sharp edges, the truck comes with small accessories, so be sure to keep them away from very young children.All in all, this is a great toy that has offered my son hours of enjoyment. Furthermore, it is pretty much good to go - you don't have to buy additional (and more often than not, expensive) components. In fact my son has integrated the truck with his other toys pretty well.

"Of the first six albums, this 1972 release always seemed to fall through the cracks for me. After listening to this album again for the first time in a (really) long time, I realize that most of my hang-ups have to do with the production quality and the disjointedness of a few of the tunes. In all fairness though, the music has enough of the Black Sabbath ""spirit"" that I enjoyed it - even moreso than when I listened to this on vinyl as a teen.Overall, Vol. 4 is a decent example of the Black Sabbath sound: a bulldozer-like rhythm section, heavily distorted ""power chords"" played at a bone-crushing volume, and the distinctive vocal style of Ozzy Osbourne. Wheels of Confusion, Tomorrow's Dream, Supernaut, Cornucopia, and Snowblind are great examples of this.On the other hand, Black Sabbath had started to experiment with their sound by this point and make use of different tone colors - strings, mellotron, piano-this likely reflects the guitarist's increasing interest in progressive rock. The experimentation was alternately thrilling; the mellotron (with string setting) drenched and melancholy track Changes is my favorite Sabbath track, and less-than-satisfying; FX amounts to little more than Tony Iommi fiddling with the controls on his guitar and an echo box. Tony did compose the pleasant acoustic guitar track Laguna Sunrise though - this is one of my favorites from the guitarist.The disjointedness of Vol. 4 rears its head on the first track - the instrumental track The Straightener is unrelated to Wheels of Confusion and should have either been omitted or fleshed out into a full-blown song (it really is a catchy bit of music). There is also the haphazard sequencing of tracks; there is not much in the way of natural pacing to Vol. 4. I blame the producer (Patrick Meehan) for this sort of thing though, not Sabbath - even though they partipated in the production.The sound quality of this CD reissue is horrific - unfortunately, I no longer have my old LP so I can't do a decent comparison.  As far as the sound of the CD goes, the bass guitar is barely audible, the cymbals and high-hat are ""splishy"", and there are noticeable (unplanned) shifts in volume. The liner notes provide the track listing, and a few notes on the recording of the album.All in all, this is a pretty good album by the group that endures to this day in spite of a few (minor) shortcomings.  My understanding is that many of the band members were suffering from substance abuse problems at the time of the recording, so we are lucky that we got anything out of them at all.Although I have a preference for the first three studio albums, any of the first six are recommended to newbies: Black Sabbath (1970); Paranoid (1970); Master of Reality (1971); Vol. 4 (1972); Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973); and Sabotage (1975).  If you are just curious about the group, the compilation We Sold our Soul for Rock `n' Roll (1976) does a nice job capturing the highlights of these albums and is pretty cheap - come to think of it, about half of the compilation is made up of tunes from Paranoid and Vol. 4. Enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DL9UUHHEKJE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002KE2#wasThisHelpful","R1DL9UUHHEKJE1","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This ""ice cream maker"" keeps our kids (ages 5 and 6.5) entertained for hours - they absolutely love it!  The appeal lies in the varieties of ice cream that can be made and the types of ""toppings"" that they can come up with. You are, of course, limited by the types of colored Play-Doh you have at your disposal, so the sky is not the limit.We have found that clean-up is not any tougher than other toys that use Play-Doh. Although dried Play-Doh turns up in some of the cracks and crevices, I will usually just give the affected piece a good rinse with water - that usually takes care of it. Our kids love to mix the ""toppings"" in with the ""ice cream"". Because of this, the original colors usually do not last too long so we are constantly buying new Play-Doh.All in all, this is a great toy that will keep your kids entertained for hours - just be prepared to shell out money for more Play-Doh - especially if they like to mix the colors together.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377A41JUMXIXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ARQW0NW#wasThisHelpful","R377A41JUMXIXX","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Deadwing (2005) finds Porcupine Tree in top form and is loaded with excellent playing and songwriting. Although a bit heavier and louder than some of their earlier albums, the music on this album is still killer Porcupine Tree through-and-through. Overall, this is one of the few newer groups that really grabs me.The album blends the influences of heavy groups like Opeth with melancholy, softer passages and has a gloom to it that I find very appealing - not sure why I like the gloom so much - it just seems to resonate more.  These are dark times after all and Porcupine Tree seems to have successfully tapped into this. The level of musicianship is fairly high and the arrangements are generally well thought out - the individual tracks seem to be arranged in a larger work. One pleasant surprise was the guitar solo by Adrian Belew (King Crimson).The CD comes with a booklet that features a series of arty images, along with the recording credits.  The sound quality is very high.All in all, this is a great album by a mature group with a mature sound.  Although heavier than some of the earlier albums, this is fantastic stuff that paves the way for the excellent Fear of a Blank Planet (2007). Highly recommended along with In Absentia (2002) and Fear of a Blank Planet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PDKGEQCD4D25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007XT87G#wasThisHelpful","R2PDKGEQCD4D25","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well constructed water tower that fits perfectly with our other Thomas the Tank Engine train set parts.  Our kids (ages 5 and 6.5) enjoy playing with the tower and filling the steam engines up - the water level in the tank ""drops"" as you lower the outlet pipe, and returns to its original ""full"" level when you raise the outlet pipe back up. The construction of the water tower is quite good; it is solid, and the materials are of high quality.All in all, the water tower makes for a nice addition to our Thomas the Tank Engine train set and provides hours of enjoyment for the kids.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RIT7JIW1B70E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AJCNO7A#wasThisHelpful","R3RIT7JIW1B70E","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 1971 release sounds a lot different than Tommy (1969) and indicates how much the group had developed in only a few short years. There is certainly no shortage of popular songs on this album and the track listing reads like a greatest hits list. Although culled from a larger project that was shelved (Lifehouse), there is continuity to the collection of songs on Who's Next, which is a personal favorite.The album was recorded in fits and starts (the process is nicely detailed in the liner notes) with the end product being a definitive album by the group. Come to think of it, along with Tommy and Quadrophenia (1973), Who's Next defines the Who's mature sound: a mixture of hard rock, a smidge of progressive, and dynamics that range from soft to loud.I love the use of synthesizers on the album (mostly VCS3 and ARP 2500) and electronic processing, which lends the music a fairly distinctive sound. On the downside, I am not a fan of the (lyrically) silly tune My Wife (John Entwistle), which is really at odds with the remainder of the material. This same sort of thing drove me crazy with ELP.The production quality is (was) outstanding and the remastered CD does not fiddle with the original sound too much (at least based upon my distant memories of the LP). The sound of the drums is best described as thunderous, and there is excellent separation of individual instruments. The liner notes are very detailed and include an essay by Pete Townshend and some notes on the album by a rock critic.  The extra tracks are pretty cool and I have to say they are actually of interest.All in all, this may very well be the Who's finest moment.  A classic by any measure, it is highly recommended along with Tommy and Quadrophenia.  These three albums find the group at a creative peak.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25U9XU9WW8HH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002OX7#wasThisHelpful","R25U9XU9WW8HH4","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This case features a plastic snap that mounts on the back of an iPad mini snugly. The case is easy to grip and is composed of hard plastic, so the back of the Apple Ipad Mini is reasonably well protected. This is plastic, however, so it is not likely to protect your Ipad from the force of falling on a hard surface from heights above three feet. My wife appreciates the color of the case and feels that it lends the Ipad ""pizzazz"".All in all, this is a colorful plastic case that should protect your Ipad from the rigors of day-to-day life.

"This is a nice cover for our Ipad Mini from Belkin. Both our son (6) and daughter (4) use it; fortunately, no one complains that it is too ""girly"" or ""for boys"" - then again, they are more interested in the game that they are playing to take much notice of the Ipad cover.The cover fastens with a little magnet and is fairly durable. Because there are ""bend points"" in the cover, you can prop your Ipad up at an angle - this is nice if you are on a plane. The cover is composed of rubber and is covered with what appears to be some type of cloth/woven synthetic fibers. Regardless of what the outer covering is composed of - keep it away from spills and clean it frequently - otherwise, the cover will get pretty dirty.All in all, this is a nice cover for the Ipad.

"This collection of live material recorded during the 1973-1974 tour is just fantastic.  Not only does this sprawling set demonstrate their ability to play such complex material in a live setting, but it also showcases their considerable improvisational skills.  Welcome Back My Friends to the Show that Never Ends (1974) is killer ELP from start to finish.I had this (3 LP) set on vinyl a long time ago and only just barely remember it, so my ability to point out the differences between the LP and CD is diminished. However, I did recognize that the longer tracks are now presented in their entirety. The sound quality is about the same as I remember it – not too bad overall.Although the subtle details of this record have faded with time, the staggering virtuosity of the performances and the sheer electrical power of this live recording is something that was never forgotten. Each member gets a chance to shine – my favorite is Keith’s solo piano piece – and the ensemble tracks are spectacular –the Karn-Evil 9 and Tarkus suites are especially impressive.This remastered CD by Rhino is not bad – they attempted to reproduce the original liner notes and graphics and the sound quality is not bad for a live album.  Although I would have wished for some extra tracks, I was more than satisfied with the track listing of the original album.All in all, if you are looking for a live album by ELP during the height of their abilities, look no further than this.  Recommended along with ELP (1970); Tarkus (1971); the live album Pictures at an Exhibition (1972); Trilogy (1972); and Brain Salad Surgery (1973).","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SOQQ9N2MB04P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000033P3#wasThisHelpful","R2SOQQ9N2MB04P","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Norton software is great - I am a bit biased though, I have been using Norton anti-virus software for a long time.The setup is very easy - even for folks that might not be computer savvy - and works its ""magic"" without too much active maintenance on your part.  There are four main components to the software including security, identity, backup, and tune-up.  The tune-up component needs a little tweaking at first - it would erase all of current log-ins so we would have to re-log onto our favorite websites.  Other than that, it does not take up a lot of memory on our laptop - as such, I have not noticed any slowing of the computer.Another nice feature is the high level of detail on computer performance, internet threats etc. Although it may be too much information for most folks, I like being able to review data from the four components so that I know exactly what is going on.All in all, this is a great anti-virus software package that really is the best line of defense against internet viruses, malware et al.

"I find this group to be one of the more refreshing acts out there right now - there is hope for progressive music yet.  One aspect of their music that is most refreshing is the successful blend of new music with the old; in this case, goth/indie rock with the best of 1970s progressive.  This is forward-thinking music at its best.Although Signal to Noise (2006) is a bit lighter than some of their other albums, there is still a brooding darkness that I find very appealing.  I also like the musicianship, the level of which is very high, and the keyboard playing of young Lars Fredrik Frislie really stands out - he favors the analog instruments like the mellotron, mini-moog, and other synthesizers.  A new female vocalist signed on for this album and her vocals are exceptional.With a total running time of 51:28, the tracks seem to be arranged in a song-cycle of sorts; the song-cycle incorporates vocal passages with more complex instrumental interludes.  The instrumental passages are fairly intricate and feature pre-composed solos - fortunately, there is not a lot of grandstanding.  Although a bit heavier than their other albums, the heaviness is not overbearing and is nicely leavened by the pastoral moments that the group is known for.The sound quality of this release is pretty good, although it varies considerably depending on the equipment that is used.  The CD booklet features the (great) lyrics, a few arty images, and the production credits.All in all, this is a group that I enjoy a great deal.  Progressive music at its finest - very highly recommended along with Sanctuary (2000) and Terminal Twilight (2011).","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29HTXCAPE8HW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GBEWFC#wasThisHelpful","R29HTXCAPE8HW3","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They come in a wide variety of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures, and are easy to put together.  The pieces are very durable and of the highest quality - everything fits together snugly.One of the nicest features of the toy is that the pieces come enclosed in their own storage case - as parents with toy storage issues, it was nice to not have to run to the store to pick up (yet another) plastic storage bin.All in all, you cannot go wrong with this toy - it has been around forever for a reason.

"This case served as a replacement for an old plastic case that was cracked and filthy after months of misuse and abuse at the hands of our toddlers.  Although my wife likes the color, I can't say that I am a fan of hot pink.  Furthermore, the Kindle has a tendency to slip out of the four corner fasteners on occasion, which defeats the purpose of having a protective covering.On the plus side, the cover is bright, so it makes it a bit easier to find the Kindle when it is buried under piles of toys and clothing strewn about the room. I also like the fact that it surrounds the Kindle like a book cover.  The cover is composed of slightly textured plastic and is easy to clean.  I would not, however, drop the Kindle from any height even with the cover on - this is just a flimsy plastic cover - not a shock-proof container.All in all, this is effectively an expensive dust cover for your Kindle.  The bright color is a lot of fun and the case should protect it from most of the trials and tribulations of day-to-day life (coffee spills, stray pen/pencil marks, grubby hands etc).  If I were traveling with the Kindle, I would most likely keep it in a briefcase or bag - the bright pink color would most likely just attract unwanted attention.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXUQPYX4NS2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ULPERA#wasThisHelpful","R3LXUQPYX4NS2E","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally had this 1975 compilation on vinyl and as I recall, liked it solely for the extended prog rock rave up of the Paul Simon tune America - this was recorded with the classic lineup of Rick Wakeman, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Jon Anderson, and Bill Bruford.  I did like the earlier psychedelic rock  tracks with Peter Banks, however, but at the time was heavily into the full-blown prog albums like Going for the One, Relayer, and Tales from Topographic Oceans so I can't say that I was bowled over by the earlier stuff.  Furthermore, the Roger Dean cover art was a bit dicey - the back cover is likely not shown here for a reason.If you are like me and have to buy everything Yes ever released (I am obsessed) you will want to pick this up.  You may also want to get this if you just want a sampler of the early material (specifically, the first two albums Yes [1969] and Time and a Word [1970]) before forking over the money for the remasters.  I originally bought Yesterdays for America - which is now included on the Rhino release of Fragile, so I now consider Yesterdays to be redundant.The CD booklet of the remastered version of Yesterdays comes with the green photos of the various band members that used to form the dust cover for the record.  The sound quality is pretty good.All in all, this compilation is for Yes ""completists"".

"As I recall, I bought Three Sides Live (1982) while in England at some point in 1983 or 1984.  At any rate, the record was pretty new when I bought it and presented a nice summary of early 1980s Genesis, along with some of their more progressive material.One of things that I liked about the U.K. version was that the fourth side was live and had a great version of One for the Vine on it - this is the version that made it onto this CD.  Back in the early 1980s, however, the U.S. release of the album had studio tracks on the fourth side (Paperlate, You Might Recall, Evidence of Autumn, Me and Virgil, Open Door).  The U.S. version of the album is available here at AMAZON and used copies are reasonably priced (Three Sides Live). Fortunately for me though, I am only familiar with the U.K. version, so I do not miss the studio tracks (good as they are though).I was always a fan of the early 1980s albums like Duke and Abacab, so I found the track listing to be pretty good.  However, I especially liked the progressive pieces such as the lengthy medley, and the entire fourth side.  The playing is pretty good and the two guys that Genesis hired to help out (Chester Thompson - drums and Darryl Stuermer - guitars/bass) are fantastic.  On the fourth side, Bill Bruford (drums) turns up on a few tracks, along with former guitarist Steve Hackett.The overall sound quality on Three Sides Live was always a bit thin - this definitive remaster does little to help correct that.  The CD booklet comes with a color image of the group playing live, liner notes, and recording credits.  Nothing fancy though which is in keeping with the theme of the original record.All in all, this is a fine summary of the live Genesis sound as it existed in the early 1980s and makes a nice complement to Seconds Out (1977).","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLPRTR7DQR2SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009FHFN6#wasThisHelpful","RLPRTR7DQR2SS","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We picked this up because it seemed like a fun thing to do with the kids (ages 4 and 5). Unfortunately, this cheaply constructed plastic slurpee maker from Umagine was a bit difficult to assemble, hard to use, messy, and yielded zero return.The slush is generated when a flavored drink comes into direct contact with a metal cooling canister containing ice and salt.  Ignore the directions, however, and add something healthy to drink such as apple juice for the kids (the target audience).  The suggestions on the box include soda and high-sugar fruit drinks - just like the junk you can buy at a convenience store like 7-11.The drink is then agitated until slush is formed.  The mixing takes about five minutes or so and requires you to really crank it - otherwise you will be mixing for a while.  Because the maker is flimsy and lightweight, there is the risk that it will topple over and spill its contents if you are not careful.  I got a little carried away and the handle slipped out of its fitting a few times.Once the mixing is complete, the slush is dispensed by pulling a sliding plastic ""door"" located at the bottom of the mixing container.  I found that the sliding door was so hard to pull out that I just ended up dumping the contents out of the top of the container into the plastic serving cups.  It was that or risk spilling everything all over the place.All in all this is an expensive and shoddily constructed slurpee maker.  It was difficult to assemble, very difficult to use, and did not yield as much fun as we would have liked.  I was, however, able to illustrate some basic scientific principles to the kids (the effects of cooling on liquids).  That was worth at least a two-star rating.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U5UN17LHX76B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007X9DRWO#wasThisHelpful","R2U5UN17LHX76B","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My four year old daughter loves this dollhouse.  I think the appeal lies with its large size, along with details such as the room under the stairs, lights that work, and door bells etc. (the dollhouse requires 3 ""AA"" batteries).The dollhouse was very easy to put together and comes with easy-to-read and clearly laid out instructions.  In fact, my wife was able to assemble the house in only a half hour armed with only a phillips-head screwdriver.The house is constructed of sturdy plastic pieces (colored pink, cream, brown, and green) that hold up well to super-hero ""assaults"" launched by my five year old son. Various pieces of furniture and four dolls (mom, dad, daughter, and a baby) are included.  The furniture and the dolls are well constructed and hold up well to the stresses imposed by two toddlers - the super-hero assaults can get pretty intense.All in all, this is a nice dollhouse by Fisher Price (even for a plastic dollhouse).  It may very well impress the wooden dollhouse lovers out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34O7B4WXKD9LE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077NCEX4#wasThisHelpful","R34O7B4WXKD9LE","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an inexpensive (cheap) coffee maker that we use on a daily basis.  Although we have owned Mr. Coffee machines for years, we were not exactly thrilled with this model. Like everything, however, there are pros and cons.The Mr.Coffee unit is easy to operate, although the water fill line is a bit hard to see through the window (which is located along the side of the machine).  After a few uses, however, you get accustomed to where the water level should be - we stopped checking the fill line after the first use.  The clock is a nice feature and the buttons used to operate the coffee maker are conveniently located around the clock.  The water filter that came with the machine is also nice; although it is unlikely that it is actually filtering anything, the gesture is appreciated.After a few months of daily use, the cleaner light came on and would not shut off. Whether related to the cleaning light issue, the machine would also shut itself off only 30-60 seconds after brewing.  As such, an entire pot of coffee would go cold if the machine was not manually switched back on. Fortunately, we were able to correct these problems by unplugging the coffee maker for a few hours and letting it ""re-boot"". One other development was that the paint on the heater plate peeled off.All in all, this coffee maker is fairly inexpensive and makes a good pot of coffee.  Although our experience with Mr.Coffee machines over the years is that they hold up pretty well, this model has required a bit more maintenance than other machines that we have owned. Ultimately, you get what you pay for, so if you don't mind tinkering with gadgets, this might be the coffee maker for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZBKKJGM2EGJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041847OC#wasThisHelpful","R2ZBKKJGM2EGJM","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is another high quality puzzle from Ravensburger that was fun to put together and looks fantastic when completed. With ""only"" 300 pieces, this was mildly challenging to put together - it took us approximately 2 hours to assemble.The individual pieces are soft and well constructed, and the image itself is quite nice (you cannot go wrong with Beacon Hill).All in all, this is a high quality puzzle with enough pieces that it makes for a mild challenge.

"This is a great Soft Machine album and a fan favorite.  Mine too.  What appeals to me the most about Third (1970) is the fact that the approach was purely exploratory.  How else could I describe an attempt to fuse minimalism, jazz, and psychedelic rock together?  Third-stream maybe?  At any rate, this music is just plain exciting - even decades after its original release.This was originally a double album, but they somehow managed to cram it all onto one CD (running time is approximately 75 minutes).  Only four tracks are included on Third - each is roughly 18-20 minutes long - and range from the roughly recorded live jazz on Facelift (recorded at Fairfield Hall in Croydon [January 4, 1970] and Mother's Club in Birmingham [January 11, 1970]) to the psychedelic rock of Moon in June.  Most of Moon in June features drummer Robert Wyatt singing (a wordless vocal) to the accompaniment of Mike Ratledge on organ.  Although I love the whole album, I am partial to the flat out jazz of Slightly All the Time and the spacey minimalism/jazz rock on Out-Bloody-Rageous.The tunes do not consist of much more than improvisation around a few pre-composed themes but man is it good.  The guys are all great players and can play jazz very convincingly.  Hands down, my favorite is bassist Hugh Hopper.  One of the distinctive aspects of the music is Mike's overdriven and distorted tone on the organ - I think he ran it through a fuzz box or equivalent.  He is also capable of a clean, ""churchy"" tone.  I also like the incorporation of minimalism into the mix - this lends some of the pieces a very hypnotic, dream-like quality - especially Out-Bloody-Rageous.  I also like the brass and reed players - they are excellent.This is not the remastered version of the album, although there is one floating around out there.  With the exception of the poorly recorded opening live track, the sound quality of the studio tracks is not bad at all.  This version of the CD is pretty skimpy.All in all, this is an excellent example of Canterbury Rock and a distinctly English take on the then nascent jazz rock style.  Although fans of the earlier, more psychedelic albums might get turned off by the transition to jazz, I think that this is a fantastic album.  Recommended along with Fourth (1971), which is essentially a jazz album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BW0SVSJ5SHZW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000024WV#wasThisHelpful","R1BW0SVSJ5SHZW","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music on Banks of Eden (2012) consists of the same approach presented on their 1995 debut, which in turn, was merely a re-tread of the late 1970s-early 1980s stadium rock acts, along with American progressive groups like Starcastle.  The overall sound blends the harder edged sound of riff-heavy stadium rock with neo-progressive rock and perhaps a smidge of the soft adult contemporary rock style.Overall, the highlight of the album for me was the keyboard playing (Tomas Bodin) - he is just fantastic and I love his use of tone color (some of the synthesizer tones were generated with software). The players are all solid though and the new drummer (Felix Lehrman) sounds just like previous drummers; particularly Zoltan Csorz (an excellent percussionist by the way).  At times though, the new drummer reminds me of a very young Ian Paice (Deep Purple) circa 1970-1972.  The vocals and lyrics suffer from the same problems as on earlier albums - my wish is that they would either go instrumental or hire a singer/lyricist.Pop melodies abound and it is clear they spent a lot of time putting each track together. As featured on any number of their albums, Banks of Eden opens with a long track that consists of several unrelated bits and pieces tacked together.  The remaining tracks are not bad and are somewhat short (5-8 minutes).  My favorite of the ""shorter"" tracks is For the Love of Gold - this is a waltzy tune that was co-authored by Tomas Bodin and the guitarist (Roine Stolt).  The closing track Rising the Imperial, which was written by the bassist (Jonas Reingold), is an overly calculated and maudlin ballad that boasts Roine doing his best interpretation of the guitar solo on Comfortably Numb (Pink Floyd, The Wall, 1979).  This was my least favorite track.  Come to think of it, the main theme from this track is presented during a few points during the track Numbers.  Typically, restating central themes serves to draw connecting threads between different pieces.  I am not quite sure what the objective here was though - there is no relationship between any of the individual pieces.I was able to get the deluxe, 2-CD edition of the album fairly cheaply.  Total running time is somewhere around 53 minutes - I am still used to the running length of vinyl records so this was a perfect length.  The overall package is very nice and features some cool cover art and a booklet that has the lyrics and color photos of the group in the studio.  The sound quality is outstanding - very little compression was applied and the music sounds natural.  The bonus tracks on disc 2 (running time around 20 minutes) are OK -they sound like studio outtakes.  There is also a roughly 20-minute long video of the group being interviewed in the studio.All in all, this album will likely appeal to fans of the group.  It just did not push all of my buttons because I find their emphasis on stale stadium rock cliches and a reluctance to embrace musical ideas outside of mainstream rock frustrating - this seems to go against the very spirit of progressive music.  What is most frustrating, however, is that these guys seem content to just play it safe.  Progressive was never safe - it challenged the listener, it shattered the norm, and above all else, it was exciting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YNOFMNBVU7J7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007Y57OD0#wasThisHelpful","R1YNOFMNBVU7J7","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Try as I might, album after album, I fail to make any connection with this group.  I can admit however, that they are capable of a good melody or two and sometimes their playing can be inspired (Space Revolver [2000] is not bad).  This 1995 debut certainly has loads of melodies and establishes the basic approach that they would follow for every album released thereafter.  That is, stadium rock with a dose of the symphonic pop style.The guys are all good musicians, just like the guys in any number of the stadium rock groups.  Hands down, my favorite track is ""Kaleidoscope"", which is a very nice acoustic guitar track that is surprisingly delicate and, well...thoughtful.  My least favorite track is the pop/R&B inflected ""My Cosmic Lover"".  In-between these two extremes, there is a lot of riff-heavy stadium rock with hard-edged guitar playing, a few atmospheric moments here and there, some nice Tony Banks -influenced keyboard playing, pretty bad vocals, and mind-blowingly bad lyrics.Yes, I found the lyrics especially troubling.  In that I grew up with the sophisticated lyrics of the (1970s) progressive groups, I found the puerile gibberish on this record to be more than I could stomach - it really ruined the listening experience for me.  One other aspect that I found troubling was the (apparently conscious) decision to equate music that sounds like Toto with music that sounds modern.  Given the wide range of musical styles that developed from the 1980s onwards, and that could be applied to a given framework (be it progressive rock or something else), the approach of the Flower Kings is both limited and suprisingly unimaginative.The version of the album that I have was released on Foxtrot Records and comes with the lyrics.  The sound quality is very good.All in all, this is lightweight fluff that is certainly not nearly as progressive as I was led to believe.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EGXGTTYAZLL2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000056V9N#wasThisHelpful","R3EGXGTTYAZLL2","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nicely constructed plant holder that is durable and attractive.  Because it is made of metal (powder-coated heavy gage steel), however, we will likely use this as an indoor holder.

"My 4 year old daughter had a solid 15 minutes worth of fun in the tub with this blue goo.  My five-year old son would not go near the stuff - he found it ""disgusting"".I followed the directions and put approximately 2 inches of water in the tub, added the blue goo powder, and mixed.  My daughter helped mix by wiggling all over the place - she really had fun with the stuff. As far as cleanup goes, it was a snap - I just dumped the enclosed salt packet into the blue slurry, mixed, waited until it had thinned out, and washed it down the drain.  There was no staining and no clogged drains.  I would not, however, use this product in a tub that drains slowly - the goo will potentially clog a partially obstructed drain pipe.I did, however, have a little trouble getting the goo out of her hair, albeit not too much trouble.  Evidently, the blue goo is composed of the same material found in diapers, so getting the individual particles out posed a brief inconvenience.  My solution was to just have her stand under the shower head for a bit until everything was washed outThe only drawback that I can see is that while the entertainment value of the blue goo is high, it is short-lived.  This is a novelty item, pure and simple.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKRLL3AXZAWIK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0074A54PA#wasThisHelpful","RKRLL3AXZAWIK","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife picked this moisturizing hair oil up for herself, but I found that using it also helped correct my dry scalp/hair issues.  However, the product also makes your hair very greasy - in fact, because I tend to use too much, my wife suggested I use it at night, rather than during the day.  This is not Moroccan oil after all.The oil has the odor of suntan lotion (probably the shea butter), which is something I do not like - I am a bit too conservative to use overly perfumed hair products.  Unfortunately, there are no directions and I had to determine what amount to use through trial and error; at first, I put too much in and my hair looked like I had dumped salad oil on it - very greasy.  If you use a little bit, which will vary with the amount of hair you have, your hair won't look too greasy.  Unfortunately, this might defeat the purpose - a tiny bit won't moisturize either your scalp or your hair.The packaging is a bit tricky - I had to peel the back label off to see the ingredient list, which was comprised of several oils.  If the thought of dumping oil in your hair does not sound appealing, then steer clear of this stuff.  The first two ingredients include mineral oil and coconut oil - that may explain why it smells like suntan lotion.  There are lesser amounts of other oils including: palm oil, wheat germ oil, sweet almond oil, sunflower seed oil, soybean oil, and Moroccan ironwood oil.Now that summer is here, keeping my scalp and hair moisturized requires some effort.  Unfortunately, I do not like having greasy hair, so I have had to seek out other hair care options.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ID6Y7W1BS8QC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RTR9G0#wasThisHelpful","R2ID6Y7W1BS8QC","AO2AQRPPSTABB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO2AQRPPSTABB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our kids (ages 3 and 5) had a ""ball"" putting this creative Ravensburger puzzle together.  The puzzle is of high quality and extremely durable - the pieces are constructed of sturdy plastic, so once the two halves of the puzzle are completed, they fit together to form a ball that can be (gently) rolled around.For those of you with little time on your hands, or kids with limited attention spans, the puzzle is easy to put together and takes no time at all; in fact, the kids were able to put this 40 piece puzzle together with minimal supervision.  There is also the added thrill of building a spherical puzzle - this was a first for us.  It was especially exciting for our 5-year old son - he has been an avid puzzle builder since he was 3, so a special puzzle like this had him smiling from ear to ear.All in all, Ravensburger makes some of the finest puzzles out there.

Ice did get a little bit of everywhere in his tummy, so be careful when you are pulling open the door, ice pools on the ""shelf"" in the door.It comes with a set of ice trays, which are a little hard to pop out, might be better served with silicon trays - but that was an added bonus. I do wish it would have come with maybe one or two starter flavors - so remember if you pick this one up remember to grab a flavor with it. Disappointed children aren't fun.Overall great product. Has a huge footprint though so have some counter room.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JWKSSRZ2QRJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7G5SWM#wasThisHelpful","R1JWKSSRZ2QRJ7","A2V98TS4QDDCG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V98TS4QDDCG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This product is a very pretty case. It FITS the iPAD Air perfectly. It is simple, it is put together well and it protects my iPad. It folds back so I can set it up so it faces me and it holds it in place. I really can't ask for anything more. It's SUPER cheap, so really, I don't expect it to protect it from falls, spills etc. I just want it to get some sort of extra protection.I have had other boxes​ and super tough cases that are a pain in the but, especially when I use things like Paypal Here and have to attach a card reader to my iPad. Pain in the butt. This one is not. It's simplicity is what the selling point is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34CE3O9UD6SV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSB5XQW#wasThisHelpful","R34CE3O9UD6SV6","A2V98TS4QDDCG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V98TS4QDDCG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Avery Textured White Scallop Round Tags are just perfect and very similar to the Scallop Round Tags (41557) just without the hole punched. These have adhesive on them though, so they can easily be placed on a jar, or box. Fun fun! These were perfect for my mason jar products.

"I am pretty impressed with this daypack, it seems to have EVERYTHING in it. It's padded, so it was comfortable to wear. The straps fit nicely on my body and it didn't weigh me down. I usually run around with a laptop and a tablet. Over-achiever and all that, but I was using a simple pack and I didn't feel it gave my electronics enough protection. This one does. It even has a dedicated pocket for my sunglasses so I don't mess those up also. It also has enough room that you can put your phone in there and it's got a hard casing so you won't have any breakage.It seems they thought of everything with this bag. There are pockets here and there that hold, organize and protect anything you would need to bring with you on your adventure. I use this mostly for light traveling. I have a bigger pack for traveling via plane or train.The inside extra pockets are mesh, so you can easily see what you stashed in there and nothing gets lost.There are attachments for your keys, or hiking gear, which is nice. You can use this pack for outdoor adventures also.The straps are padded, but not as comfortable as their other packs, which is something I usually like about Thule, this sat a bit differently on the body, so the back of the pack pressed against my neck. So, I loosened the straps and it felt too loose on me. So I tightened them back up. I found a happy medium, but I still felt it sat too high on my back.I LOVE the easy grab zippers. They fit perfectly in your fingers and make for easy unzip/zip. You don't think about these things until you try and unzip something and it drives you crazy because your fingers slip. Not on this backpack. Love those easy grab ones.I also LOVE the fact that it is water resistant. You put the waterbottle in the side pocket and realize too late it's leaking. Ruined laptop. not with this one.Overall, lightweight. Padded and protects my electronic goodies. You can't ask for anything better. If they just made it a bit more comfortable​ it would be perfect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRV3IEFTEECJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8KAFIW#wasThisHelpful","RRV3IEFTEECJ3","A2V98TS4QDDCG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V98TS4QDDCG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great product. It's easy to use and my child loves it. It set-up in minutes and it required very little supervision. My child is eight and she read through the directions and was able to create her clings with us just watching over her for a little while and then we let her go at it. She made colorful window clings for a few hours, completely entertained. It was different and fun for her and didn't take a whole bunch of bulky things to do it. It was all together.This set made about 15-20 clings. Each cling took about 5 minutes to dry, so you don't have to worry about anything messing up. The mixing and set-up was also easy and wasn't that big of a mess. The only thing that got out of hand was when she decided to mix glitter in with the concoction. Overall, great experience and perfect gift for your crafty kid.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLC9VX5SWNY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFWP2XE#wasThisHelpful","RBLC9VX5SWNY7","A2V98TS4QDDCG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V98TS4QDDCG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’ve used many brooms in my day. I’ve used synthetic brooms, bamboo, the one with all the sticks that break off all over the place, even a great Asian broom that I need to buy again, it is kind of small though. This is my first Rubber Squeegee.I wouldn’t exactly describe it as perky though.One, it was easy to put together, even though you really have to JAM it in the hole. Screwing it together only worked with the head of the broom. The pole part I had to really force it in there by slamming it on the floor. Luckily it didn’t break, but I could see this happening.Then for the sweeping part. It’s not an easy sweep, the rubber on my hardwood floor drags a bit, so it’s not a smooth push and pull. It does get up a lot of the items, mainly the animal hair – which we have a lot of. But, the little pieces of paper (I have a crafty kid) doesn’t come up as easily. But it was efficient. Use it with another broom and your vacuum for optimal floor cleaning. I wish the head was a bit bigger…but other than that it did the job.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29VR05OM29BIQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQNI99O#wasThisHelpful","R29VR05OM29BIQ","A2V98TS4QDDCG9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2V98TS4QDDCG9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I think there is sometimes a myth that if you have oily hair, you should be careful with using hair masks or argan oil as it can make it even more oily.

This was is very nice, but it rarely large compared to some others.  The others are a standard brick package, where this one has a cute package.  It is very heavy and would look cute displayed.  I am attaching a picture next to a standard mouse so you can see the size comparison.  This is larger than the mouse.This charging unit has lights to show you how much power is being used or where it is in the charging feature.  I really like this so you know how much power the unit currently has.  I also really like the different attachments.

"I can not really tell how this will fit or if it will fit properly, as I did not realize when getting this that it was for the new 6S.  I can say that screen protectors are a must have for any phone user.  Phone screens break so easily if you drop your phone.

"We had an air purifier for the baby's room but we were not really happy with it as it was loud and blew a bit of cold air when it was doing its cleaning so we tried the the AeraMax Baby DB5 Air Purifier and so far we are very pleased.The product is very easy to set up- it basically works straight out of the box but you do need to take the plastic off the filters and reinstall prior to use.  Then just plug in, let it go through its start up cycle and let it go.  The first thing you notice is that it is very quiet- so quiet I actually wondered if it was doing anything but with two dogs and a cat, the baby routinely had a runny nose in the morning and that has been cut down considerably once we started using the AeraMax so it does seem to be working.In addition, the product has a sleek, tall design so it is attractive and the lights have a similar glow to Eva from Wall-E which my older son likes.  One caveat is that is is pretty lightweight so baby tries to use it to stand up but it tips over so one has to watch it in that respect.  Other then that, I can't find any fault with this product at the moment. I even see that you can get different types of replacement filters for animals, etc so that should be handy when we need to replace it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37KRVU05U2M4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V31B0YU#wasThisHelpful","R37KRVU05U2M4G","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With two kids, traveling can be a bit of a pain, especially when you need two car seats on the other end.  The J.L. Childress Universal Side-Carry Seat Cover does not take all the hassle out of the trip but it does make it somewhat easier. On our outbound trip we used the product to carry the car seat we kept with us through the airports. It worked reasonably well- the seat was easy enough to get in and out of it as the bag is very roomy and we could even stuff more of the babies toys and accessories in it.  The bag is nylon so it is strong but it folded up small enough to stuff under the babies seat when in flight.  The staps were comfortable enough for short walks but they did start to dig into your shoulders after a while as there was no padding.  Overall, it served as an oversize backpack for the seat which was nice.On the way back, we put the older child's car seat in the carrier and checked it and despite losing some of the functionality by not having it with us, we actually liked this option more as it really saved the seat from getting beat up while in the hold. The seat cover really held up and we were able to grab and go once we got the luggage.Either way, this is a durable product that wil make travel with the kids somewhat easier- at least on the car seat...","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QMHWVX2DHTN7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVBGNDI#wasThisHelpful","R2QMHWVX2DHTN7","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I learned how to use a sewing machine when I was young on my grandmother’s machine but I have never owned my own until I got the Singer 1304 Start Basic Everyday and after just a few weeks, I am not sure why I had not gotten one before.  Even if I never find the time to actually make things, just the time it saves on basic mending is worth it.The machine itself is fairly small for a sewing machine and lightweight so it is portable- perhaps a better word is storable in that you can unplug, put on the top shelf and then get down when necessary. Even though it is not that heavy, I would still describe it as sturdy and I anticipate it will last a good while with proper care.  Setup was easy- there are basic instructions and if you follow them, you will be redoing hems and patching holes in a matter of minutes.  It even comes with some thread already so there is no additional material needed to start using it out of the box.As I said, I probably won’t ever use this machine to craft my own clothes or anything, and in truth, this is what one might describe as a “starter kit.” I am sure it is capable of being used for heavy duty sewing but you might be better off with an upgraded machine if you are going to be making serious handicrafts.  What this machine can do is save you time and money- I have two boys, and with them, two dogs and a cat in the house, things get torn, ripped, and trashed with some frequency.  I tried to fix what I could with needle and thread but some stuff was either unsalvageable or I would have to pay the astronomical prices at the local seamstress (10 bucks for a ripped pocket!).  The Singer allows me to make these repairs in minimal time.  Honestly, I’m not sure why I didn’t get one sooner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30KAY4VS29TY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VV4ZWBQ#wasThisHelpful","R30KAY4VS29TY1","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our 3-year-old loves when he gets access to his dad's IPAD, so we were excited at the possibility of a child appropriate tablet.  Overall, the LeapPad2 GLO has a lot of plusses.  First, it has a very sturdy case that keeps both the device and screen protected.  The buttons are clearly marked and easy for little fingers and our son quickly figured out the basics.  It has front-and-back facing cameras, a microphone, nice sound quality and decent screen resolution.  There is an attached stylus, but the touch screen does fine with fingers as well.Some potential cons.  The LeapPad2 requires 4-AA batteries to operate and goes through them fairly quickly.  We had to replace our first set after around 4-5 hours of use.  LeapFrog does offer two alternatives to this.  The $12 Leapfrog Leappad Accessories On-the-go Bundle. Flower Carrying Case, Car Adapter & $15 Digital Download Card, which is a good deal considering it includes a $15 game credit in addition to a case and a car adapter.  There's also the pricier (at over $30) LeapFrog LeapPad2 Recharger Pack (Works with all LeapPad2 Tablets), which includes both rechargeable batteries and an AC adapter.  It's half the base price of the device, but probably a worthwhile investment if your child is going to be regularly using this product.The other issue is the content.  The device comes preloaded with several nice apps and games and includes a credit for one more.  You can both download apps directly to the device with a USB port, or there are games that can be bought on cartridges (tiny versions of the old Tandy squares from my childhood).  Either way is an easy purchase and LeapFrog offers a large variety of apps on their website.  The downside is that the apps are pricey - on average between $10 and $20.  Now, the quality of the apps is high and they are definitely geared at teaching young kids.  However, compared to what's available for a kindle or smartphone for free to under $5, it's a steep jump, so should be considered as a factor when purchasing.  Another plus of the games is that if you're looking for a specific product tie-in, LeapFrog is likely to have it.Our son loves this tablet and I think it's a good, solid option at an overall reasonable price.  It's attractive, durable and easy to use.  I think it's probably better for the younger end of the targeted demographic, but I look forward to being proven wrong over time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24EKRLQTVJQ04/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SKBX1NE#wasThisHelpful","R24EKRLQTVJQ04","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was looking to replace my two year old Samsun S3 smartphone which was running low on memory.  This is a great smartphone, particularly for the price and considering that it's unlocked.First, the phone - it's a comparable size to my old Samsun, although more of the phone is used for the screen.  Screen color and definition and the speakers offer a good quality sound.  It's large enough to feel substantive and be easy to use the screen, but small and slim enough to fit into a pocket without awkwardness.  The basic interface is nice and the phone works well overall.Setting up WiFI was super easy, and if you don't want to install a SIM card, the phone operates excellent just off the Wi-Fi network.  Installing a SIM card is easy (just pop off the back and slide it in.  It only takes micro SIM cards, which is important to note.  I was able to easily and quickly download all my previously purchased apps using Wi-Fi.  The keyboard, and basic built in apps are handy, but there are not so many built in apps that I felt clogged up from the second I got started.  The phone charged quickly and easily and accepted charges that can multi-function.Overall, this is a great little smart phone if you're not interesting in paying a huge amount.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQJ3IGQQNL1WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNKES28#wasThisHelpful","RQJ3IGQQNL1WU","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let’s just get this out of the way- if you get the Radio Flyer Ultimate EZ Folding Wagon thinking it will pass for the Radio Flyer red wagon of your youth, you will be disappointed.  Although this looks like the classic wagon in form, it is probably much closer to think of this product as a double stroller then a wagon.But that ok! In fact it’s great- we have two children, ages 10 months and 3 years and although we have a Phil and Ted double stroller, we find that we can’t really carry all the things we need in it when we go places- what with diaper bags, snacks, drinks, etc. The Radio Flyer solves these problems- there is plenty of room for two kids to sit- the recommended age is 1 and a half but our ten month old loves it and can sit up, buckled in just fine.  There is also plenty of room in the middle for all the accessories needed as well as cup holders both in the wagon for the kids and outside for parents drinks.  The canopy top provides complete top coverage, unlike the typical stroller cover and comes in handy, especially on a hot day.  The icing on the cake is that since the Radio Flyer folds up, it does not take any more space than the double stroller in the back of our car.  Overall, this is fast replacing our stroller as the go-to child conveyance in our house.The product itself is typical Radio Flyer high quality- we have the typical red wagon and tricycle as well and we can’t say enough.  Construction was fairly simple and the instructions were easy to follow.  Just to note, and another reason I say the product is not really a wagon is the side are really just a red canvas material, that won’t really allow for much impact.  In addition, the wheels are set so that they have great turning radius, but they are thinner and connected to higher, thinner rods then the wagon.  Bottom line- this is for hauling children and their gear, not for racing down hills, tying to the back of bikes, and all those other great things we did as kids but wouldn’t dream of letting out kids do today.  The seats are hard plastic with a safety belt and the canopy top seems to be the same material as the sides.  The only complain I really have is that once folded, sometimes it is a bit hard to unfold.Overall, if you need a double stroller or are ready to ditch the traditional stroller, this may be what you are looking for.  We really enjoy taking our kids on walks in this and they love it as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUZ53ZI9PK542/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OD3EVDW#wasThisHelpful","RUZ53ZI9PK542","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its kind of hard to believe that even with the long litany of tragedies and wars of the 20th century, something on the scale of the India-Pakistan partisan, which saw 12.5 million people displaced and up to a million killed, should be somewhat overlooked- at least in Western texts and thought.In that sense, Midnight’s Fury by Nisid Hajari is a critical book in that it tells the story of that fateful year of 1947, concentrating on the leaders- Gandhi, Nehru and Ali Jinnah and the choices they made and the ways they got swept up in history’s tide and overtaken by events. Hajari also chronicals the British’s rapid, one might even say chaotic departure from the subcontinent and the vacuum that ensued that was filled by ethnic and religious violence.This is a well-written book that really delves into that year. The scholarship and research is self-evident as Hajari brings primary sources into sharp focus to display how both sides got caught in a cycle of action and reaction and the results that followed. The book is detailed but not overly gory as he relates the violence and atrocities that racked India and Pakistan during this time.If I have one complaint, it’s that Hajari does not much to place the situation at the dawn of the partisan in much context- understandably this may be a lot but at least a brief overview of the British Raj would be in order and placing the contest in the UK’s history and policy in the region. Then at the end, he sort of tails off at the end of partisan and does not really close any of the threads that were left open. For example- how Pakistan was split into two that almost guaranteed a coming civil war, which finally happened in 1970-71 when Bangladesh broke away.However, this is not to take away from the sheer power of Midnight’s Fury, which tells, in gripping detail, the story of one of the largest displacement of peoples and mass killings the world has ever seen, but depressingly, seems to know too little about.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYKDQXORILNWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547669216#wasThisHelpful","RYKDQXORILNWB","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you travel enough, you seem to gravitate towards a particular travel guide that best suits you.  For us, that is the Lonely Planet series- it gives a wide range of options in a number of different price ranges and has nice write-ups of most attractions, not only in the major cities but in out of the way places as well.  The write-ups are informative with schedules, prices, an often suggested times to go.  They even will caution against going if they feel it’s not worth it which allows the traveler to make up their own mind.In that respect, the Lonely Planet Scotland is a welcome addition to the series.  It starts with suggested key highlights from around the country, mixing urban (Edinburgh and Glasgow) with more remote locals and islands, and even throwing in golf and whiskey.  It then makes itinerary suggestions if you have certain interests and has a calendar of festivals and events to help plan events as well.  It has some general tourist guidelines such as climate, transportation, visa need, etc. Finally they get into the different regions- as one might imagine the largest sections focus on the main cities but they do a great job of breaking the country down by region and giving the adventurous traveler a reason to get out of the cities and see more out of the way places.Having said that, we were a bit disappointed in this version of Lonely Planet.  One reason we really liked the series is that they always have a history section that traces the history of the city, region, etc that they are covering.  This one has it but it is sorely lacking. The write-ups are a half page at best and not very informative.  In addition, other Lonely Planet guides have inserts throughout the book that illuminate some local tradition or lore but this has none of that.  I suppose they figure the reader is familiar enough with the subject or it would make the book too long/thick to be useful while traveling but surely a better balance could have been struck.Overall, though, another fine effort from Lonely Planet that really opens up the possibilities when visiting Scotland.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO9V45NGHI0M0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1743215703#wasThisHelpful","RO9V45NGHI0M0","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very thick, wavy should length hair and I'm always looking for new ways to tame it. If I'm going for style, normally I'll either get a blow out (if I have time and cash) or use a flat iron. I have a Remington NEW Wet 2 Straight Ceramic Hair Straightener with 2"" Inch Ceramic Plates, All NEW Steam Vent Technology, Fast Heat Up & Swivel Cord and it works great, although nothing is as good as someone else doing my hair.  I was initially a bit dubious of this device, since my hair does not respond well to brushes in general (I literally don't own one).The single biggest perk of this item is versatility.  I travel a lot, so appreciate any time I can bring one item and have it serve several purposes.  If you're going on a trip and want options with your hair, this will definitely provide it.  You can flat iron, add some curl or body, or just use it as a standard brush (not for me but I understand that most people have a better relationship with brushes than I do).I found the straightening element worked well overall.  I won't be getting rid of my other flat iron any time soon - the bristles made it very hard to get all the way to the roots of your hair, and I found that while it was a good flat iron, I like my Remington a bit better.  I liked being able to trap the end of my hair into the iron to start the curls.  Due to the size of the tube, you get fairly large, loos curls.  For thick hair, I found this slightly less effective, as I had use fairly small strips of hair to allow sufficient exposure to the rod.  However, I have friends with thin hair, and have no doubt that for those whose hair is less bushy, it would work very well.I think the bristles were my least favorite part, as I had to be careful when unwinding curls to ensure they didn't get brushed out and puffy.  Again, it all depends on what type of hair you have.  I will definitely be throwing this in my suitcase next time I want some options while traveling, while keeping the luggage on the light side.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMFACX7U03XMN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOJ9008#wasThisHelpful","RMFACX7U03XMN","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ok- I’m just going to put this out there- a 5 and a half pound bag of candy is probably not for everyone but for those that either eat or need a lot of candy, you could do worse than a ton of Blue Raspberry Jolly Ranchers.I have to assume that if you are reading this, you have an idea of what a Jolly Rancher is but if not, it’s a hard candy that comes individually wrapped in a small rectangular piece about the size of a nickel (well- if nickels were rectangular).  They have a number of flavors but the basic ones are watermelon, grape, cherry, green apple, and blue raspberry.So- I hear you asking- why would you buy a gigantic bag of only one flavor when you can get bags with all five flavors?  Well- it’s like this- Blue Raspberry rocks- it’s not just the hypnotic light blue color but it has a sublime raspberry taste that can’t be beat- ok, the watermelon is close but blue raspberry edges it out by a whisker. And like the green M&Ms, they are always- and I do mean always, underrepresented in the bag.  Oh, I know the manufacturer says they mix all the flavors in the bag evenly.  Lies! There are never enough Blue Raspberry, and that dear reader is why you need this product.

"I love Thai curry, yet with a regular work schedule and two kids, taking the time to make a proper curry paste isn't an option.  Maggie offers a decent option if you'd like to cook a curry at home, but have limited time.  This is a large tub, so if you don't plan to make curry regularly, it may not be your best option.  It's great if you're cooking for a dinner party and want more than a small serving, which is the option of most single-serve packet brands.  In addition, I found that it stayed well if you seal in a zip lock bag and keep it in the fridge, but after about 6 weeks the flavor starts to wane.It's super easy to use.  Open the pouch, sauté some of the paste in oil, add coconut milk (or combine coconut milk and broth to reduce the fat content) and add your choice of protein and veggies and let simmer.  The dishes are easy to reheat and make great leftovers.  This curry is fairly salty, so I like to include some citrus (fresh lime juice) to cut the salt and not too spicy, so if you’re a big heat fan you should plan to add some more on your own.  Overall, it’s a good way to “spice up” your dinner options.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KB9CM41D84Z7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ6EGFQ#wasThisHelpful","R2KB9CM41D84Z7","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We found ourselves in the market for a more heavy-duty crib mattress cover as our 8-month old is now drinking his bottle by himself and refuses to go to sleep without it (and yes, this includes waking up multiple times a night to ""fill up"").  As you might imagine this cause a delightful little two-fer problem in that he makes a mess while drinking and, well- he stresses the limits of his diaper during the night.  Given the situation, we took the opportunity to try the Serta Perfect Sleeper Crib Mattress Cover.The product itself is everything it claims- the top is 100% cotton and very thick and soft, while the sides are an elastic polyurethane.  It does fit a regular sized U.S. crib mattress; however the elastic is just a bit loose.  This is not an issue as I think most would use a cover sheet but if you did just want to use the pad itself, it might slip a little.  The pad seems to just come in the one color and style- white with the Serta sheep pattern plus stars on top of it. The design does show through a white sheet if you look hard enough and although the sheep are cute but I could also understand where some people might not want to have a corporate logo showing in their baby’s bed.  If this is a factor, a colored sheet hides the pattern quite nicely. The quality seems in line with other mattress pads we have owned- either adult or baby- which is to say holds up fairly well to frequent washing, and does not seem to rip or tear too easily.  As for being waterproof- we have already had to change it out a few times in the morning and it seems to be holding its own against the formula and other liquids being thrown its way.The last note is the thickness on the top- I don't know if our baby notices the softness or not. There is no discernable way to tell if he is sleeping better on this pad verses the others we rotate out with it as he still loves getting us up at night, but I have to admit, it does feel good to lay him down on such as soft nest.Overall, this is a nice, quality crib pad, and at $20 dollars is a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19ES1D6XV57VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUT4P62#wasThisHelpful","R19ES1D6XV57VD","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've used a wide variety of bottles and nipples between our two children. I found these to be a solid, middle-of-the-road bottle, but was not overly impressed by the anti-colic feature if your child truly has issues with gas.  The shape of the nipples was fairly unique – significantly smaller than the Munchkin LATCH line of bottles, and the Playtex Ventaire that also have an anti-colic feature.  The head of the nipple is very small comparatively, and would be useful with a younger baby.  They most resemble the infant nipples used by Madela.  AVENT offers a range of nipple speeds, and the size does work with an older child, but our son who was used to a wider nipple from the Playtex and Munchkin took time to adjust.Instead of a mini-bottle, the 9 oz bottle is great for older babies.  Our 8 month old son goes through 6-9 oz in a feeding, so the larger bottle is easier to use than many of the other brands which have only 6-8 oz bottles.  This is particularly true if you’re using formula, which requires the extra space to add the powder to the water and mix.  I also liked that amounts were listed not only in US oz, but in ML and UK oz.  We live overseas and having a measurement that makes sense to our child care provider is a huge plus.The bottle comes apart easily for cleaning, and has only three parts.  My biggest concern was the “anti-colic’ element, which is basically rivets in the nipples.  Our son, who is not prone to colic, did fine with these.  However, I feel the actual anti-colic value here seems less than that of the Latch or Ventaire.  That said, our son had no more issues with these than with the other brands.  Overall I found it to be a good bottle/nipple combo, and easy to use.  If your baby is particularly colicky, I’d recommend one of the other brands, but it’s a very good standard bottle overall.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VELO8HTKS8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PF8A6Q0#wasThisHelpful","R20VELO8HTKS8T","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have always enjoyed historical tracing books such as “Salt” or “Cod” that take one thing and trace it through history and “Rain: A Natural and Cultural History” by Cynthia Barnett is in the same mold. True to the title, Barnett traces human interactions with rain (or lack of rain as the case may be) through the eons. She weaves cultural references and natural science together to show man’s attempts to understand this phenomena and in some instances, attempts to control it. A bit unlike other books of what I consider its genre, “Rain” is less history- after all, can one really dispute the absolute necessity of it, and more a look of mankind’s relationship with it. Therefore she does rely a lot more on poets then historians but it is still a compelling look at something we take for granted, especially the warning that we may be taking rain too much for granted and risk contaminating it even further.Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable book. The writing is crisp and compelling and the narrative is brisk and keeps the reader’s attention. One could quibble about examples she uses or ones she does not (What- no Credence Clearwater Revival and ""Who'll Stop The Rain""???), but given the absolutely overwhelming amount of source material, that seems like a pretty churlish complaint. Barnett clearly knows her stuff and is totally in synch with her subject.

"Our oldest son just turned three and over the past six months or so has become much more interested in playing with items that Mom and Dad use.  We started him out with a toy kitchen and a small Melissa and Doug Wooden Tool Box and although he loves the kitchen, he played with the tool kit one or twice and did not touch it again (our eight month old on the other hand loves it!).  Since he did like the larger kitchen ensemble, we, took the opportunity to get the Lanard Workman Ultimate Workbench and it has been an unequivocal hit.The work bench itself is made of hard plastic pieces, with a cardboard backing.  The table is almost two feet off the ground so it’s a good height for the target audience of about 3-6 years.  The back part rises to about three feet so all in all it’s an imposing toy but not too big to be intimidating to our three year old.  The bench is fairly easy to assemble and has hooks and areas to hand and store all the tool toys that come with the set.  The plastic is sturdy so I am confident it will last long enough for our second son to play with it as well.  The only slight negative is the cardboard backing is a bit flimsy.Although the bench itself is fairly impressive, it’s the array of tools that comes with the set that is truly astounding. It has all the usual ones- wrenches, screwdrivers, saws and hammers- but it also has a nail gun and lathe (with attached baseball bat no less) that are battery powered to move and simulate the real equipment.  There are also 15 each of nuts and bolts.  All the pieces are colorful, hard plastic that can withstand hard play. I am actually less concerned about these toys then I am with the wooden tools in the Melissa and Doug tool set.  Best of all, all the tools are pretty good replicas of real tools, albeit a bit smaller for smaller hands.  I don’t think I can say enough about this point as our son really likes to play with the same things he sees his daddy use (except the lathe- we don’t have a lathe although my husband now says he needs one…).  It really is a good lead-in to the real things as my husband is working with our son on the importance of putting the tools back in their areas and making sure they are properly cared for, well- as well as a three year old can take care of things.  The urge to throw things is strong in that one.At about $75 dollars, the Workman Ultimate Workbench is also a good value.  That is comparable to larger workbench toys from other major brands that do not contain the same amount to tool toys and significantly cheaper than some brands. If you are looking for a quality toy work bench, with a good selection of toy tools at a reasonable price, this is a great option.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LYPKDDL58G3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q058PRE#wasThisHelpful","R3LYPKDDL58G3A","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn’t really know what to expect with “Women of Will” by Tina Packer.  From the name, you could pretty much deduce it would focus on the female characters, especially with a secondary title of “Following the Feminine in Shakespeare’s Plays”, which sounds intriguing in theory, but how would it work in practice?After reading the book, I am still trying to figure out how it does work in practice.  Much like Will Shakespeare himself, the book is a bit of a mystery, wrapped in a riddle, inside an enigma (to paraphrase Churchill…)  To begin with the book is not an academic work in that Packer does not spend much time- any time really, citing source documents or such.  Her only sources are the plays themselves which she is intimately familiar with from her stage background.  In that respect, she really brings to life the characters she focuses on and interprets them in her own way- much like every director or actor has since Will first wrote the plays, but you can’t help but come away with the feeling, that it remains just that- her interpretation of these characters- not Shakespeare’s.The book itself is broken into five acts that Packer uses to trace her view of the changing way women are portrayed in Shakespeare.  Starting with Kate from Taming of the Shrew, which shows in her opinion, a sophomoric view of women as property, she traces what she sees as the advancement of his views on the status and value of women through five “acts”, ending with the stronger, nobler women characters, to be found in Marina (Pericles) and Hermoine (The Winter’s Tale) as she tries to theorize how the idea of the female changed through the writing and what might be the cause of it (Love Actually).Which brings us to the second conundrum about the book- The writing is good and engaging but one feels they must already have a Master’s in Literature to follow her sometimes.  I am reasonably familiar with a large number of Shakespeare’s plays but Packer left me in the dust and never looked back.  For a scholarly work, I would expect this, but for a book that basically outlines the author’s insights, a bit more background would have been handy.None of this is to say I did not enjoy the book- I actually did.  The author’s enthusiasm for the subject is infectious but it is not light reading.  I don’t necessarily think the reasoning is entirely accurate but the book is a great view of how Shakespeare’s women characters evolved over the course of his career.  In that respect, and for anyone who is looking for a contemporary retelling of Shakespeare, this is well worth the read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F1CD2QC7LUHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307700399#wasThisHelpful","R3F1CD2QC7LUHD","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved paper dolls as a kid, but they are not so common these days. The paper dolls that are available tend to be fairly expensive and not particularly high quality - a younger child just isn't capable of not destroying them. This product, the T.S. Pirates of the High Seas Wooden Magnetic Dress Up Kit, is the perfect compromise, as this set is comparably priced to some paper doll books I've seen.Overall, the set is great, particularly for little ones who like pirates. We have others in the same line of product but this is the first we have that does not seem especially geared towards girls.  It should be noted that the others have also worked well three-year-old boy, but- well- hey- these are pirates.  There are two main pirate figures with interchangeable pieces of assorted pirate garb, hats, swords, pirate chests, and other pirate paraphernalia such as a treasure map, spyglass, flag, and even a monkey. The pieces are well made, have lots of detail and the plastic pouch they come in makes for an easy way to store and transport what could otherwise be lots of annoying pieces. The pieces stick well, but are easy for small hands to manipulate and are durable, so can survive normal pre-schooler play. The one drawback is that some of the pieces are really small so if you have younger children in the house, you do need to be careful as they can be a choking hazard.  In fairness to T.S. Shure- they do label this very clearly on the packaging.If you have a child who likes pirates, this is a great set, has quality, well made pieces and can offer hours of fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XSK6LIMKP6M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWD2U#wasThisHelpful","R30XSK6LIMKP6M","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have very thick, somewhat wavy should length hair and I'm always looking for new ways to tame it.  If I'm going for style, normally I'll either get a blow out (if I have time and cash) or use a flat iron. I have a Remington NEW Wet 2 Straight Ceramic Hair Straightener with 2"" Inch Ceramic Plates, All NEW Steam Vent Technology, Fast Heat Up & Swivel Cord  and it works great, although nothing is as good as someone else doing my hair.On the plus side, I travel a lot and this is dual voltage so can go with me.  It's fairly compact and lightweight.  However, I'm not sold overall.  First, the glove.  Why is there a glove you ask?  To be honest, I'm still not sure and I didn't like wearing it.  Your hair definitely has to be dry before using this, so you better have time to first blow dry, then style.  Heat control seems to be an issue and I had to be careful not to burn myself.I'd also say, this might be more successful for someone with different hair.  My hair is very thick and hard to style.  If you have thinner or straight hair, I think this would do a decent job of giving you volume.  However, if you're not an expect, for thick hair, it can only exacerbate existent problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23OEJU51WLEE6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3JDCH2#wasThisHelpful","R23OEJU51WLEE6","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be clear, I'm not sure that I actually ""like"" this toy, but boy is it a hit with my two sons, aged 3 and 8 months.  We had purchased Tiny Love Crosby Clip-On Crab Stroller Toy when our older son was a baby and it is still popular with him on longer car rides.  The older boy likes lions, so we thought this might be good to entertain the baby in the car.First, it's big.  This thing takes up the whole car window.  The lion hangs by a plastic bar with two (strong) suction cups that hooks onto little pegs on lion's paws.  That's also the basis for the lion's ability to move around.  It's bright, colorful and has a nice texture if baby wants to touch it.  It also comes with a small rattle with a wristband which is fun for baby as the lion appears to be sound activated and turns on when baby shakes his wrist.I'm not sure if it was designed by a drunken collage student, a genius or a combination of the two.  The lion dances and roars to frat party style electronica.  Now, since my older son's favorite form of communication is roaring, this makes it incredibly popular.  The three year old loves it.  The 8 month old stares at it raptly as thought it is even more interesting than his older brother (this is by no means a small feat).  So from the ""entertaining children"" perspective, it's a big hit.  From the adult perspective, I can mostly live with my sons being entertained by a roaring, lion drunkenly gyrating to bad electronica in the car.From the ""how long can you listen to this without going crazy?""  Well, that's a personal question.  For us, the entertainment value has outweighed the annoyance and after the initial surprise, the music is actually a slightly refreshing change from the standard 4 tinny classical tunes on most baby products.  Overall, our family finds the lion a roaringly good time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25KK4GVVM0YDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYL9MQ6#wasThisHelpful","R25KK4GVVM0YDV","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Our 3 year old loves trains.  He discovered Thomas shortly after turning two and got his first train set at 28 months. Ever since, he can spend hours playing with his ""choo choos"" and loves to set up elaborate tracks and push them around all day. He saw this set, stopped what he was doing and spent the next 2 hours playing with it non-stop.  He spent the next two days carrying the ""ship"" with him everywhere he went, so from that perspective, there is no question that this item is a hit.While we have purchased a number of the Thomas series wooden trains, most of his tracks are Melissa & Doug Deluxe Wooden Railway Set or 100 Pieces of Bulk Wooden Train Track. Compatible with All Major Brands Including Thomas the Tank Engine.  This is largely due to my refusing to pay for the larger Thomas kits, which are significantly more expensive.  However, this was a nice set to supplement the others and to give his train building a bit more of a Sodor feel.The set itself contains a limited number of track pieces and cannot make many configurations beyond that shown on the box.  Instructions for that configuration are included and when set up, it nicely creates a small figure-eight with the ship, a tunnel and a small vender.  The pieces also fit interchangeably with our other sets (except that the Thomas tracks are too wide for ourWooden Train Expansion Pieces Raised Track Support ( 6 pack) so you can mix this in with a less expensive set of tracks quite easily to expand the fun.  The tracks are high quality, with some nice detailing and fit together well.  Some of the tracks have road designs on the bottom, so if you have toy trucks they would also be useful.  However, this set includes only a special ""celebrations"" Thomas (who looks like normal Thomas, but with what appear to be fireworks on the side) and a follow car for Thomas.  The ship is a fun addition with a few little flags that pop up from the smoke stack if you push a button and once you figure it out the tunnel is cool.Overall, if you have a train lover in your house and particularly a Thomas fan, it's pretty sure this set will delight.  It clearly has a target audience and at least in my house, it really hits the mark.  Parents, however, will have to ask if the price is right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L08QNZAJLWFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MYL98OM#wasThisHelpful","R2L08QNZAJLWFJ","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We're Melissa & Doug fans and were looking for something for our son who just turned 8 months and can sit up on his own and crawl. It's rated for babies 9 months and up, but I actually think it would be better for younger babies.The item itself is adorable. It's soft, brightly colored and well made. The ""wheels"" sit on the ground and are attached. The ""dashboard"" required 3 AA batteries (not included), which allow the three ""lights"" to activate and music to play. This particularly happens if the key is put in the ignition and turned. The steering wheel rotates all the way and the dashboard attaches to the front with some strong Velcro. I found the buttons a bit hard to activate, but it still worked well and our son lived the side ""mirror"" and smiled every time he looked at it. There is an open area under the front so baby's legs can just stick right out and it even allows older children (like jealous big brothers) to be able to get into the chair for as long as their entertained. There's a little mesh pouch on the rear and even a cup holder for baby's bottle.The downside is that since our baby is already moving, he didn't want to stay seated in the chair, even with the lights, music and other attractions. Which is why I recommend the toy for a baby younger than the noted 9 months. If we'd had this for our son when he was 4-7 months, it would have been perfect. However, he likes it for the first couple minutes, then arches himself of the back and since the car is several inches tall, attempts to bonk his head on the floor. Also, given the size, I think this item might be hard to wash as it definitely won't fit in a washing machine.However, our household cat decided that this is the greatest thing we've ever owned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DP46WTQNCS9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBIYO18#wasThisHelpful","R1DP46WTQNCS9M","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to say- the Fisher-Price Comfort Curve Bouncer may be the first Fisher-Price accessory that has disappointed me.  We have had some our children have not particularly cared for but I was always happy with the functionality, design, and the fact that they were sturdy enough to be used, thrown in a closet and then brought back out for our second child.  We got this product as we have already had a metal frame bouncer so wanted to try this model to see if the added mobility was worth it.  I have to say- so far the answer is no.The first thing you notice is that it is more difficult to assemble then other Fisher-Price products- not necessarily hard, but just more cumbersome.  Many of their products don’t require tools at all but you need a screwdriver for this one.  Again- the setup is not difficult but compared to their other products, it is more effort.  Once the chair is set up, it consists of fairly flimsy plastic around a light wire frame for the base.  I understand that the plastic has to be flexible in order for the seat to bounce, but it just seems really thin and not at all sturdy.  The chair is rated up to 25 pounds but our son is about 18 pounds and I am already a bit uncomfortable with him in the seat.  There is a noticeable bend when he is placed in it that you don’t get with the typical metal framed bouncers.  I guess the bottom line is, although light and portable, this chair does not feel sturdy and I don’t think it will last a particularly long time.  The seat has a vibrating mechanism but it is only one speed and the motor is a bit loud.  Also, unlike other Fisher-Price bouncers, there is no music.  In fact, for baby’s entertainment there are just two danglies that hook on to the play bar.  The play bar itself is just a strip of plastic- not rigid at all- that clips into the sides of the chair.  In addition, and I realize this is a matter of taste- I don’t find the design particularly attractive.  The seat cover is covered with colorful little spheroids that resemble the old AT&T logo.  I understand some may be tired of the usual Fisher Price motif of bright colorful animals but this design looks like something straight out of the 70’s.There are some positives to this product.  As I mentioned- it is extremely light and portable.  If you need mobility, it will definitely give you that over a normal bouncing chair.  In addition, in contrast to the rest of the chair which seems pretty flimsy, the danglies may be best I have ever seen.  There is a little deer and raccoon figure with a little rattle attached to them that are colorful and well made.  Even if we give away the chair- we are so keeping the danglies.  I guess the last positive- and the reason this chair is not rated lower is that our child does enjoy sitting in it.  I won’t say he likes it better than other bouncers but about the same and in the end, I guess that counts for something.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32UBMUO58RZ0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NEO5UQS#wasThisHelpful","R32UBMUO58RZ0C","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Fisher-Price Woodlands Friends Space Saver Jumperoo is basically a scaled down, portable version of their Jumparoo series.  We have a Rainforest Jumparoo and are on our second son with it and they both just love it.  We got the space saver model as we are doing a bit of traveling and thought it would be handy to have somewhere fun to plop the 7 month old while we chase the 3 year old.  In that respect, it does the trick- it is fairly lightweight, folds up easily and is portable, which if you are familiar with the full-size Jumparoo models, know is just not an option with them.The product itself has the standard Fisher Price motif of colorful animals and bright patterns.  This model has squirrels and frogs.  One other positive is all the colors are gender neutral so there is no ""boy"" or ""girl"" model, so it is good for all children!  As with most Fisher-Price products, we find the Space Saver Jumparoo to be of high quality that should last and allow you to use the product until your baby outgrows it and even for future children.  It is sturdy plastic with plenty of support and balance and is easy to set up as everything just snaps into place.  As with other Fisher-Price bouncers, it is adjustable, has several dangly things meant to catch baby's attention, and noises and lights that play when he is jumping.Having said that, we do prefer the full size model.  This Jumparoo is fine but we feel the bigger version gives him more movement- the chair swivels in a complete 360 to allow baby to follow things that are going on in the room. The full size model also has three posts with the elastic material attached whereas this model only has one.  You can just tell, this model is a bit more of an effort to bounce in and he gets tired more easily.  Of course we realize that you have to give something up for the mobility and space savings but if you can only get one and your space permits, we would recommend the full size version over making this your everyday bouncer.  However, if you have the need and the budget for a mobile version- then this is the one you need.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PLB8KH0TGSOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFETGM6#wasThisHelpful","R3PLB8KH0TGSOC","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As we move around a lot with our jobs, we wanted to get our older son something to give him a better understanding of the world but that would also keep his attention. The T.S. Shure Map of the World Magnetic Playboard seemed like a good option even if our son is younger then the recommended age 6 and up.  We have other T.S. Shure products and find them fairly well made but not things that will last forever.In this regards, the world map is in line with the company's other products.  It is colorful but the pieces are thin and although will last a while with responsible play, probably won't hold up to heavy play.  The map is also somewhat smaller then what I expected. With 100 pieces, I just expected a bit bigger- the font is hard to read and the artwork, although very good and whimsical is also small.On the plus side, the product does do what we want- it helps us start a conversation with our son about the places we have been and is helping him start to understand the different regions of the world.  The pieces are color coded by continent and for the most part are geographically correct.  There are some quibbles of course (What, no Kosovo??) but as we aren't trying to make a political statement with a child's map, we are not too concerned about it.  Initial reaction to the map has been positive and many of the magnetic countries have migrated to the fridge as well.Overall, we are enjoying the product and yes, it would probably last longer and be more informative in the hands of an older child, but our son does really like it and we would recommend this as an introductory toy to world geography.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5KLOIG61BIMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RTC162S#wasThisHelpful","R5KLOIG61BIMQ","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have been using the Fisher Price Sit Me Up Floor Seat for 4 months since our son was about 3-months old and are thrilled with it. It's a great place to put him down so he can see what is going on around him and presents a nice change from the reclining bouncer, as it provides enough support to hold him erect while also providing containment. I also think it helped develop the muscles related to sitting upright as he was able to sit and hold himself up at about 6-months old- much faster than his older brother. In addition- he loves it. He has a better view of the room and just seems more alert and interested in his surroundings when sitting upright.The product itself has the standard Fisher Price motif of colorful animals and bright patterns. This model is a blue frog with a green foot rest but they also sell models with a lion and a monkey. One other positive is all the colors are gender neutral so there is no ""boy"" or ""girl"" model, it all depends on what animal you think is cutest. As with most Fisher-Price products, we find the Floor Seat to be of high quality that should last and allow you to use the seat until your baby outgrows it and even for future children. It is sturdy plastic with plenty of support and balance. Although the warning clearly states not to place it on elevated surfaces due to the possibility of baby tipping him or herself over, we have not found that to be a problem. We place it on our (very wide) kitchen island so he can watch as we feed his older brother and it is quite sturdy. The seat portion is deep with fabric that connects to a high ring around his chest that does not allow him to escape or to lurch about too much. There are two detachable toys, but he does not play too much with them as he prefers that most wonderful of all toys- a spoon. The seat also folds up for travel if you want to take it with you.  We have not done so but it is light enough that I don’t think it would be very burdensome.We find the product superior to the similar product we had, the Galt Playnest and Gym - Farm. The Fisher-Price assembly was simple and it takes up significantly less space. Although the Galt allowed baby a greater range of motion, the Sit Me Up allows baby to sit near you and observe, while still including some (limited) built in toys for entertainment. Comparatively, this is also about 30% less expensive. It also helps provide some protection from his rampaging older brother as the later can't try to lift the baby from this as he does with the bouncers we have. If you're looking for an alternative to the traditional bouncy chair, we can highly recommend this item. Once the baby can hold his head erect, he can enjoy this chair until he outgrows it, which we estimate should be at about one year for us as at 18 pounds, it is already getting a bit tight to get him in and out.

"We have had a Fisher Price Bubble Mower for a few years already so as with any ""Lawn Care Device"" it was getting a bit old from overuse- the only difference is that our three year old loves his mower while his father, well...not so much. With our younger son just learning to walk and premonitions of sibling arguments in the future, we took the opportunity to upgrade to the latest model.For starters, the new model is very similar to the older ones. The big difference is the older one had a movable throttle which this one does not have, but this one has a transparent top and you can see the fan whirling inside. Overall, though, it is the same classic toy and since it is Fisher-price, it is made of high quality, safe plastic. I am confident that any toddler will enjoy pushing this toy around the yard, the house, anywhere really...and then screaming with delight at all the bubbles they are creating. The only catch is that you should invest in a higher quality of bubble liquid then what comes with it if you want to get the most out of this toy. You will have to buy more soon anyway as the machine runs through it pretty quick.Overall, however, I can't say enough about this toy. My older son loves it and the younger son loves looking at the bubbles for now and soon he will be able to push his as well. The only problem is that I am not sure having two of them will be sufficient to stop the inevitable arguments.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FKES3THPCY1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLBGUZW#wasThisHelpful","R2FKES3THPCY1S","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are always looking for ways to stimulate our son’s interest in learning as well as keep him busy, so, although he is three and a little young for the target range of the Summer Bridge Activities Pre-K-K workbook, we got it in hopes that we could work our way up to the activities with him.  In that, we were not disappointed.  There are a number of exercises that we can work with him- some obviously that will need to wait until he is a bit older, but for the most part, everything seems age appropriate and ideally suited for kids in Pre-K or Kindergarten.The book itself is large, nicely printed, and divided into three sections, each with its own exercises and goals.  The pages are perforated so they pull out easily.  The book also plus contains a reading list, flash cards and stickers to use as incentive.  I was happy to see a number of books that we currently read to our son on the reading list.  This can be seen as a negative as maybe the level should be a bit higher, but I assume it’s not just reading the story but talking about them with your child as well.  Section 1 contained the more basic exercises as you might imagine- exercise with numbers, shapes, etc which honestly, is about where our child is right now.  If you do have a kindergarten aged child, this section may be too elementary.  Section 2 also had counting, colors and brought in handwriting.  This is where it started to go beyond us, and Section 3 which phonics and handwriting were for the most part beyond what our son could do himself and needs an adult to guide him through. Overall, we are very happy with the book- some exercises hit home more than others at the moment but there is enough for a few years range from about 3-6 in the book to make it worthwhile.

The paper dolls that are available tend to be fairly expensive and not particularly high quality - a younger child just isn't capable of not destroying them. These are the perfect compromise, as this set is comparably priced to some paper doll books I've seen.Overall, the set is great, particularly for little ones who like horses.  Most reviews note this is good for girls, however it has also worked well for our almost-three-year-old boy.  Although the main doll is a girl, our son loves horses and enjoyed playing with both characters.  The range of clothes for ""Emily"" is great - lots of equestrian wear.  However, I think a few more options for the horse other than a saddle would have been good.  The pieces are well made, have lots of detail and the wooden ""frame"" they come in makes for an easy way to store what could otherwise be lots of annoying pieces. The pieces stick well, but are easy for small hands to manipulate and are durable, so can survive normal pre-schooler play. There's a stand so that ""Freckles"" can stand up, but it doesn't fit quite perfect.  Also, there's no way to get Emily to be able to sit on Freckles.  That said, those are minor quips and don't impact my son's enjoyment of this set.If you have a child who likes horses, this is a great set, has quality, well made pieces and can offer hours of fun.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FVL0VTNWEG9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RDL4EC#wasThisHelpful","R1FVL0VTNWEG9U","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are an expat family and want to ensure that our sons (almost 3 and 7 months) grow up knowing about the United States.  We were delighted with this map, as it is a great tool/toy to help with that goal.The map is colorful, durable and interesting to look at, making it a great addition to the wall in our older son's room.  It has grommets to make attaching to the wall easy and non-destructive to the map.  It includes state capitals and interesting facts about the states, some geographic landmarks, and items commonly associated with each state (a space shuttle for Florida, redwoods for California).  Sometimes the additional information covers up parts of the state's shape, but overall it's a good and sufficiently accurate, particularly for younger children.It also includes removable stickers, with notes to personalize places for children, marking things like where grandparents live, vacations, places they want to visit, etc.  Overall, I think this will be a great tool for us to help our sons become more familiar with our home country.  We also got the Melissa & Doug Wooden USA Map Puzzle, which is a nice compliment to this map if you're trying to use it as a teaching toy about the USA.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TT5V42O0SXMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWDFM#wasThisHelpful","R1TT5V42O0SXMI","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We have an almost 3 year old, who really enjoyed playing with the bears.My only suggested improvement relates to this being a product clearly aimed at girls.  With two bears and the amount of clothes, this could have easily divided into one of each gender with clothes for each.  Instead it was 100% female clothes, which limits it somewhat.  A boy could still play with this, but with only minimal changes, it could be a great gender neutral toy, instead of one focused towards little girls.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HVYQ7LW4FU38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I64DYU#wasThisHelpful","R3HVYQ7LW4FU38","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started reading the Showalter's Lords of the Underworld series a number of years ago and loved the original books.  However, I have to concur with those who say that her work over time has begun to vary in quality.  Don't get me wrong, this book is fine....but just that, fine.  Perhaps it is the spinoff world - I don't think the Angels of the Dark series has the same ""spark"" that the LOTU does.  Perhaps its that the characters seem to now be caricatures of  those from the earlier books.  Gwen's inner strength and spunkiness, once it broke through her timidity in The Darkest Whisper was well written character development, versus the forced feeling I had about Elin.  Perhaps it's the sitcom-esque forced cast of secondary characters that now must exist in any given book, but all these contributed to this book just not having the same quality of Showalter's earlier ones.I will also say, I feel like Showalter was trying to get on board with the Fifty Shades of Grey bandwagon with the whole sex issues for Thane.  She got through the Darkest Pleasure, about the demon of pain, without having a hero who liked sexually abusing women, so I'm not sure why she needed to go there in a book in which that storyline really added nothing.  Which goes back to me saying Thane was fine.  I'll admit I really liked the recent Darkest Touch.  However I had a hard time getting through this one, and normally I'll devour these type of books.  This wasn't a terrible book.  But it didn't show the high caliber story this author is capable of.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q4F8E0BU029E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373778449#wasThisHelpful","R3Q4F8E0BU029E","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ahh duct tape- the handyman’s (and not so handyman’s) band-aid. If something springs a leak, needs a patch, whatever, just slap a couple of pieces over it and press on. Every house should have a roll around just in case and since we were deficient in that, when the opportunity came to get the Iron Grip Black Heavy-Duty Duct Tape, we jumped at it.As far as the product, this is excellent tape- it’s tough, its sticky and it’s a huge roll so you won’t run out anytime soon. You can tear it if you apply enough pressure but it’s easier to cut it off- and don’t forget to dog ear the edge so you can start the unrolling easier the next time. The few times we have used it so far, to fix a few things that have been lingering, it has worked just fine and gotten the job done.So why the three stars then? Well- quite frankly- this may be more tape then the average (and below average) do-it-yourselfer needs. I don’t find it such an improvement over 3M and Scotch brands for basic jobs that it justifies the premium you pay for it. It also is extremely sticky sitting the drawer so if you don’t use it on a regular basis, it creates a bit of a mess, leaving sticky residue on whatever it is resting on. It also has an odor, which while not strong, is noticeable.Just to close- you can’t go wrong with the Iron Grip as it is serious duct tape and will accomplish any task duct tape possibly can but there are cheaper alternatives that will probably do just as well","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JZAOZHIA7MX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5R21XG#wasThisHelpful","R11JZAOZHIA7MX","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As the owners- human servants might be a more apt description- of two 50 pound former street dogs, let me just say cows ears are a lifesaver.  Not much slows down our dogs but at least a nice big cows ear gives them pause for 10 minutes or so as they devour them.  Yes- I know these are all day treats for smaller dogs, but well, as I mentioned- former street dogs.  We have tried a number of different brands, not so much as we really liked or disliked any particular brand, but living overseas, we have had some issues with shipping, as well as often we would look for the product on sale as they can get a tad expensive if your dogs get one or two every day as ours do.In that vein, we are quite satisfied with the Red Ear Brand.  They are comparable in cost to other major brands, they sell through Amazon so we did not have an issue sending them to an APO address, they arrived promptly and they are much the same quality as other brands.  I noticed that the ones we have received so far are smaller than some other brands- particularly the HDP Jumbos, but not so much so that we consider them to be a bad bargain.  The only minor complaint we have is that they do not seem quite as clean as others we have received.  These still had some black, crusty matter on the inside of the ears- not that the dogs seem to mind in the least, but you do notice it.  On the plus side, they do not leave any odor- sometimes we have noticed a faint odor from boxes or bags of ears but these don’t have one, nor do we find any trace of one after the dogs have eaten them.Overall, we like this product and if your dogs like cows ears, they will probably like this product as well.  Although we don’t have any particular brand loyalty to Red Barn, we will probably end up ordering this product again based on price and shipping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q9DVLP4PV2JT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OQY8LW#wasThisHelpful","R2Q9DVLP4PV2JT","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As we are on our second child and numerous pets, which currently include two dogs and a cat, we have had and still own a multitude of baby gates but the Munchkin Auto-Close Designer Safety Gate, Dark Wood is by far the swankiest we have ever had.The first thing you notice about this product when it arrives is that it is heavy.  The middle frame is solid wood and the ends where the anchoring rods attach and sit is a pretty heavy metal as well.  In addition to its weight, the wood is a rich, dark shade that looks very attractive set off against the white of the rest of the gate.  Once you get it out of the box, it is relatively easy to set up.  The anchoring rods screw out until they are firmly wedged against the door frame and you tighten to hold the gate in place.  The frame fits regular sized doorways and passageways but also has extension sections should yours be wider than normal.  Once placed properly with sufficient tension, the gate is secure and I don’t really worry that it will fall out or a child or pet can knock it over.The gate itself is easy to operate- it has a button on top that you depress to open and the gate can be swung open either way and then will lock automatically as it swings back through the middle position.  If there is a flaw with the gate, this is it as there is not a locking mechanism to prevent a child from depressing the button and opening it him or herself depending on their dexterity.  This is a minor quibble though on what is overall an excellent safety gate.So- an excellent, durable product that even adds a touch of style with its dark wood slats?  What’s not to like- well, I guess what you have to ask yourself is do you really need and/or want an $80 baby gate.  We have Carlson Pet Gates which are all metal and work on the same principle with the screw anchors and even has a locking latch and a small kitty door built in that costs $38.  We also have the Safety First Easy-Fit Security Gate that cost $25- although in all fairness, those are somewhat of a pain to use with the sliding plastic panels and locking arm.  Even the Munchkin Easy Close All Metal Gate, which at $42 is half the price.  Basically, you are paying double for the looks and style. As I am somewhat utilitarian, I can see splurging for one, but will probably stick with the cheaper options for corralling my pets and kids for the most part.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B8I2X94MTAZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00INT0Y7O#wasThisHelpful","R1B8I2X94MTAZ3","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel I have to start this review with a disclaimer- I know the first thing anyone should want to know about headphones, especially a $200 set is how they sound, followed by comfort, style, etc but I have to admit, I have a tin ear so let me start by saying the House of Marley EM-FH041-MI Liberate Bluetooth Wireless Headphones sounded just fine to me.  I know some of the other reviews go into sound quality at different ranges but I really just needed a pair of headsets I could wear on flights as well as watch TV and listen to music at home once the kids are in bed so I don’t wake them up.  The Liberate work great for that, the sound is clear and I don’t notice much if any drop off of clarity using Bluetooth vs the cable.So with that out of the way, let’s turn to comfort.  The earphones are round and on the smallish side. I find they don’t cover the entire year and the top bar does not constrict quite enough to touch the top of my head.  This means the full weight is on the ears- which is not uncomfortable per se but you do have to readjust them every so often as the weight will get to you after a bit.  I don’t find this too burdensome but my husband does- he used a Dave Clark Aviation headset when he was in the military which has an oval, elongated earphone which covers the whole year so he says he can’t get used to these.  Frankly- they are light years ahead of earbuds!As for style, the Liberate is hard to beat.  The set is well made and looks great.  The wood panel is thin but adds a touch of elegance.  The buttons on the right headset took some getting used to, but blend seamlessly into the design.  I like the envious looks I get when I take them out on a plane.  I also like that they are good to travel with.  They fold up and come with a nice carrying case and the battery lasts a sufficient amount of time- you can use them for the better part of a day without a recharge so that is also handy when traveling.Overall, I am happy with this headset.  I realize they are pricy but they fit what I need them to do- namely travel with and allow me to enjoy shows and music when everyone is asleep with enough sound quality and style to make them enjoyable to own.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDVO9X2TLKK2I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LL6P5U2#wasThisHelpful","RDVO9X2TLKK2I","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As most people with children can tell you, kid’s toys are like water- they expand to fill all available space.  So, when we bought our son the Melissa and Doug Deluxe Train Set, we should not have been surprised that the 130 piece set soon proved insufficient to fulfill his ambition to cover the entire living room floor.  To rectify this, we purchased 100 pieces of bulk wooden train track by Kid’s Destiny.The set advertised that it fits all major brands and although I can’t vouch for others, it is indeed compatible with the Melissa and Doug set.  In fact, we store all the pieces from both sets together in the same storage box and after a few months, I could not tell you the difference between them.  The pieces are well sanded and grooved and the trains, including Thomas accessories, roll just fine over them.The only slight complaint I could make about the set is that it does not contain either male-male or female-female connection, nor does it contain ramped track.  The set, which consists of 25 each of 3.5"" curved, 6"" curved, 3.5"" straight, and 6"" straight pieces  will allow you to greatly expand your track but you will need another expansion set if you want to build more bridges and ramped track.  In addition, more male-male and female-female connectors are needed if you expand with more special pieces such as bridges or tunnels so you need to make sure those expansion kits have more of them.Overall, however, this set does exactly what we wanted, which was to provide enough pieces to allow our son to build to his heart’s content- or at least cover the available space we have- at an affordable price.  We recommend this if you too need extra track.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GV11A6YVJVYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D7KIHPA#wasThisHelpful","R1GV11A6YVJVYT","A5K3CK2PWYQ7O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5K3CK2PWYQ7O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We are using this primarily for outdoor use like during picnic, while on patio etc., where this becomes a nice buffer of filtered water.The LED indicators are nice to have, however not really a must since you would know that the life of the filter is over based on the taste of water and the speed of filtration.

"A good travel buddy, these pouches are very handy especially when on the move with an infant.While I like most of the ingredients, I'm not a fan of the corn bit. This plus all the other fruits make it higher on sugar content. So do not be surprised if the baby is especially active after gobbling down a meal coming from the pouch.

"The infant cereal has great ingredients. That's beyond any doubt.Anyone aware of what processed rice cereal is actually providing in terms of nutrition will no more willingly offer it to their children. Just like us, rice cereals - especially the fully processed ones that instantly mix in any form of liquid, are not allowed for our kids. The processing pretty much takes away the outer coating that makes the digestive system ""work"" on the food, hence developing it in turn.This infant cereal comes with all likable ingredients and they're organic, plus it is lower on sugar (3g per serving). What I would have loved to see is were the grains whole or processed?

Especially when he wouldn't consider pull ups as read diapers and wouldn't allow us to put him in these.For the pricing, pull ups are way more expensive than regular ones but thats the price one has to pay for moving out of them (potty training).And these are at least 10-20% more expensive than the luv's diapers, which are good quality too, but not as great looking.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239IYBRNSB7XQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B35KJ2A#wasThisHelpful","R239IYBRNSB7XQ","A33HIV8RXRDM88","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33HIV8RXRDM88?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being a CrossFitter, I use the foam rollers on a very regular basis before and after the workouts (WODs). This one is specifically designed to provide a deep massage for sore tissues and is very effective indeed. It is challenging to use it everyday unless you are a serious athlete. However, when I really need this deep massage, it works best!Being an 18"" roller, it is compact, dense, and easy to store or carry. It fits well in my gym bag for the occasional outdoor workouts. Most other rollers are 24"" in length and can a bit large to store.It is a bit pricey, however worth it if you plan to use it regular.

"The one reason we really will go ahead and buy more of this brand in this size is the price for quality. For ($0.21) per piece, it doesn't get much cheaper.These diaper are true fit. We have rarely had any mis-haps with these with a few exceptions here and there. But let's face it, that will always be the case given any diaper. The reasons are pretty simple - Either too big or too small or too full. And these are acceptable reasons.We have used this brand in this size for our first kid and now again for the second one. Huggies vs. Pampers vs. Luvs vs. store brand diaper is an excellent topic for conversation among new parents and there is no one clear winner. However, for Huggies we have been lucky enough to find good deals on prices more frequently than Pampers and maybe that's why we ended up using them more often.The diaper material is very soft and the absorbing properties are good to contain and prevent the ""potential decimation"" :).","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S5Y2MX1JIAJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HB0WIPW#wasThisHelpful","R2S5Y2MX1JIAJR","A33HIV8RXRDM88","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33HIV8RXRDM88?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The iPhone 6/6S armband is indeed a great product by Belkin. Having been used several such armbands in pasts, this one is certainly much better on several aspects:- The look and feel of this product is high quality and not really plasticky type.The finish of the case and the plastic in armband is very complimentary to an iPhone.- The band goes all the way around for a comfortable feel.- The fabric on the armband behind the plastic clamp for phone is coated with a rubber base to make it waterproof and protect phone from the potential sweat flooding on your arm after a tough workout :).- The plastic case has a good finish and provide a very good accessibility to the iPhone ports. In some other cases, I had problem accessing these ports since the opening was too tight or close. Not in the Belkin case though.- For someone who is regular with fitness activities, the case can be left on phone all the time. I do not see that an issue and plan to use the plastic case as the main case for the phone. It does add some bulkiness to device and could be an issue if you prefer to use your phone bare-naked!Price is a bit on the higher side, however has a high potential to provide the value in terms of continuous protection and functionality to your phone while supporting fitness activities.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FMSYPB1JD8GS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JNQQPC#wasThisHelpful","R3FMSYPB1JD8GS","A33HIV8RXRDM88","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33HIV8RXRDM88?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We've used many other brands of diapers - Pampers, Huggies, Luvs, target store brand, CVS. From Pampers, it was the swaddlers and sensitive that we used most during the newborn to size 2 timeframe. We liked swaddlers.We also liked the Huggies Little Snugglers since they also come with indicator line.And here's why -Apart from the high quality, nice smelling diapers, I like the fact that thy have not caused any skin irritation or rashes even when soaking wet. This is extremely important for the baby's health and parent's sanity.The indicator is truly effective and it doesn't just give away a binary answer on what to expect - Diaper is wet or Diaper is dry. It will show a shorter blue line if the diaper is slightly wet. For those with very sensitive skin, this is quite a helpful feature since parents can immediately decide if they want to change the diaper or not.However the only reason this one gets 4 stars is because they're indeed expensive","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG9LWFOY600OT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HJKP6PI#wasThisHelpful","RG9LWFOY600OT","A33HIV8RXRDM88","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33HIV8RXRDM88?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Eventually you might have to cut some rope to adjust to right length. I believe it won't be an issue for taller people.Rope is very good and I am sure that it will go long. One thing to keep in mind is that if you a new learner and tend to get stuck...it will hit you on the back side....either slowly you will get used to it or figure out the movement to get single unders and double unders :).","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R152UO0951NVHJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYYOKDC#wasThisHelpful","R152UO0951NVHJ","A33HIV8RXRDM88","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33HIV8RXRDM88?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Within 3 weeks of use, I can feel the difference in my form during the strength exercises in CrossFit WODs especially due to improved footwork. These Nano 2.0s are a perfect companion for any CrossFitter and are truly a must-have. Note that these do not provide any arch support and are designed to keep your feet flat in order to get a flat grip and be able to push the ground across the whole feet. Most other shoes are curved up in the front of the feet and hence you don't get that full push.These do run a bit tight and open up very little with use. So, it's a good idea to pay attention to the Amazon guidelines and the size fit recommendation which shows up while making a purchase here.With the Nano 4.0 cost being a bit prohibitively high, I am glad that my coach advised me to go with 2.0 at a much reasonable cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAR46PWXO6BY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KUE8G2A#wasThisHelpful","RAR46PWXO6BY3","A33HIV8RXRDM88","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A33HIV8RXRDM88?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So I was one of the many guys who hated, I mean HATED Justin Bieber since his rise to stardom.  I would get angry at the thought of him even existing.  Suffice it to say, I wasn't a fan.  Then a few things seemed to work in Justins favor for 2015.  First off, he was the subject of a Comedy Central Roast which replayed constantly during the beginning of the year.  The Roast was funny and at the end Justin gave a believable eulogy to his old ways and hopeful possibility of a more respectable future.  That made me really start to think that, if I had his voice and money at his age(we are the same age actually), then I'd probably be as reckless.  But alas, I wasn't going to go buy his early albums still.  Then the next thing happened.  He released the song ""Where Are U Now?"" in collaboration with Jack U(most notably Skrillex).  It was the perfect summer song with production that was very unique.  Finally, Justin made the Prestige of his comeback with the release of the single ""What Do You Mean?"" which followed the new vibe in production started by the Skrillex collaboration.  I was actually looking forward to this album.  I wanted to hear a whole album of similar songs and more maturity.  The album didn't disappoint.  And as for that other 'forgettable' boy band One Direction releasing their album the same day, well I listened to it and its more of the same from them and nothing new or notable(They peaked in creativity on Midnight Memories, their only good album, but that's a separate review).  This album is the one to get.  If you hated Justin Bieber, then you might like this like I did.  Its just a nice break up album that isn't just for break ups.  The singing is mature and spot on and the production is crisp and unique.  Here is a track by track review of the album that could reinvent the most hated success story of the 2000s.1.  Mark My Words: The album starts off slow with this song full of crooning.  The instrumental sounds like a loop of Justins distorted humming and it works nicely.  Justin reaches divine high notes and showcases how much of a good singer he really is.  Toward the end of the song the production by Blood catches up with the emotion in his voice as it comes to a close.  I just wish it was maybe at least 30 seconds longer.  This is a great introduction of the more adult style this album is full of.  9/102.  I'll Show You: Another Skrillex produced song and it shows.  The production is really becoming his new trademark thankfully instead of that awful dubstep that he used to make.  Blood also helped with this song too as they create a common flow to continue the album.  If you like ""Where Are U Now"" then you'll like this.  Very emotional and classy.  But lets not forget the main man himself with his sensual vocals.  This is destined for the club.  Also don't forget to make love with this in the background.  Thats something I'd never say I would do Justins previous music that was meant for the tweens.  This is pure adult love making music at its best.  9.5/103.  What Do You Mean?: The mega hit comeback lead single.  Yes we all know the lyrics are simple and not very impressive, but the vocal delivery is top notch.  Great sing along song with a nice tropical dance pop production that just gets the body moving, even if you can't dance.  There's no surprise why it was JBs first number one song in the US.  Very infectious. 9.5/104.  Sorry: The second Skrillex produced single.  The buildup to the chorus is so great it makes my heartbeat skip.  Speaking of the chorus, talk about catchy.  This is the type of infectious song that many will love to hate.  You will have it stuck in your head.  It's one of those singing in the shower songs.  Also a great song to play when you're trying to win back your lover in a fun way.  Get ready to groove on the dance floor to this too.  10/105.  Love Yourself: This is a nice acoustic guitar driven ballad with some of the more mature and modern lyricism.  Though this isn't a dance song like most of the album, it still keeps the same vibe as the other songs.  There is also a nice surprising trumpet solo that gives it more class.  This ones a great tune but not a huge highlight aside from the solo.  Others might like it more than I do.  8.5/106.  Company: The dance aspect of the album returns with this song.  The production is in the same style as the Skrillex produced songs and I might even go on to say it's slightly better.  The bass is very groovy.  I would choose this as a single.  The lyrics are simple like the lead single but gosh does it get stuck in your head.  Mature dance pop.  9.5/107.  No Pressure Feat. Big Sean: This is an R&B pop gem with acoustic guitars similar to early NeYo songs production values.  Of course the chorus is catchy, but it isn't one of Justins more impressive vocal performances.  Still great though.  I thought Big Sean would ruin the song as he isn't one of my favorite rappers.  In fact, I never liked Big Sean.  But he provided a decent guest rap verse.  Still he didn't really add to the song.  Justin really does make sure you know its his song with the catchy chorus though.  The song really does grow on you.  9/108.  No Sense: At first I hated this song.  I felt it didn't even fit right with the rest of the album.  But that soon changed.  The production is very trap like.  Travis Scott gave a better rap guest vocal than BS.  This is in the same league as Justin Timberlakes collaboration songs.  This is one of my guilty pleasure songs from the album.  Another modern love making song that Justins previous tween fans wouldn't have fully appreciated.  Just shows his growth again.  9.5/109.  The Feeling Feat. Halsey: The songs picks up speed again with this urgent dance pop track.  I never liked Halsey, but she really shines in the emotionally charged mega infectious chorus.  I think its one of the best choruses in pop music I've heard in a while even though its so simplistic.  Skrillex is lurking in the production again with his experimental dance beat antics.  I can see this as another hit single.  One of my favorites from the album.  10/1010.  Life Is Worth Living: Things slow down and quiet down again for this uplifting ballad.  This one really showcases Justins songwriting and puts his vocals upfront once again, but don't get me wrong there are some nice little treats in the production.  During the Comedy Central Roast for Bieber one of the comedians jokingly compared Justins voice with Stevie Wonder.  This is makes that comparison seem more true.  But don't think I'm saying they sound the same.  I can already see some people scoffing at that, but it's just a compliment for the vocals on this track.  Very feelgood relaxing ballad.  9.5/1011.  Where Are U Now? Feat. Skrillex and Diplo: The song that really paved the way for Justins comeback in 2015.  I'm glad this Jack U hit track was included on this album even though it's not fully a Bieber song.  The real star of this song was always the production.  Justin gives an amazing comeback performance, but we all know that screeching violin/flute sound during the chorus is one of the most emotional heart wrenching piece of music production ever created.  It was the highlight of Jack Us album, and it's still one of the big highlights of this album.  It never gets old.  I could listen to this song for hours.  If you haven't already, add this to your workout playlist.  10/1012.  Children: The final Skrillex produced song.  This is the most EDM styled song but at the same time it keeps to the consistent vibe of the rest of the album Skrillex seemed to have influenced the others to take as well.  Lyrically this is something the younger Bono of U2 would be singing about.  Its nice to see Bieber having faith in the children of the future, because I don't.  But I still love this song to death.  Its also a good workout song. 10/1013.  Purpose: The album closes with another ballad.  This time its a nice quite piano tune.  Its a very powerful love song.  The ending of the song has Justin speaking some words of wisdom.  At first I felt the words of truth but after multiple listens I found myself skipping to the next track on shuffle after the singing part stops.  The ending part is one of the few attempts at maturity from Bieber that I think didn't work.  I know it sounds bad when I put it like that, but I still think its a great song.  9/10So I can't believe I actually like, let alone purchased a Justin Bieber album.  This could be Justins first step into Justin Timberlake territory.  Hopefully if his friendship with Skrillex stays strong they can work together from now on.  I'd love to hear a JB album with production handled entirely by Skrillex the way Timberlakes albums are handled by Timbaland.  This shows many examples of Bieber maturing and growing, but he's still in the fixing stage.  The songs are all good to great.  There are no duds.  No filler for me.  This isn't the same JB that I grew to hate since his inception on the music scene.  Everyone was rooting against Justin during his years of recklessness.  Many were certain that Bieber would go the way of many forgotten child stars.  He proved them and me wrong.  He came back bigger than ever and this album proves he is a force to be reckoned with in this ever changing music industry.  I really enjoyed this album.  If you hated Justin Bieber like most did, don't be afraid to give this album a chance.  You just might change your mind.  I'm a hypocrite for loving this album so much after all the negativity I had for him prior to this.  I hope this review wasn't 'too late for me to say sorry', because this album is going to be on replay for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B5U18C0M3GZ9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AM4BFQ#wasThisHelpful","R1B5U18C0M3GZ9","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll admit that like most, I discovered this band from their their mega hit single ""Sweater Weather"".  It was such a winter-esque pop delight in the best way.  One of the best songs of 2012.  I also began to wonder whether the band would continue on the upward spiral or become a one hit wonder.  When I listened to their debut album ""I Love You"" I can honestly say I wasn't a fan.  (Don't discount my review just yet).  I agree that their debut album had some good catchy songs, but in all honesty it was just forgettable.  It wasn't a surprise that their next singles didn't have even half of the impact as Sweater Weather.  The album didn't sell well and other than ""Afraid"" no other singles really went anywhere for the band.  So in 2015 when I heard of the band releasing a new album I was on the fence.  The lead single ""R.I.P. 2 My Youth"" didn't impress me on my first few listens.  I'll get back to that song later in the review.  The song didn't hype up the albums release really.  In reality most people had no clue the album was even dropping on its release day.  I actually didn't even plan on listening to the album until a good friend of mine brought it up the night it came out and told me it was good.  I trust his opinion most of the time so I checked it out online and liked it enough on my first listen to buy it the next day.  If the first part of my review seemed negative I want you to know it gets better and better now that I've listened to this album a few more times.  I liked this album, a lot.  Here is my track by track review of what I think is one of the most surprisingly great albums destined to be underrated this year.1.  A Moment Of Silence: This is my only beef with the album.  I'm sure there is a deep meaning to this, but I lost interest in it quick.  Honestly just a waste of a track of silence.  Call me disrespectful to the bands intentions, I think this track added nothing to the album.  (no rating)2.  Prey: This is where the music really begins.  And boy does it kick off perfectly.  I love the aching vibe in the vocals.  There is already obviously a lot more soul in this albums singing compared to their first.  The chorus tops things off to make this hopefully another big single for the band and possibly a career saver(more on that in a bit).  A great beachy beginning to the album.  10/103.  Cry Baby: This might be their most pop infested song so far.  It grooves by.  The vocals are in the vein of MJ stylistically and I love it.  The instrumentation is spot on.  There is even a hauntingly beautiful guitar solo.  It's almost like the bands take on ""I Can't Go For That"" by Hall and Oates.  The vibes of the two songs come from the same musical universe.  I am rooting for this song to be a single.  In fact I think this would've been the better choice for the lead single.  Maybe my favorite song from the band so far.  11/104.  Wiped Out!: The epic title track.  Not as catchy as the first two songs but still wonderfully crafted.  There is even a bridge section similar to that of Sweater Weather.  There are some vocal effects that might turn off some listeners but I think they are used masterfully and add a lot to the emotional effect of the song.  Halfway through the song their is a second bridge that picks up the paste of the song into sonic speed almost as it leads to the final act of the track.  The songs ends sounding like a completely different song it began as and its just great.  Some uptight listeners might call the antics of this song 'pretentious', but I call it great musicianship and art pop I can listen to on repeat.  10/105.  The Beach: Honestly, this should've been the title track.  The album being titled The Beach would work so perfectly with the artwork.  But the vibe of this song is just unheard of.  Another single worthy song to save the band.  The notes the vocals reach during the chorus are achingly beautiful.  This is similar in sound to a recent genre called PBR&B, but I'd personally describe this as Gothic R&B Alternative Rock.  10/106.  Daddy Issues: The title isn't appealing, but gosh the music is.  This is a perfect low key dance song.  The lyrics are sweet and great to listen to with a lover.  It's ominous in a positive way.  Not as great as the others, but still really really good.  9/107.  Baby Came Home 2/ Valentines: Another soothing epic.  The layers upon layers of musical bliss in this song is very cinematic and emotional.  The vocals even contain some nice falsetto.  The different musical cues throughout the song are clever too.  But there is an unneeded section in the middle of silence that really added nothing to the song.  The last 2 minutes were interesting upon my first few listens but I started skipping to the next song before the end soon.  But the rest of the song is still amazing.  9.5/108.  Greetings From California: There is a somewhat apocalyptic sadness present in this song in my opinion.  I'd compare it's style to the band Glass Animals which is a compliment.  Very tropical jungle-esque.  Nice musicianship as with the rest.  9.5/109.  Ferrari: The title made me think this was going to be a mindless party song that would kill the vibe of the rest of the album.  I was wrong.  There is a slight industrial vibe throughout the song as if Trent Reznor tried to do some indie alternative music.  Its a groovy industrial dance pop song.  Very somber surprisingly.  9.5/1010.  Single: This song sits next to Cry Baby as one of their most pop infested songs.  The lyrics are sad but the music is mostly positive which makes it even more beautiful.  It starts off soft before blowing up into a feast for the musical heartbeat in the middle before ending the way it began.  I love this song.  It has more of that slight R&B influence too.  Nice.  10/1011.  R.I.P. 2 My Youth: The lead single.  Now I somewhat disapproved of this song when it first came out leading to the albums release.  But dare I say this song has grown onto me so much it's almost scary.  I just can't get it out of my head.  This is the true definition of a song that gets better and better.  I didn't really like it at first but now I can't get enough of it.  But that doesn't change the fact that leading to this albums release this single went nowhere.  Maybe it'll become a huge hit.  Maybe not.  If the other songs released as singles don't do anything for the band then this could be the single that killed their career.  Again, I love it to death now.  I personally hope this turns into a sleeper hit like Sweater Weather or at least enough of a hit that it leaves room for other singles to burst onto the scene bigger.  We'll just have to wait and see.  (Maybe future readers will wonder what I was talking about because it became a huge hit)  Still a great closer to the album.  Some critics have criticized the move of putting this at the end.  I think it ended the album perfectly.  10/10So this album was a vast improvement on their mediocre debut album.  I know many of you really loved that first album, but I can confidently say this one is much better and more respectable.  It's also surprisingly very mature.  The style of the album is very different than what was heard from the band before.  But before anyone starts complaining too soon with remarks like ""They changed their sound too much!  This isn't The Neighbourhood"", how can anyone be so sure of what this bands sound really is so early in their career.  Honestly I'd love for them to abandon most of the style heard on their first album.  They didn't just experiment on this album.  They changed for the better.  This isn't a rock album.  It's not even an alternative rock album fully.  I would compare the style of this album to the R&B influenced 'AM' by Arctic Monkeys.  The American version of that albums vibe if you will.  I'll say its Gothic R&B Alternative Art Pop.  Critics have been kinder to this album than their first, but not kind enough in my opinion.  A lot of the critic reviews for this that I've read seemed lazy and as if they didn't really listen to this masterpiece of modern music.  Yes, this is a masterpiece.  As I've stated before, if the singles don't pick up momentum then this will be labeled as a commercial sophomore slump and it might be impossible for the band to recover, which would be a shame since this album is pure musical art and pleasure.  I want more people to hear this album.  It's the perfect combination of a winter/summer album.  Of course many people who are going through bad break ups or other losses will find solace in this album but this album is great for music lovers regardless.  It has been on repeat for the past few days and I cant get enough of it.  We could have The Neighbourhoods 'Pinkerton' on our hands.  And no I'm not comparing them because they sound nothing alike.  I'm saying this could be a album that was received poorly upon its initial release before becoming regarded as a classic in the future.  But its already a classic to me.  I don't know what else to say.  This is a step in the right direction for the band and I loved it.  It's in my all time top 10 favorite albums already and I don't say that lightly.  Worth more than a purchase.  I'd love to see this album played live.  Okay I think this is the longest review I've typed on here.  Let me get back to enjoying the vibrations.  R.I.P. 2 My fingers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPZC30LW933U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K364HK#wasThisHelpful","R2JPZC30LW933U","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cant believe I only now discovered this amazing musical wizard.  It was a chance encounter.  I was just looking at a website for new music and saw that this album was getting the best reviews out of all others released during the same week.  I had no idea who Destroyer was.  So being intrigued I did a quick search for the singles of the album.  It was love at first listen for songs like 'Dream Lover' and 'Time Square'.  The classy and sophisticated sound of the songs just swept me away.  So I looked more into this guy finding out he's been around since the early 90s which just made my mind boggle.  I read that his albums all had a different sound yet were all distinct to him and that was so true when I listened to his earlier albums like the amazing 'Kaputt' and 'Trouble In Dreams'.  But we were here to talk about this perfect album.  I was strongly disappointed but not surprised to find out that no store in my city carried that album.  So as I type this review I have to admit I don't own the album YET.  But that doesn't mean I haven't had it on replay on Spotify for over a week now.  I'm waiting for any store to carry it or maybe eventually order it on here.  I will have it in my grasp.  So anyways I saw that there have been no reviews for this album on this site yet which is a shame.  So here is my track by track review of one of the greatest things to ever grace my ears.1.  Time Square, Poison Season I: The album starts with a slow and soothing version of a later track.  A great and smooth introduction with nice quiet orchestral moments accompanying the soft vocals.  A nice greeting from the album.  9.5/102.  Dream Lover: The first song I heard from the album upon discovery.  The upbeat style is similar to Arcade Fires early work but is also very original and catchy.  The saxophone during the chorus is so painfully addictive.  One of the few really upbeat songs but still very very good.  The song gives me a feeling of constant happiness yet it also has some tragic beauty to it.  9.5/103.  Forces From Above: Violins lead the song with a nice bass and rattling/jungle drums.  The vocals are calm and mysterious. I love the way this one builds up and basically jams.  Around 2 minutes in things get more urgent sounding for the chorus.  It's a very exotic song.  Like something that would play in a action movie as the characters enter a nice foreign city.  When the saxophone comes in you know things come together perfectly before ending smoothly.  10/104.  Hell Is an Open Door: Another song that is drenched in perfect orchestral soundscapes.  The violin riff combined with the emotional saxophone always tug at my heartstrings.  A very fancy song literally.  The lyrics are clever.  The part that mentions the angels in the song is followed by a perfect fluttering sound.  Its those little moments.  A perfect song with great meaning.  One of my favorites.  10/105.  The River: Another relaxing song.  The piano stars with smooth singing before the sax come in to help you take in whatever view you have while listening to this one.  Very atmospheric.  I always imagine sitting at a coffee shop along the beach or a nice river during the sunset.  It's just a very soothing song.  The way the piano ends the song repeating the saxophone riff always tops things off perfectly.  Another favorite.  10/106.  Girl In a Sling: Another slow and soft emotional song.  The instrumentation on this is divine.  For me its a perfect song for 'understanding' someones hardships in life.  It could make you cry when played during the right emotional moment.  10/107.  Time Square: This is the new theme song for Time Square.  Or it should be.  The lyrics are basically the same as the opening song but more upbeat and with a traditional pop sound.  I hope someone uses this in a movie or commercial because it has such a classy and cinematic feel to it.  The guitars and sax compliment each other so well.  It just fits the New York style perfectly.  10/108.  Archer on the Beach: Such a groovy and mysteriously seductive bass guides the song.  The lyrics are so obscure and great as they paint pictures in your mind.  Another jamming track with classy jazz influences.  10/109.  Midnight Meet the Rain: This one has a 70s yet modern feel to it.  Its like a soundtrack to a detective drama that could play during a old school crime solving montage.  Not among the best on the album though.  8.5/1010.  Solaces Bride: This song marks the beginning of the perfect combination of tracks to end the album.  Everything about this song is perfect.  The lyrics contain more tragic beauty.  The guitar is sad and romantic.  A bit after the 1 minute mark a soothing orchestrated part takes place that is probably the most beautiful piece of music I've heard ever.  This is candy for the ears.  Pure and simple.  Among my top 10 favorite tracks ever.  Seriously.  11/1011.  Bangkok: Another perfect and epic relaxation song.  It just amazes me how someone could come up with such lush sounds as this.  It's a great love letter to a city.  The song is about Bangkok but the style has pure classy sophisticated New York written all over it.  Near the 3 minute mark when the pianos get faster with sexy Saxophone in the back you'll know what I mean.  Always seems to calm me down nicely.  11/1012.  Sun in the Sky: This one musically sounds like a companion to 'The River'.  The guitar and sax just make my heart feel like its tied to a kite.  I always get a music high when listening to this album by the time I get to this song  I'm nearly at a loss for words.  Just know it's pure magic.  11/1013.  Time Square, Poison Season II: A final take on the Time Square track as a closer.  It starts slow but ends very smoothly.  It's a beautiful goodbye from the album.  9.5/10So its been two weeks since the albums release when I type this review and I'm so far the only one?  Hopefully this changes quick.  It would be a criminal injustice for this album to not be heard by as many people as possible.  It's one of those albums that makes me think I'm lucky to have been alive when it came out.  It is a wonder how this guy isn't a bigger name in the music industry.  And no I'm not trying to be an annoying hipster and sound cool for knowing him now.  I actually am rooting for this guy to get more and more popular.  If you liked this album then I highly suggest you check out his albums 'Kaputt' and 'Trouble In Dreams'.  Then maybe even more of his early work.  I do think this album will really finally give him the exposure he's deserved for years apparently.  I still can't believe his previous masterpieces slipped my music radar.  This is album is the work of a living musical wizard genius.  This album is so classy it'll make you want to put on your nicest suit or dress and just take in the mood.  One of the greatest albums of all time.  I say that confidently.  Listen to it.  Share it with as many people as you can.  It's worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VPHTRT19TL6U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3UGAW0#wasThisHelpful","R2VPHTRT19TL6U","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first found out about this amazing duo by chance in 2012.  I was walking in a bookstore when I heard a song that instantly struck me in awe almost putting me in a trance standing there.  I used a music recognition app to find out that it was 'Wild' by Beach House.  So I bought the album Bloom and have listened to it at least 30 times since.  It was one of the most beautiful albums I've ever heard.  I instantly compared them to Cocteau Twins, another great and similar band from the 80s/90s.  Of course I listened to the bands earlier work too and found favorites in Teen Dream and Devotion but I ultimately still named Bloom as my favorite so far.  So during the 3 years since I would periodically look into whether the band was releasing a new album to no avail.  I almost forgot about them when suddenly they released the song 'Sparks' and news of a new album in the Fall of 2015.  I was intrigued also by the title.  When they said they were going back to basics I was still excited but somewhat hesitant as I loved their lush sound from Bloom most.  I made myself not listen to anymore songs released before the album so that the feeling of discovery with each track was much more sincere, especially since there are only 9 songs.  Well when I finally purchased the CD and held the smooth velvet case in my hands I knew I was in for something extra special.  I was right.  After multiple listens so far, here is a track by track review of one of the most beautiful and emotional albums I've heard.1.  Levitation: This song slowly builds up the atmosphere with keyboards and minor drum beats.  Victorias angelic vocals glide through.  At first I didn't think the singing was as good as others but after repeated listens I found myself singing 'Theres a place I want to take you' in my head.  The second half features an emotional guitar croon that creeps in perfectly to complete the soundscape before fading away nicely.  The title of the song explains how it feels listening to this perfectly.  Amazing opener.  10/102.  Sparks: The lead single.  At first I wasn't that impressed.  But the song just kept getting better and better.  It is a very spacey song that again sounds just as the title implies.  The vocals in the first half remind me of M83.  Then toward the end Victorias distinct lullaby style brings it to a close.  The main riff is so alluring.  By the time the main riff repeats itself one final time it sounds like a friend departing whom you wished would stay longer.  Each time I listen to this song I feel like I'm saying goodbye to someone I love.  It's so profound the way music can make you feel.  Especially when done right like this.  10/103.  Space Song: This sounds like it could've been on Bloom.  I fell in love with this at first listen and it has only grown more and more on me.  It's just so great all around.  The main riff on this one is so gorgeous it's hard to describe.  I would have to say it sounds tragically beautiful.  Like endlessly floating through the night while the one you love is floating a distance in front of you that you can never catch up to.  I know, it sounds depressing, but not in the mopey way at all.  Oh and Victorias vocals of course are so sensual and perfect.  This is a new favorite.  This is one of those songs I could  never get tired of.  11/104.  Beyond Love: Another song with a tragic beauty in its sound as if the title didn't hint at it.  The lyrics are so eerie yet delivered so smoothly.  Victoria really is beyond human in her vocal abilities.  The main riff is sad in a good way.  Think of your lover or the one that got away while listening.  Or just relax and enjoy.  Another great track.  9.5/105.  10:37: The beginning drums sound like the introduction to a ceremony.  Then the vocals slowly soar through the song.  This one keeps that Cocteau Twins comparison strong.  Such a relaxing song.  The guitar are so simple yet elegantly great.  I always picture myself floating down a mystic river on giant lily pads staring up at the stars when listening to this.  But thats just me.  Great playful relaxation song.  9.5/106.  PPP: This song.  Wow.  The main riff.  The way Victoria talks seductively in the beginning before singing so beautifully that I feel like I'm drowning in divine delight.  The melody of this song can either make you cry or feel exceptionally happy, or both.  The eerie guitar solo is just so beautiful gorgeous haunting elegant.  I can't even really put to words how it makes me feel.  This song is sure to be a emotional roller coaster throughout the years.  This one is an instant classic.  If I was a filmmaker I'd want this to be in my movie.  11/107.  Wildflower: The synth and guitar in this one brings to mind the 80s.  A quick but twinkling song that I wish was twice as long.  Just sit back and let this one guide your thoughts.  Another relaxation gem.  9.5/108.  Bluebird: Another one that I strongly wish was longer.  This is a jam.  Everything is perfect again.  The drums.  The staccato style guitars that just glide through the chorus.  The keyboards.  Victorias heavenly croon.  I am constantly amazed with this one.  This is the sound definition of good music.  Love it.  10.5/109.  Days Of Candy:  I read that the band used a choir of 24 for this song and it really shows.  The beginning is slow and haunting in the way she sings.  Then the drums quietly kick in with some great emotional guitars.  The final 2 minutes of the song are the best.  It sounds like 3 seperate songs yet one song at the same time.  Such a great and endearing way to close this emotional masterpiece of an album.  10/10Dare I say it?  I think I like this album more than Bloom.  Thats just my personal opinion.  I am still in awe just thinking of the way this album moved me.  I've listened to many albums of many genres throughout the years but I can't say any have struck me like this.  As I said, tragic beauty is present in almost all tracks.  Finding love, losing love.  Happiness, depression.  Relaxation, pure ecstasy.  This album somehow combines all of that in its craft.  Part of me hopes they don't release another album in a while so I can enjoy this even more.  I almost have this irrational fear that they will release an album that I will like more.  I feel like I have found a perfect album.  Of course many will strongly disagree.  But this is my opinion.  Maybe you wont feel the same way whether you love this album or not.  But I highly recommend you listen to the album at least 3 times before you form your full opinion.  Hearing this album gave me the feeling of wondering how I lived all those prior years without it.  Though I'm sure this album will be great year round I think that it is the perfect soundtrack for the Autumn season the most.  This is also one of those albums that really needs to be purchased physically.  You cannot fully experience the album without feeling the smooth red velvet that the CD is wrapped in.  If you already love Beach House, then you need to get this now.  If you're new to the band then prepare yourself for a beauty in music you've probably never heard before.  Do the ears of the world a favor and spread this music to as many people as you can!  I will be cherishing this album till the day I die.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ2SITRY7CZK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZIAODGE#wasThisHelpful","RQ2SITRY7CZK0","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was long expecting Detox.  When he suddenly announced it was shelved and was instead releasing this companion album to the Straight Outta Compton film I was disappointed but at the same time relieved to have something new at least.  Here's a problem.  Dr Dre was such a snobby pr*ck about this albums release method.  He is the first music billionaire yet he decided to make this an Apple Music exclusive for two full weeks.  I don't use Apple Music and probably never will.  It was a wimpy move in music.  I couldn't find the album online and didn't want to risk any viruses from downloading it elsewhere plus I didn't have the time to worry about it.  So I waited the two weeks for it to be released on CD.  Still no freemium Spotify though?  Gosh Dre really is a @#$%.  Anyways leading up to the CD release I read many reviews.  It was universally loved by the critics.  I couldn't wait to hear Dres supposed final masterpiece.  After finally having it in my grasp, it was clear that the critics were probably on Dres payroll.  This album isn't a masterpiece.  It isn't bad either.  It's just good.  And 'just good' wasn't worth all the hype.First off, the production on the album is crisp and smooth and of course full of soulful funk.  But here's the thing, it was all very forgettable.  I listened to the album over 5 times to let it seep in fully.  Still not amazing.  Not what the critics made the album out to be.  Its funny nowadays most of the time when critics hate an album the fans love it.  This is one of those rare times when critics love the album, but though the fans don't really hate it, I can see many others aren't as impressed either.  This truly was Dre trying too hard to sound relevant after 16 years between albums.  Like I said, the sound of the album is nice and modern, but just not special.  Weird since Dre is known for his high standards and perfectionism.  Now to Dres rapping.  He was decent but he sounded like he was the guest on someone elses song on each song.  There are even two songs he isn't even on???  The topics just made me roll my eyes.  The choruses were catchy but also strangely unappealing.  When I saw it on Amazon it was listed at the time as the number one bestseller in POP Rap.  That explains the sound perfectly.  I like catchy feelgood soft pop rap, but not from someone like Dr Dre.  Like I said, this album barely had Dre rapping on it.  It was like a Calvin Harris album where he thought production was enough to stamp his name on it.  The guests steal the show almost 99% of the time.  Which is good and bad.  There will be people who just love the album but I'm sure more people will toss it aside after a week or two or maybe less.  In a world were new music is constantly shifting and pushing boundaries and blowing minds, this album was just a letdown, especially by Dres standards and the hype.  Honestly even if the album wasn't hyped up I probably wouldn't be impressed still.  I'm sure it took a lot of work for Dre and company to put these songs together, but does that mean it payed off?  I don't think so.Dre worries about making money so much yet this album quickly declined in sales.  The Apple Music exclusive sold a robust 300,000 in its first week.  But even after the actual CD release it was apparent that many weren't buying it anymore.  This album will barely go Gold(500,000), which is still good for others standards, but not for someone who was supposed to be a mega seller.  Maybe Dre should revisit Detox and finish that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PLR7VN104YQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GX8MDO#wasThisHelpful","R3PLR7VN104YQL","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disturbed  are one of the most popular modern heavy metal/hard rock related bands.  David Draiman had the uncanny ability to roar like a demonic animal in the catchiest way possible while also singing melodically and soulfully.  His voice is one of the most recognizable in Rock alongside Robert Plant, Ozzy Osbourne, Serj Tankian, Anthony Kiedis, James Hetfield, Bono, etc.  Their previous full length album Asylum wasn't as big a seller or as popular as their first albums but I still think it contained a lot of the best work from the band.  But that was in 2010.  Lots of things have changed in the five year gap between albums.  Rock music was slowly taking a backseat to hip hop and dance/pop in terms of sales and popularity.  Modern Hard Rock and Metal were almost totally nonexistent in the charts and it became rare for a band of any rock genre to even go platinum.  Some of you might be thinking ""who cares how much they sell their music is good"".  But I'm pretty sure Disturbed care  David even said before the release of this album that he's gonna see to it that Rock isn't dead.  So when this album was even mentioned in the summer of 2015 I was half excited and half apathetic.  Mostly because their lead single, however really good, was a major letdown.  It was not nearly as good as it should've been for a comeback single.  The subsequent songs released afterward and before the albums release didn't offer much more either.  I actually lost all interest quick and thought one of my favorite bands from 10 years ago were now going to have to become another band that was once on top and now struggling to stay relevant.  When the day of its release came by I completely forgot about it.  Until I saw it in the new releases on sale and I just couldn't resist giving it a chance.  So when I got home and listened to it once, I was in utter disappointment.  Unimpressed.  Feeling cheated out of 12 bucks I could've used for something else.  But then I remembered how I shouldn't judge an album from one listen alone.  I put it away and listened to it again a second time a few hours later.  It still didn't click.  I was about to give up on it but for some reason I listened to it another time.  Something happened.Suddenly I was singing along again.  I was going along with Davids signature 'raaaaaah's.  I was air drumming especially to the future hit 'Fire It Up'.  This has been said many times before by many others and myself.  This is an album that gets better with each listen.  It evolves.  Its almost like it changes form.  I think that the lead single is still the weakest track.  But its still good.  Their cover of 'The Sound Of Silence' at first sounded like awkward karaoke from David.  But it really blossoms into a ultimate subdued anthem.  I'd say this sounded like a combination of 'Believe' and 'Indestructible'.  It doesn't bring anything new to the table for the band.  But so what?  Its the same sound, but it's not the same songs.  This is what some people don't understand about what can be good about a band not venturing away from the sound that made them liked in the first place.  Disturbed wouldn't sound right if they experimented too much.  Critics most likely will not be too kind to this album because they are the people who mostly listen once and decide in the moment.  I'm starting to think music critics nowadays need to meet a quota to get paid or something so they just write quick unhelpful reviews.  This album deserves attention.  It'll be great for your workout playlist for a while.  This is for old fans of the band and hopefully new fans as well.  It isn't the 'Pet Sounds' of metal.  It's another album of exactly the type of music you'd expect from Disturbed.  Also it isn't their best album.  Those reviewers are probably speaking in the moment too but in a too highly positive manner.  It's just a good album to remind people that Disturbed still have it in them.  And I'm fine with that.  Standout tracks for me are 'Fire It Up' which had some negative responses on Youtube at first because of it's weed influenced lyrics (But come on other great bands have sang about it such as Black Sabbath - Sweet Leaf, TOOL - The Pot).  Other standouts are 'The Light', 'You're Mine', 'Save Our Last Goodbye' and 'The Sound of Silence'.  All of the tracks are nice though.  Like I said, live with this album for a bit before really judging.  I'm not the first to say that and won't be the last.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AS5ALVYZB0Y6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0106US0FU#wasThisHelpful","R1AS5ALVYZB0Y6","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a newer Clive Barker reader.  But don't discount my views on his work just based on that.  Unlike many I really enjoyed this one a lot.  I liked The Hellbound Heart.  But of course I saw the movie version first and like it more surprisingly.  The novel version didn't really even showcase Pinhead except for maybe in a few sentences.  Yet he is the main identifier of the movie series and the major plot point of this sequel/reboot even if his name is changed.  I've also read Barkers Book of Blood volumes which are spine tingling horror collections.  But so far my favorite novel of his is the not much mentioned debut novel The Damnation Game.  But lets get back to this.  Yes I give it 5 stars unlike the majority who have apparently had their much too high expectations murdered with this book.  I saw the reviews but still paid the full 28 bucks for this.  It was a risk I took as I usually get books used or online for cheaper nowadays.  The risk paid off.  Apparently this novel has been talked about and in the making for almost 2 decades before its release.  Plot points being hinted at are probably what disappointed many readers when many of the said plot schemes weren't even in the final book.  Though I understand many of these reviewers disappointments, I still found myself personally enjoying this very straight foward and epic horror novel.  I saw it as a more intricate sequel and end to the movie series of Hellraiser.  Yes the writing style of this book isn't as in depth or mindblowing and poetically terrifying as many of Mr. Barkers previous works, but it was still a mesmerizing epic.  I'd say it's his most accessible book in terms of writing style.  Of course the blood and gore and horror elements aren't for those with weak stomachs.  (Spoiler: theres a very uncalled for rape in the story).  But I'd say any adult who is a fan of a good horror story by someone not named Stephen King would like this.  (love Stephen King too though)  This book was strangely appealing to me.  It was like a very long epic horror movie.  I do believe that if Clive were to really put the effort into it that he could adapt this into a decent movie.  Maybe the finale Hellraiser movie.  Hellraiser: Scarlet Gospels.  Sounds cliche and too sequel-ly.  Oh well.  Or just call the movie Scarlet Gospels.  Either way I enjoyed this horror read.  If you can stomach some of the more weirdly terrifying elements then I highly recommend this.  If you're a fan of the Hellraiser movies but haven't really read the books of Barker, then I'd say give this a short as a closer for the series.  If you're a long time Barker fan then I dont know what to tell you.  You might love it like I did.  You might not.  It's a mixed bag with this book.  I just know I'd read it again when I have the time.  Oh and also for new Barker fans, I highly recommend The Damnation Game as well!.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14U0HXLKZ9FPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250055806#wasThisHelpful","R14U0HXLKZ9FPN","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wasn't really a fan of Tame Impala before this album. I listened to their previous albums and though I agree they are great classics in their own rights, their style wasn't for me. Then one day a friend of mine showed me their song 'Cause I'm A Man'. I was impressed. But it wasn't until I heard their song 'Let It Happen' that they had my full attention. It was one of the most epic and catchy electronic rock songs I've heard in recent years. So I read up on the mastermind behind the band Kevin Parker and his comments regarding this album. I was especially intrigued by the fact that it was basically abandoning the psychedelic rock nature or their previous efforts in favor of more synths and electronic aspects. Then behold the song 'Eventually' was released. Probably one of the greatest songs of all time. But still, leading up to the albums eventual release I almost forgot about the album coming out. But once again the week the album came out there was my friend again reminding me of the album and telling me how great it was all around. So I gave it a preview listen online and liked it. I also couldn't help but to see that other reviewers were calling it another classic breakup record. I love breakup albums the most. So I went and purchased the album and gave it a good few listens and I'm glad I did. Here is a track by track review of this amazing musical journey.1. Let It Happen: As I said, this is an epic synth dance disco rock song. The main synth riff is so urgent and infectious. In fact this entire song has a feeling of urgency as if one was being chased by bad guys throughout a maze like dance floor. At nearly 8 minutes it has more replay value than most 3 minute songs I've heard recently. There is just a bit guitar in here so don't worry if you were concerned that there would be no guitar at all. The final half of the song gets almost robotic in the vein of Daft Punk perfectly. This is also one of my new workout playlist tracks for the gym! Amazing song. 10/102. Nangs: This is a short cut. At first I thought it was going to be an interlude but its just a quick song. It's very trippy and layered with repeated vocals throughout. There's something soothing about it that makes me wish it lasted longer. Still very dreamlike. 9/103. The Moment: Another upbeat disco rock track. The repeated synth riff is simple and genius. There are atmospheric sounds faintly in the background that seem like faint orchestrated parts. Kevin sings in a relaxed voice throughout with infectious wit. The lyrics are very nice too. There is also an interesting synth solo that sounds exotic. 9.5/104. Yes I'm Changing: Things slow down for this very emotional and masterfully executed ballad. This is probably Kevins best vocal performance yet. I never thought he could sing like this. This should be a single. The lyrics are very reflecting. The production really makes you get lost in the soundscape. The final minute change tone to somewhat gothic keyboards ending the song in a hauntingly beautiful manner. A perfect song. 11/105. Eventually: Another perfect song. As I said earlier this is one of the best songs of all time in my opinion. It's a break up song, but from the point of view of the person doing the breaking up. The harsh but tuneful synth riff throughout is tragic and gorgeous. There are sudden stops throughout that just work so well. The vocals of course are emotional and almost remorseful to the lyrics. Its a sad song for a break up. I suggest you not listen to it during a bad break up. Still a masterpiece of a song. The final part of the song features this synth riff that just leaves me in near tears each time no matter my mood. I'm surprised this hasn't become a mega hit(yet) as it's also the catchiest song on an album full of catchy tracks. A beautiful emotional tour de force track that I would call the Song Of The Year. 11/106. Gossip: The synth of this song sounds like what its title suggest. It's as if the sounds are gossiping to each other. Very clever short interlude. 9/107. The Less I Know The Better: This one features more of the disco rock style. The guitars are back again with a funky groove throughout along with Kevins fun vocals despite the tone of the lyrics. The final verse of the song sounds like it should've been a chorus for the song its so playful and sad. A great unconventional possible hit! 9.5/108. Past Life: This is just amazing. The verses are spoken word and tell such a beautiful story about a past love. The chorus is sung in heavenly manner. Though at first some might be off put by the effect put on Kevins voice during the verses it actually feels like it couldn't work without it once you get used to the song. Very dreamy and heartbreaking yet it ends on a positive note. 10/109. Disciples: Another really short song. Not an interlude. Just a quick and awesome song. Its a nice fast song and I understand why its so short, but I wouldn't mind if it was twice as long either. Oh well that's what the replay button is for! 9/1010. 'Cause I'm A Man: This is the closest thing to the psychedelic style but also in tune with the rest of the album. It's a very relaxing and empowering song. I was impressed but it's not my favorite on the album. Maybe it'll be yours though. 8.5/1011. Reality In Motion: I like the laid back playful tone of Kevins singing again on this song. He makes it seem so effortless. It's a real head bobbing song. Of course like most of the songs it changes style a bit toward the end. There's even a slight guitar near the finale. Very nice. 9/1012. Love/Paranoia: Wow. Can this guy do no wrong? Just as the title suggest this one is full of love and paranoia in its sound and lyrics. It also a slight R&B feel that is pulled off almost too nicely. Very emotional too. Less than 30 seconds to the end it gets a so good with guitars and orchestration that I wish it lasted much longer. Dare I say it? Another perfect song. 10/1013. New Person, Same Old Mistakes: The album began epic and fast. It ends epic and somewhat slow, in a good way. This song just has such a classy vibe to it. Everything about this song is smooth from the production to the style of the singing. This sounds like the perfect song to listen to while walking down a cityscape while wearing your best suit or dress with your head held up high. It's a very mysterious song as well. A great way to close this emotional album. 10/10So this album was a pleasant surprise and a nice treat. Very few times are full albums so consistent. This was epic and full of genius but at the same time very catchy and accessible. Something that is very rare to find in music nowadays. It is also the best all out break up album for me. But don't get me wrong, even if you're happily in a relationship or happily single you'd appreciate the beauty and sound of this. It's hard to fully explain just how magnificent and near perfect this album is. Like I said, I wasn't a fan before this album. Hopefully in further released the band explores more of this sound or maybe another. I'm sure Kevin is a class act with whatever style of music he tries to make. You will dance to this. You will relax to this. You might even cry to this. Don't be ashamed if you do! This is a very satisfying and smooth headphone album of heartbreak. Close your eyes. Let the music take you to abstract places in your mind. I seriously think this is a candidate for the Album Of The Year. It would be a criminal injustice if it wasn't even nominated at the Grammys. (Future people was I right or wrong?) If you liked their old albums but have an open mind for new sounds then you might like this or maybe not. If you like good electronic rock then you'll love this. I suggest you listen to it online first and if you like it then buy it. But be warned, once you get into this album, you'll never get tired of it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HE8OIHA9GET7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBWBWBK#wasThisHelpful","R3HE8OIHA9GET7","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first got into Miguel as an impulse buy. His song 'Adorn' was still blossoming. I loved the style of the song and the high notes he could hit so effortlessly. I knew I was listening to a new icon of music. So I walked through a music store sometime after and saw his album 'Kaleidoscope Dream' on sale and picked it up. It was a huge breath of fresh air with its wispy production and soulful melodies compared to most of the genre today. The album was tapping into a new genre thats slowly taking the world by storm called PBR&B. It has also become a standard album to listen to while making love for many people. So I was in high anticipation of Miguels next move. I was wondering how he could top the legendary song 'Adorn'. In the meantime I checked out his debut album which was also good but not nearly as groundbreaking and masterful. Finally he released the lead single for this album 'Coffee' but I was at first disappointed upon hearing that it was not only just a reworked version of a song from a EP he released in 2014, but that he added a rap guest vocal to it by Wale, which totally ruined the song. Wale isn't bad, and rap isn't bad, but Miguels music doesn't work best with one guest verse from a rapper. His vocals do however work great when he himself is a guest on a rappers song usually singing the chorus. But I didn't give up on his new album as he released more songs prior to the album that kept my interest high such as 'face the sun'. So when the disc finally hit stores I purchased it. After many repeated listens here is a track by track review.1. A Beautiful Exit: The album opener begins with a few seconds of a news reporter before this sonic guitar comes in. Miguels singing in this is similar to his song 'The Thrill'. During the chorus the sonic guitars are layered with more elegant guitars that work so well. This song is a beautiful entrance. 9.5/102. Deal: This one starts off somewhat slow before turning into a jam with a groovy bass. The chorus sounds fun and playful like some oldschool funk song, but I think the real star of this song is the production. For the first time I'm not too impressed by Miguels vocals. Don't get me wrong, the song is nice. I just wouldn't list it among his best material. The last half with hints of Miguels higher notes and group vocals along with some distinct guitars before slowing down into a slow jam are the best parts. I wish the slow jam toward the end lasted longer! 9/103. The Valley: The production of this song is similar to late 90s Nine Inch Nails, which is nice. The vocals are seductive while the lyrics are far from innocent. It's a sexy song to make love to like you're 'filming in the valley'. Miguel swears with class. For anyone who doesn't know, the valley is alluded to as the place in Hollywood where many porn films are filmed. Get ready to add this to your sex playlist, but you can listen to this as casual listening just as much. 9.5/104. Coffee: Boy was I glad that Wale wasn't on the album version! No offense to Wale fans, but he really ruined the song. But this pristine version of the song with Miguel alone is just perfect. It has Miguels own sensual production with his sexual vocals. Sadly the song hasn't impacted big, yet. It's no 'Adorn', but thats like expecting Led Zeppelin to make another 'Stairway'. Expect this one to never get old. This one will put almost anyone in a good mood. 10/105. NWA Feat. Kurrupt: Seeing the guest rapper on the title I was ready to be disappointed. But unlike the alternate version of 'Coffee' that was ruined, this one actually works. Kurrupt isn't the best rapper. He isn't the ideal for this song seeing it's title either. His lyrics aren't impressive, but the way he delivered them were in tune with the style of the song that now I can't see this song without him. But now lemme talk about the main star Miguel. He sings in a falsetto for the whole song nicely. The production gives the song a feeling of walking an island at night seeing various people making love. Or at least that's how I'd picture a music video for this. Good song that almost proves me wrong about MIguel and guest rappers. 9/106. Waves: This is the catchiest song on the album by far. I can see this becoming a hit single. This is something Bruno Mars would be impressed with. You can interpret the lyrics literally or metaphorically and it works great either way. Make babies to this song or enjoy it at a beach party! A master funk pop song. 10/107. Whats Normal Anyway: This is the best song on the album in my opinion. It's a laid back song. It's a self pity song almost but reminds itself that being yourself is important. It's also a great song for how most mixed kids feel growing up. The production is full of sonic textures and emotional synths. Great song to just listen to with good headphones while walking around a city and thinking about life. 10/108. Hollywood Dreams: This is a great motivational song in nature. Decent lyrics. The groovy guitar riff marches throughout. It's very catchy and Miguel sings nicely throughout as expected. Just a feelgood song. 9/109. Destinado A Morir (Enter.Lewd): Usually I don't really like interlude type tracks. This one was okay. It would've worked better as a full song. It doesn't even really lead into the next much better track. Others might like it, but for me it's just okay. 7.5/1010. ...Goingtohell: Great song. The music is just perfect. The tragic and romantic lyrics and vocals are vintage Miguel. I know the lyrics are pretty straight forward but the song itself always gives me this feeling of going through very tough times with a lover together. There's even a nice guitar solo. The chorus is so elegant and laid back. One of his best by far. 10/1011. Flesh: This song brings to mind sensual gothic vampire style romance. It sounds silly to some maybe but I mean those old school vampires in black leather before Twilight ruined them. This sounds like it could be part of their playlist for eternal love making. Its so beautiful and almost haunting in a good way. Get ready to breed to this. 10/1012. Leaves: Another song where the guitar is upfront for more genre bending. It starts off soft before it ends with a bang. This one is a sad song to listen to thinking of the one that got away. Prepare to have memories of a past love haunt you in the last minute of the song. Unless you're in a happy relationship now so you'll just see this as a great mellow song. It's great either way. 10/1013. Face The Sun Feat. Lenny Kravitz: Now when I saw the Kravitz name on this song I assumed it was gonna be like one of his funk rock jams from the 90s. No offense to him, but I'm glad it was nothing like that! This is just a romantic slow song with great guitars and probably Miguels best vocal performance on the album. Kravits probably plays the guitar including a nice solo, but he also has a nice backing vocal part. This is the type of guest that builds the song perfectly to compliment the main artist. I really hope this one becomes a single. Not only is it one of his best songs but its a perfect closer to the album. The lyrics are so gorgeous and romantic. Anyone else singing this type of song would come off as corny, but he delivers it all with class. This is in the ball park of 'Adorn', maybe even in a bigger league. Perfection. 11/10So I'm gonna say it. This was better than Kaleidoscope Dream. Its more consistent. I loved that album but there are a good 3 or 4 songs I would skip on it. This album isn't as catchy at first, but it is a clear example of an album that gets better with multiple listens and never gets old. This one is a seed that you plant and it grows into a musical tree of sensual magic for your ears. If you don't like it at first, I urge you to put it away for a few days, then revisit it and see how it sounds somewhat more welcoming to you. But of course some people just wont like it no matter what. In those cases those people shouldn't trash the album but just move on. Some have compared Miguel to Prince. I think that's a lazy comparison. They both have stylish hair and they aren't tall individuals and they incorporate rock and roll elements but they really don't sound the same. Also this isn't R&B or PBR&B, well not entirely. I'd say this is the midpoint between both genres. It does have a few good examples of PBR&B throughout such as 'Coffee', 'Whats Normal Anyways' and ' Face The Sun' but as a whole this is almost hard to put into one genre. All I can say is it is great romantic music. Even if you don't have a lover, this is stylish classy music to listen and relax to. This is one of the best albums of 2015 and probably the best R&B related material in years. Yes even better than that D'Angelo album. Go ahead and dismiss my opinion and maybe my review just on that comment. Regarding the PBR&B styled songs. If you liked them, then you should check out the singer known as 'How To Dress Well', especially his album 'What Is This Heart?', as he's one of the few in the genre who gives Miguel a run for his money. But yes, this album is near perfect. If you like Miguels style then you'll either love this or be disappointed. Hopefully the former.  I can see this becoming known as a classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MLXS3XXPDVU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XIQNKK0#wasThisHelpful","R1MLXS3XXPDVU8","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when fun. was gaining momentum in their career with the song 'We Are Young'.  I honestly didn't like the song.  The reason I bought their second album the day it came out was because I read that it was inspired by the sound of Kanye West(production, not lyrics) and in some aspects, Queen.  So I bought the album 'Some Nights' and it became one of my main soundtracks for my life as a 18 year old in Miami at the time.  Oh the memories the album still brings to my mind these days.  So as you can expect I was strongly anticipating a new album from the band for years.  Sadly no new studio album materialized.  Then lead guitarist Jack Antonoff embarked on his solo career with his project Bleachers and a new album.  I liked it.  I didn't think it was as good as fun. though.  So then came the announcement of Nate Ruess pursuing a solo career as well.  I was somewhat excited.  When he released his first single 'Nothing Without Love' I couldn't help but compare it to the fun. song that made them famous in the first place.  I honestly again didn't really like it as much as I wanted.  But then he released the song 'AhHa'.  That song was like a sequel to my favorite fun. song 'Some Nights'.  So I was again excited for the albums release hoping to get the closest thing to a new fun. album.  I was right.  Sorta.  It's impossible not to compare this new album to Nates bands work, but that's the reason I bought it in the first place.  I was not disappointed.  Here's a track by track review.1.  Grand Romantic (Intro): Much like the theatrics of 'Some Nights' this one is impossible not to compare to the operatic aspects of Queen, and I love it.  Great baroque opener.  I actually wish it was longer and louder though.  9/102.  AhHa: Some people are trashing this song.  I at first was annoyed by the constant laughter in the background, but it really stuck with me for the better.  Yes like I said it's like a sequel to the song 'Some Nights'.  I didn't realize it at first but the lyrics of the pre-chorus are directly taken from the ending portion of the song 'Some Nights' which is cool.  Its a very anthemic song.  The production is grand.  Great song to work out to or listen to on a road trip.  I don't like how it ends abruptly though as I always think theirs something wrong with the track each time.  Still a great catchy pump up song.  10/103.  Nothing Without Love: I didn't like this song that much at first.  But I couldn't stop it from taking over my mind with its infectious melodies.  Still not one of my favorites though.  If you liked 'We Are Young' then you'll like this, but this is better in my opinion.  9/104.  Take It Back: This is where the romantic aspect really starts.  The old crackling record player sound in the background was off putting at first.  It has such a relaxing and heartbreaking sound.  But nonetheless it's one of the most beautiful songs I've heard lyrically and musically in a long time.  There's even a great guitar solo.  Sam Smith would be impressed with this one.  I would've chosen this as the lead single.  10/105  You Light My Fire: This sounds like it took all of the biggest pop hits of the 80s and tried to mash them together into one song and it works.  I do think the chorus is the least appealing part surprisingly but the production throughout and the verses make up for it ten fold.  Nice playful retro tune.  9/106.  What This World Is Coming To (featuring Beck): This is a beautiful mellow song.  Some have compared it to Lennon which is on spot.  Becks appearance is nicely done without overshadowing Nate at all since this is his album.  The first half has more of Becks style while the last half is vintage Ruess.  This is a modern classic.  9.5/107.  Great Big Storm: This is another insanely catchy song.  It will annoy some at first.  But trust me this is one of those songs that you'll find yourself suddenly singing in the shower its so infectious.  The lyrics are also very meaningful.  The style of the song is like a playful musical storm.  9.5/108.  Moment: Another possible future hit.  This is a piano driven power ballad with a chorus that's destined to be cried to.  I can see the sea of cell phone lights during a live performance of this while Ruess pours his heart out.  A great song for a farewell to a relationship you wished wouldn't end.  10/109.  It Only Gets Much Worse: The title should already foreshadow the sad song ahead.  It's truly sad and beautiful.  The orchestral background is tragic beauty in musical form.  This one breaks my heart in a good way?  The way Nate delivers the chorus is smooth.  This is the kind of song you'll see in a montage of heartbreak in a movie.  10/1010.  Grand Romantic: This is such a great companion to the opening song that I wish it followed that song.  It seems to work better played alongside its intro counterpart.  This song truly is full of romance.  Its such a gorgeously crafted song.  Then when you think its over the baroque Queen-esque choir from the intro song repeats but much louder and more magically.  Such a great song.  10/1011.  Harsh Light:  This song was originally performed by fun. live but alas it has appeared on this album.  This studio version of the song is a breath of fresh air though.  Nates chants of ""We All Got Scars"" will get lodged in your cranium.  There is a instrument similar to a flute heard briefly during the bridge section that is such a great attention to detail that I love in the production.  This one gets better with each listen which is saying something since the song is instantly lovable.  10/1012.  Brightside: Wow what a way to end an album full of love songs.  There is a twinkle to this songs melody that gives it a dreamy tragic feeling.  The baroque style musical cues throughout are just perfect.  Nate gives one of his best vocal performances as well.  It really feels like a drunk dream full of loving memories in musical form.  The way Nate playfully says ""And look at you"" just feels right as the album comes to a celestial close.  10/10So I'm sure some of you were tired of all the fun. comparisons but its almost impossible not to mention them since this truly sounds like the next album from the band.  Which is a good thing.  Look back at the cover artwork.  The music matches the mood and style of the artwork almost too perfectly.  I could almost see balloons flying up into the unknown in my mind at the end of most of the songs.  It's not a happy album, but it's a beautifully orchestrated one with vocals that pull on your heartstrings.  Nates voice is a trademark now.  It's like anything he puts his vocals to turns into magical music.  Also another reason the similarities to fun. were prominent was because the production team was basically the same.  This is a great album for break ups.  Even if you're happy in a relationship you could listen to this with your lover for its beauty and show your partner your Grandly Romantic musical taste.  This is truly a pop masterpiece.  I promise if you already like anything Nate has been apart of including fun., The Format or just his guest vocals on many other artists songs, then you'll more than love this.  I can proudly say it's much better than his fellow bandmembers solo Bleachers album, which was also good.  I say it's one of the best albums of 2015 and truly one of the best ever by a lead singer going solo.  This demands repeated listens.  One of the best albums in the past 10 years and worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SVA8KET134Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X6BXAL6#wasThisHelpful","R21SVA8KET134Y","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its no surprise that I discovered Of Monsters and Men when they released the song 'Little Talks' and took the world by storm. When I first heard of them I just dismissed them as an Arcade Fire ripoff band but I quickly changed my mind. Their debut album was one of the best of 2012. The band became somewhat of an everyman band. The public didn't hate them. You wouldn't be made fun of for telling anyone you liked the band. Critics liked the band too but they weren't Grammy darlings. I always thought of them as a folky version of the xx. They did continue to pave the way for indie/folk rock to reach bigger audiences. So after the success of their first album I was curious to see what the group would do next. Almost 3 years passed since and I almost forgot about the band honestly. In todays music landscape, 3 years between albums can sometimes break an artists career. When the band released their lead single ""Crystals"" I wasn't that impressed at first. Sure it has grown on me like a parasite like most good songs, but it just never hit the world hard like the singles from the first album. They released a few more songs to hype up the release, but for the most part if you weren't already a mega fan of the band you probably had no idea the album was hitting stores. I'm not a mega fan of the band. I said I liked their first album and was eager to see what happened next, but I was totally surprised when I saw that they released their new album the same day as another band I actually love more, Muse. But, for some odd reason, I bought this album over the Muse album despite it being more pricey(I still listened to the Muse on Spotify of course though). It was an impulse. So when I got home I looked up information on the new album to see if I should keep it. I keep telling myself I won't listen to critics reviews anymore, but my curiosity always has me wanting to know others opinions. So I saw that the critics weren't too kind on this album and it almost made me return it. I didn't, and I'm glad I didn't. After a few listens of this impulse buy I found it mesmerizing. Here is a track by track review.1. Crystals: Like I said, this lead single wasn't as impressive at first. But gosh has it grown on me. Those 'whoah oh oh ooohs' are irresistible. This really is a beautiful song. The short bridge section of the song that leads to the last repetition of the chorus always gets me. It wasn't a big hit at the time of the albums release but it does have potential to change that. Great opener. 9.5/102. Human: A quiet starting song with soothing distance humming in the background. When the vocals start things really take off. I can see this being another decent single. The lyrics are darker but its so gorgeous it has that special appeal to be used in movie trailers and soundtracks. The melody isn't that obvious at first but it will hit you hard when it finally does. Its tragic beauty in song form. 9.5/103. Hunger: This is a very atmospheric song and I love it. The dual vocals work great in this song. I love their dual vocals most compared to them taking turns with lead vocals on a lot of songs. I can see this being another hit song. You'll see many people covering this online. I love the drumming on this song and its theatrical ending. 9/104. Wolves Without Teeth: This one is catchy all around. The verses and chorus could be switched and still be infectious. There are many layers in the background that really make this song stellar. This is one of those songs that makes you discover more and more with repeated listens. The last minute is so corny but powerful I really love it and wish it lasted longer. One of my favorites. 10/105. Empire: This is almost similar to 'Dirty Paws' in structure. The lyrics just sound so magical. It's like the words were made to be in this song. This is what I would've chosen to be the lead single if I was in charge. Its majestic instrumentally and infectious vocally. This is the type of song that reminds you to have a great imagination. Let the music paint a picture in your mind. 10/106. Slow Life: This is the grooviest song from the band so far. The guitar and drums jam throughout as the bass grooves along. That bass though. This is epic and dreamlike. This is the perfect bridge between the first and second half of the album. 10/107. Organs: At first I didn't like this song. I recognized it was great, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. But boy did this song prove me wrong. It's slow, but its so persistent in its beauty and it forces its melody to get stuck in your head. This is a song that many will cry to when their down. It will be one of those healthy cry-fests that you need to remind yourself you're human. I already have this on reserve for when I'm in a crisis in my life and just need to sit back and let the music guide my emotions. You can listen to this with others, but I think this is best enjoyed alone for life introspection. I hate it for making me unable to resist it. 9.5/108. Black Water: Just the title itself sends my mind dark gothic imagery. The song is just that. Very folky gothic and it works well. When I listen to this song I imagine a dark figure staring at the sea from a castle in the night. Can this song make a song that isn't just pure gorgeousness? The last two minutes of the song is probably the best two minutes of the entire album. That's saying something considering how great the album is. 10/109. Thousand Eyes: This one starts off as the quietest song on the album before it builds up into a climax that never really happens. Reminds me of Sigur Ros instrumentally which is a huge compliment. If I ever became a movie director I wouldn't want this in my movie. 10/1010. I Of The Storm: Such a gorgeous and emotional song. This will be a big hit. This song will stand the test of time. Everything is perfect in this song. Every little musical layer is placed perfectly and if just any small part of the song was removed it wouldn't sound complete. Its not a happy song. But it's still musical beauty. 10/1011. We Sink: I always hold closing songs to a higher regard. I feel every album should close with a lasting impression and not just 'another song'. This is that lasting impression. That's all I need to say. It sums up the beauty of the album perfectly. Its a cinematic ending perfect for the credits to play to. 10/10So once again the negativity of so called professional critics need to be ignored. This album was released to little hype and it might slip under many listeners radars which would be a great injustice. This album isn't as instantly catchy as the first. But I will say with confidence that I think this album is better as a whole. If you're a mega fan of the band, you will love this without a doubt. If you're one of those who loved the bands first album but didn't really keep up with them after that, then this will remind you why you liked them in the first place like it did for me. Hopefully this album rebounds with its subsequent singles and inevitable uses in soundtracks and trailers. You might have already heard this album on replay at bookstores. I know that most of the critics are people who probably listened to the album once or twice and tossed it aside. Trust me, this album will hit you hard and demand repeated listens. This is a perfect addition to any summer playlist. If you're going through a break up or another sad event, this album will comfort you when you're home alone and need the motivation. The album artwork reminded me of something that I couldn't quite put my finger on at first, then it hit me. It reminded me of the album cover for Sigur Ros untitled album. They are another brilliant Icelandic band worth checking out. But yes, this album is one of the best alums of 2015 and I hope it holds strong. It serves as great driving music. Great background music or your personal soundtrack for magical motivation. This is not a sophomore slump. Its a sophomore bump. It's probably one of the best albums of 2015 that many will not even hear. So I'd help spread the word if I were you to change that. Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMGLT4BCS5QT6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US7OSEY#wasThisHelpful","RMGLT4BCS5QT6","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a newer fan of the Pixies/Frank Black, as I was born just when the band was breaking up initially. I'm not trying to impress anyone saying I'm young and blah blah like a hipster. The band just clicks with me so much. I can proudly say they have quickly become my favorite group. I still listen to all kinds of music but so far I've never had an obsession with a bands music quite like I have for the Pixies. I've only really started listening to their music fully recently, but they really almost instantly took the throne for my all time favorite musical artist. I've read about the bands history, watched old and new live footage that I wish I could've seen in person, and of course listened to all five of their full length albums. Surfa Rosa gets so much acclaim for its raw and unique sound for its time and it should, but I think it's my least favorite album of theirs. It's still great though. I will say it now that Bossanova is my all time favorite from the band. Doolittle is my second favorite. Trompe Le Monde is my third favorite. I even put their 2014 Kim-less album ahead of Surfa Rosa, because. I enjoyed it a lot more. I even checked out some of Frank Blacks early solo work. Teenager of the Year is still one of my favorites as well. So back to Doolittle now. I know I said it wasn't my favorite album from the band, but I do acknowledge that it's their best. What else can I say that hasn't been said throughout the years? Doolittle is a landmark album. It literally changed rock music. It's great. It's the bees-kness. When I first bought this album I literally listened to it for 4 hours straight and that wasn't enough. I still listen to it regularly even if I'm trying to find new music. Here's a track by track review for other newcomers who happen upon this review.1. Debaser: Such a great opener that instantly showcases all aspects of the band. The fun bass, awesome guitars, parading drums and of course Frank Blacks insanely catchy shouting vocals. It's guitar riff is always stuck in my head even after hearing the rest of the album. 10/102. Tame: This one took me a while to like. I can see some people liking it instantly. It took me a few listens, but it really latched onto me. The angry chorus just gets my blood pumping. Great bridge part as well. Its funny knowing that when offered a slot to perform on Arsenio Hall, they wanted to play this song but were quickly denied because of its angry unconventional style unheard of then. Great song though. 9/103. Wave Of Mutilation: Another track that showcases the great riffs Santiago can produce along with Franks more melodic soothing vocals. It just gives me this warming sensation every time I hear it. 10/104. I Bleed: So this is one of the specific tracks that I think Kurt Cobain was influenced by. It really has the blueprints for the sound of Nirvana and grunge altogether. Bass upfront with some awesome guitars sneaking around every corner while Frank and Kim sing together in such an awesomely haunting way. The angst-filled guitars during the chorus are so good too. 10/105. Here Comes Your Man: Oh the big hit of the album. It's probably the catchiest song from the band alongside 'Dig For Fire' from Bossanova. It's just so different than anything else from the band musically and lyrically. It's great. That guitar riff. That chorus. If you like this catchy more mellow side to Franks vocals you should check out his second solo album 'Teenager of the Year' as well. Such a beautiful song that I'm sure will still sound brand new even 50 years from now. 10/106. Dead: This will sound strange and crazy for most listeners at first. It sure did for me. But the screeching guitar along with Blacks cartoony crazy vocals really get stuck in your head after repeated listens. It's one of the bands acquired taste songs. There is a nice melodic guitar part during the chorus though thats always a welcoming gesture. Strange and good. 9/107. Monkey Gone To Heaven: The second catchiest song on the album. The lyrics might sound silly and obscure but there is a deep meaning. The chorus is enchanting and almost hypnotizing. I like the use of violins as well. I love the bridge section a lot that leads into the finaly chorus too. Oh and I forgot to mention again how awesome Santiagos guitar is. 10/108. Mr. Grieves: This song begins with a sound similar to Tom Waits in style. Frank does this insane laugh that makes you know you're in for a ride. When the song picks up speed it gains more melody and undeniably catchy vocals. It's a sound the band didn't really move onto their future albums but I love it. I know Frank loved short songs, but I wish this was longer. 9.5/109. Crackity Jones: There are some silly spanish lyrics mixed with the english and more of the fast insane vocals that might turn off some listeners not used to the style. The fast guitar riff throughout is just incredible! 9/1010. La La Love You: David the drummer takes over lead vocals on this song with his nice Elvis styled singing. It's a cute love song that shows off Davids ability to kick butt on drums and sing a catchy tune at the same time. Nice guitar work and whistle moments too. I wish David was used more vocally like in this song. It's always fun watching the live videos of this too. 10/1011. No. 13 Baby: I love how the band can be insane wacky with vocals and catchy at the same time. It shows off how the band can end a song with a groove. 9.5/1012. There Goes My Gun: The shouts of 'Yo ho' seemed silly at first but like most of the bands music, it makes perfect sense in due time after repeated listens. It is another example of the bands ability to make short but lasting top tunes. 9.5/1013. Hey: Hey! This is just an awesome amazing perfect good great song. Such a powerful track that has so many layers to it. The way the guitar riffs of Santiago and Black compliment each other along with the rest of the band are just unexplainable. I just love this song. 10/1014. Silver: This is a very cinematic slow and haunting song sung by Kim. It really sounds nothing like the others which is why the album and band are loved. It's not my favorite, but I never seem to find the need to press skip. It feels like something you'd hear in a dramatic and tragic movie scene. The slide guitar done by Kim is nice though. 9/1015. Gouge Away: What a way to bring it all together for this groovy rock ending. It's a strange biblical love song about, gouging your eyes out. Haunting yet strongly appealing. Smooth edgy closer to an amazing album. 9.5/10So, yes the hype is real. This album is timeless. It's all over the place in style and it works well. Something many bands fail to do with full albums. It's quick and really demands multiple listens. It rocks. It jams. It pops. This is the Pixies best album. Their Magnum Opus. But like I said, that doesn't mean it has to be my favorite. If you're a newcomer to the band I'd recommend listening to Bossanova(My favorite). Then listen to Doolittle(Their best), then listen to Trompe Le Monde(Also great), then Surfa Rosa. If you end up loving Surfa Rosa or are someone who already does, then ok, doesn't mean I'm gonna start loving it the same way. Then after you have their original line up material seeped into your head, give their newest album Indie Cindy a chance. I really like it. Some trash talk it, but their mostly biased just because of Kims departure. It's a nice album that stands tall along the rest. Also check out Frank Blacks first two solo albums because they really do sound like 'what if' Pixies albums. I might even say 'Teenager of the Year' is as good as if not better than Doolittle. But yes, Doolittle is the masterpiece force of music nature that everyone is saying. In this modern music landscape I'll say you should listen to it on Spotify then actually buy it. I did. It was worth every penny.  This album is 7.  You'll understand after listening to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9WHAN7SHCJ4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000065PUE#wasThisHelpful","R9WHAN7SHCJ4Y","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The xx have always had a special place in my music collection.  Sure they aren't my all time favorite artists but they are definitely one of my top go-to groups.  Their first album was an instant atmospheric guitar twirling classic that showcased their ability to fuse indie rock with nightclub vibes.  Their second album focused a lot more on the nightclub vibes and lost one of the key guitarists that made the first album so great, but it was still a great almost underrated second album.  Ever since, I've been patiently waiting for any announcement on a new xx album.  I knew Jamie was the main producer and beat maker of the album, and he had his own sorta solo effort a few years back in the form of a collaboration remix collection with Gil Scott Heron.  I thought it had the great production and style of the xx but with Gils soulful raw voice, but I didn't really give it much attention.  So then I hear some of Jamies solo songs leading up to this album.  Songs like 'Girl' and 'Sleep Sound' were mesmerizing.  Then he released the song 'Loud Places', which featured his xx bandmate Romy, along with an awesome video.  It made me even more excited, even though I knew Romy wouldn't be on the entire album.  Usually I stay away from almost entirely instrumental albums, but once the album finally came out I gave it a listen on Spotify and I couldn't resist.  It was some of the classiest electronic music I've heard.  I had to have it physically.  After multiple listens so far, here is my track by track review.1.  Gosh: This opener has an urgent feeling to it.  The bass thumps as the beat runs along.  The chants of 'Oh my gosh' are somewhat humorous but they work well.  This is the type of song you'd hear during a chase scene in an action movie and I like it.  Also good to listen to during a workout.  The last half of the song takes a different approach with its ominous bass and playful siren-like synths closing the song perfectly. 9.5/102.  Sleep Sound: This version sounds different than the one released beforehand, and I like it a lot.  The song features some heavenly plucking sounds along with a distant soothing bass.  There are also these strangely appealing sounds throughout that seem to be that of voices put through some vocal effect.  This is really an out of this world sexy song that needs to be played loud whether in a car or at home or on some decent headphones.  I can see this being played a lot when I go to the beach during the summer.  10/103.  SeeSaw featuring Romy: The ending of the last song merges into this song nicely.  The drums are faster and the synths are so beautiful.  Romys evangelic vocals sore in the near distance throughout the song.  If the xx release a new album soon I'd love to hear more of this side to them!  Definitely a new house classic.  10/104.  Obvs: There is a slight tropical vibe similar to Jamies production in The xx song 'Reunion'.  But things just keep building up and the song ends in a totally different place than it began which always leaves me in awe.  There are even distant Lion King style howls in the distance in some parts that make me feel relaxed.  10/105.  Just Saying: I saw the short length and thought I'd be disappointed.  Its a very soothing interlude that I'm sure would work great in a movie soundtrack.  I think I hear some Romy in it at a certain part.  I just wish it was longer.  Not really disappointed, as its a good relaxer, but still not one of my favorites.  8/106.  Stranger In A Room featuring Oliver Sim: The other xx bandmate song.  It gives off the illusion that it might be a fast song with its quick synths, but it's probably the slowest vocal featured song on the album.  Its impossible not to compare it to the xx since Oliver is the prominent singer in more songs than Romy.  Reminds me a bit of 'Fiction' from the band, but of course without the beat.  Great beautifully sad song as always.  Its a nice midpoint for the album.  9/107.  Hold Tight: The first half sounds like something Trent Reznor would be proud of.  Then the second half speeds up with its drums.  Another one that sounds worthy of being part of some climatic action sequence in a movie. 8.5/108.  Loud Places featuring Romy: Such a beautiful song.  The production just sounds the perfect soundtrack for a soothing night out in the big city.  Romy even shows off her xx guitars even if only slightly in the background.  Of course the ending lyrics leave that lasting mark on your heartstrings.  It's a perfect song.  I don't know what else to say.  10/109.  I Know There's Gonna Be(Good Times) featuring Young Thug and Popcaan: This really sounds out of place among the other songs.  But does that make it bad?  No way.  This is one of the catchiest xx related songs.  The beat and synths were made for the club.  The Hip Hop/R&B vocals are delivered undeniably well even if its in a style foreign to others on the album.  I can already see Hip Hop artists hearing this and begging to have Jamie produce for them.  Hopefully the xx's next album explores this style more but without the constant swearing.  The band itself just doesn't work well with vulgar lyrics, but this song does, and I'll be jamming to it all summer.  I can see this being the big hit of the album maybe.  10/1010.  The Rest Is Noise:  This is beautiful 'noise'.  Its dreamy and fast paced production with heavenly vocal howls throughout in the distance remind me of M83.  There is also a synth moment that is very similar if not the same as that of 'SeeSaw' accompanied by a gorgeously elegant piano.  It then transitions into a club song in the last two minutes smoothly.  Its the longest song on the album but it doesn't feel long enough.  I could listen to this alone on replay for hours and not get tired of it.  11/1011.  Girl:  That groovy bass throughout is....groovy.  There is more of those otherworldly vocal chants throughout the song.  Toward the end there is an industrial part that I wish was longer as it also features some nice guitars.  It's a great song and a decent closer to the album, but I feel like the previous song would've closed the album better.  Still good.  9.5/10So this was a great album to vibe to especially for a summer soundtrack and late nights out on the town during any season.  I was on a Pixies binge when this album came out.  They are my favorite group and a totally different sound altogether.  But this album broke me away from that binge.  Thats how worthy and great this is.  If you like The xx, you'll either love this or hate it.  If you love House/Electronic/Dance then you'd be in for a treat with this collection of songs.  I can tell this will be revisited throughout the summer and many summers to come.  Jam to it at home or relax to it.  Use it as background music as you get things down around your place or while you study.  Drive through the night with it as your soundtrack.  Go to the gym and workout/stretch to the vibes of this.  Close your eyes and lay down while the album takes you somewhere in your thoughts.  Open your eyes and maybe even go for a nice stroll if you can with this guiding your steps.  It's basically an electronic album that would work well as a soundtrack to almost anything you do.  I love it, and as I said before, I hope Jamies band The xx explores more of the sounds heard here. These thoughts I've expressed in this review were after at least 5 listens through.  Upon my first listen I wasn't really impressed, but I urge you to push forward with repeated listens like I did so this can fully seep into your mindset.  This is really worth the money whether you download it or buy the actual album.  Probably the best album of any genre in 2015 at the time of its release in my opinion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19CXIQ2G4EKPN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V9MQZRU#wasThisHelpful","R19CXIQ2G4EKPN","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I avoided this album upon its initial release because of the mostly mixed to negative reaction from critics compared to the almost unanimous critical praise of their first four albums.  That was a huge mistake and clear example of bad judgement on my part!  I'm actually a newer fan of Pixies and Frank Black, especially since I was born around the time they first broke up.  I discovered them through many outlets from their inclusion at the end of Fight Club to the comedic cover of 'Here Comes Your Man' on 500 Days of Summer.  I had read about the bands history and how important and groundbreaking their first two albums were.  I completely ignored their albums Bossanova and Trompe for no real good reason at first.  I never really listened to Surfa Rosa but just took the critics words for it.  In fact I never listened to any of their albums entirely until recently, remember my age so give me a pass.  For some reason I decided to check out the Pixies albums in 2015 finally.  But not before I checked out Frank Blacks solo albums.  I only listened to the first two.  Teenager of the Year is now one of my favorites of all time.  So I listened to each of the bands albums fully a few times each.  I didn't like Surfa Rosa as much as everyone else.  Sure its great, but I just never got into it.  Doolittle is of course amazing.  But then came Bossanova and Trompe, which I thought were their worst albums based on lower sales at first which was very stupid of me.  They ended up being my favorite albums of the band, Surfa being my least.  I can already see hipsters shaking their heads and arrogantly blindly disagreeing.I realized finally that I should not give a crap about critics reviews.  I paid too much attention to Pitchfork, who is the almighty hipster music haven.  They worshiped this band but hated this album which turned me off from it.  I'm glad to say I have finally denounced giving a crap about what those hooligans at Pitchfork have to say, good or bad, about any album.  It's mostly the hipsters who are blindly angry at this album just because Kim Deal isn't on it.  But, even though I'm a newer fan of the band, I'm pretty sure I know that Kim herself has said that she is just the bassist and Frank Black is the main man.  Its true.  I never really liked the few songs that Kim wrote for the band which included the overrated 'Gigantic'.  Her absence isn't even that big a deal.  If she had been with the band, she would just be doing bass not writing the songs.  Okay, now onto this album.  The album would only sound slightly different if she was still in the band, and I personally don't care whether she comes back or not, even if she is talented and hot.  This contained some of the most emotional and accessible songs from the band.  Like some have said, this has more in common with Bossanova and Frank Blacks early solo career and that's good.  It does sound more modern.  The songs do sound more radio friendly as a whole compared to the old albums having only a few radio songs per album.  So what if almost every song sounds like it could be a single?  This is why hiipsters are annoying.  They will make an album or band seem horrid if they sound catchy or commercial or dare I say ""Mainstream"".  I loved the bands hardcore songs like 'Debaser' and 'Tame' but I loved their more melodic and soothing songs like 'Velouria' and 'Letter to Memphis' much more.  This album is full of those 'Velouria' type songs and some harder songs like the opening track 'What Goes Boom' which is vintage harder Pixies.  I can understand why there is much less of the hardcore Pixies sound.  Its simple, Frank is old and I like that hes writing more friendly and soothing songs for the band.  The songs 'Greens and Blues' and 'Indie Cindy' are so beautiful.  'Greens and Blues' particularly has such infectious twirling surf guitars and a chorus that pulls the heartstrings.  I wish that was a hit for the band.  The single 'Bagboy' has a chorus that almost pays homage to Debasers chorus.  By the way the chorus features what sounds like Kim, but isn't.  Every track on here has something special and appealing.  Its not groundbreaking, but it doesn't have to be to be considered great.  Thats what many people nowadays get wrong.  The track 'Ring the Bell' is one of the obvious attempts at a more modern style, and I like it alot.  The guitars are very U2 and heartwarming.  'Another Toe In The Ocean' is another great song full of layered melodies.  'Snake' is what a James Bond Pixies song would sound like.  It's a fast song with some great edgy guitar work and Davids awesome drumming.  People make Kim up to seem like the biggest part of the band.  Sure her bass was nice in some songs, but I'm pretty sure I liked the guitar of Santiago better.  Franks vocals are better and he IS the mastermind of the band from the beginning.  Davids drumming skills are as good as ever too.  He also even had a good lead vocal track on 'La La Love You"" from Doolittle.  When I think of a new Pixies album, I dont worry about how often I'll hear Kims backing vocals, I was actually looking forward to David doing more vocals alongside Frank.  Using a female, or anyone that sounds like a female (BagBoy) as a backing vocal on some songs are pure proof that Kims contributions are very replaceable.  If you're not a closeminded hipster who disowns anything from this band without the entire original lineup, then you'll love this album I'm sure.  If you liked Bossanova, you'll love this album.  The melodies Frank and Santiago make on these new songs are just great and stand tall next to what many consider their best albums.  Like I said, even if Kim was still in the band her contribution would be small.  She was barely noticeable in Bossanova and Trompe, yet those were hailed by critics.  This is what the Pixies would sound like today, and it sounds nice.  It's only been a year since Indie Cindy hit stores officially and it's being dismissed a lot.  I say give it 5 to 10 more years and it'll have many critical re-evaluations.  I'm not saying it will be hailed in high regards like Doolittle and Surfa, but I'm sure it will be considered another worthy classic for the band.  Hopefully another hit cult movie uses one of these new songs for a soundtrack and brings in even more new fans.  I really wanna hear more of this new Pixies in the coming years.  If Kim does ever come back, then okay to that.  If she never comes back, then okay to that too, you already know I like this new yet familiar sound the band is producing.I'll consider this the Pixies most accessible album so far.  I like it.  Sorry I ranted on too much about all the dumbfounded naysayers and Kim.  Just know this album really isn't nearly as bad as many are saying.  Give it at least 3 listens before you really decide if you like it.  I know I love it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R359WOOAH9HJUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J8JQ8GY#wasThisHelpful","R359WOOAH9HJUI","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always liked The Killers.  Sure they had hit or miss albums.  Hot Fuss is a modern classic that brought back sounds of the 80s in good infectious fashion with it's post-punk revival vibe.  Their second album had a change in tone to Heartland Rock similar to early Springsteen, which sounds good on paper but was far from their best album even though the lead single, 'When You Were Young', was one of their most memorable.  Day and Age was slightly better but still a slight downward trend for the band.  I still to this day think that Battle Born is the bands best and most underrated album.  Brandon himself recently disregarded the album, but I think that was mostly because of its lack of success compared to others.  He'll appreciate his Frankenstein monster album soon enough again.  So enough of me being typical and yapping away about The Killers and let me talk about Brandon Flowers and this new album.  Many will disagree but I thought Flowers debut solo album was a near dud.  Sure it had the hit song 'Crossfire' and some other decent songs, but it was not an amazing album.  It just didn't work for me and its no surprise that the sales of the album quickly failed.  This new album on the other hand is a huge breath of fresh air for Flowers solo career.  When I heard the lead single 'Can't Deny My Love', I was blown away but I was worried it would be the 'Crossfire' of the new album, meaning, the only good song.  As he released 3 more songs from the album I was quickly proved wrong as each one seemed to be better than the other.  I'll say this beforehand.  It's impossible to not compare this album to The Killers, because Flowers was the main identifier of the band and his voice and style hasn't really changed much in this solo release.  That being said, remember when I said that Battle Born is The Killers best album?  Well this album is even better.  Here is a track by track review.1. Dreams Come True:  Talk about a great opener!  Such a dreamy and upbeat uplifting pop gem.  The horns throughout are just classy and the chorus is so catchy it gives me a tingly feeling.  The last minute and a half is extra amazing.  Possibly the best opener of Flowers career so far, including that of his band.  10/102. Can't Deny My Love:  The lead single.  I love the song.  Its like a modern take on the classic song ""I Need A Hero"" but with male vocals.  It's an anthem for sure.  The groovy guitars, the synths, the vocals, the beats, the awesomeness.  It's a shame it hasn't hit as big as it should've.  This is the type of song that sounds like it would dominate the world but it hasn't.  Hopefully it rebounds.  Great song, but believe it or not, it's definitely not the best on the album, which is a good thing.  9.5/103. I Can Change:  This is another one of Flowers U2 inspired songs.  If you hate U2 sorry but this is a compliment to say this sounds like a lost U2 track from the early 90s.  Things start off slow before the beat and synths come in, then comes the heavenly evangelic backing vocals throughout that are similar to U2 hits like ""Ultraviolet"" and the recent ""Iris"".  This song just gets better and better.  Great inspiring love song that I'm sure would sound great in a 80s style montage in a movie about a guy trying to win back his girl!  10/104. Still Want You:  At first I wasn't that impressed with the song as a whole when it was released.  But its just so impossibly catchy.  It gets twice as good with each listen and never gives up.  The playful staccato synth thoughout just makes me feel good.  The chorus has an oldschool betty boop feel but if that sounds off putting to some don't worry, it really works.  Another song to win back an ex that you know shouldn't be an ex.  9.5/105. Between Me And You: Another early Springsteen styled song.  It really sounds like it could be among songs like 'Jungleland' and not feel out of place.  Very romantic and emotional track.  I think his vocals are the best on this track.  Sure he doesn't really reach any high notes, but its his overall performance that just impresses so much.  Everything about this song screams romance, and not corny at all.  10/106. Lonely Town:  Just wow.  What a great song this is.  It has everything.  Catchy vocals that you will have stuck in your head.  Awesome attention to detail to every instrumental aspect even if it's just something small in the background.  Great lyrics.  A perfect song.  Some will complain about one certain moment in the song that uses autotune, but ignore those bigots.  This song is something divine.  10/107. Diggin' Up The Heart: Another gem!  This one features a strangely appealing guitar riff in the beginning before it turns into a perfect synth song for the road.  There is this great background synth during the chorus in the second half similar to the opening track of Battle Born that is just pure eargasmic.  Love it.  10/108. Never Get You Right:  Can it be?  Another great song?  Yes!  This is another one that pays so much attention to detail with its little moments you'll miss on your first listen.  This song is meant for headphones or good quality car stereos.  Such a feelgood song with another chorus that you won't get out of your head.  The production is so crisp and beautiful!  10/109. Untangled Love:  Another Springsteen styled song in the verses with a little Bono styled chorus again.  I just love Flowers ability to come up with some of the most beautifully catchy chorus's.  He really knows how to use backing vocals or effects perfectly without sounding generic.  There are nice guitar moments throughout in the slight background throughout too. 9.3/1010. The Way It's Always Been:  A great closer to the album.  Very soothing.  Theres the typical Flowers light Queen styled vocals that sneak up to remind you its there.  But mostly its a laid back and relaxing.  It's definitely not as catchy as the rest but so what?  Just a nice song to sit back and enjoy.  If you don't like it at first, listen to it a few more times and it'll grow.  9/10So this was a much better album than Flowers debut solo effort.  He doesn't stray too far away from the style of The Killers and thats good.  Sorry naysayers but not all solo artists need to break away from the sound that made them loved in the first place.  This is the style of music that Brandon does best.  Honestly if he made an all out Alt Rock album that experimented with wacky sounds too much I think it would've failed.  This is just an all out catchy and beautifully epic pop rock album that does what many recently have tried but failed to do, and that is to perfectly pay homage to the sound of the 80s.  Dare I say it?  I think Flowers took the best part of 80s pop and improved it for a modern album.  Yeah I can already see many of you shaking your heads at that comment but its very true.  Don't be too hipster and realize the truth of this mans genius and musical power.  Yeah honestly this sounds like another Killers album, but much better as I've stated.  I know many will think ""But the rest of the band matter too"", and thats true, but they don't matter nearly as much as Flowers.  If his band released an album without him, it wouldn't be The Killers.  Flowers voice is the ultimate legacy holder of the band whether its with them or solo.  This album keeps that legacy going.  Hopefully this album finds the success it deserves.  It needs to be heard.  Not overlooked.  If youre a fan of his band, then you'll more than love this album.  If you're new to this mans voice and style, but love the sound of the 80s, then remember my previous comment about that.  If you love good music, you'd be doing your ears a favor in checking this album out.  It's a rare pop album that has no filler and doesn't stop in its quest to make you love it.  Highly recommended.  Its worth the money.  I'd even say you should actually purchase the CD.  Sure you can enjoy it on Spotify, but having this gem physically just makes it that much more endearing.  Your choice though.  Great album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPN64FILTELU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UXFJAJY#wasThisHelpful","R2GPN64FILTELU","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I originally bought this as a Mothers Day gift.  But upon hearing the actual CD I had to copy it onto my phone too because this is just gorgeously delivered music.  The fact that he covers popular Musical Broadway songs is a major plus.  I listen to a wide variety of genres and I'm a guy who doesn't typically veer toward this genre, but I couldn't resist the appeal of this album.  If you like his style already you'll love this album.  If you need good beautiful powerful music that will bring back memories of musicals such as Willy Wonka or even Sweeney Todd then this is a great addition to your music collection.  I never thought I'd find myself listening to Josh Groban, but here I am and proud of it.  Other men who claim false masculinity against this type of music are fake men.  This is extravagant music for anyone of all ages and gender!  Highly Recommended.  I might even say this could be nominated for Album of the Year.  I can really see this being a megahit.  Just great music you would be insane to pass up on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ7C7HFFF7DU3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCFVIDQ#wasThisHelpful","RZ7C7HFFF7DU3","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't listen to this album when it was first released, mostly because I was only 7 years old at the time.  But I did discover it in 2008 during my freshmen year in High School.  I wasn't emo or anything, but I was drawn to the emotional angst and beauty of this band at that time in my life.  But as years passed by I've stretched my musical taste to a wide variety of genres and ultimately stopped listening to the Post-Grunge/Alternative Metal genre that this band was wrongfully clustered with.  The genre was just a fad that didn't last long and was this bands rise and fall.  I was walking in a used goods store in my town and saw this album for 50 cents.  I remembered how it was a special album along with their followup ""Year of the Spider"".  So I bought it and all the nostalgia came rushing back as I rediscovered why this was a stand out in the rock music scene of the early 2000s.  Almost all bands associated with Post-Grunge or Alt Metal seem bland and generic.  There were few original bands.  But honestly it's hard to really classify the music of Cold in a single genre.  They were one of the most underrated bands in their prime.  They have made new albums since, but sadly they have crashed downhill.  This album in my opinion was their opus.  It stands out so well against other forgettable bands associated with the genre like Staind or Limp Bizkit.  The best comparison for this band would be the band HURT, but with vocals somewhat similar to Creed or Bush.  Now I mention Creed, but I'm saying this band was much more talented and original during this albums release.  The instruments are so melodic and sonic.  The vocals are so crisp.  Sometimes they have a raw nature to them and sometimes they have this gorgeously emotional delivery.  This is in my opinion one of the most beautiful alternative metal albums.  Its definitely one of the most thoughtful as well.  Here is a track by track review.1. Just Got Wicked:  The guitars are rocking right away.  The verses are grungy followed by a chorus that channels Nirvana.  Wicked opener to a classic.  9.5/102. She Said:  The song begins with a gorgeous piano that almost brings me to tears with each listen before it turns into a groovy grungy rock song.  This one features another angsty grunge chorus that just works well.  The guitars are echoey and thoughtful.  9/103. No One:  The big hit from the album.  The emotion in the vocals of this song are just unheard of.  The background vocals are so haunting and make this song one of the best from the band.  The guitar riff is hauntingly emotional as well.  A song with depressing lyrics that doesn't bum you out at all!  In fact I think this is motivating.  10/104. End Of The World:  The way Scooter delivers the verses just sounds cool.  The chorus makes it sound like it could've been a hit if released as a single.  The guitar chimes that sneak in the background throughout are nice especially with headphones.  9.5/105. Confession:  Such a beautiful guitar riff.  The verses sound so soothing in a way before the rocking chorus hits.  Should've been a single in my opinion as well.  The power in the vocals complimented by the guitars is just perfection.  Another one of the bands best.  10/106. t's All Good:  Another example of the band complimenting soft relaxing guitar and laid back vocals with rocking choruses.  This is an anthem that I wish more people knew!  Its all good!  9.5/107. Send In The Clowns:  One of the heavier songs on the album featuring Aaron Lewis of Staind.  I still think this band deserved more fame than them though.  This is included to satisfy the Nu Metal fans back when the genre was big.  The chorus is similar to 'Just Got Wicked'.  Its a good hard song to work out to.  The ending with the screams of 'Send in the Clowns' isn't that appealing anymore.  There's a reason Nu Metal only lasted a few years.  Still a good song!  8.5/108. Same Drug:  Back to what the band did best, grungy artsy emotional ballads with rocking anthem choruses.  The bridge section features some overlapping vocals that are trippy but nice.  The guitars are just so great!  9/109. Anti-Love Song:  The angriest song on the album.  I don't listen to music like this anymore on a regular, but I can't resist the appeal of this song.  It's so angry but it doesn't sound too over the top like screamo or some heavy metal vocals.  Great song to work out to.  I'd compare the nature of the vocals in this song to Trent Rexnor in Nine Inch Nails 'Downward Spiral' album.  9.5/1010. Witch:  The guitar screeches through the verses and rocks through the chorus.  The female vocal howls are haunting but just work so well accompanied by Scooters rocking crooning.  The last half of the song are the best part.  9/1011. Sick Of Man:  The lyrics are depressing but don't confuse this with emo at all.  I find this to be a very introspective song lyrically.  The instrumentation of this song is further proof of why this band stood out from the multiple copies of copies of bands that crowded the scene when this band was at their prime.  This sounds like if The Cure tried to do Alternative Metal and succeeded.  10/1012. Outerspace:  Another awesome rocker of a song.  The guitar riff just gets the blood flowing switching from screeching to twirling in the background to plain rocking out.  The bridge contains an awesome Cure-y guitar riff before rocking out till the end of the song.  Oh and as always Scooter just brings the goodies with his vocal style.  This is the best all out rocker on the album.  10/1013.  Bleed:  After 12 emotional rock anthems comes this acoustic ballad to calm down the vocals.  This is a very very beautiful song about the love for music.  This just feels so relaxing and inspiring somehow.  Great swan song for the album.  10/10So this is without a doubt the Colds masterpiece.  It was appealing enough to open the door for their mainstream success at the time and different enough to set them apart from the dozens of bands during the time all trying to recycle the same style.  Sadly those other bands who were much less talented(Creed, Puddle of Mudd, Nickelback) prevented this band from really reaching superstardom.  Their album after this ""Year of the Spider"" is their close second best album.  It hit big with the song 'Stupid Girl' and contained even more melody and emotion.  Sadly after that album their key guitarists left the band, one joining Evanescence.  That really put a major dent in the bands chances at becoming a household name.  In fact, even though some people like the bands recent albums, I'm telling you they seem to have lost their way and appeal.  This is a classic.  As a guy who abandoned the post-grunge/alt metal bands like most for indie rock and 80s synth revival sounds among other genres, I'm telling you this band was a diamond in the rough of the genre.  Seeing the cheap price here on amazon for this album and ""Year of the Spider"" I suggest you purchase both if you need a reminder of the sound that almost dominated rock in the early 2000s.  I'm glad I rediscovered this album after all these years and I hope many others do and keep it alive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17GDJ09O43KVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004XQZC#wasThisHelpful","R17GDJ09O43KVL","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Mumford and Sons first album.  I only somewhat liked their second album despite it surprisingly winning Album of the Year.  I never really cared much more for the band.  In fact I didn't even care to watch their music videos so I actually forgot what they even looked like.  When the band announced that they would be going 'electric' I was excited.  I said I loved their first album, but I would take synths and electric guitars over banjos any day.  So my first thought was that they were going to follow in the steps of Arcade Fire who went into disco indie rock territory with the post Album of the Year album Reflektor.  The lead single ""Believe"" was released and my hopes for a Mumford Reflektor went out the window.  I loved the song but it didn't seem worth the hype.  They also released ""The Wolf"" which was also a decent song but far from their claims of real 'electric'.  I didn't discount the album yet though.  I wanted to know for sure what the band considered electric.  So the album finally came out and I decided to preview it a few times on Spotify before considering buying the actual CD.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  I listened to it through 5 times and it just didn't click.  They went sorta electric, but somehow they got even more boring.  Some of the hooks in the songs are catchy but very forgettable.  The lyrics are so cheesy and cringe worthy most of the time.  The only decent songs that save this from getting a 1 star rating from me are 'Believe', 'The Wolf'', 'Hot Gates', 'Only Love' and 'Snake Eyes'.  But even those songs are forgettable aside from the lead single.  Also note that only one of those songs isn't a single.  I really don't remember any of the hooks.  I said some of them were catchy, but I can't sing a note of any of the songs if you paid me to.  The so called electric guitar riffs were so bland.  This will sound hipster, but its also true, the band has become generic and boring.  This isn't them experimenting.  This is them preparing for their downfall.  Not all bands have everlasting success.  I predict this will be the beginning of the fading of Mumford.  This album might do well in its first weeks on sale but it will fall off quick.  The band needs to really concentrate if they wanna get up from this slump.  I can see some people enjoying and even loving this album, but that doesn't mean its good.  I see more people hating it.  I tried to like it and not be part of the group, but its hard when the album really is as bad as people say.  If you're a hardcore fan of the band, then I dont know what to tell you.  You could gamble a few bucks on this album, but I suggest you listen to it online first and see if you like it first.  Like I said, some people will love it, but more people will hate it.  Proceed into this album with caution, especially if you're a fan of good music.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YM0MMXMPPELA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6AYEB0#wasThisHelpful","R2YM0MMXMPPELA","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tried to give them a chance after Adam left.  I tried to not be one of those who automatically dismisses someone for a line up change like this.  I really tried.  But the band just isn't the same.  They shouldn't even use the Three Days Grace name anymore with this new guy and sound.  People try to say bands need to experiment and explore new sounds.  That's true.  But at least when most bands experiment and explore, they keep their core sound intact.  This new guy is the ultimate downfall of TDG.  It's true.  Hardcore fans will stick around by the handful only.  But after this album, say goodbye to anyone caring about the bands new material.  If bands like System of a Down or Disturbed or Korn or any of these bands changed their lead vocalist, their would be an outcry.  Adams voice was a trademark to TDG.  This is full of 'ok' at best songs that sound like they would be hits in 2002.  Like I said, I tried to give this new guy a chance.  He just isn't good.  When you heard Adam you knew it was TDG.  Half the time when I hear these new songs I forget I'm even listening to this band anymore.  I've listened to the album 5 times and it doesnt work.  I'm glad I didn't buy it.  If you simply are one of the people who can't let go of the band no matter what because youre a mega hardcore fan who can't move on, then you should buy this.  If you like Three Days Grace, stay away from this.  This is one of those examples where its okay to use the phrase ""their old stuff was better"" and not sound like an overbearing hipster.  This is a band trying too hard to move on just to make money even if it's with horrible music.  This is a prime example of when a lead singer becomes so important to a band that they matter more than the rest in brutal honesty.  Take a look at the new Breaking Benjamin song, another band of similar genres.  The only remaining member of that band is the lead singer and their new stuff sounds amazing and refreshing.  This is very bad.  Goodbye Three Days Grace.  Live off of your royalties from previous albums and songs that you should really thank Adam for.  If you like good music, for the goodness of your sanity, stay far far away from this failing record.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V5XZ9SIPBTOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVYNSRE#wasThisHelpful","R1V5XZ9SIPBTOO","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most so far, I discovered Future Islands from their masterpiece breakthrough album ""Singles"" and their amazing showstopping performance on Letterman.  They had this unique but familiar sound that was irresistible.  The lead singer had this raspy soulful voice accompanied by lavish synths and lush guitars with nice 80's style beats.  It was truly a career changing album for them and I'm glad it shot them into the spotlight.  It's also interesting for me to know that they are from a town near my small town which is rare.  So I listened to Singles over and over without even thinking of their past work.  But one day I couldn't help it and had to check out their early albums.  I am so happy that I did because this album and ""On The Water"" are amazing in their own rights.  I would pick this album between the two as the better though.  I couldn't find a copy anywhere in the US so I had to order it on here.  I controlled myself not to listen to it on Spotify or any other site before it arrived.  It was well worth the wait.  After a few listens already here is a track by track review.1. Walking Through That Door:  The album starts off quick with this emotional song for the dance floor.  The synth riff in this is simple but impossibly catchy.  Sam's singing is on spot as expected.  Great intro song to a great album.  10/102.  Long Flight:  Another perfect synth riff with rolling drums and bass.  Sam has a different sound to his vocals on this.  It's almost like he's trying to imitate Elvis, but failing, and sounding great at the same time.  The final repetition of the chorus hits this note that is just pure gold.  Great song to listen to while thinking over a relationship.  10/103.  Tin Man:  This band just keeps bringing the awesome synth riffs.  Sam does another uniquely raspy thing to his vocals on this.  My girlfriend jokingly said his voice almost resembles Dracula.  It's a funny thought, but when listening to this song, it kinda works.  There is a sneaky guitar in the background too and I love it.  I just wish it was longer!  9.5/104.  An Apology:  Right off the bat this sounds like a companion song to ""Long Flight"".  They really sound like they should've been placed back to back with each other.  It's such a relaxing song.  The synth in this one almost resembles a magical flute its so enchanting.  Again Sams raspy crooning voice works well against this relaxing beautiful backdrop of a song.  10/105.  In Evening Air: Usually I don't really like interludes especially on short albums.  But this one was just so good.  It was soothing and hauntingly beautiful.  It went by fast and led into the next song so well.  9/106.  Swept Inside:  This song has more guitars upfront with the synths in the background.  I'd compare this instrumentally to The Cure.  The vocals are more relaxed on this one even though the song is very upbeat.  The final 90 seconds of the song have Sam repeating a refrain that just sounds like a lullaby.  Another great great song.  10/107.  Inch Of Dust:  Can this band do no wrong?  Another amazing song?  I think so.  The way the instruments of this song work together is just insane.  It's like a small orchestra.  Another great song for pining over a relationship.  Just perfect.  It does end abruptly though.  10/108.  Vireo's Eye:  This song has a speedy vibe to it.  This sounds like the perfect song for a movie where the main character hurries to their lovers place full of passion only to find that they are with someone else.  It's a sad song delivered in a happy way.  Very nicely done.  10/109.  As I Fall:  I always hold higher standards for the closing songs of any album.  Usually I feel disappointed, but not with this.  Such a beautiful and tragic song.  Not only is this the best song on this perfect album, but it's the longest too.  So more to enjoy.  The atmosphere is just so haunting and heartbreaking.  But I love it!  The song ends with 2 minutes of gorgeous textured music that slowly fades.  It really feels like the ending to a movie that you never get tired of watching.  10/10So this ended up being one of the best albums I've ever heard.  I don't say that lightly as I've listened to many albums from genres all over.  I'm glad this band got noticed with their Singles album.  If not for that I wouldn't have ever heard this masterpiece.  Hopefully their next album takes the band even further so more people check out this album and ""On The Water"".  If you are here because you found out about Future Islands because of their newer albums and want to know if they had that spunk early in their career, then look no further.  This album will no doubt be considered a classic in years to come.  It already is one for me.  As I've said, I've listened to many albums so far in my life and I can say proudly that this is instantly in my top 10 all time favorites.  If you're a Future Islands fan, then this album is a must.  I might even say I like this better than Singles.  If you are new to the band, then this is a must as well.  If you just like good music to take you to special places every time you hear it, then this album is a definite must.  Highly recommended.  I just know this will be highly regarded and in high demand very soon!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AVBB3JEC5HO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003D0ZNDI#wasThisHelpful","R3AVBB3JEC5HO","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not trying to sound hipster even though it may sound like it when I say I will always think ""Transatlanticism"" is the bands greatest album.  Through the years after that album the band still made great music with each release, but I always found myself secretly wanting another album that hit me in all the same ways as the aforementioned album.  Then comes this album.  This collection really sounds like a spiritual successor to the big T.  It left me with that same feeling of raw emotion.  Feeling sad like I just experienced a break up, but at the same time hopeful even if only for a bit.  I always thought that ""Black Sun"" wasn't as great of a lead single as others from the band.  It grew on me, but then I heard the radio edit of the song and was even more disappointed.  The radio edit cut out a good minute worth of the best moments of the song.  So if you're a newcomer and you're here because of that radio edit, then I assure you the album version has more to offer!  Other instant classics include the should-be-lead-single song ""No Room In Frame"" which is a great break up song of course as most of the songs are.  This song contains guitar moments very very reminiscent of the big T's elegant hopeless style that I loved.  ""You've Haunted Me All My Life"" is a beautifully tragic musical account of failure to keep a relationship kindled in the vein of ""Tiny Vessels"", which is their best song ever in my opinion.  But unlike that song, now the narrator is the one who ""don't mean a thing"" to her.  ""The Ghosts Of Beverly Drive"" is just infectious even if the chorus gets a bit repetitious.  ""Everything's A Ceiling"" is an undeniably catchy song about, you guessed it, unrequited love, a topic that will never grow old in music!  The topic of being far away from the one you love while she/he is with someone else constantly replaying in your head is just so sad and true for many.  ""Little Wanderer"" has a great REM style hook about it.  ""El Dorado"" is a glider of a song with soaring vocals and more great tragically beautiful instrumentation as you'd expect from the band.  The final song ""Binary Sea"" is another example of the bands epic song per album like the big T title track and Codes and Keys epic sad anthem ""Unobstructed Views"".  Though this one is notably shorter, but nonetheless epic and gorgeous.  I didn't mention every single song but I assure you they all have something special about them.  If you are going through a break up or divorce, you'll find this album helpful in coping.  Even if you aren't in a sad state of mind this album has the ability to catch your attention and not bum you out but instead have you hooked on its beauty and execution.  This isn't the best album from the band, but it's still great.  I suggest putting this album and Transatlanticism in a playlist together and hitting shuffle.  The songs on both albums work so well together.  Or just listen to it by itself.  If you're a fan of the band you'll love it or you wont.  If you're new to the group you'll love it or you wont.  I can't say everyone will love the album, but I can say if you give it a chance that after a few listens it might be one of your favorites.  I dont know, just preview the songs, especially the ones I mentioned, and if you like what you hear then I strongly recommend you buying this album.P.S.  Too bad this is the last album with Chris Walla.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RJZZEHVFSQX9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SJ9UEGE#wasThisHelpful","R1RJZZEHVFSQX9","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't been a fan of the band since the beginning. I love the band but they were never in my top 10 favorite all time music artists. Honestly I discovered them through their album ""We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank"". I loved the nautical theme and sound of it. I still considered it my favorite release from the band. Then I listened to ""Good News For People Who Love Bad News"". I had known the hit song ""Float On"" but never really looked into the band before. Many consider it one of their better albums, but I personally only liked half of the songs. I then worked my way backward through the bands discography. Their landmark album ""The Lonesome Crowded West"" was my second favorite. I'm sure many hardcore fans will strongly disagree and say it's the greatest thing from the band, but that's just my personal opinion. So after initially discovering the bands music, they seemed to stop making music. I would eagerly wait for the bands next move for 3 years, which is how long most albums are released apart from each other. I eventually virtually gave up on any new material from the band around 2012 as many other bands and artists were releasing great albums from different genres. Then suddenly near the end of 2014 their was news of a new single ""Lampshades on Fire"". All of my hope was instantly reignited as I heard the thumping pop rocker of a track knowing a new album would follow shortly after. The song proved to be another hit and I'm glad the band has showed they can still be relevant in the constantly changing music scene. In the months leading up to the album they released 4 more swell songs which only made my anticipation even greater. I waited 8 years for this album, and I am not one bit disappointed with the outcome. Here is a track by track review.1. Strangers To Ourselves: This is such a relaxing introduction song. The violins throughout are heavenly. The vocals are just gorgeous along with the faint guitars throughout. Just beautiful. 10/102. Lampshades On Fire: I'm sure if you're new to the band this is the reason you're here. This was a worthy lead single that almost explores all of the sounds the band has experimented with in their career. It's a rock song good for parties with lyrics that mean so much more. Brock showcases his distinct lispy ranty vocals with sprinkles of his more elegant singing in such great fashion. Just great. 9.5/103. Sh*t In Your Cut: Nice title right? This song starts out slowish with plucking drums before the guitars steal the show. The vocals are more of the mix between Brocks chanting and singing. The song ends with great group vocals that the band does best. 9.5/104. Pistol: This song seems to be getting hate from many. Many have gone as far as to call it one of the bands worst. I can understand why many dislike it. The vocal effect used in the song can sound annoying at first. The style of the song is very different for the band sounding like a rip off of 80s Depeche Mode. I however got over it and actually think the song is fun and gets better with repetition. Not their best, but not horrible at all. 8/105. Ansel: Back to typical MM. This is a glowing track with colorful melodies and a nice guitar riff. The song sounds almost tropical in a way but has dark lyrics. Its a short song but it such a profound lasting effect to it. 9/106. The Ground Walks, With Time In A Box: Another interesting title. This is another of the songs released leading up to the album. The band takes a stylistic detour into disco rock. I thought it sounded similar to the style Arcade Fire explored in Reflektor. The song is full of funky and spacious guitars and horns and twists and turns. Around the 2 minute mark the chorus hits with what can be described as entrancing and very original. I wish it was repeated more than twice though. A friend of mine called this one of the best songs he's ever heard, and that's coming from a guy who wasn't familiar with the band. At 6 minutes this song flies by with style. 10/107. Coyotes: Another slower song. It was released shortly after 'Lampshades' with a very adorable video of a coyote. The soft guitar riff is nice but the chorus is just elegantly delivered. It almost brings about tears with its beauty. I'll compare this to the previous albums 'Little Motel' but this is honestly better. Just a beautiful dreamy song all around. One of the best from the band. 10/108. Pups To Dust: This song returns to the sound of earlier MM with its relaxing westernized guitars. It really sounds like a lost track from 'Lonesome Crowded West'.  It's another anthem for the band with lyrics that mean so much. The mood of this song is melancholy but not in a bad way. It's another dreamy song. 9/109. Sugar Boats: This song returns to the nautical style of their last album with some carnival sounds as well but without Johnny Marr(Sadly). The guitars are nice and rocking still and interesting horns are prominent throughout. Its a fun song from beginning to end. 9/1010. Wicked Campaign: This song almost dives into heartland rock territory but maintains the indie sound. It's a very catchy song of course. The chorus has that U2 stadium appeal. It's a song that leaves me with a feeling of being inspired. 9/1011. Be Brave: The song title says it all. The vocals are more of the chanting with the quiet laid back singing sliding in now and again. Reminds me of their song ""Florida"" just a bit. 8.5/1012. God Is An Indian And You're An A**hole: One of the longer more interesting titles, but the shortest song. The title might offend some, but the song is executed nicely. Not one of my favorites though. I'm sure many others will like it more. 7.8/1013. The Tortoise And The Tourist: The trademark guitar style of early MM is back on here again. Its another rocker with a haunting tone. It manages to be a bit harsh and melodic at the same time. The chorus is strangely addicting in a way that pumps you up. 8.5/1014. The Best Room: One of my all time favorites. I've replayed it more than 100 times before the albums released and never grow tired of it. For a time it became my gym soundtrack. The lyrics are reportedly about a UFO experience that led to a certain tacky hotel. The guitars are great and instant classic riffs. The vocals switch between chanting and singing perfectly. It's a beautiful rocking song. The bridge section with intertwined vocals is infectious. I would compare this to ""Steam Engenius"" but catchier. One of the bands best. 10/1015. Of Course We Know: This is a dark toned closer for the album. Very apocalyptic in a way. I compared the style to Sigur Ros but with vocals from Brock. The guitar style on this one is very Post Rock. When I first heard it I didn't think it was amazing. But now I think its the perfect ending. The background vocals compliment the lead singing in a strangely touching way. It's a powerful outro song. 9/10So this album was a nice reminder of how great this band is. This is a musical journey as cliche as that sounds. It manages to be strange yet appealing at the same time throughout. You will need to be able to devote your full attention to fully enjoy all of the intricate aspects of the songs. I know I will continue to find new things in each song. I might even find a new favorite in a song that I previously didn't think was the best. It's a great soundtrack for driving or just background music at home depending on your mood. Some have said the album seems too long. I think the longer the better honestly. More music to digest! I won't say this is my favorite album from the band fully, but I can say for now it's a tie with this and ""We Were Dead"". If you're already a MM fan you'll either love this or at least somewhat like it. If you're new to the band and you liked 'Lampshades' you'll love the album. If you like good new music then give this a listen and see if you like it. 8 years and not only is this album worth it, but the band says a follow up album is on its way. Hopefully as great as this album if not better!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CIM13KXMVU8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXRNCEK#wasThisHelpful","R12CIM13KXMVU8","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when ""Night Visions"" first came out.  Imagine Dragons was virtually unknown.  I purchased the album the day it came out partially as an impulse buy and partially because of the sleeper hit song ""It's Time"".  The album had a familiar yet unique catchy sound that I really enjoyed.  They aren't in my top 10 favorite artists, but I thoroughly liked them immediately.  Then the song 'Radioactive' became one of the biggest hits of 2013 and propelled the band into super stardom.  I digged the song, but I honestly never really loved it like most.  Mostly because it just didn't fit the style of the majority of the other songs.  Some other bands even rode along with the success of the band with similar sounds such as American Authors.  There were also the detractors.  People who labeled the band the next ""Nickelback"" in a negative way.  Needless to say, I was anxious for their next move.  Their second album would decide whether the band was a fluke or in for the long run.  Finally they released their lead single for their second disc.  ""I Bet My Life"" had the same sound as many of the songs from NV but with a slight soulful backdrop.  I enjoyed it nonetheless.  They released another song titled ""Gold"" which I was disappointed in initially because of its electronic sound trying to emulate ""Radioactive"" but just sounding much less memorable.  I was starting to not feel that interested in buying the new album in fear of it having too much of the electronic 'Radioactive' ripoff sound.  Before I spoke too soon they released yet another song which was said to be the official second single ""Shots"".  The title suggests party shots, but the songs lyrics turned out to be so deeply beautiful and infectiously delivered in a dance rock manner that I was excited again for Smoke and Mirrors.  Well when the album finally arrived I was actually feeling questionable about buying it again, partially due to the long wait for it.  I wasn't the only one apparently since the Best Buy didn't even bother to take the album out of the storage yet on its release day until I asked about it.  But I still bought it, like Night Visions, as an impulse buy.  I read many mixed critics reviews feeling like I had wasted money before I even listened to it.  I'm glad I can say that most critics are dead wrong about the album.  Sure it's not the most amazing thing ever, but it's still a good modern album that I'm positive many will come to love.  Here is my track by track review.1.  Shots:  This is a great dance rock track.  I'm sure this will be a hit at clubs and parties.  The lyrics aren't happy or sad.  They are somewhat gloomy in a nice way.  The guitars are nice.  There are the typical Imagine Dragon chants throughout but the slower delivery of some of the verses are the best for me.  The chorus will pull on your heart strings and make you wanna get up and dance.  Add this to your workout playlist.  Great start to the album.  9.5/102.  Gold:  I said earlier I was initially disappointed with this song when it was first released.  But I've grown to like it.  Still not among my favorites though.  I do like the whistle hook.  The lyrics do have some good meaning.  The chorus wasn't my favorite either but it still manages to get stuck in my head.  The guitar toward the end is a highlight.  Not a great song but not bad at all.  8/103.  Smoke and Mirrors:  The song starts off slow and gentle like 'Demons' before exploding into a somewhat unexplosive catchy chorus.  The final two minutes were a nice surprising and soothing ending to the track.  This song will get better and better with repeated listens.  The guitar solo is really nice!  Something you haven't heard from this band.  Gives it a classic rock feel with modern touches!  9/10.4.  I'm So Sorry:  People have compared this track musically to The Black Keys.  Its hard to deny it because if you played this song to me I wouldn't guess it was Imagine Dragons, but it is.  But then again, whose to say what sounds like ID and what doesn't this early in their career.  It's a nice rocking song.  The bridge part with what sounds like female background vocals is the best part.  This is the type of song you'd hear in a action movie trailer.  Another workout playlist worthy song.  8.5/105.  I Bet My Life:  This song didn't hit big leading up to the albums release.  Well not by ID standards.  But it's grown on me so much I'm surprised it hasn't become such a mega hit yet.  I'm confident that this song will have longevity to become a big hit, as ""Radioactive"" didn't hit big until long after it's initial release.  The chorus is impossible not to have on replay in your head.  The soulful background mixed with folk guitar and a rocking chorus are the recipe for a great rock anthem!  Very personal lyrics for Dan but also very universal at the same time.  Great song that sounds even better among the rest of the album.  9.5/106.  Polaroid:  This is a nice playful song with a nice melody throughout.  There's a hip hop feel to the delivery of the verses.  There are also nice 'doo doo doo' moments throughout and group vocals.  People seem to look down on constant ""whoahhh""s in songs nowadays but this song uses them well.  The soulful bridge section till the end sounds like something from a Hozier track.  Some have said this song is a filler but I like it.  Just a nice feelgood song.  9/107.  Friction:  There are nice Middle Eastern style guitars in this one you don't hear often in music nowadays.  Brings back memories of System of a Down.  The yelled vocals almost remind me of Michael Jacksons vocal delivery.  This is a rocker.  It changes tempo throughout nicely.  Another addition to your gym routine as well.  9/108.  It Comes Back To You:  This song has a great guitar hook thats similar to U2, more specifically their song ""When I Look At The World"".  Thats meant as a compliment.  Immediately this is a candidate for hit single.  Probably the catchiest song on the album!  I just love this song.  The vocals.  The guitars.  The 90s laid back drums.  The production.  I hope they release this as a single.  I hope it doesn't become this albums ""Amsterdam"", the best track from their debut that wasn't released as a single.  You wont get this out of your head!  10/109.  Dream:  Leave it to this band to follow a great song with another great song.  This is a hauntingly beautiful ballad.  The chorus is just delivered in a heartbreakingly gorgeous manner.  Their are string instrument moments that just add to the beauty.  An instant classic.  10/1010.  Trouble:  This sounds like it was Bruce Springsteen inspired and I like it.  It doesn't fit well with the rest of the tracks stylistically, but it's still good.  Its a really fun and uplifting song.  Not the best, but still nice.  8.5/1011.  Summer:  The title says it all.  This is a great summer track.  It's another dance-rock track with a nice eerie effect in the hook.  It really does feel like a song to listen to while driving through a summer sunset.  I didn't think the chorus was special at first but like many great ones it grew on me soon after.  The guitars are nice as always too.  9/1012.  Hopeless Opus:  The verses are hip hop tinted and playful like in 'Polaroid'.  I think someone else also said this and I agree, that this sounds like a male version of Lorde in the chorus.  Guitar solo is a highlight of course.  This is just another decent feelgood song.  Nothing wrong with that.  8.5/1013.  The Fall:  The moment this song opened I knew I was in for a great closer to the album!  This is the perfect song to end the album like a credits song.  There's something tragic yet uplifting about the music and lyrics and vocal delivery that works so well.  This is a progressive pop rock song.  It also has a beautiful cinematic feel as it builds to its climax.  I'm glad this track lasts the entire 6 plus minutes.  It's a very gorgeous ending that leaves you wanting more. 10/10So this album left me wondering what was going on in most of the critics heads who gave scathing negative reviews for this album.  They seem to hate catchy stadium music in a biased manner.  I would take this over some of the trash some critics hail as great albums.  This isn't the next 'Nickelback'(which is a horrible comparison), this is Imagine Dragons and they have made another classic pop rock album.  I might even say it's better as a whole than Night Visions.  Night Visions had at least 4 tracks I would skip.  If you liked their first album, you will definitely more than enjoy this album.  It's another different yet familiar sound for the band.  If you aren't even a fan of the band and just like good music then this is recommended.  Sure its not the best album of all time.  But it's not trying to be.  It's trying to be an accessible album with great hooks and fun melodies with some dark moments sprinkled around.  I'm not saying all critics are wrong.  But in the case with this album and plenty of others, they did get it wrong.  We all have opinions, but to trash this album the way some have is just unbelievable.  I went into this disc expecting something horrible based on critic reviews and I was surprised at how much I loved it.  This isn't a sophomore slump, well unless it ends up bombing in sales, which I doubt will happen.  I'm not forcing anyone to buy this album, but if you like good music and are willing to pay for it, then this is the album for you.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXV47HFW45PDW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QXKB7X0#wasThisHelpful","RXV47HFW45PDW","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a newer fan of The Smiths.  I was born in 1993 so sadly I didn't grow up with them.  I'm also not a hipster like most people my age who know the band.  I honestly discovered them through the movie 500 Days of Summer when their song ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" was used perfectly in it.  But at the time of discovery I still didn't really listen to the band other than just a few songs like their singles.  Then suddenly in 2014 I had an urge to really listen to the bands catalog.  I read about the bands formation and career and break up.  I listened to their album ""The Queen Is Dead"" and loved it.  That was just the beginning for me.  I decided to give Morrisseys solo career a chance and when I went to my local used goods store I found them to have one album from Morrissey which I impulsively bought.  That was my first Morrissey/Smiths related purchase.  It was ""You Are The Quarry"".  I had no prior knowledge of the album and I was blown away by its beauty, humor and amazing execution.  I then ordered ""Vauxhall And I"", another Morrissey solo album, which became one of my instant top 10 favorite albums of all time.  I was not far from done.  I listened to a mix of The Smiths first two and fourth albums and Morrisseys ""Bona Drag"" and loved them.  Then I was stricken with whether I wanted to order ""Hatful of Hollow"" or ""Louder Than Bombs""(or why not both?), and I decided on this one after giving Hatful and listen on Spotify.  24 tracks and over 70 minutes?  I think yes.  So now I have LTB and I've listened to it 5 times already so far.  I can confidently say this is now my favorite release from The Smiths, yes even more than TQID!The collection is too long for me to give my usual track by track review, but let me just tell you that every single track is a hit with me.  I never find myself skipping over any of these songs the way I eventually do with most albums.  My favorites are the incredibly catchy ""Ask"" with its nice background effect and singalong chorus, the relaxing steamroller ""Half A Person"", the quick but infectious ""William..."", and the pop masterpiece ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" among others.  There are so many good songs I am constantly discovering more and more with repeated listens.  Even the cover song ""Golden Lights"", which some consider the dud on the album, is actually really catchy and great in my opinion.  The two best slow relaxer songs for me are ""Please Please Please..."" and ""Asleep"" which ends the album ethereally making the ending feel like the end to a good dream, except unlike most dreams, you can actually repeat this as many times as you can.  Johnny Marrs guitarwork throughout is top notch.  My favorite example of his guitar skills are on ""Rubber Ring"", ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" and ""This Night Has Opened My Eyes"", but his craft is evident throughout as well!  Morrissey is just amazing of course.  He has such an uncanny ability to command any melody given to him with humorous and meaningful lyrics.  He can go from his usual baritone to falsetto with ease and divine skill.  I actually like these songs over many of the songs on their actual studio albums.  The song ""Back To The Old House"" is one of the bands most gorgeously tragic ballads.  This is the bands essential release.  The album that I'm sure is able to convert any music lover into a fan.  It is fun.  It is emotional.  It is amazing.  You'll find yourself unable to get many of these songs out of your head throughout the day.  This isn't 80s music.  This is timeless music.  For fans of good music that will never get old.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B5OC4F57FZOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002LBH#wasThisHelpful","R3B5OC4F57FZOT","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I still remember my first encounter with MM music.  It was in 1998 when I was only five years old.  My oldest brother was showing me the music video for 'The Dope Show'.  I was traumatized by the appearance of The Goddess Bunny toward the end whom my brother had convinced me was 'Bloody Mary'.  Well you can imagine I steered away from MM music as I grew up after that only really knowing and liking their song 'Beautiful People'.  But in 2011 I suddenly had the urge to look into the band after learning that one of my favorite musicians Trent Reznor had worked closely with the band early in their career.  I began reading about the bands history and the true nature of their songs.  I'm glad I suddenly gave this band a chance that year as I listened to each and every album in a weeks time during my time in Miami, a city that Brian Warner had spent some time in before truly forming the band.  I loved his Trilogy albums.  I liked Grotesque.  I only subtly enjoyed his recent albums after that.  'Born Villain'  was a step in the right direction for the band for me.  But it still lacked in my opinion.  I enjoy music of a wide variety from rock to rap to dance to pop.  To put that in perspective, the next album I'm looking forward to in 2015 is from Modest Mouse, a very different genre from MM.  Recently their haven't been many good metal or hard rock albums in the past few years.  It was almost like the genre was dying.  The last somewhat hardcore music album I purchased was NIN 2013 album.  Then in 2014 when I heard the single 'Third Day of a Seven Day Binge' I was instantly back on track.  Too many people dismiss Marilyn Manson immediately just based on his appearance and costumes.  But most people have no idea how intricate and powerful his lyrics are and how impressive the bands instrumentations can be.  If someone saw me on the street they wouldn't guess that I listen to this band, but that doesn't matter.  What matters is how solid this album turned out to be.  But I must say I do like Mansons attire in the cover of the album, which I also think is the best album cover of their career.  It's almost Joker--esque.  Though I've said I listened to all of the bands albums, this is honestly my first actual album I've purchased from them, and it was worth it.  Here is my track by track review.1.  Killing Strangers:  As Brian has stated, this song showcases the blues inspired style right away.  The guitars are rocking throughout with some of that haunting vibe the band is known for.  Great powerful vocals too.  9.5/102.  Deep Six:  I honestly didn't really like this song at first when it was released.  But like most hit singles, it grew on me like a parasite.  This album version with its slow intro build up was nice and made it a much better song to me.  Great lyrics.  Great industrial track that I hope brings back the popularity of this genre!  9/103.  Third Day of a Seven Day Binge:  One of the best songs by the band ever.  Definitely the best track from them in over 10 years too in my opinion.  This song is just sexy.  Mysterious.  Brooding.  The raspy crooning by Warner is just infectious.  The guitar work is perfect.  Like many are saying, this is one of the prime examples on the album of how mature and evolved the band is even without its original members.  10/104.  The Mephistopheles of Los Angeles:  I like to think I'm intelligent, but I really did have to look up the word in the title.  I'm liking the guitar style of this album already!  Warners vocals are laid back for such a rocking song, but I love it.  9/105.  Warship My Wreck:  Gotta love the wordplay.  This one starts slow and brooding before suddenly the band somewhat kicks off in this steamrolling way.  Its really nice on the ears.  The vocals are some of the most emotionally powerful I've heard in this band in a long time.  This one reminds me of some of NINs more apocalyptic work musically.  The final minute features some haunting group vocal work that just works well too.  Great midpoint song.  10/106.  Slave Only Dreams To Be King:  The song begins with a sample of a speech, and ironically the vocal style of this one is almost speech-like.  Another great industrial track meant to be played loud though.  Great pumping song to add to your workout playlist as well.  Deep lyrics that showcase much more than what the title suggests!  9/107.  The Devil Beneath My Feet:  I read a critic compare this album slightly to the band Interpol in its sound.  This song is the song that makes that comparison almost legit.  I wouldn't mind hearing this dance rocker in a club.  There is a nice electronic area within the song that surprisingly works amazingly well!  Don't be fooled again by the title, this is a deep song with great meaning and some of the best guitar work from MM in a while.  I would choose this as a single.  10/108.  Birds of Hell Awaiting:  Aside from MMs appearance, it's these titles that make some people think this is a satanic band which is entirely false.  The lyrics will state otherwise.  Even though this has haunting hell-ish howling within the song, the song is still good.  The bass is nice similar just a bit to that of The Dope Show.  The guitar riff is very bluesy and nice.  Not my favorite, but it could grow on me more.  8.5/109.  Cupid Carries A Gun:  Infectious and creepy good.  There is even more of that raspy crooning very similar to Third Day Binge.  There is even a nice bell toll throughout.  This song just works all around.  One of the best on the album and will surely be another great single.  Also another great workout playlist addition!  9.5/1010.  Odds of Even:  A slow burner closer and its great as expected.  Just masterful guitar work throughout.  Things almost reach orchestral quality toward the end.  Epic end to this unexpected classic.  9/10As everyone is saying, this is much more mature than you'd expect from this band.  Each song works as a piece to a puzzle.  This album would be incomplete if any instance of the record was gone.  I know I've praised the vocals and guitars throughout, but I almost forgot to mention the great overall production from Tyler Bates which gave the album an almost cinematic feel.  Tyler Bates is a very up and coming name in the film industry with his most popular film score being of Guardians of the Galaxy, the score, not the old school soundtrack.  He is also responsible for the great bluesy guitar riffs throughout.  Hopefully Bates is here to stay with the band in the long run.  It's rare that a band that peaked in the 90s would put out such a masterpiece nearly 20 years later when most bands would be long forgotten.  I would compare this comeback to the recent comeback David Bowie had in 2013.  Many years from now, this will be one of the albums that people will remember this band for.  Now this album will be divided with negative to positive reviews.  There will be the people who are stuck in the 90s and haven't matured through the years as Warner has.  People who haven't grown up to put it more bluntly.  They will probably trash this softer more old school rock sound.  Then there will be the people who did grow up and will appreciate the new mature nature of this middle aged Warner.  Then there will be the people who have no idea about MM from the 90s and will discover a new favorite in this album.  I can see people who didn't like MM like this album.  This is a good album to start with whether you listen to his other work or just enjoy this album as a standalone.  For fans of good music.  But I will say that this isn't an easy listen even though it is very melodic.  I recognize how great it is, but at the same time it isn't the type of album you can binge listen to on repeat for hours.  This is a good but exhausting experience.  Listen at your own precaution, but enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNI6YLWQUU0EP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEJG1K0#wasThisHelpful","RNI6YLWQUU0EP","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most others, I learned of this band through their infectious song ""Gooey"".  I heard it play on the radio one day and it was love at first listen.  I quickly google searched the band and discovered this album.  I previewed a few other songs such as ""Pools"" and ""Hazey"" before I finally couldn't resist myself from buying the album.  The group sounds so polished and complete.  I will say that upon my first listen of this album I was somewhat disappointed though.  I felt a bit cheated because I expected more of ""Gooey"" type songs throughout the album.  I listened to the album again an hour later and many more times since and I discovered that the songs were all latching onto me like parasites.  I was entranced and hooked to the textured layers and soulful vocals.  Here is my track by track review of what I believe will be considered a classic soon.1.  Flip:  The bass of this song comes in waves throughout the song.  At first I didn't really like this one.  But I began to find it more exotic and anthem worthy quickly.  The vocal style in this one just sounds unique in a great way.  Good intro to a true experience of an album.  9/102.  Black Mambo:  Again, first listen didn't really impress me.  But that changed soon after.  The vocals are so elegant yet powerful.  The main riff is so chill and almost has a old school hip hop feel.  I'd compare the riff and vibe of the instruments in this one to ""Clint Eastwood"" by Gorillaz.  The vocals mirror that of Robert Plant slightly!  Toward the end there is an awesome guitar section that is just sexy.  This is one of my favorites.  10/103.  Pools:  The electronic jungle feel of this one is so infectious.  The verses are playfully catchy.  The chorus is nice and pumping.  I cant help myself from singing along ""I smile because I want to"".  This really does make me feel like I'm at a party in the jungle!  Another instant classic.  10/104.  Gooey:  This is probably the song that made you look into this band.  I haven't heard a song as beautiful, sexy, and mysteriously catchy as this in a long time.  It is one of those rare songs that will never get old.  I've listened to it over 100 times so far and I still can't get enough of it.  I know this song will become an anthem.  The vocals are gorgeously executed.  The music is sensual and tantalizing.  The chorus is one of the most infectious of all time and I don't say that lightly.  This is one of the greatest songs written and performed in my opinion.  This song is.....gooey.  The music video is strange but it works so well and I can tell it will go viral.  11/105.  Walla Walla:  The jungle vibe continues here.  There is another infectious riff too.  The vocals are playful again and impossible to not want to sing along to.  The band slightly showcases some psychedelic vibes in this one toward the end.  Very trippy and cool.  9/106.  Intruxx:  This is an interlude.  I wish there were actual vocals aside from some hums.  I like the sound of the song.  It really builds up the mood gently before the drums and guitars really kick in.  I usually don't really like instrumentals as much, but this one really holds its own!  Perfect midpoint for the album.  9/107.  Hazey:  Another bass infested song.  The trip hop beat and soulful instrumental makes this one extra amazing.  This is another hit for sure.  The chorus is pure sex music.  The group really makes it sound easy to make such masterful music! 10/108.  Toes:  More great vocals textured with a chorus almost impossible to dislike.  The the guitar just strides nicely in the background throughout.  The bridge is almost trippy but still great.  9/109.  WYRD:  Another 'old school hip hop' inspired main riff.  There really is a magic ingredient to the vocals of this group.  They seem to be unable to make bad songs.  The song does end with 30 seconds of unneeded background sounds though.  9/1010.  Cocoa Hooves:  Don't you just love the titles of these songs?  This is one of the more relaxing songs.  This takes the music and vocals all over the place and I love it.  Really epic and chill at the same time.  9.5/1011.  JDNT:  The style of this song is just so mysterious and awesome.  The vocals are the best alongside 'Gooey' in the verses.  The pace of the song almost has a classy jazz vibe to it without the jazz instruments.  Great ending to this masterpiece of an album.  9.5/10Hidden Track:  I'm not a fan of hidden tracks that are accessible only after minutes of silence.  This could have easily been included as its own track or not at all.  It's not really as impressive as the rest of the album.  I like it, but I don't find myself listening to it as much.  It does have a nice refrain though.  8/10So this album was a clear example of an acquired taste.  Some may love it right away.  Some will be disappointed completely if they don't give it a chance.  I am glad I didn't dismiss it after my first listen.  I had expected an entire album of ""Gooey"" clones at first.  Though none of the songs sound like 'Gooey', I can say that the album as a whole is a gooey masterpiece in itself.  They literally get better with each listen.  These songs really sink in.  There is a consistent electronic jungle vibe that creeps throughout the songs.  The production is crisp all around. The vocals are some of the best and most gorgeous I've ever heard.  It is completely original yet familiar at the same time in its sound.  But it is clear that the band has it's own sound.  Many will compare them to Alt J at first, but I can say confidently that this band has more potential.  Plus, just the song 'Gooey' itself gives this group an automatic legendary status.  If you like textured music with soulfully elegant but powerful vocals, then this album is perfect for you.  In fact, I recommend this to anyone who likes good music altogether.  Just give it a few listens before you fully judge it!  This is one of the only recent bands alongside Arcade Fire that are instantly in my top 10 favorite music acts of all time.  I am almost sure this will be considered a masterpiece by many in the future as it is already for me.***(Hey future people, was I right?)","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JRU13LRIZUS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JQHOBU8#wasThisHelpful","R2JRU13LRIZUS3","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like most of the country, I discovered Calvin Harris through his breakout international single ""Feel So Close"". I was certain that Calvin Harris was the future of dance music. But during that time, I discovered that Calvin Harris was making good music long before that song and it's album came out. It was typical that the USA were late in his discovery. I decided to check out his first two albums ""I Created Disco"" and the amazing ""Ready For The Weekend"". Both albums were gems. Then his album ""18 Months"" was released. It was okay. It had the obvious hits, but were was Calvin Harris vocally except on one or two tracks? It had great production and guest vocals. But the guest vocals took the spotlight. So some time later in 2014, he releases his best single to date ""Summer"" and once again he shines with his vocals. I was excited for the album hoping that this time around Calvin would be singing more on his songs again. Then the song ""Blame"" featuring the phenomenal John Newman was released. Though I was disappointed to hear another guest vocal, I ended up loving the song. But still, I held onto hope that Calvin would feature more of his own singing on his new album instead of relying on others. Calvin Harris singing on his own produced songs was what set him apart from the likes of David Guetta and Avicii. It showed that he was a great producer and a good vocalist. But before the release of the album, it was revealed that this would be just like 18 Months with an overabundance of guests. I wasn't planning on buying the album at all. But I decided I needed some good new songs to add to my workout playlist and I assumed this would do. I impulsively bought the album and gave it a few listens. Here is my track by track review.1. Faith: Great opener. The album credits say that John Newman is a writer on this one. But I'm glad that Calvin takes on vocal duties! It isn't his best produced song by far, but its a definite club track. 8.5/102. Under Control Feat. Alesso and Hurts: A song released long before the album was even announced. Great guest vocals from Hurts and co-production by Alesso. It has Calvins typical chorus, EDM instrumental, chorus, and so on vibe. The vocals really do shine though. I'm surprised it wasn't a bigger hit in the US. Great song to dance to and work out to. 9.5/103. Blame Feat. John Newman: More guest vocals, but I'm glad so far they are great, and John Newman delivers. This cat can sing! I'm sure this song will do for John Newman what Disclosure did for Sam Smith. John already has a hit in this US, but this song will solidify him as a force to be reckoned with! Great Calvin Harris-isms in the production of course, but John Newman really stole the show with this one. This is really John Newman featuring Calvin Harris honestly. 10/104. Love Now Feat. All About She: I'm slowly getting used to the fact that Calvin is relying on guest vocals again. This felt like a 90s dance club lost hit. The strings incorporated in the production give it a classy dance feel. Though not as great as John Newman, the vocals are still amazing from All About She. Could be a single. 9.5/105. Slow Acid: I'm not a fan of dance instrumentals. Especially the ones that Calvin has been doing since 18 Months. This was okay. Its a definite club track and could maybe be used in movie soundtracks for action films during club scenes. But even with all of that, I still find myself skipping this song some of the time. But it's good for working out. I just would rather hear more vocals to go with the textured production. 8.5/106. Outside Feat. Ellie Goulding: Calvin and Ellies second collaboration. The production is crisp in this one. Ellie gives a good vocal performance, though not as good as Newman. This is one of his few guest vocal songs that really makes the guest vocalist seem like just that, a guest. Don't get me wrong, Ellie is great, but the production is just extra infectious on this one. 10/107. It Was You Feat. Firebeatz: The Moby style vocals are great.  At first I thought the song was annoying when the thumping beat came in.  But it quickly grew on me.  The loudness of the main beat compliments the calmness of the vocals so well.  This is original and a great work out song.  9/108. Summer: Its no surprise that I'm going to praise this masterpiece. Amazing production and singing from Calvin. The summer anthem of 2014 and another song that will become timeless. Vocals still are not as great as John Newmans guest performance, but the production just invades my soul no matter how many times I hear it. This is one of those rare songs that will never be graced with the 'skip' button. 11/109. Overdrive Feat. Ummet Ozcan: Another guest production, but with NO vocals. I found this unworthy of even being included in the album. It's not horrible. But it doesn't even fit into the rest of the album. Its obviously good to add to your workout routine, but it's also so forgettable. The production is great, but also annoying at times. The title says it all except I would call it 'OverDONE' instead. Its a shame that the longest song on the album is easily the most forgettable. 7/1010. Ecstasy Feat. Hurts: Here's something you don't hear often from Calvin. A ballad. The vocal performance by Hurts is beautiful. The title suggests it would be a club song, but this song is ecstasy in a different way. This is gorgeous. But the production once again is in the background again while the vocals take over. Another song that could be considered Hurts featuring Calvin Harris and not the other way around. A relaxing ballad to calm you. This song is you stepping out of the club to recover and relax before heading back into the madness of the club for more. 10/1011. Pray To God Feat. HAIM: I was extra excited for this song because HAIM are one of my favorite bands. I wasn't disappointed at all. Amazing Fleetwood Mac-esque vocals with modern CH production. I hope this becomes a single! 10/1012. Open Wide Feat. Big Sean: This is the worst guest vocal. But still an okay song. It also just doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. I love rap and hip hop, but I've never liked Big Sean, and this song doesn't change my mind. Luckily the production is great. But again, the production doesn't match Big Seans annoying rapping. He should have chosen a much better current rapper like Macklemore, Drake, Schoolboy Q, Logic or Kendrick Lamar. The production saves this from being a disaster. 8/1013. Together Feat. Gwen Stefani: The production sounds like Calvin Harris is ripping off himself. But it is still infectious. Gwen Stefani is a great singer and its no surprise that she soars in this one. 9.5/1014. Burnin Feat. R3hab: I was going to dismiss this immediately because of its guest production with no vocals, but I was surprised to find that I liked this for some odd reason. But that quickly changed again as I found myself hating it soon after. Very lukewarm song. Another good workout song, but horrible standalone song. It just feels out of place anywhere outside of a club setting. 7.5/1015. Dollar Sign Feat. Tinashe: I'm glad to hear a PBR&B singer mixed with CH! The bass is killer in this one. Its almost industrial and EDM at the same time. Tinashe is great, but she didn't really explode vocally. Still, very infectious! I love the song, but I thought it didn't feel like an album closer. 9.5/10So this album was full of good songs and some filler. But this is not a 5 star album. I give it a 3.5/5, but I guess rounding it up to 4 stars is acceptable. The production is great, but at the same time repetitive. Individually the songs are amazing, but as a whole, the album seems scattered. Though there are some consistencies in production, it all just feels like a greatest hits album of lost hits. Calvin Harris isn't the star of the album. Aside from in ""Summer"" and maybe the opening track, this feels like a collection of songs that featured Calvin Harris production, not an album that Calvin Harris needs to brand his name all over. A good chunk of these songs are destined to take over clubs around the world. As stated before too, this is full of good songs to workout to. This is a great album of catchy songs with crisp production, but this is not a good Calvin Harris album, if you get my drift. If Calvin was honest he would title the album ""Calvin Harris and friends - Motion"". I don't regret paying for this album, but I also don't think it's a masterpiece. I feel like the songs 'Slow Acid', 'Overdrive' and 'Burnin' could have been scrapped from the album and it wouldn't affect the albums quality negatively at all though. I suggest you preview the songs and decide if this is something you feel is worth a purchase. Expect many awards in the Dance/Electronic/Pop category though.If you don't want to purchase the whole album, then songs to definitely download include: Under Control, Blame, Outside, It Was You Summer, Pray To God and Together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BAE1171GG8Z4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NPDVTOK#wasThisHelpful","R2BAE1171GG8Z4","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've only been a U2 fan for a few years.  Nonetheless, I'm still a huge fan.  My exposure to their albums was scattered as the first album I bought from them was ""War"", which is still one of my all time favorite albums.  I've listened to all of their albums since.  Almost everyone goes crazy over ""Joshua Tree"" or ""Achtung Baby"", but my favorite to this day is still ""How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb"".  I remember going on a U2 binge leading up to the release of their album ""No Line On The Horizon"".  It was a different sound again for the band but still amazing in my opinion.  A lot of people were disappointed with that album for some reason.  I was disappointed it wasn't as popular as their others.  Non-U2 fans  don't know a single song from NLOTH unlike how nearly every other U2 album had a song known by virtually everyone like ""Beautiful Day"", ""One"", ""Vertigo"", ""Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"",etc.  Many were calling it the start to their decline, even though the concert tour for the album ended up being the highest grossing in history.  Ever since that albums mixed reaction I have been anticipating U2s next move.  I would literally search at least once a month for information regarding a new release from the band.  First I found out that Danger Mouse was helping with production which was an interesting thought.  Then the songs ""Ordinary Love"" and ""Invisible"" were released and hinted at as singles for the new album.  Luckily those songs didn't end up in the cut because I personally found them lacking a bit even if they were good.  Then finally, in September of 2014 they make history when they released the album for free to Itunes users for a month.  Even that got a mixed reaction sadly.  Either way it became the most popular album of all time because of the stunt.  I'm not ashamed to say that I'm not one of people who got the album for free.  I stopped using itunes a while ago.  I still found the album online of course because I couldn't wait and made myself only listen to it once, and I loved it.  I waited until the day the physical album was released and proudly purchased it!  Here is my track by track review after many listens so far.1.  The Miracle(Of Joey Ramone): I honestly thought this was a horrible choice for the lead single of the album.  It's not a bad song at all.  Its actually a really great one with impressive lyrics!  But I just didn't feel like it was worthy of being the teaser of the album.  It doesn't have that everlasting appeal like previous singles.  I've listened to it 10 times now and still can't remember the chorus or verses.  I only remember those ""Whoah oh oh""s.  The guitars are great and rocking though!  Great song, but wrong single choice for me.  9/102.  Every Breaking Wave:  After the rocking opener it slows down into an arena ballad anthem with this.  The chorus has Bono changing up his pitch throughout which I love.  The Edges guitar riff is a breath of fresh air.  This is supposed to be the second single from the album and I have no doubt that this will become a huge hit! 9.5/103.  California(There Is No End To Love):  The chants in the beginning are heavenly and atmospheric before the keyboards come in followed by the drums then the rest of the band.  The piano riff is similar to the bands previous hit piano riffs like ""New Years Day"".  Great guitar solo!  9.5/104.  Song For Someone:  This song is hauntingly beautiful.  Bonos singing melody in this one will become a classic that will be covered again and again.  The style of this song is similar to ""Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own"", which is perfect!  The guitar toward the end is great of course.  Song of the Year in my opinion.  This could be a single! 10/105.  Iris(Hold Me Close): This should've been the lead single.  This isn't just the best song on the album for me, but one of the best from the band altogether.  The haunting angel-like intro makes this one sound like a sequel to the song ""Ultraviolet"".  The way Bono sings ""Iris"" after each chorus is just beautiful.  Fun fact, Chris Martin does the backing vocals during the chorus.  I love the riff during the chorus especially.  Perfect U2 song.  10/106.  Volcano:  The bass shines throughout this one.  Bono changes up his style a bit.  The chorus is catchy in this weird way.  It's hard to describe why, its just infectious!  The Edge creeps in the background for the first part of the song before he explodes front first with his rocking guitar skills which build more and more till the end.  Bono chants ""You are Rock N Roll"" in the bridge, which is exactly what this song is as well!  9.5/107.  Raised By Wolves:  The effect used throughout the song reminds me of Jason Voorhees.  The song builds and builds and I love it.  Bono gives a powerful vocal performance.  This is another great rocker anthem that I'm sure will get the crowd riled up in concert!  There is a nice piano section as well.  9.5/108.  Cedarwood Road:  The title did not prepare me for the rocker that this song is.  Its a rocker, but it's also groovy during the verses.  I love the Edges backing vocals.  The guitar riff is just so awesome.  9.5/109.  Sleep Like A Baby Tonight:  The synths in this song made me think of ""Sweet Dreams"" from the 80s at first.  Bonos voice serenades the listener.  Then the chorus hits, and things get even better.  Halfway into the song Bono hits this haunting high note that works so well even if it lasts only a few seconds.  The closing guitar solo is perfect for romantic nights.  This could be a single.  This is a love making song based on its sound, but the lyrics are really haunting!  10/1010.  This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now:  This sounds like it could have been released on their album ""War"".  The bass makes it groove by!  This song gets the boogey on.  The chanting chorus will be amazing in concert.  This is the song on the album that most shows off the production by Danger Mouse.  9.5/1011.  The Troubles:  This is a majestic and beautiful closer to the album.  Lykke Li gives a great guest performance.  This song is being used in advertisements for The Walking Dead season 5 which will undoubtedly make it one of the more popular songs from the album.  This song plays well as an ending that keeps me wanting more!  10/10So this album ended up being one of U2s best for me.  It is definitely better than NLOTH and almost up there with Atomic Bomb.  Well worth the wait.  Every song is a gem in its own way.  They made a U2 album without changing their sound to match the sound of today but still sounding new at the same time.  I feel like the free release of the album made many people see this as B-side material.  They let the release method cloud their judgement.  People focused on the release method rather than the music itself in most cases.  I know a lot of people don't listen to U2 or their genre, but whats to complain about a free album from one of the biggest and best bands of all time?  I'm disappointed that the physical album doesn't seem to be selling nearly as well as it should be!  This is U2.  THE U2.  Sadly the Apple stunt did affect the physical sales of the album.  I'm not someone who really cares about how much a musical artist sells, but this is U2 where talking about.  What happened to all the fans?  I know this album will sell more and more as time passes though.  It's still the most popular album of all time thanks to the stunt.  It's a truly amazing album as well.  I would consider it for another Album of the Year nomination for the band and I'm not just being biased because I'm a fan.  It's truly great inspiring and beautiful music.  Turn up the volume and enjoy!  Old and new fans, this is worth more than a purchase even if you get it for free!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27XNB8H6XHI7Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NI5RLOW#wasThisHelpful","R27XNB8H6XHI7Y","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is nothing new for me to say that like most, I discovered Hozier through his breakout single ""Take Me To Church"".  I have to admit that I did not think the song was special upon my first few listens.  But like most great songs, it latched onto me like a parasite and I'm glad it did.  The meaning and soulful nature of the song was incredible.  I was convinced that this was a true artist who would make an album worth listening to when it came out.  Then weeks leading up to the albums released I listened to another song to be included in it called ""Sedated"" and that fully solidified my interest in buying this.  Well now the album is here and I've given it a good few listens.  Here is my track by track review.1.  Take Me To Church:  The perfect opening track and lead single!  I'm pretty sure this song is why you are here too.  Can we all agree this is one of the biggest surprise hits of 2014?  Great soulful and seductive song with amazing vocals that metaphorically compares falling in love to religion.  Masterpiece.  10/102.  Angel of Small Death & The Codeine Scene:  What a title.  The song starts off slow with atmospheric blues hums in the background before the drums come in and brings it all together!  The bridge part of the song offers one of the best guitar moments in music in recent memory.  9.5/103.  Jackie and Wilson:  The style changes just a bit with this song.  The riff is nice, but again Hozier shines great with his vocals especially in the chorus.  Toward the end the distinctive atmospheric blues effect can be heard again and it works great!  Very catchy and meaningful.  9/104.  Someone New:  Another impossibly catchy tune.  The guitars during the verses make it feel perfect for listening to in the sunlight or at the beach!  The chorus will be stuck in your head!  Such a great melody!  9.5/105.  To Be Alone:  The bluesy guitars on this one along with the whistle-like howls make this one feel like something to listen to during the sunset.  The vocals style changes throughout and it works well.  9/106.  From Eden:  This is a great love song that is worthy of a single.  The lyrics about Eve and the Serpent are very clever without sounding too religious.  In fact, most people won't even catch on with that and just hear it as a sweet cute love song which is even better!  One of my favorites.  10/107.  In A Week:  At first I thought this was boring.  But after a few listens, I really recognized the tragic beauty of the lyrics and somber vocals.  Karen Cowleys guest vocals give it more elegance and at times haunting.  The intertwining of their voices toward the end is just majestic.  9.5/108  Sedated:  A sexy and catchy atmospheric anthem that just grooves by.  Dare I say it?  In my opinion this is even better than ""Take Me To Church"".  But thats my personal opinion.  The lyrics are so clever and true with a chorus worthy of making love to, even if the lyrics aren't exactly sexual.  So far my favorite of the album.  10/109.  Work Song:  Such a beautiful ballad!  The distant hums throughout the song just give me a warm feeling in my chest.  The chorus is destined to make this an anthem.  Expect many people to cover this all over the place.  10/1010.  Like Real People Do:  Very romantic song.  Hoziers vocals seem to glide by elegantly.  Just a perfect sweet song to listen to with your lover by your side.  9.5/1011.  It Will Come Back:  This is one of those songs which has verses that are better than the chorus.  The guitars do take the stage more on this song too.  9/1012.  Foreigners God:  This is the closer of the album for me and it closed it well.  Very meaningful song with great delivery.  The vocals and the instrumentals work so great together here and I can really feel the song.  10/1013.  Cherry Wine:  Though this is a great song, I found myself skipping over it after a few listens.  I'm not a fan of live tracks.  I like going to concerts, but listening to live recordings like this just don't hit me.  It's very well recorded to sound like it isn't live, but I can still tell.  Seemed very out of place for me.  9/10 for the song.  6/10 for the placementSo this ended up proving that Hozier is a force to be reckoned with in the music scene of today and the future.  He proved on this album that his talent extends far beyond just his hit single ""Take Me To Church"".  Every song is a gem in its own way.  I would compare Hoziers success to the success that Gotye experienced with ""Somebody that I Used To Know"".  This album is a modern classic.  One of the best debut albums of the decade.  This is a great combination of indie rock with blues and soul.  Worthy of adding to any music lovers collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SKXC208Q82I7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M856DSS#wasThisHelpful","R1SKXC208Q82I7","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its no surprise that I discovered Tove Lo from her breakout single ""Habits"".  There was something about her singing style and the music production that really set her apart from the likes of Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, etc. Basically she isn't just another typical pop singer. I actually don't listen to poppy music like this let alone buy their albums.  I initially wasn't even planning on buying this album.  But the night before it came out, I suddenly had an urge to check it out.  I previewed some of the songs and liked what I heard.  I decided this was worth an actual purchase!  So I go all over my small city looking for it, and it was no where to be found at first.  I was so surprised at that since she is becoming so popular.  Luckily I found it at a B&N at the last minute.  I needed good new music at the moment and this album was just what the doctor ordered.  After a few listens, I can proudly say this is a gem.  Here is a track by track review.1. The Sex(Interlude): Waste of space in my opinion.  Its only 6 seconds.  I guess its supposed to give the album a concept album feel but I feel like it could have been an actual interlude of music instead of her just speaking for a few seconds.  (No Rating)2.  My Gun:  This is where the real music starts and it gets thumping right away.  The beat of this is a club track definitely.  But of course the real star is Tove Los voice!  There are clicks of a gun used to add effect to the song and it works.  The last repetition of the chorus is really great.  This could be a single!  9.5/103.  Like Em Young: I was honestly going to not like this song right away because of the title and because I'm a dude and this made me think it would target female audiences only.  Lyrically, this song relates more to women, especially my girlfriend who is actually pretty older than me.  But the sound of the song is impossible to not like!  Very playful and a great dance track.  This is just a fun song.  8.5/104.  Talking Body: Another potential hit single.  The chorus is just sexy and perfect for the club scene of today.  Her voice though.  It really is something to admire.  The production is crisp!  There are those little touches you'll miss the first time.  Definitely a song that gets better with each listen.  Thats saying something since this song is great upon first listen!  10/105.  Timebomb:  Lyrically this is a sad song.  But musically and vocally it is upbeat and infectious.  I'm not a big fan of the verses yet.  The way she talk sings just doesn't catch me right away.  I could get used to it since the chorus is an anthem!  The chorus is just beautifully tragic!  This is a perfect example of a song that sounds happy, but has lyrics that state otherwise.  This is another song worthy of being a single!  10/106.  The Love(Interlude): Another pointless inclusion.  (no rating)7.  Moments: The industrial production of this song is really great.  This is a very chill song with a great upbeat chorus.  Very uplifting song.  Tove gives some of her best vocals in this song as well!  9.5/108.  The Way That I Am:  The production of this song shows Tove Lo with a badass side to her.  Lyrically, its more of the relationship material.  Expect to hear this at a club ready for couples and strangers to grind on each other.  Probably one of the more generic songs, but still great!  8.5/109.  Got Love:  The drum beat and synths give this a futuristic 80s sound.  Gosh, I feel redundant constantly praising the choruses, but this proves she is a hit maker!  She makes singing so good sound so easy.  Toward the end things get more exotic in the production.  You'll have to hear it to fully understand!  She's got love from me!  9.5/1010.  Not On Drugs:  The production team continue its consistent textured production with this one!  Of course the voice of the song can't be overlooked!  Another gem.  9/1011.  The Pain(Interlude): Another 5 second interlude that doesnt add to the album.  (no rating)12.  Thousand Miles:  The bell synth throughout the song sounds nice.  I don't have to say how amazing the chorus is, even though I just did.  Boy can this lady sing!  Her melodies just keep impressing.  10/1013.  Habits(Stay High):  I don't even have to say anything.  If you're even contemplating buying this CD or you're on this page, its probably because you heard this song and loved it.  Just a great fun infectious song.  That chorus!  ""Ooh ooh ooh Ooooooh""!  But I'd be lying if I said I thought it was the best song on the album.  9.5/1014.  This Time Around:  More amazing production.  She almost sounds like she's crying while singing during some moments, which makes it sound more powerful.  This is a great love making song.  9.5/1015.  Run On Love(QOTC Edit):  The production sounds different on this song compared to the rest.  It sounds like a great dance song that Calvin Harris wishes he produced!  The sound of the song reminds me of the soundtrack to The Night At The Roxbury.  Awesome and infectious!  10/1016.  Habits(Stay High)(Hippie Sabotage Remix):  I honestly don't get the hype over this remix.  It distorts her voice too much.  It's a good slightly slower and groovy version, but I'll take the original over this every time.  I didn't really want this version, it just came with the album.  Lots of people love this remix, but I'm not one of them.  7.5/10So, aside from the three brief spoken interludes and the remix of Habits, this album is a consistent modern pop masterpiece.  This will go on lists of greatest debut albums of all time.  The songs are catchy, meaningful, full of wicked lyrics, great production and most of all, perfect vocals!  A good portion of the album, if not all of it, can be added to your work out playlist.  I know I'll be jamming to these while I'm at the gym.  Maybe I'll even lip sync!  This is a welcomed addition  to any music collection that wants something fresh, fun, and just plain amazing.  When I bought this album, as stated earlier, there was only one place in my entire city that had it in stock.  That will change soon thanks to her divine appeal.  I didn't think I would say this, but I strongly think this can be a strong contender for Album of The Year!  Definitely worth the money!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2APQ7C40B4VBU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MW5FBKU#wasThisHelpful","R2APQ7C40B4VBU","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I first heard this living legends magnificent voice years ago in commercials and movies via the song ""I Need a Dollar"", which I am so surprised wasn't a big hit in the US.  I liked the song a lot but never looked into Aloe.  Fast forward to 2013, and Avicii is releasing his debut album.  Then I heard that special voice of Aloe again on the song ""Wake Me Up"", which is one of the greatest songs ever written.  I didn't buy Aviciis album though.  I honestly dislike when a producer only uses other vocalists.  Most people didn't even care who Aloe was.  They gave all the credit to Avicii.  I'll be honest, I was one of those people for a bit.  I knew it wasn't Avicii singing, but I never fully appreciated who Aloe was yet.  Fast forward again to 2014.  The song ""The Man"" is becoming popular.  I then look into Aloe Blacc and begin to fully appreciate him as a solo artist.  This album comes out and I listen to the acoustic, also original version of ""Wake Me Up"", and I just can't believe how beautiful it is.  So I buy the album after that and after reading that it is full of many different genres spliced together.  Well I am glad I bought it because this is a good contender for Album of the Year.  Here is a track by track review.1. The Man: The theme song for many Beats by Dre commercials.  I immediately noticed the Elton John sample and loved it.  It is very well produced and the vocals are infectious.  Great positive song to motivate yourself to.  I'm glad this is finally giving Aloe the big hit in the US he deserved years ago.  10/102. Love is the Answer:  Produced by Pharrell, this one is a great dance soul song.  Very reminiscent of John Legends recent album.  The lyrics have great meaning too.  I could see this playing at clubs.  Great track.  9.5/103. Wake Me Up:  The BETTER version of the song.  After hearing this, I like Aviciis version a lot less.  I still love Aviciis version, but not nearly as much as this perfect gem.  The production is crisp and deliciously executed.  This one hits the emotions a lot harder than Aviciis.  The string parts never sounded so beautiful.  I really hope more people find out about this song.  I hope it is released as a single and overshadows the Avicii version.  Amazing song.  Timeless.  Song of the Year.  11/104. Here Today:  Very uplifting song that builds up to an infectious chorus.  The last part of this song is just perfect.  The song is just bound to put anyone in a good mood.  The production, the instrumentals, the singing.  It all comes together in amazing fashion.  10/105.  Can You Do This:  This is the fastest song on the album.  Reminds me a bit of ""Runaway Baby"" from Bruno Mars.  Just a bit.  This one is better of course.  The groove of the song is fun.  This isn't my favorite song though.  It just doesn't fit the feel of the rest of the album for me.  Its great, but it's not on par with the rest of the songs in my opinion.  Still really good though.  8.5/106. Chasing:  At first I thought the song was too 1960s corny because of the first time I heard the chorus.  But then the chorus came in a second time and I just felt how great it was.  The delivery of every vocal is very nice.  9.5/107. The Hand is Quicker:  The vocals here.  Just amazing.  The music.  Amazing.  At first I thought this song was going to be boring seeing it was over 5 minutes long.  Luckily this is 5 minutes of greatness.  Every aspect of this song is great.  Really a good example of Aloes genre blending sound.  10/108. Ticking Bomb:  The title had me hesitant at first.  I assumed it would be a mindless filler.  That made the song hit me even harder because of the lowered expectation.  The sound of the ticking bomb with the acoustic guitar followed by the light pulsating beat.  Just pure perfection.  This is the male equivalent of, dare I say, Adeles ""Rumor Has it"", but much much much better.  Great lyrics too.  10/109. Red Velvet Seat: Very relaxing and soulful song.  The most soulful song on the album.  There is something very oldschool and classy about this song.  The vocal delivery and the bluesy feel.  Just masterful.  I can picture myself in a big city walking down the park thinking of ""that special girl"" while listening to this song.  Very powerful.  10/1010. Owe it All: A great way to close the album.  I do think the transition from the previous song to this one wasn't that smooth at all though.  But luckily this song is amazing.  The chorus is one of the catchiest and gentlemen sounding things I've heard in a while.  This could be a single.  Every single aspect of this song is sexy.  Classy.  Sexy.  Great end to the US edition of the album.  10.5/10So this album proves that Aloe Blacc is more than just a voice.  More than just that guy on the ""Avicii"" song.  I'm so surprised he hasn't been hugely big in the US till now.  I hope this album introduces his voice and style to new listeners everywhere.  This is a modern pop/soul masterpiece.  A great collection of classy songs for all ages.  Until now, the only other album I've considered for album of the year was Arcade Fires ""Reflektor"".  But this album is now on the list for me.  I hope this album gets Grammy recognition, even if not for Album of The Year.  If they snub this album then I will lose what little faith I had left in the Grammys forever.  Buy this album.  Modern classic.  Worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12C6A8JLYKF88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HZ2M5FO#wasThisHelpful","R12C6A8JLYKF88","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I, like many people first discovered this amazing duo when I heard their song ""Fall In Love"" on satellite radio.  It was such a different yet familiar and beautiful sound.  The song intrigued me enough to look up the group.  The female lead, Sarah Barthel has one of the sexiest voices in music today.  My friend told me about their Nightlife EP and the sleeper hit from it ""Don't Move"" and I was even more intrigued.  So I look into their debut album ""Eyelid Movies"" and preview their lead single from that album, ""When I'm Small"" which is recently becoming the theme song for Gillette fusion commercials.  Then I listened to the Nightlife EP a few times and liked it, but only two songs really excited me.  I decided to order their debut album to prepare me for the release of this album.  I ended up loving the album so much.  I was also surprised to know that the male part of the group, Josh Carter, who produces the music too, also sings very well and sometimes sing raps hauntingly.  At this time the song ""Bill Murray"" from this album was released and I couldn't have been more excited.  Now the album is finally here, and after a few listens, I can say with confidence that this is one of my favorites now.  Here is a track by track review.1. Nothing But Trouble:  This song was also released prior to the albums release.  I immediately compared the industrial sound of it to Nine Inch Nails but with female vocals.  The vocals took some getting used to at first because I was so used to the delicious vocals from ""Fall in Love"".  The song seriously gets better with multiple listens.  A great song to add to your work out routine and for cardio.  A great industrial start to the album.  9.5/102. Black Out Days: Another song released prior to the album.  This was more of the beautiful sound heard from the debut album but more advanced.  Very beautiful.  The sounds heard in the song are just delicious.  Josh Carter did extra great work on this track with production.  The chorus was annoying at first to me, but it got infectious with multiple listens.  Another good song to add to your work out.  9.5/103. Fall In Love: This song.  The song that had heads turning and many converted into instant fans.  This song is also getting really popular and might be their first big hit, which I hope happens!  I know it will!  The production combined with the perfectly infectious vocals.  I can't even muster how perfect this song is.  The chorus is amazing and never gets old.  Good song for almost any setting whether you're single or taken.  ALSO another good work out song.  11.5/104. Never Going Home: My friend told me this song reminded him of Phil Collins before I got to listen to it.  That is a good comparison.  Very relaxing.  Definitely a song to listen to at night while taking in the scene wherever you are.  The lyrics sound sad but uplifting at the same time.  The vocals are by the male part of the group, who shows off more of his singing ability.  There are parts where he and Sarah sing together and it works very well.  Another song that gets better with each listen.  This could be a single.  Beautiful song. 10/105. The Day You Died: The guitars hooked me in right away.  This song sounds like it could've been on Paramores self titled album!  I mean that in a good way.  The chorus was okay for me for Phantogram standards.  It is good, but it'll take a few listens for me to get used to it.  But the guitars are immediately infectious which is the reason I keep coming back to this song.  Sarah does show off her sexy moans in the song though.  Also good for your work out.  9/106. Howling At The Moon: The beginning mislead me.  But then the beat comes in.  A great beat which is what Phantogram is known for.  Mixing hip hop/trip hop with beautiful vocals.  The song was about to be miss for me vocally at first before the chorus kicked it.  Very pumping and infectious guitar led chorus!  I'll still have to get used to the verses.  They are good, but the chorus is the true show stealer of this song.  Again, good for the work out!  9.5/107. Bad Dreams: I really liked the verses of the song right away.  Then I heard the chorus.  At first I thought it was very annoying.  But after many listens, I actually really liked the chorus.  Especially with the production of the song.  I mostly said it was annoying at first just to annoy my friend who said he didn't like the previous song.  But I actually can't deny how sexy the chorus is!  Josh also creeps in the background with his 'twirling' and infectious guitars as well.  9.5/108. Bill Murray:  I honestly didn't think it was possible to produce such beautiful and sexy music as heard on this song.  The production, the vocals, the lyrics.  Everything is perfect in this song.  The choir sound of the chorus almost reminds me of the soundtrack to ""Home Alone"".  I know that sounds corny, but if you go watch Home Alone right now and listen to the chorus of this song you'll know what I mean!  This might be one of the greatest songs ever written or recorded.  If officially released as a single I strongly demand this as a Grammy contender for Song/Record of the Year.  (Wishful thinking).  15/109. I Don't Blame You: Its impossible to follow a song like ""Bill Murray"".  But this song does a good job trying.  Another song vocally lead by Josh.  The production is solid as always and the chorus is catchy.  At first I thought the chorus was too stale, but it actually gets infectious and stuck in your head!  Truthfully its really hard to listen to this song and fully appreciate it right after the masterpiece song that preceded it!  Still a great song though.  The production is very unique too!  9.5/1010. Celebrating Nothing: The title sounds like it would be a depressing song.  But this very upbeat.  The beat and synths flow together so well.  The vocals and lyrics have radio potential all over it.  Probably the most 80s retro sounding song on the album!  Good song.  9/1011. My Only Friend:  After the mostly perfect album, I was expecting not much from the closer.  But this was actually a great great and haunting yet beautiful song.  The song builds up with its great production.  Not as good a closer as ""10,000 Claps"" from the debut album, but still a great song.  Very textured.  I just think ""Bill Murray"" would've been the best choice to end the album with perfectly.  But I'm not complaining.  Still a great end to the album which leaves me wanting more!  9.5/10So this album was consistently great.  There are no fillers.  Each song is a gem.  The replay value is high.  After listening to the album a few times in order, I find the best thing to do is to put the album on shuffle to give it more variety.  It works.  This album is just pure and good modern music.  I expect to see this album winning awards as well.  Lets just hope they don't wait 5 more years to release another one!  If I had one thing to suggest to make this nearly perfect album even better, it would be to include more songs with Josh on vocals or even duets.  Maybe on future albums hopefully.  If you like good indie electronic music with great vocals and nice hip hop inspired beats, then this is a great album for you.  If you want something new and different and great, then this album is great for you.  If you like good music, then this album is...you guessed it.  Worth a purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U50BKEKUZXB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H7MW3D6#wasThisHelpful","R1U50BKEKUZXB1","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I discovered this movie by chance. I was browsing a site that listed upcoming movies being released to DVD/Blu Ray. I saw this and it intrigued me. So I watched the trailer and was stoked to see the film. I read that it was loosely based on ""From Beyond"" by the great H.P. Lovecraft. That made me even more excited because I love the creeping terror of many Lovecraft works. I saw the low score on this site and that only slightly put me off. But I saw that the critics were giving the movie positive feedback, something that doesn't happen often in the horror genre. So the movie comes out and I buy it and wait till the night comes to watch it. Boy was this a horror gem.Plot Synopsis. The movie revolves around a journalist who discovers that her college friend has disappeared after taking a hallucinatory drug that the CIA used to experiment with on humans during the MKUltra project. After taking the drug a radio suddenly broadcasts a creepy numbers station signal of unknown origin before ""something"" comes and takes the person. She goes on a journey to figure out what happened and is joined along the way by a Hunter S. Thompson inspired character who uses the drug regularly. On the journey there are supernatural happenings and creepy CIA footage of patients from the MKUltra era. What the two discover is beyond belief and terrifying.The movie uses found footage sometimes, but don't be fooled. This is not a found footage movie. There are instances where the film cuts to creepy fake documentary footage as well. But for the most part, the movie is directed in a way that can best be described as a combination of traditional film making and found footage. The directing style for these scenes I speak of is masterful especially for the low budget. The darkness that filled the screen a lot got annoying at first, but it actually becomes another character in the movie. The scariest scenes are the scenes in the darkness that don't show the monster or only show slight glimpses of it. The creeping feeling one gets from these scenes is done so well. There are many jump scares. Even if you don't get a glimpse of the entity shown during some of the jump scares, they still work. Some are cheap scares, but most are clever and truly terrifying scares. The music was also perfectly done. Very eerie and sometimes relaxing to the point of utter creepiness. The numbers station broadcast that plays to warn you that the entity is coming is one of the creepiest and original horror movie ideas I've ever seen or heard. The sounds heard are just discomforting and well crafted. The acting is also terrific from everyone. This is a low budge movie, but there are some veteran actors such as Ted Levine who plays the crucial Hunter S. Thompson type character amazingly and humorously. Those don't recognize the name will know his face from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and his voice from the now classic horror movie ""Joy Ride"". For such a low budget virtually unknown movie, all the actors and actresses give great performances. I have to say again that the style of directing is so original and clever. Sometimes it gets annoying and maybe boring during the long shots, but the payoff is worth it.This movie will stick with you. The images seen will keep some people up at night. The radio broadcast sound will dig deep. I can tell that this movie will slowly become the cult horror classic it is destined to be. I look forward to the work from this new director as he gets into slightly bigger budgeted films. I do have one complaint that many might also have with the DVD. If not watching on Netflix when it comes out there, many will probably be seeing this on DVD. But the problem I had was that there were no subtitles. I don't have trouble hearing, but some of the dialogue was hard to understand or hear clearly even when blown up to a high volume. But that is just a minor issue. So buy or rent this horror movie if you need a good creepy scare for the night that will stick with you. Just be prepared to pay attention because you could miss things if not!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XPA7F75BB0M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GB0OQ3U#wasThisHelpful","R16XPA7F75BB0M","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that I didn't really know who Sara Bareilles was prior to this album.  I knew the song ""Love Song"", but didn't know it was by her.  I saw her name thrown around but I never looked her up.  Then the Grammy Nominations for 2014 were announced and everyone, including myself were surprised to see her name and album in the Album of The Year category.  She beat out critically acclaimed albums by artists such as Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, and Vampire Weekend among others.  So I was interested in hearing what the buzz about this album was about.  I previewed some songs and listened to the lead single ""Brave"" which has been played in commercials and is really catchy.  I decided to actually purchase the album, even though this type of music isn't usually my preference, especially since I consider myself a manly man.  I still gave her a big chance and bought her album, and here is a track by track review.1. Brave: When I first listened to the song I sensed a familiarity in its sound.  Not my favorite of the album, but very catchy.  Nice motivational feelgood song.  But I'm the type that usually likes the songs not released as the lead single more.  Still a good pop song.  9/102. Chasing the Sun:  This is a great song.  It builds upon itself and the emotions it brings out in the listener is magical.  The last 2 minutes of the song really sound beautiful.  The background vocals toward the end are the perfect sound to accompany strength after a breakup.  Just a great great song and could be a single.  9.5/103. Hercules: My favorite song on the album.  The opening piano riff is unbelievably catchy.  The verses were good at first, but then when I heard the chorus I could feel my soul swooning for her voice.  It is just perfect.  There is also great use of strings in the song toward the end.  Since I'm a guy, I use this song as motivation to be the Hercules for a woman.  Perfect song.  10/104. Manhattan: Not my favorite song, but I'm sure many others will like the song.  I like slow ballad songs, but this one just doesn't appeal to me that much.  I'm sure if I have my heart broken by a girl I could hear this song for what it is, but right now it's not for me.  Its a great song and the story behind the lyrics is beautifully sad, but it's just not my personal pick.  I will say I like the use of horns though.  8.5/105. Satellite Call: The sound of this song is just pure sonic emotion.  The ""woo oooh oooh""s of the chorus sound just tragically gorgeous. 9/106. Little Black Dress: At first I didn't like the song, because, I'm not a woman and I'm not gonna put on a little black dress.  But then I listened to it again and I could feel her emotion.  I listen to this song to hear her emotion and story.  The chorus is really catchy and heartfelt.  9/107. Cassiopeia: Another beautifully perfect song.  Her singing abilities are really showcased in the chorus.  I'm really starting to understand the hype for this album.  One of my favorite songs by anyone!  10/108. 1000 Times: This is one of the better of the three slower songs on the album in my opinion.  Great song to play while trying to get someone you love to swoon for you at the right moment.  The final chorus is sung in a trembling voice and you can really feel her words.  Beautiful.  9.5/109. I Choose You: This is a more upbeat and happy song.  The way she sings the chorus is candy to the ears.  Her voice really is sexy and gorgeous!  Think of the one you choose when you listen to this.  10/1010. Eden: The verses of this thumping song sounds soulful and funky.  Then the chorus turns into a delicious dance track.  The chorus really is pumping and catchy.  There are nice piano elements to the song as well.  Good pop.  9.5/1011. Islands: This is the best of the slow songs on the album.  This song reminds me of the recently discovered sister band HAIM.  This song brings out more emotion than the rest of the album with the background chants alone.  The chorus is just serenading perfection.  Feel the heartbreaking beauty of it for yourself.  10/1012: December: This song was just okay for me at first.  But the last part of the song really closes the album well and beautifully.  The layered vocals and guitar during the last 90 seconds make for a good ending to this surprisingly great album.  9.5/10So this album made me a believer.  I now believe this more than deserves its Album of The Year Nomination, and could possibly be the underdog and win.  It is a shame it hasn't been a megahit yet, but I'm sure more people are taking notice after hearing about the nomination.  Sara has one of the most beautiful voices working today, and I think she is much better and appealing than Adele honestly.  This is mature pop for everyone, especially those going through a break up.  The Blessed Unrest is definitely one of most unexpected pop masterpieces.  I'm a fan now and I more than recommend this album!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHKW7RJCDEMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CF7PG5U#wasThisHelpful","RDHKW7RJCDEMB","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying this.  I'm a guy that hated One Direction at first.  But this albums mature sound caught my eye and I like it!  My music taste ranges from metal to hard rock to soft rock, indie, folk, pop, rap, etc.  I admit I liked N'Sync and thought One Direction was too bubble gum pop and no real man should go anywhere near their so called music.  But then I heard the song ""Story of my Life"" and I couldn't resist the mature pop sound of it.  I told myself that was the only One Direction song I would ever like.  Then I started reading reviews for the album.  People were calling it more mature and rock sounding.  The core audience liked it a lot less and people who didn't like One Direction started to listen up including me.  So I gave in and purchased my first and probably only One Direction album, telling the guy at the register it was ""for my sister"", but he knew....he knew.  Here is a track by track review.1. Best Song Ever:  I heard about this song, and heard snippets of it in commercials, but I dismissed it as just another lame 1D song before I actually listened to it now.  It does have an obvious The Who influence in the beginning.  It's a feel good party song and its undeniably catchy, but not the best thing ever.  Still good for this boy band standard.  I will say that the verses remind me a bit of The Police, in a good way!  9/102. Story of My Life: This is the song that turned heads for many.  At first I thought it was a new OneRepublic song before finding out the truth.  Definitely the best song this boy band has put out so far.  Very mature and the chorus will have many girls swooning and guys singing along while thinking of that special girl.  The folk pop sound of it really is a game changer for this group.  10/103. Diana: There is a sort of 80s influence on this song.  Again I will say the verses remind me of Sting just slightly.  The chorus was too poppy for me at first, but then it grew more and more on me and now I think it's very catchy.  Girls named Diana must be in love with this song.  Around 2 minutes into the song the bridge steals the show before the final chorus and shows more of the growth of the band musically.  9/104. Midnight Memories: Theres an obvious rock n roll influence on this song.  The chorus has a big stadium sound.  Not one of my favorites, but the last minute of the song is great!  8/105. You and I: Slower song, but definitely one of the better ones.  At first I thought it was too corny, but then I remembered the group I was listening to and gave them a pass.  The chorus is very catchy and emotional.  Good song to listen to with your girlfriend/boyfriend.  I see a sunset in my mind when I hear the chorus.  The guitars in the final chorus are perfect and the vocals get bigger.  This could be a single.  9.5/106. Don't Forget Where You Belong: The vocals and song structure immediately remind me of Ryan Teddar and his band.  I know its being said too much, but this is another example of the maturity the group is reaching!  Definitely a feelgood song.  9/107. Strong: The plucking guitars really give this song a 90s feel.  I have to hand it to these guys for singing greatly in their chorus's.  Of course the bridge part of this song is just musical candy to the ears!  The chorus had me singing along in my head by the end and its very infectious.  9.5/108. Happily:  The guitars in this song continue the trend on the album to bring out a more pop rock sound.  Another song to listen to with that special someone.  Very upbeat and fun!  Toward the end the song begins to take a folk pop sound in good fashion to end the song with.  9.5/109. Right Now:  The Ryan Teddar comparisons are prominent especially since he produced this song!  I just have to say that the harmonies in the chorus are just perfect.  This is anthem worthy.  10/1010. Little Black Dress:  The guitar riff of this song definitely sounds like a lost hit from the 80s!  Though the songs lyrical content is definitely more for the ladies, it's still catchy and the guitars make it sound more hard rock than the rest of the album! 9/1011. Through the Dark:  The folk sound is there again with Mumford and Sons sounding plucking.  The chorus has a slight Of Monsters and Men vibe.  This song makes me want to chase after the girl of my dreams through the dark.  See what I did there?  9/1012. Something Great:  This song is really something great.  The chorus is so corny in the best way.  Try not to feel the music when you hear it.  I don't know what to say, this is the definition of a good pop rock song.  10/1013. Little White Lies:  Obviously one of the more poppy songs on the album.  But still better than their tween sound from previous albums.  This could grow on me.  8.5/1014. Better Than Words: A whistling song.  This song really combines most of the sounds of the album to sum up an ending.  The corny lyrics make it perfect to listen to when you wanna get the message to your lover that they are 'better than words'.  I'd say this was a good close to the album from this growing boy band. 9/10So all in all, this album really is more mature than expected from the group.  I've never listened to the first two albums, but I'll take most peoples word that they were mainly for the teenage girl audience.  I never thought I would be listening to this group, but here I am enjoying their latest album.  The rock elements are a really nice touch.  I would say they have exited Justin Bieber territory and entered manhood with this album.  Fellow men, don't be ashamed to like this album!  This is their first and only album I'm gonna buy unless they make another more mature one next.  But if you do only ever buy one 1D album, let this one be it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G52E518BPL2D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1INPQM#wasThisHelpful","R2G52E518BPL2D","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first had a taste of Arcade Fire when my brother was playing their debut album ""Funeral"" in his car.  I had no idea who they were, but I liked their sound.  I finally found out it was Arcade Fire and I immediately bought my own copy.  It turned out that the song ""Wake Up"" was also getting commercial exposure in movie trailers and Super Bowl ads during that time too.  The album was a masterpiece as a whole.  I found out that the band was comprised of many musicians and I loved it.  Then I checked out their second album ""Neon Bible"" and it was more of the amazing baroque indie sound but much darker.  Though the album is my least favorite of theirs, I still love it to death.  Finally, ""The Suburbs"" was released and it was their first number one album.  It was also just as good, if not much better than ""Funeral"".  Beautiful music.  It won Album of The Year at the Grammys and I was so happy for them while most people were confused at who they were.  They really deserved the win.  Now, 3 years later they release viral videos and graffiti ads promoting a new album.  Then they released the music video for the lead single and title track of the album ""Reflektor"" featuring David Bowie.  It was a different sound, but a very great song.  I think Ive listened to the song at least 10 times a day until they released yet another lyric/music video of the song ""Afterlife"".  It was in my opinion even better than ""Reflektor"" and the video was just perfect.  I just couldn't wait for the new album.  Well it has finally arrived and I could not be happier.  I thought they wouldn't be able to top their last album, but I think they might have with this epic double disc set.  Here is a track by track review.Disc 1:1. Reflektor:  The beginning tribal drums remind me of The Rolling Stones ""Sympathy for the Devil"" a bit.  Then the song turns into an indie rock disco track.  Many immediately compared the sound to LCD Soundsystem, who's frontman produced the album.  At first I didn't think the chorus was great, but then as it was repeated more and more it became so infectious.  The way Regines and Wins vocals intertwine is magical.  Regine also sings some verses in French beautifully.  David Bowie gives a haunting guest vocal.  Favorite lyric is ""Thought you were praying to the resurrector, turns out it was just a reflektor"".  Great song to start off this great album with.  10/102. We Exist: The song immediately starts with a bass similar to ""Billie Jean"" with some sexy ""na na nas"".  The vocals are so smooth.  This is probably Arcade Fires most groovy song.  It was first played live on Saturday Night Live, but I'm glad I can finally hear the studio version.  3 minutes into the song the synths take over a bit and the vocals become more calm.  The last 2 minutes of the song get even better.  The songs bass will definitely get you moving.  10/103. Flashbulb Eyes: At first I thought I wasn't going to like the song because of its short length.  But I'm glad I was proven wrong.  This is a groovy trippy song.  The instrumentation of this song is amazing.  I can see this playing at a parade in a forest at night in Haiti.  I wish the song was at least a minute longer though.  It does lead into the next song rather smoothly.  9.5/104. Here Comes The Night Time: Another song that was played on Saturday Night Live well, but I'm glad to hear the album version finally!  The song starts out quick before slowing down into a groovy dance beat similar to The Killers song ""Believe Me Natalie"" just slightly.  The synths really give this an 80s feel at times.  Nearly 2 minutes into the song it turns into a slightly different sound with playful keyboards.  4 and a half minutes into the song things pick up pace in beautiful fashion similar to in Funerals ""Wake Up"".  This change in pace makes you feel like youre in the middle of a celebration in Haiti with Arcade Fire at ""night time"".  See what I did there?  The last minute of the song is a perfect sing along to end the song with!  10/105. Normal Person:  This song is like a rocking sister song to ""Modern Man"".  This is definitely Arcade Fires most rock n roll sounding song.  There is a perfect guitar riff that permeates the song throughout.  It is destined to become a classic guitar riff that will be covered over and over again!  This is going to be a great concert song to get the crowd hyped.  Regine also has a haunting vocal part during the bridge.  The ending has a really quick fast guitar part that I kind wish was used more!  10/106. You Already Know: This hand clapper of a song is really feelgood.  This song took me a few listens to get into, but its worth it.  It really gets better with repetition.  The chorus sounds the best toward the end of the song with Regines backing vocals!  Great song about seizing the moment!  9.5/107. Joan of Arc: The song starts out with a punk rocker spirit.  Then it turns into an anthemic song for the road.  The drums have that ""We Will Rock You"" spirit just a bit.  Regine showcases more of her French vocals, but not as good as in the title track, but still good!  The chorus seriously gets better every time I hear it!  This song might become a grower for most though.  There are some nice guitar moments sprinkled throughout the song, especially toward the end.  The song ends abruptly with silence to end the track.  Great way to end dico 1 of this masterpiece. 9.5/10Disc 2:1. Here Comes the Night Time part 2:  The silence from disc 1 leads into this sequel to the previous song of the same title.  This calm electronic song is very relaxing, especially toward its end.  Great calming start to the second disc.  9/102. Awful Sound (Oh Eurydice): The song starts out with the tribal drums before a sexy Bass starts up.  There is an apocalyptic sound to the beginning, but 2 minutes into the song it starts to sound more uplifting and beautiful.  There is something very emotional about Wins vocals, especially considering the Greek story of Orpheus this and most of the album is inspired by.  3 minutes into the song it gets even more beautiful with added backing vocals from Regine!  This is a very experimental epic and beautiful song.  This will sound great live.  10/103. Its Never Over (Oh Orpheus):  This song is more dance-y after the heartwrenching previous song.  This might instantly be one of my favorite tracks of all time.  The guitars and dance beat are just infectious!  Regine is more prominent in this song and she does more of her French vocals.  The chants of ""Hey Orpheus"" are typical Arcade Fire and remind me of ""Neighborhood 2"" just a bit.  There are nice horns in there too!  Near 4 minutes into the song Win and Regine compliment each other vocally so perfectly!  The final minute of the song is very very chill.  Probably the best progressive indie rock song ever.  10/104. Porno:  This finger snapping song is very synthbased in a great way.  As many of said, this one sounds like it could've been used in the Drive movie soundtrack.  This is a really really sexy song.  The sexiest song from the band.  I mean the title already hinted at that though.  Win gives some of his best vocal performances too.  Honestly this one sounds like it was produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.  That is a compliment!  Great different song for the band.  One of the best as well.  10/105. Afterlife:  This is my new favorite song from the band.  The dance beat and the U2 Achtung-Baby-esque guitars are amazing and catchy.  The music video works so well too using clips from the classic movie ""Black Orpheo"", which I now need to see!  The subject of this song is touchy and very emotional.  The chorus is one of the best from the band.  If I was in charge, this would be the next song of the year at the Grammys!  I don't know what else to say.  Just perfect and timeless.  11/106. Supersymmetry:  The title sounds like something ""Muse"" would do.  I had two feelings when I saw the 11 minute length of the song.  I was excited for epicness, and I was also hesitant at having to sit back at a possibly boring track.  I ended up somewhere in the middle of the two feelings.  Luckily, this track is far from boring.  In fact, its one of the more exciting songs from the band.  Very beautiful vocals from both Win and Regine symmetrically.  The song is very relaxing at the start with some 80s synths.  The U2 inspired sound is also present.  3 minutes into the track it starts to pick up the beat and get more anthemic and gorgeous!  The vocals also come to a halt turning the song into an instrumental the rest of the way.  At first this might sound off putting considering the length of the song, but I promise you this is one of the best.  Halfway in it seems to fade out, before slowly fading back in again.  It takes a while but the song ends with the last 4 minutes or so being a spacey sound.  It is said this is a hidden track, but I don't hear a real track.  I just hear ambient spacey noises.  I honestly wish they wouldn't have wasted all that time, but some will think its really artistic while many will call it annoying and pretentious to end the album this way.  I think the first 5 minutes make up for the last part of the song.  I do think if there were a movie based on the album that the spacey ending would fit well, but not for casual listeners.  10/10 strictly for the first part of the song.So I may sound biased since I gave most of the songs on the album a perfect score, but I'm confident that this is one of the best albums released in the past 10 years.  Some are saying this is Arcade Fires ""OK Computer""/""Kid A"".  I somewhat agree.  I might get a lot of disagreements for what I'm about to say, but I think this was much better than both of those Radiohead albums that seem to be brought up whenever an artist experiments nowadays.  This is Arcade Fires ""REFLEKTOR"".  This album has so many textures and layers that one will discover with each repeated listen.  I already keep discovering new things in the songs I didn't hear before.  As many have stated, the album does have a more dance-y feel to it.  It works really well though.  If there was any doubt that Arcade could surpass their ""Suburbs"" or ""Funeral"" album, this is the answer.  This album is almost too good.  This really is epic.  At over 70 minutes long, you really have to get settled in to really enjoy the album, but its worth it.  I won't be surprised if this album sweeps the next Grammy award season.  This will be analyzed by critics for years as one of the milestone albums of the 2010s decade of music.  Do yourself a favor and get this album if you like good music.P.S.  For those of you who didn't know, there is a hidden track in the beginning of the album.  Rewind past the beginning of track 1 and you will be treated to a 10 minute treat that I'm sure many of you will enjoy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28T6XEKS8U3JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F1CRSKM#wasThisHelpful","R28T6XEKS8U3JX","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I kept hearing about this band vaguely.  At first I didn't really pay attention to them.  All I heard was that they were a band of sisters who decided to start a band with the influence of their parents who enjoyed good rock music!  I didn't go crazy to look into the band though.  Then I heard that the sisters debut album kept Justin Timberlakes second ""20/20"" album from the top spot in the UK charts.  That is impressive.  If there's one thing I know, its that the UK usually foreshadow a groups success in the US.  So I read more into the bands impressive upbringing and I heard the song ""The Wire"" on the radio and liked it a lot.  I previewed other songs from the album on YouTube and I could not help myself, I had to get the CD.  Their sound is so 80s, yet futuristic at the same time.  There is even some R&B influence in there.  I also agree with many people who compare them to a more modern Fleetwood Mac, the music my parents liked!  So after a few good listens of this great debut album from 3 sexy, yet talented sisters, here is a track by track review.1. Falling:  The pulsing beat and guitars in this song are so relaxing yet danceable!  The singing is swift and heavenly.  Very sexy!  Some have even compared the vocals to Michael Jackson and I can't disagree.  There is something just majestic about this song.  The music video really suits the feel of the song.  Great song to start off this classic album!  10/102. Forever:  The transition into this song is just clever!  This really sounds like a lost 80s hit pop song!  Her vocals make me melt!  There is a nice guitar section in the a little over halfway that leads into one of the most infectious bridges I've ever heard in any song in recent memory.  Many have tried to emulate the sound of the 80s recently, and this is one of the songs that more than succeeds!  10/103. The Wire:  The first song I've heard from the band.  Probably the first song from the band to gain attention in the US.  The song has ""Anthem"" written all over it.  At first I thought it was way too poppy for me during the first part.  But then the last 90 seconds kicks in and blows me away.  After multiple listens I love the whole song more and more.  It just puts me in a good mood.  Feelgood song.  I hope this or another song hits big in the US!  Again, sexy vocals!  10/104. If I Could Change Your Mind:  The guitars are so urgent in this song in a good way!  The vocals are almost crooning at parts.  The chorus is beautiful!  Great song for any gender to listen to while thinking of that person whose mind you want to change!  10/105. Honey & I: There is a slight beach feel in this song.  The vocals sound a bit off beat at first, but I realized its part of the sound of the infectious song!  The chorus really gets better and better.  Listen to this at the beach with that special someone, or anywhere as long as you're with someone special!  9.5/106. Don't Save Me: The synths that are the backdrop to this song are nice.  The singing is seriously some of the most infectious and beautiful I've heard in a long time!  The chorus makes me feel all fuzzy inside.  Yeah I just said that!  Try not to sing along I dare you!  This song is the perfect combination of pop and rock!  10/107. Days Are Gone:  The sounds heard in this song are infectious!  The verses are golden, but honestly it took me a while to get into the chorus.  But when I finally did, I loved it!  The falsetto in the chorus latched onto me.  The bridge is also pretty catchy!  9.5/108. My Song 5:  This is the most modern sounding song.  It is also the most original!  The arrangement is just so smart and infectious!  The vocals from all sisters are really used as an instrument here!  The use of interweaving vocals is nicely done!  There is a nice guitar part also!  This is the most rocking song on the album!  10/109. Go Slow: As the title suggests, this is one of the slower songs.  It really is very relaxing!  It reminds me of the band The XX without the male vocals!  This song is going to become a 'love making' staple.  Very sexy and relaxing song.  The guitars, vocals and drums compliment each other so perfect.  This is one of the best songs of the decade!  10/1010. Let Me Go: The beginning and chorus sounds a bit like a Florence and The Machine song.  A minute and a half into the song the beat picks up pace!  It sounds like a great song to listen to while running in a forest!  Another great guitar part invades this song with a great solo sounding a bit like Black Sabbath!  These girls really have many great influences!  This is an epic epic epic pop song that rocks out!  10/1011. Running If You Call My Name:  This is a really chill song!  The vocals are just heavenly and again, sexy!  I seriously melted like 10 times from listening to the vocals from this album the first go round!  This song just closes the album perfectly and leaves you wanting so much more, but also feeling content!  10/10This album lived up to the hype.  Actually, this album surpassed the hype.  I was not expecting this pop rock masterpiece to be even half as good as it is.  This is beautiful music from 3 beautiful sisters!  I am a 20 year old male who listens to many types of music ranging from Eminem to Kanye West to System of A Down to The Beatles to Arcade Fire among many others.  But an all female band wasn't really ever on my radar until now and I am so glad and not ashamed to say this is one of my favorite albums of all time now.  The vocals are perfect in every song.  It's almost as if this album is too perfect!  The instruments engage beautifully.  The harmonies are just gorgeous.  This is what a pop album should be like.  It doesn't just sound like a collection of songs, it sounds like one big work of art, if that didn't sound too artsy.  This is music for anyone who likes good music!  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.  You won't regret it.  I'm predicting this band will have a long and prominent career!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336W3IIT2WKYI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECL7ZJ2#wasThisHelpful","R336W3IIT2WKYI","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always favored ""Panic! at the Disco"" over ""Fall Out Boy"".  I just found their music more mature and appealing to both sexes and Fall Out Boy was mostly for the girls.  There was even a year when Panic was much bigger than Fall Out Boy with their debut album, but then they started to fall off the radar and become forgotten.  This was honestly a huge impulse buy for me.  I loved the debut album ""Fever"", when I was a angsty teenaged dude in Middle/High School.  The album had mature lyrics, but the sound of teenage angst at the time.  The second album, ""Pretty. Odd"" caught everyone by surprise with its Beatles-esque feel.  I loved most of it.  After that I expected more of that.  Then they released ""Vices"" after most of the members left the band.  It sort of mixed the sound of the first album with the second.  It was a nice catchy album, but it seemed like Panic was about to be forgotten by the masses after that.  Years later, I'm more of an adult now and I listen to more mature music of all genres.  So I hear Panics new single ""Miss Jackson"" and I like it, but I didn't feel stoked for the new album.  The vibe of the song sounded too similar to Fall Out Boys comeback single.  By the way I passed on FOBs comeback album, though I did listen to it online.  Then the second single came out ""This is Gospel"" and it was just as catchy.  Still, I felt I was too ""manly"" now for this album so I didn't put it on my ""to buy"" list.  Well the week the album came out I was at Best Buy in the new releases section.  I just needed something new at the moment and this album was there among the Miley Cyrus album.  You could guess which one I impulsively brought to the check out.  So I didn't expect much from this album as I gave it is first listen.  But I am glad I bought it honestly!  Here is a track by track review!1. This is Gospel: This sounds a bit like Panics first album, but definitely more poppy.  The song is very upbeat.  At first I thought the ""If you love me let me go"" part was too corny and teenpop sounding, but now I find myself fighting not to sing along to it!  After actually listening to the lyrics, the opening and closing beats sound more like a heartbeat to me!  Great single and song to open up this comeback album!  9.5/102. Miss Jackson feat. Lolo: The comeback song.  At first I thought it was trying too hard to be like Fall Out Boys comeback song, but I honestly like this much more.  It is also more mature with its lyrics.  The chorus is pumping.  Probably one of the best chorus's from the band since ""I Write Sins..."".  The songs instrumentals have a hip hop feel to them and Lolos parts are nice and R&B sounding!  Great comeback single.  10/103. Vegas Lights:  Song starts with kids counting to ten then back to one before the song really starts.  The song has a 80s feel with its synths.  Lyrically it's about nights in Vegas, but the song could easily be played as a backdrop to any party filled crazy nights.  The chorus gets better and better each time I listen to it.  Throughout the song there are background chants of kids chanting ""5 4 3 2 1"" and its just catchy.  The bridge part of this song is one of the best parts of the entire album.  Great anthem for Vegas and crazy lifestyles in general!  10/104. Girl That You Love: The song immediately has a strong 80s influence.  Some parts have a robotic feel which reminds me of Daft Punk.  This is definitely a good trippy song for the club.  The synths and guitars work well together in this song.  9/105. Nicotine: When I first saw the title of this song I was skeptical because I'm a non smoker.  But the song isn't really about cigarettes at all.  Its mostly contrasting a bad relationship with nicotine.  You want to leave but you can't because you're addicted!  The song also has one of the best rocking guitar riffs of any Panic song.  The chorus is anthem worthy.  The bridge part is almost as good as the one in ""Vegas Lights"".  Great catchy song.  9.5/106. Girls/Girls/Boys:  At first I thought the song was going to be just some ""OneDirection"" type pop song.  But it actually has more of the awesome 80s vibes.  The vocals are also some of Brandens most powerful, especially in the chorus.  Oh the chorus.  Probably one of the catchiest chorus's from the band.  This could be a hit single.  I ignore the music video for this song though.  The music video is mostly for the ladies.  Still an undeniably catchy song!  10/107. Casual Affair:  On first listen I didn't really like this song.  It just sounded off to me.  Then after a few listens I loved it.  The slight orchestral moments in the song are a nice touch too.  The chorus really makes me want to have a casual affair!  Though I love the song now, it's not one of my favorites.  Still good though!  9/108. Far Too Young to Die:  Another 80s influenced song!  The synths are so perfect.  The chorus is simple, but I love it complimented with the synth riff!  Theres something very emotional about this song for some reason.  9.5/109. Collar Full: Yes, there's another 80s vibe on this song.  Again at first I thought the chorus was too corny for me.  But now I can't get it out of my head.  The melody is so infectious, especially the ""whoah oh oh oooh"" parts!  Nice poppy song.  9.5/1010. The End of All Things:  This might be the greatest song Panic has ever conceived in my opinion.  Its just outright beautiful.  The pianos and strings are heartbreakingly gorgeous.  This is the slowest song from the band, but in my opinion their best song.  The vocals have a robotic/heavenly feel at times.  Sometimes its hard to understand the lyrics, but you can still feel the emotion.  This song alone is worth the purchase of the album honestly!  I wish the song was longer though.  Still, amazing.  I must have listened to it over 50 times already.  Think of that special someone when you listen to this song for a fuller experience.  11/10So this is definitely a great album.  It really gets better with multiple listens like most great albums.  Also, its just a simple and fun pop album.  It's not trying to experiment, not that there's anything wrong with experimentation.  At a mere 32 minutes long, it's just a good straightforward pop album.  This can be seen as a big comeback for the band after their slight falling off with their last album.  I think this is a much better comeback album than Fall Out Boys recent one, which was also produced by Butch Walker.  Dare I say it?  This album might be their best overall album so far in their career.  Yes, I'm saying its better than ""Fever"" as a whole.  I found myself skipping songs on that album many times honestly.  All in all, great great simple yet infectious comeback album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D69227TBG89O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DZAWPNM#wasThisHelpful","R3D69227TBG89O","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I remember when N Sync broke up and Justin Timberlake was starting his solo career. Many thought he was just going to be another bubblegum pop singer. Then he wowed us with his debut ""Justified"" which contained mature pop and R&B songs. It was even nominated for Album of the Year. Then he released ""FutureSex/LoveSounds"" and changed pop music forever. It was the perfect genre bending pop album thanks to his dynamic singing abilities and Timbalands eclectic producing skills. Another Album of the Year nomination followed and the album sold better than his debut. He showcased his great falsetto, his dancing, and his innovation. After that he seemed to jump off the music radar and venture into a pretty successful acting career. Many people were craving another JT album. He only released 2 albums and he was already given a legendary status in the music industry. Then surprisingly nearly 7 years later he made his big comeback with ""Suit and Tie"" and his long awaited third album ""The 20/20 Experience"". The album was yet again produced with the help of his longtime friend Timbaland. It was a very refreshing and epic album. Some people were turned off by the progressively long songs as opposed to the more straightforward music they were used to. It experimented even further than ""Futuresex"" did and it succeeded. I was content with it and couldn't wait for another album. Then what do you know? Justin announced a second part to the 20/20 experience to be released. I was ecstatic. After what seemed like another long wait, the second album is here. This album is another reason why Justin Timberlake and Timbaland are one of the best dynamic duos of music. Though many think it isn't as adventurous as part 1, I think this was the better of the two for me personally. For those who wanted more of the ""FutureSex"" sound, this is it! Here is a track by track review.1. Gimme What I Don't Know(I Want): This opening song sounds like a return to the sound of ""Futuresex"". Think ""Sexy Ladies"" and ""Sexy Back"" in comparison to style. Around 3 minutes into the song it breaks down in perfect Timberlake/Timbaland fashion. Great production and futuristic sexual singing from Justin. Nice way to open the album! 9.5/102. True Blood: The song starts out with a dancing pump up beat right away with more of JT's ""Futuresex"" type beats and vocals. This really sounds like a sequel to ""Sexy Back"". The song has a sexy Halloween feel to it, which is perfect since the album came out during the Halloween season. Justin gives us this weird laugh during the chorus sounding like a male Lady Gaga, but it works. There is a Thriller-like narrative that goes on in the middle of this dance epic. There are nice guitar moments in the song as well. The chorus will make you wanna dance through a Halloween costume party in pursuit of a sexy vixen. The last 3 minutes of course contain a progressive change in tempo a bit that ends the song well. This song is over 9 minutes but it goes by so fast each time. 10/103. Cabaret Feat. Drake: Imagine the sound of Drake and Timberlake/Timbaland combined. That is what this song sounds like right off the bat. It works so great. Drakes guest appearance doesn't take away from the album at all. In fact it shows how modern Justin can be. I did however wish Drake should've sang the chorus along with Timberlake in his unique voice. He does showcase his robotic singing voice for a few seconds though. The 4 minute length of the song makes it a good single candidate probably. Great pop rap song. 9.5/104. TKO: This song is amazing. The song transitions well from the previous song. Many will find the sound and lyrical contents similar to ""Cry Me a River"". The song took me a few listens to get into, but when I did, I couldn't get it out of my head. The chorus is so infectious. The Timbaland production is infectious as always. Perfect song for how you feel when a girl betrays you. The chorus will sink its teeth into you and infect you so good you will be singing it in the shower. Of course the final 2 minutes end the song so well with a perfect breakdown of the chorus and a tasty hip hop beat. The ending is emotionally intense. One of JT's best. 10/105. Take Back The Night: Justin showcases his Michael Jackson like singing/falsetto. Seriously, he sounds like MJ more than ever and it's great. This really is a good homage to the late legend. Though not as good of a lead single as ""Suit and Tie"" and ""Sexy Back"", it is impossible not to get grooving to this song. Nice disco comeback. The horns will blow you away. Get on the dance floor for this one! 9.5/106. Murder Feat. Jay Z: The transition into this song is perfect. The beat is pumping. Justin uses his sing rap style nicely. Jay Z makes his second guest appearance. Its nicely executed, but not as good as his appearance in part 1. Again, the song takes another route within the last 2 minutes. This part of the song reminds me of Outkast! Great song, but not one of his best. It does get better with multiple listens of course. 9/107. Drink You Away: The guitars that open the song have a slight country feel to it. I'm glad the song isn't country at all. But it does sound like a classy futuristic western soul song. The chorus is a new sound for Justin, but it works. At first I didn't really like the song, but it gets better with repetition. The last 2 and a half minutes save the song for me. Not one of my favorites though. I'll still have to get used to it. 8.5/108. You Got It On: There is a sexy futuristic yet 90s feel to this one. Justin sings sweetly on this song. Very relaxing song to play while you're with that special someone. The chorus brings back memories of N Sync beautifully. He sings so swiftly in this song its hard not feel good listening to this song, no matter how corny it is. He makes it feel classy! Like the song states, this song sounds like falling in love. 10/109. Amnesia: This one starts out orchestral before turning into a pulsing and infectious beat. The chorus is another slight throwback to younger Justin! The last 2 minutes again are very beautiful. I don't know how else to explain how epic and emotional the ending of this song is! Justin really is the only one who can succeed in making 7 minute pop songs go by so fast. One of my favorites. 10/1010. Only When I Walk Away: The chorus of this song has a dance rock feel to it. It does get repetitive as it implants its melody into your mind. Great memorable guitars are featured as well. The song changes direction at the halfway point with a groovy beat until again changing pace with a minute left in the song. Another nice song! 9.5/1011. Not a Bad Thing/Pair of Wings: Be prepared to be hit with nostalgia. This song brings back the N Sync sound in full scale albeit some explicit lyrics. Another great feelgood song. Around the halfway point the second song/hidden track begins. It is an acoustic song in vein of ""Never Again"" and ""Another Song"". This song was solely produced by Timberlake. Its a really nice calm song to relax to after the pumping dance album that preceded it. Nice ending to the experience. 10/10So the critics are giving this album negative reviews in comparison to part 1. I think they are being too hard on it. A lot of people just had expectations too big for this album. Part 1 set the bar so high that they didn't welcome this more approachable album. Despite being longer than part 1, this one is more accessible. It is more catchy and poppy. Honestly, this is what I wanted the first 20/20 experience to sound like. I love that album, but this one is better for me. This album is funner too. Many think this album is a disappointment because it lacks the experimentation that made part 1 so groundbreaking. This does however sound more like a sequel to ""FutureSex/LoveSounds"" with some of the ""20/20"" sound sprinkled on top and I love that. I think this album is more of a treat to Justins fans who wanted more of the ""FutureSex"" vibe. Part 1 was more of a personal album. This one is having more fun and you can hear it a lot throughout. When it comes to musical growth and artistic experimentation, part 1 wins. When it comes to making a album that is just fun to listen to with catchy long songs and decent lyrics, this one wins. Either way this one has a lot more replay value. I will definitely have this on repeat longer than the first experience. Truly a great modern musical experience. If you like Justins other albums, you'll love this. It's a great combination of all of the sounds he's tried. If you need some good fun dance music then you'll also love this. It's worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35E4PRZQGUK4L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DWFQ2N4#wasThisHelpful","R35E4PRZQGUK4L","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I listen to all genres of music.  But I only purchase hip hop albums if they are truly good.  I remember when Drake went from being a Degrassi character to a so called rapper.  Many thought he was gonna be a Nickelodeon type rapper that wouldn't be taken seriously at first.  How often does an actor become a successful rapper?  Well his debut album ""Thank Me Later"" proved many wrong.  It was one of the best rap albums of 2010.  His sing-rap style isn't original, but he makes it sound so new and fresh.  His voice is a trademark now.  Then he released the highly anticipated ""Take Care"", which was a step up from his debut, but kept the same vibe thanks to continued help from producer ""40"".  That album was great, but I admit I got a little tired of some of the songs.  After the very good ""Take Care"" it was debatable whether this was Drakes peak or just the beginning of a long career.  ""Nothing Was The Same"" is the answer.  This might be Drakes new peak.  Not only is he the biggest rapper not named ""Eminem"" or ""Kanye West"", but he is very introspective in his lyrics.  The long awaited album was well worth the wait.  Here is a track by track review.1. Tuscan Leather:  The album starts up with a Kanye/Passion Pit type sample of Whitney Houston.  There is no real hook or chorus.  This is pure rapping for nearly 6 minutes.  But it still sounds radio friendly at the same time as stated in the lyrics.  The song picks up the beat more 2 minutes in turning into a club track.  Then it comes back to down tempo toward the end relaxing you then fading out with a sample of ""When Seasons Change"".  Perfect song to listen to while driving around a city like Miami!  This is one of my favorite Drake songs. 10/102. Furthest Thing:  This song expands more on the production style ""40"" is known for with Drake.  Very relaxing beat with Drakes sing rap style.  2 and a half minutes into the song it turns into an irresistible old school hip hop song with beats that will again remind you of older Kanye material!  Great song for guys to listen to while thinking of that 'ex'!  10/103. Started From The Bottom:  I used to hate this song when it came out as the lead single months before the album even had a title.  I almost gave up on Drake when this song first came out.  Like most people it was because Drakes 'bottom' was still pretty good.  But now I love the song!  Its my jam.  Still not one of Drakes best songs, but still really catchy.  It latches onto you and grows on you like a parasite.  A really catchy song parasite.  The chorus will be stuck in your head I promise.  9.5/104. Wu-Tang Forever:  Many hardcore Wu-Tang Clan fans hated on this song violently when it leaked online.  They thought it ruined a classic Wu-Tang song.  At first I just thought it was okay.  But like most great songs it really grew on me.  The ""Its Yourz"" sample sounds perfectly placed in the song.  Drake shows off some of his fast rap style among his sexual lyrics for women.  Great song to listen to with that special girl around.  9/105. Own It: Very explicit sexual song but never profane.  Its a sweet song again to play around that special girl.  Typical soft Drake song done well.  Drake does show off more of his superior rapping abilities over more atmospheric ""40"" instrumentals, something very common in this album. 9/106. Worst Behavior:  I'm getting redundant, but there is another slight Kanye sounding sample in this song.  Very well done!  The chorus is really explicit, but wow its infectious!  I'm sure many will find this a great song to work out to.  Drake is angriest he's ever sounded in this song, and I love it!  9.5/107. From Time:  The song starts off with a peaceful beat and piano riff!  Jhene Aiko gives a great singing performance in this song.  I never heard of her prior to this, but wow her voice is beautiful.  After the very peaceful hook, Drake again shows off his very quick rapping style with very personal lyrics.  The best type of lyrics for a rapper!  Just sit back and let this track sink in.  Light some candles if you need to.  Best line in the song ""She said I'd never be as big as Trey Songz/Boy was she wrong!""  10/108. Hold On, We're Going On:  This song.  I don't care how corny it is!  This song is golden.  This is Drakes best poppy song since ""Find Your Love"" and its even better than that song in my opinion.  Great backing vocals from the newly discovered ""Mijad Jordan"" as well!  This song really makes you wanna just save a girl from something negative in her life and just hold her hand.  10/109. Connect: A new sound for Drake musically.  Close to the 3 minute mark the song starts to sound futuristic a bit before turning down tempo again, something Drake songs are now known for!  Though again there isn't a real hook to this song, its Drakes trademark delivery that sticks with you!  9.5/1010. The Language: Musically this sounds like it could've been included in Kanyes ""Yeezus"".  Yeah, another Kanye comparison.  The chorus reminds me of Drakes appearance in the 2 Chainz song ""No Lie"".  But this is better of course.  Honestly, Birdman ruins the ending of the song a bit for me.  9/1011. 305 To My City:  The guest vocals from Detail remind me of The Weeknds breakthrough appearance on Drakes ""Take Care"".  But this is again, better!  Very atmospheric song with more great lyrics.  The sample reminds me of something Timbaland would make.  Drake is a good rapper ""I get it!"", you'll get it after listening to this song.  9.5/1012. Too Much:  Very personal and emotional song.  Sampha provides some very beautiful vocals for the hook.  Kudos again to ""40"" for providing a beautiful beat.  The lyrics are just great.  Great storytelling song about life and family.  10/1013. Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music:  I will say it again, another instrumental comparable to Kanye!  The song starts with a narrative and the song takes off with a great great great instrumental.  The main sample is from an Ellie Goulding song and it goes beautifully with Drake and Jay Zs rapping.  There is also another perfectly placed Wu Tang sample in the mix!  Jay Z provides a great guest appearance, certainly better than his recent albums material!  Then suddenly the song changes pace into what sounds like a completely new song over 4 minutes in.  This is probably the ""Paris Morton Music"" portion of the song.  The piano is so beautiful as it glides around in the background of Drakes lyrics.  7 minutes long, but it goes by so fast.  I wish this wouldn't end.  Great track to end this new hip hop classic.  10/10So this is arguably Drakes best album so far.  This might even be one of best rap albums of 2013.  It's almost in the league of the critically acclaimed, but also hated ""Yeezus"" from Kanye West.  This album really is a step up for Drake.  It will be very difficult for him to top this near hip hop masterpiece.  I think Drake is the only rapper on YMCMB worth listening to.  He is definitely the best and most talented of the bunch.  This could gain Drake his first Album of The Year Grammy nod, hopefully.  Drake went from a rapper many thought would fall off quick, to possibly the biggest rapper of the 2010s decade.  This is a very mature and well executed rap album.  The album gets better with each listen, like most great albums.  You will discover new things in the songs each time I promise.  Other rappers of today can learn a thing or two from this album.  This is real music.  Even if you don't normally like rap, this album could win you over if you give it a chance.  New Hip Hop Classic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQ58UP6KAPUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDPFJA4#wasThisHelpful","RRQ58UP6KAPUO","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I still remember when I first listened to Arctic Monkeys classic debut album ""Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not"".  Even just the title was intriguing.  It was one of the best post punk indie rock albums ever.  Also one of the best rock records in the 2000s.  The album had small success in the US, but did get a Grammy nomination.  Then a year later they released their second masterpiece in a row titled ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"".  I loved the slightly different musical direction of the album.  It was another classic, but still the US was almost ignoring the band!  Two years later they released ""Humbug"", which was also a great album.  It was more psychedelic and sometimes reminded me of ""The Doors"" and legendary bands from the 60s.  Then came what was honestly my least favorite album, ""Suck It and See"".  It was a great album, but definitely a step down for me.  I almost gave up on the band after that album.  Finally they released ""R U Mine?"" as a single.  It was the best song I've heard from the band in years.  Then came ""Do I Wanna Know"" and finally ""Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?"".  The band said the album took influences from Hip Hop, most notably ""Dr Dre"" and I could hear it in the lead singles.  Needless to say, I was sold and I couldn't wait to own the album.  Finally here it is, and it is truly an amazing collection of songs.  Here is a track by track review.1.  Do I Wanna Know?: The best single from the band since ""When The Sun Goes Down"" in my opinion.  The pulsing hip hop beat will make you wanna clap along.  The guitar riff is destined to become a classic.  The way Alex muses the verses is perfect.  The song is getting recognition in the US and I'm glad!  Definitely one of my favorites.  10/102.  R U Mine?: At first I thought this was just gonna be a stand alone single.  Then it was included in the album.  Really a great rocker song reminiscent of ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"".  More great guitars!  Great great song!  10/103.  One For The Road: The song already starts smooth with a perfect chorus.  Then the hip hop bass kicks in.  Really does have that ""Dr Dre"" funky feel!  The guitar solo is tasty and the background chants of the chorus are candy for the ears.  10/104.  Arabella:  Another great hip hop beat and bass leads this song.  Then before you know it a Black Sabbath ""War Pigs"" sounding combination of guitars and drums kicks in.  Its really energizing!  9.5/105.  I Want It All:  Nice guitars in the song.  For some reason I hear an ""Outkast"" influence in the vocals of the chorus! 9/106.  No.1 Party Anthem: Many would assume from the title that this would be a pumping party song.  Wrong!  This is a beautiful ballad along the lines of ""505"" and ""Cornerstone"".  I think this makes those other ballads seem boring, because this one is just so perfect!  I don't know what else to say.  Great song to calm you down in the middle of the album!  10/107.  Mad Sounds: Another great ballad with a ""Beatles"" sound to it.  I thought the other ballad would be the only good one on the album.  But this was also just beautiful!  The ""Oooo la la laaaa"" parts are just soothing and gorgeous!  10/108.  Fireside: The beat of this song is urgent and mysterious!  There are great backing vocals chanting ""shoo wop shoo wop"" so infectiously during the chorus!  The last half of the song gets even better and sexy!  Another perfect song.  10/109.  Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?""  This song.  This song has the biggest ""Dr Dre"" influence as evident in the thumping groovy bass!  The smooth and sexy vocals.  The sexy chorus.  The sexy backing vocals!  This song is just sexy and amazing.  10/1010.  Snap Out of It: A nice clapping song!  Of course the chorus is just delicious!  9.5/1011.  Knee Socks:  This is my new favorite song from the band.  The guitars are great.  The vocals are some of the best from Alex and so smooth.  The chorus is the sexiest I've heard from any band in a long time.  Try not to get the chorus stuck in your head I dare you.  This would be a great single!  I thought track 9 would be the sexiest, but this definitely steals the cake!  11/1012.  I Wanna Be Yours:  This ballad has a slow hip hop beat, but nice beautiful psychedelic guitars.  Again the chorus is slow sexy perfection.  This song is great to play for someone you want to fall in love with you.  Nice relaxing way to end this nearly perfect album. 10/10So this album was consistently great.  There were no tracks I would skip.  Many can agree this is the bands best album since the ""Favourite Worst Nightmare"".  But I can truthfully say that this might be my favorite from the band altogether!  This album is very sexy in its feel and vibe.  Also a great soundtrack for single people, mostly men.  I feel this might finally open the US eyes to the greatness of this band again!  They deserve all the recognition they get.  Arctic Monkeys fans, this is a must buy.  If you're new to the band, this is also a great album to get introduced to the band.  Another timeless masterpiece.  Also one of the few albums that got the ""Hip Hop""/""Rock"" vibe perfect!  Well worth the money!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N020HF2I0I7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKY4LBW#wasThisHelpful","R2N020HF2I0I7I","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nine Inch Nails are one of the few more hardcore bands that manage to stay relevant and greatly artistic at the same time.  I admit after the release of ""The Slip"" and the Ghosts, I thought NIN were done with making full albums.  Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross started doing musical scores for movies which were amazing, earning them an Oscar win that was well deserved.  But in their absense from NIN music I started listening to all kinds of other types of music.  I even started listening to more calm bands and even some poppy indie bands.  I also ventured into some Hip Hop since then and I don't regret that.  This album can be seen as a comeback because ""The Slip"", though a full length album, was released for free as a gift to fans.  But Trent did release the album physically for those who wanted to actually own the album.  That album was great, but still didn't feel like a REAL NIN album just because of its release method.  Also around that time the ""Ghosts"" were gradually released the same way and though they were haunting and beautiful instrumentals, I wanted something more.  So there was an absence for 5 years before I finally heard that NIN were releasing a new album in the traditional manner and on a major label again.  Not that the label matters, but it just felt more official to me!  The release of the lead single ""Came Back Haunted"" was a welcoming sound to my ears.  I haven't heard hard rock/industrial sounds this good in years.  Then the albums title was released.  It had the same edgy dark theme as ""The Downward Spiral"" and I couldn't wait.  Now it's finally here!  It was well worth the wait and money.  Here is a track by track review.1. The Eater of Dreams:  Short but haunting instrumental intro.  Its okay for me, but I've had enough instrumentals after the Ghosts.  It does lead into the next track well though.  6.5/102. Copy of A:  At first when this was released as a second single I thought it was just okay.  This song features more of the electronic sounds from ""Year Zero"" and Trents excellent movie scores.  The chorus gets better with each listen.  The second verse has some industrial background sounds similar to the ""Downward Spiral"" and its just great.  9.5/103. Came Back Haunted:  The comeback single.  This is definitely one of the best NIN songs hands down.  Its a shame it wasn't as commercially successful as some of NINs previous singles, but oh well.  Still great.  Pumping beats, addictive chorus and perfect industrial sounds!  One of NINs best dance rocker songs.  I have to say this.  After all those Ghosts, its no surprise Trent came back haunted.  (haha).  10/104. Find My Way:  The album slows down with this hauntingly beautiful industrial ballad.  The song, like a lot of NINs best, builds upon itself to the somewhat climatic end.  The piano featured in the song is simple yet addictive!  9/105. All Time Low:  This has got to be one of my new favorite NIN tracks.  It has this groovy feel to it.  If it were up to me, this would be the next single.  There is even a soulful influence in Trents voice.  He delivers a perfect falsetto before the chorus that would even impress the likes of Robin Thicke.  The second verse really makes you wanna yell along to the lyrics as if you're marching with Trent and Atticus!  A little after 4 minutes into the song it starts to break down a bit and Trent muses his falsetto in the background of the 80s sounding keyboards a bit before fading out  I can really see this song featured in dance clubs today.  Well I would love to hear it there at least. 10/106. Disappointed:  The beat really starts out pumping right away in this song.  Trent sings some cryptic vocals to the beat before the chorus angrily kicks in with great industrial fashion.  Really reminds me again of the ""Downward Spiral"" a bit.  The setup of the song is similar in structure to ""Copy of A"" with a nice background sound in the second verse before exploding to an even more pumping second chorus.  There is a nice breakdown bridge in the song too with some nice groovy instrumentals to end the song.  There is kind of an Egyptian feel to these instrumental parts for me and I love it!  Like Trent was venturing into the Pyramids during this song.  9/107. Everything:  I don't understand what all the hate was for when this song first came out.  People called it too poppy or whatever.  I will admit at first I didn't really like it at first listen, but not because it sounded poppy, because it didn't live up to previous singles.  But regarding the poppy sound, I seriously don't even think this song sounds poppy.  Just more happy compared to other songs by NIN.  In fact, the chorus is the opposite of poppy.  The song really has grown on me though, but still isn't one of my all time favorites.  I do see this as a good song to work out to though.  8/108. Satellite:  Another good industrial song to dance to!  Again there is more of the falsetto in the background vocals that goes so well with the feel of the song.  The chorus is sexy in a NIN way and it gets better with repetition.  The song also contains some of the best guitars I've heard from NIN and from rock music in a long time!  Great great great song.  10/109. Various Methods of Escape: Song starts out a bit quiet before exploding into an amazing rocking chorus.  The guitar in the chorus is excellent!  There is a perfectly beautiful breakdown that is pretty emotional in its sound before exploding back into the rocking guitars.  This would make a great single as well in my opinion!  I would recommend this songs motivational sound to your work out routine soundtrack also!  10/1010. Running: Ironically this song is perfect to listen to while running.  The beat reminds me of an industrial African sound.  The sounds in this song are wild and crazy but the song never turns into noise.  Its all handled with such craft like always by NIN. 8.7/1011. I Would For You: The song sounds angry in nature, but it really isn't.  The verses are great.  The chorus is a grower but still awesome.  There is a nice guitar solo before a ""Closer"" sounding piano comes in to end the song with!  This song might get better for me with time though!  8.5/1012. In Two:  The beginning of the song will remind many of the great NIN song ""We're In This Together"".  Trents verses venture back into the Hiphop sounding style he would use sometimes in ""Downward Spiral"" and ""Prety Hate Machine"".  The chorus is very electronic before he brings in his falsetto again with some nice industrial guitar to compliment each other.  The song manages to be angry and melodic at once.  There is a breakdown that really sounds just like the breakdown in the song ""Mr. Self Destruct"".  Seriously it sounds like a more melodic brother to that song!  The breakdown bridge builds back up with some infectious guitar that sounds like Black Sabbaths ""War Pigs"" just a bit!  One of the best songs from NIN hands down. 11/1013. While I'm Still Here: This song will surprise you in your first few listens after the intensity of ""In Two"".  This is another build up song.  The difference here is the song just constantly builds up more and more but never really explodes.  That isn't bad though, it's actually really nice.  There is a nice horn section at the end and it really leads into the next track so swiftly.  9/1014.  Black Noise:  The better of the two instrumentals.  I do however think this wouldve been better if they just combined it with the previous track.  They really do sound like one big nice ending to the album.  Still a nice industrial end to a great comeback album that leaves you haunted, but not sad!  9/10Deluxe Edition has some good bonus tracks too.So this album was consistently great.  There was no track I felt like skipping.  It is an epic collection of great NIN comeback songs.  The album is also slightly more uplifting in tone compared to earlier NIN work, but that doesn't mean it is a happy album.  The album is just not depressing despite the suicidal title.  Many have said this album sounds like a return to the ""Fragile"" and ""Downward Spiral"" era.  I sort of agree.  I mostly think this is like more of a continuation of ""Downward Spiral"" in style than ""The Fragile"" was.  I wouldn't have questioned it if this was given the title ""The Downward Spiral 2"" or ""The Upward Spiral"" honestly.  Though this does sound a lot like the older NIN, it sounds fresh and new at the same time.  This is definitely  better than the previous 3 releases in my opinion.  Best NIN album since ""With Teeth"".  This album even has the potential to gain many new NIN fans.  If you're new to the band then I suggest you give this album at least 3 listens before you form a full opinion.  My method when listening to a new album is for me to listen to it 3 times in order.  Then I start to put the album on shuffle and I begin to discover new things in each song!  All in all, I think this is one of the best releases in the rock genre in a long time.  Rock music has been dominated by more of the poppy and indie bands(nothing against them, I like some good indie bands) lately but I think this album would help bring back more of the edgier rock thats been missing in recent years.  Really worth the money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CLLQHWXHLAY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8HNR5W#wasThisHelpful","R3CLLQHWXHLAY","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"- Synopsis - If you've seen the trailer then you know basically the entire movies premise. A couple is driving down the road looking to 'relocate'. They stop for a night at a motel and get some dinner. While having dinner they are harassed by a member of this group of criminals before the leader stops him. Later on the couple is run off the road by the man who harassed them and kidnapped. Though at first the leader disagrees when finding out what has happened, he changes his mind soon enough. One of the bigger members of the group is threatening to torture the couple in a secluded location. Suddenly the lady takes her own life before anything can happen to the surprise of the torturer and dismay of her handcuffed lover. The man escapes his handcuffs and kills the torturer, showing a violent well trained side to him and sets out to get revenge on the rest of the group. But the couple have been hiding a terrible secret this entire time that will disturb even the ruthless criminals who kidnapped them. Thats just part of the plot. There are some more small subplots, but you'll just have to see the movie yourself to find out!This movie caught me by surprise. Of course anyone who has seen the trailer knows that the twist of the movie is given away. Even the DVD/Blu Ray cover itself gives away the twist. This movie could have had a wider theatrical release and could have been more successful if the marketing was handled better. I feel like, if under the right marketing hands, the movie could have been just as financially successful as the WWE studios last horror movie ""The Call"". I initially thought this was going to be another mindless B movie from the mostly horrible films the WWE studios puts out. I was dead wrong. Even though what could have been one of the more interesting twists in recent horror movies was given away so carelessly, this movie still packs a decent punch. The Director is Ryuhei Kitamura. He directed his first American movie ""The Midnight Meat Train""(No it's not a porno) starring Bradley Cooper and based on a story by Clive Barker. That movie was visually stunning for the Horror genre and was a okay horror movie thanks to the ""Clive Barker"" aspect. Parts of this movie contain the visual cleverness of ""Midnight Meat Train"", but some parts do look a bit amateurish. Some say because it's supposed to pay homage to 70s Grindhouse movies. I bought this impulsively and decided to save money and just get the cheaper DVD, but now I kinda wish I had bought the Blu-Ray because I would like to have seen how some of the more visual scenes would have looked in HD. Like most horror movies, this is best viewed at night, literally.The first 20 minutes are really good and tension filled. The middle part of the movie slightly goes a bit downhill in the horror aspect. The killer wasn't used to his full potential in some scenes and the editing seemed choppy at times. But it was still full of serial killer tension. Some of the dialogue from the less talented actors ruined some of the middle scenes, but it didn't turn into a disaster. The last 20 minutes is where the movie shines the most. It has action, killing, decent dialogue for a horror movie, a good ending, and a nice soundtrack similar to the Saw theme. The movie had decent horror movie music, but the final scene/credits is where the soundtrack really shines. I think the ending was cliché, but very well done. Dexter fans, the last 20 minutes might remind you of that show a bit.Luke Evans(Immortals, Fast and Furious 6) does a great job in his sociopath role. Some said he seemed wooden and couldn't act well. That was the way his character is supposed to seem. Wooden and awkward, yet charismatic! He plays a great psychopath! The only other notable performance is Adelaide Clemens(Silent Hill 2) who reminds me of Michelle Williams! She was nice in her ominous role. She is also very pretty. The rest of the cast are decent at best, but still better than B-movie standards.I'm not saying this is better than recent horror movies like ""The Conjuring"", ""Insidious 1 and 2"", or ""You're Next"", but I still think this movie is better than most horror movies that get a wide theatrical release. It was definitely way better than the 2013 Texas Chainsaw Massacre! This had a theatrical run, but barely. ""No One Lives"" has the potential to become a horror cult classic. I hope that the DVD release will expand its audience! This is a good way to spend a boring night when you have nothing else to do. You don't have to buy it, but at least give it a rental. It is one of the better horror movies in recent memory truthfully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28KMJPCFX3NLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3LA6M0#wasThisHelpful","R28KMJPCFX3NLW","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a fan of ""The Gos""(Ryan Gosling). I admit I even tried to emulate him in ""Drive"" and ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". He is a great actor and he always seems to make great movies whether they are mainstream or independent. He has already received recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""Half Nelson"". I was excited to see what character he would bring to life next when I heard about this movie. I saw the running time of 140 minutes and saw the trailer. I wondered how they were gonna make a movie of Gosling and Cooper last that long without dragging. Then I found out that Gosling is only in the first third of the movie despite him being the face of the movie. At first I felt disappointed, but I got over it because I know that isn't a way to judge a movie. So I went in after hearing mostly praise for this gem of a film.If most of you haven't already figured out, the movie is divided into 3 acts. The first follows Luke(Gosling) a motorcyclist from a traveling carnival who quits upon finding out he has a son. He struggles to provide for the son Jason, who's mother Romina(Eva Mendez) is now with another man. He resorts to robbing banks. These actions lead into the Second act which follows Avery(Bradley Cooper) after he has a traumatic run in with Luke. Avery, a cop who also has a son, is struggling with corruption within the police station. Soon he finds a job as the Assistant DA. The third act takes place 15 years later. Now Luke and Averys sons Jason and AJ are teenagers. Soon they become frenemies. All of the actions from the first two acts collide into a dramatic finale. That is just the gist of the plot.The first act was emotionally tense. This was also the best of the three acts in my opinion. Each act was like a mini movie. But this act could have been expanded into a separate movie if possible! It was intense, the dialogue with Ben Mendelsohns character was great. Ben Mendelsohn should really be recognized for Best Supporting Actor here. Gosling gives a great performance as an Outlaw type, but also a caring man who just wants to provide for his son.The second act featured less of the emotion from the first act and more of the crime aspect of the movie. For a second I thought Martin Scorcese had taken over the script. That is a compliment. Cooper also does great acting here! At first you will hate his character, but as you realize what is going on, you will almost forget about the first act and now focus on the story of Avery!The third act seems to be getting the least praise. I am confused with that. Some are saying it was unneeded. I strongly disagree with those opinions! This was the perfect way to end this story! Many people are complaining that it was too cliché to include this part. It wasn't as good as the first two acts, but it was still great. The fact that the two sons meet and become friends is intriguing. It makes you wonder what will happen scene after scene. Great climatic ending to the movie!The directing is top notch. This movie is beautiful to watch. It did what movies that use an overload of CGI mostly can't do. It told a genuinely good and tension filled story. I do like some movies with some good CGI, but I love movies that don't rely on special effects even more! The acting was stunning from all members of the cast. Its hard to choose a best actor between Gosling and Cooper, but there is no doubt in my mind that Ben Mendelsohn did a magnificent job in his supporting role! The story of this movie is gut wrenching. Its a drama. Its a crime drama. Its a thriller. Its even a R rated High School movie in the final act at times. It is a modern epic tragedy. It is a tale of karma and decisions. I personally think it is much better than Director Derek Cianfrances last film with Gosling ""Blue Valentine"". This movie had me on the edge of my seat throughout, especially in the third act. Again regarding the third act, I think most people aren't too keen with it because of the way one of the teens talks throughout. I got used to it within 5 minutes though as I thought it was actually a nice touch. The music of the movie is brilliantly placed too. The musical score was haunting and beautiful. The main theme cuts deep especially the way it was used in the film! Stay with the credits to finalize the experience because the song ""The Wolves"" by Bon Iver that plays is a true emotional masterpiece that goes well with the movie that preceded it!I recommend this movie to anybody that loves a genuinely good original movie. This movie does demand your full attention though. If needed, you might have to put on the subtitles to fully understand some of the less audible dialogue. But that is your personal choice. This is a great movie for men particularly, whether you're a father, a son or both. This movie is great for women too, but men will have a more personal experience with the movie! This movie will stick with you either way!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30LKHOK3L7MOU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYKM6#wasThisHelpful","R30LKHOK3L7MOU","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had my first taste of ""Fitz and the Tantrums"" around 2011 when their song ""Moneygrabber"" was gaining small popularity.  I never really paid attention to who it was by back then, but I just loved the oldschool nature of the song.  It was so infectious and the vocals were so powerful.  It was a great song about money grubbing exes.  I still wonder how it didn't become a huge megahit.  Well after that I just forgot about them.  Then my friend sent me their new song ""Out of my League"" and I was just slightly impressed on my first listen.  Then I listened to it again and it suddenly became an anthem for me and a summer hit!  I looked up more information on the band and realized they were behind the aforementioned ""Moneygrabber"" and I was glad that they were finally getting more popular.  I then listened to their first album to see if they were the real deal.  They are.  Then I listened to a few of the songs from this album and was hooked and had to purchase it!  The music on this album is some of the best I've heard in years!  I am also finally realizing how perfect the bands name is.  Their name is so clever and oldschool!  Here is a track by track review.1.  Out Of My League:  The song that will be known as the song that made them famous.  Though the song isn't as great as ""Moneygrabber"", it seems to have such a simple and infectious groove.  Fitz has a unique yet familiar sounding voice!  Noel is the co lead singer, but in this song she only provides background vocal effects that work really well.  Great summer song! 10/102.  Break the Walls:  Great great great.  Nice upbeat poppy song with a thumping chorus.  Powerful vocals from both Fitz and Noelle during the verses.  Very uplifting fun song!  9/103.  The Walker:  This song has 'hit' written all around it.  It has a very infectious whistling featured in it.  The chorus is rocking, yet doesn't even feature a guitar!  That is how great this band is.  They are one of the best bands that doesn't primarily use a guitar, if ever.  I can see this song featured in movies and commercials.  The bridge sounds nice and oldschool.  Great song to motivate yourself with!  10/104.  Spark:  Another song that is worthy of being released as a single!  The riff has a ""Black Keys"" vibe but with perfect vocals from Fitz.  The chorus is pure megahit material.  The ""oh oooh ooooh ooooooh"" parts are so catchy!  Not only that, but it is a well crafted song that will have you humming it long after listening to it!  Great party song too!  10/105.  6am:  This is the best song on the album for me.  Like the rest of the songs, it has potential to become a hit single!  The vocals of both Fitz and Noelle.  The keyboard riff just makes me feel so good inside.  The lyrics pine over an ex, but the music is so uplifting and perfect.  This is one of those timeless songs that will never get old.  I could play this song 100 times and still not get tired of it.  This is song will become an anthem, mark my words!  11/106.  Fools Gold:  Another great song!  The drums and piano are nicely done.  The vocals from Fitz again are so powerful and perfect.  There is a slight 80s vibe going on in this song!  The chorus is perfect as always.  Fitz seems to have one of the greatest voices in music right now and I hope him and Noelle get recoginized!  10/107.  Keepin Our Eyes Out:  A very mellow and upbeat song.  The instruments are happy and the vocals are playfully catchy!  The piano is simple yet they compliment the vocals so well.  9/108.  Last Raindrop:  This is right behind ""6am"" as one of the best songs ever!  The synths cut deep.  The vocals cut deep.  The chorus cuts DEEP.  This song is emotionally perfect!  Like many of Fitz songs this sounds oldschool but modern at the same time.  Listen to this after a break up and try not to tear up.  Also good even if you're single.  Just a great song!  10.5/109.  House on Fire:  The other song that slightly has a ""Black Keys"" vibe.  Vocals are great as always.  The chorus sounds like a choir preaching in a good way with lots of soul.  Great song, but not in the league as the past few masterpieces.  8/1010.  The End:  Nice fun upbeat song with a piano riff guiding the song to its soaring chorus!  Great song to listen to in the city while thinking of an ex in my opinion.  9/1011.  Get Away:  Yet another song with the ""Black Keys"" vibe in the instruments, think the song ""Gold on the Ceiling"".  I'll just say the chorus is very rocking much like ""Spark"" and ""The Walker"".  Motivational!  9/1012.  MerryGoRound:  Fun instrumentals!  Emotional vocals.  Playful chorus.  The piano during the verses are there, but hard to hear.  But once you hear the pianos you'll know what I'm talking about when I say they are very nice!  The synths are again fun!  The bridge reminds me of Coldplay and maybe some U2.  Nice way to close this fun and great album!  10/10So this album was very consistently great.  It was catchy and good without sounding too needy like most pop songs of today!  Almost every song on this album could be a hit single.  Most of the songs are about exes, but even if you don't have an ex to pine over, this album is great regardless!  I really hope Fitz and the Tantrums finally get the recognition they deserve!  I'm glad they are finally being heard too because I found out that Fitz is in his 40s at the time that I write this review.  This is proof that hard work and talent can pay off and it's never too late!  This music is perfect for all ages.  New enough for kids, teens and young adults.  Oldschool enough for older people who miss the way music used to sound.  This is timeless music.  Even if you aren't into pop, indie rock or Neo Soul influenced vocals, this album will win you over I promise!  This is what the music industry needs, a band that isn't too corny, but is fun and artistic.  Plus both lead singers are great singers!  This album is more than just a good album.  It's a pop masterpiece.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A0EP0PH4YEEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CJSHJKU#wasThisHelpful","R1A0EP0PH4YEEO","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love all kinds of movies from all genres whether they are mainstream released or independent distributed. A good movie is a good movie. Out of all the genres, I have always enjoyed a good horror movie. But even more, I enjoy mysterious Gothic horror movies!I read the negative reviews and expected to hate the movie. But I ended up enjoying it! This movie is, like many reviewers have stated, very different from Francis Ford Coppolas previous works. Mr. Coppola has directed some of the greatest films ever made and many were destroying this film because it wasn't like the rest of his filmography. This happens to be one of the best Horror films in recent memory. I can see why this wasn't released nationwide in theaters because of it's independent art house feel. But I still thought this was better than a lot of the Horror movies that were graced with a nationwide theater count. The look of the film doesn't look like a typical horror movie in theaters, but it also doesn't look like direct-to-video quality.  This is a great ghost, murder mystery movie with mesmerizing Gothic visuals. It almost had a 90s feel. The vibe of the film with its small town eerie setting reminded me of the John Carpenter classic ""In the Mouth of Madness"" at times. The acting is decent. Val Kimmer is okay as the lead and Elle Fanning is showing that she has more acting capabilities than her sister Dakotah. The make-up effects for the ghostly character V and others were simple yet haunting and clever. The cinematography is nicely done. One other memorable aspect of the film was the eerie soundtrack. It is beautiful and creepy at the same time which helps with the tone of the film. This movie as a whole reminded me of an R rated Goosebumps movie. I mean that in a good way. Many are saying the story is downright stupid or doesn't make sense. Well honestly, I love the dreamy incoherent plot. I could understand completely what was going on, but sometimes I just got lost in the artsy visuals that I didn't really care whether the story made sense or not. This is labeled as a Horror movie and I honestly expected more scares.  But when I first watched it, I only jumped one or two times, and never saw anything that frightened me.  I felt a little disappointed at that and felt I had wasted 16 bucks on this movie.  Then after the ending, I just felt an uneasy feeling brought to me from the film.  I felt creeped out.  This movie isn't terrifying, but after much thought, it was scary at times.  The movie sticks with you after the ending.  That's what is masterful about this type of horror.  This movie is receiving tormented reviews right now, but I can tell that throughout the years the reviews will get more and more positive. This isn't a mega masterpiece, but it is a good enough movie to have positive feedback.  I'm saying you should give this a try before assuming it is bad because of the negative reviews. You might like it, you might hate it. But if you want a nice visual treat of a Horror/suspense movie, then rent or buy this. Turn off the lights, and enjoy the mysterious creepy ride!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A9X8NN9VCJHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CTQWIGC#wasThisHelpful","R3A9X8NN9VCJHZ","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE the original 'Evil Dead' Trilogy by Sam Raimi. I'm not like the angry people who immediately dismiss remakes of classic horror movies because they aren't the same as the original. Well remakes aren't supposed to be the same or better than the original. I loved the spirit of this raunchy creepy gore filled remake/re-imagining of 'Evil Dead'. Sadly main character of Ash is totally gone. But I gave it a chance. A good horror movie is a good horror movie. Sure we had the horrible remakes, but there have been some good ones.Synopsis:After an intense introduction which involves a sort of Exorcism, we are introduced to the main characters. The iconic lead character of Ash played by Bruce Campbell is replaced by the female lead of Mia played by newcomer Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez as her brother. Many are enraged by this change, but I accepted it. I mean honestly, it would be even worse if they decided to remake the Ash character with a new actor. Seriously, no one can fill Bruce Campbells shoes. That being said, I was actually impressed with the approach the film takes this go-round.  5 friends gather at a Cabin to help one of the group, Mia, overcome her drug addiction.  As the hours go by she gets edgy and they discover a basement full of witchcraft type items.  One of the group brings out a book and starts to read from it.  This is when the demons start to take over.  As the movie progresses I honestly felt the movie didn't really have a lead character because 3 of the 5 characters seem to become equally important.The imagery is beautifully gruesome. The tension builds up in creeping terror fashion until the scares start to get louder and more prominent toward the end. There are even certain aspects of the remake that pay great homage to the original Evil Dead.  The quick shot of the Chainsaw.  The implication that the girls hand will become possessed like Ashes hand. The terrifyingly creepy cellar scenes. The demonic Necronomicon book of the dead is present of course. When the guy reads from the book you know right away that horror is about to follow. The movie has a constant feeling of dread from that moment on.  There are some scenes that will make people laugh, but for the most part, this movie was relentless horror! The movie also had a little heart. There were certain scenes that will bring out emotions in the audience and make you think ""What would I do if that happened to me and my loved ones?"" I admit there was a part where I almost felt a tear forming in my eye.The make up effects are disgustingly real. Don't see this movie if you have a weak stomach. I read that they refrained from using CGI effects in this movie to stay true to the spirit of the old school approach of the original. I loved that they chose to do that. The demons in this had the true 'Evil Dead' feel to them. I was so creeped out the entire movie. The faces of the demons are some of the scariest images since ""The Exorcist"".  I felt like a kid again watching ""The Exorcist"" for the first time. The voices of the demons will surely haunt most viewers for nights. I definitely closed my closet door after seeing this movie. The directing is clever and creepy. This movie has a lot of good examples of how a horror movie should be made. The actors and actresses give believable performances. The actress who plays 'Mia' was so good in her terrorized and demonic performance. Sure sometimes the characters made stupid decisions, but come on, we all remember the part when the girl walked into the woods alone just because she 'heard something' in the original Evil Dead right? If the characters don't make at least one stupid decision in a movie, then there wouldn't be a horror movie right? I can tell the filmmakers put a lot of effort into this movie. The filmmakers knew how the fan base of the original trilogy would react to certain things. I'm glad that the original director Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell helped a lot with production for this movie. They also had help from Robert Tapert, the producer of the original. If they weren't there to supervise, I can tell this movie wouldn't have been half as good as it is.This is definitely the best horror remake. Also one of the best and goriest horror movies released nationwide in theaters.  This made the Saw movies seem ""PG"". The movie has that 'independent' feel of the original while also having a mainstream feel at the same time. I really appreciated this movie. I even cared for the characters. Not like most horror movies where you can't wait to see the characters die. I wanted these characters to live. It was a great tragic movie, just like the original. It terrified me and made me and the audience at the theater cringe and wanna cover our eyes.  Watching this movie with a crowd of people is the best way to experience it. I haven't had that much fun at a theater in a LONG time. I encourage you to see it with at least 3 other people. Turn up the volume, and have fun.  The quality of the Blu Ray really brought the horror to life at home too!I do have slight criticisms.  I like to believe the movie is set in modern times.  But I didn't see a single Cell Phone.  Also regarding that, it would've been nice and more modern if at least one character said ""There's no service out here"", because a lot of people in the theater kept saying ""Why don't they just call 911?"".  Another thing is, after their hot lady friend is killed first, they just forget about it right away.  As if it was nothing tragic!  Other than that, this movie is legit horror though!All in all, don't dismiss it as just another pointless horrible remake. Give it a chance. Don't over analyze every single detail just to criticize the movie, even though I pointed out minor things that bugged me.  I see too many people just destroying this movie by dissecting every little detail that they didn't like.  But most of all, DON'T keep comparing it to the original.P.S. Stay after the credits. There's a nice treat for 'Evil Dead' fans waiting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJR1RLBWWTYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUO0Y#wasThisHelpful","RUJR1RLBWWTYC","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want to state first that I listen to all kinds of music. Rock, hip hop, metal, House, pop, indie, ambient, etc.  Sigur Ros has always had a special place in my heart with their music.  I can proudly say that they are my all time favorite band and I will listen to them for the rest of my life no matter what.  Sigur Ros has mostly been categorized as Post Rock, but they are their own genre in my opinion.  They have always made some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  To me, good music is good music regardless of whether it is mainstream popular or underground.  Sigur Ros make great and dreamy music that channels all kinds of emotions. My favorite albums of course were their untitled album ""( )"",""Takk"" and of course ""Agaetis Byrjun"". I first discovered the band through their musical appearance in the movie ""Vanilla Sky"" and I was hooked. Since then I listened to all of their albums.  Then I heard of their new album ""Kveikur"" being a new and more aggressive sound. I was curious and looked up their first two singles ""Brennisteinn"" and ""Isjaki"". The former had a very industrial heavy sound and reminded me of Silversun Pickups a bit. I liked the feeling it gave me. It was almost an apocalyptic feeling. Then I heard ""Isjaki"", and I was blown away by the beauty of it. It was very upbeat and poppy, but still had the heavenly unique Sigur Ros vibe. I was sold, I wanted this album. I also heard that Sigur Ros signed with the record label ""XL"" which mostly features indie music. The most well known of the label are ""Vampire Weekend"", ""Adele"", and ""Radiohead"", so I was anxious to hear how signing to ""XL"" would change the music. There have been hints that this album will be the most commercial sounding as well. Like I said, I listen to all kinds of music and this new album was released on the same day as many other albums I was anticipating including Kanye Wests new controversial ""Yeezus"". I was standing in Best Buy for 30 minutes contemplating what to buy. Finally I decided on ""Kviekur"", and I am betting I was the only one that day to bring that album to the register. But I didn't care, I just wanted to hear the beauty of this album. So I listened to it three times before I decided to review it and hear is a track by track overview!1. Brennisteinn: This is by far the heaviest song on the album, and it still has very divine vocals. The songs deep bass gives it an ""End of the World"" feel. Near the halfway mark of this nearly 8 minute epic, the song changes and becomes faster in the vain of songs from the band Silversun Pickups! Very beautifully haunting. The last minute and a half is a very relaxing recovery from the beautifully musical aggressiveness that just happened in the song.  The song was also used perfectly in a gameplay trailer for ""Assassins Creed 4"" as well.2. Hrafntinna: This is another hauntingly beautiful song! If Brennisteinn was the War, this song is the footage of the aftermath. I mean that in the best way. The vocals from Jon are as beautiful and soaring as always!3. Isjaki: Definitely the most radio ready song. Very upbeat and gorgeous. The vocals kind of remind me of the band ""Beach House"". This song brings about so many emotions. It is simply perfection in music form. This is the type of song that would play while you make love in a dream. This song will make you wanna dance and for some reason it makes me feel nostalgic. While listening to this song think of that special someone, or ""the one who got away"" and see how you feel! My definite favorite of the album.4. Yfirbor: The song starts off slow and peaceful, with another haunting vocal effect in the background. While Jon sings gracefully along with the beautiful music the tempo becomes faster, but doesn't turn into a dance song. It somehow manages to speed up during the chorus without fully becoming an upbeat song. It's so relaxing. The song makes me feel like I am soaring through the clouds and looking at the landscape below!5. Stormur: The song begins slowly with powerful vocals that slightly remind me of the Enigma song ""Return to Innocence"". The song then gains momentum and the tempo really picks up. Much like the song ""Isjaki"" this song could be released to US radio even though its not in English. I love it. Such a powerful song.  This song can be compared to the song ""Saeglopur"" from the bands album ""Takk"".  The chiming sound in this song is so infectious.  Definitely one of Sigur Ros's best!6. Kveikur: The title track with a industrial influence like ""Brennisteinn"". The song has a big stadium feeling to it.  At first I didn't like it that much, but after repeated listens I started to feel the music and love it.  This is commone with Sigur Ros music!7. Rafstraumur: After the slight heaviness of ""Kveikur"", this song takes you down a notch to just sit back and groove along. The upbeat nature of this song reminds me of Silversun Pickups again. This is a great song to listen to while sailing along a beach in my opinion!8. Bláþráður: More powerful vocals to start off the song. This song brings about a feeling of loneliness and happiness at the same time. The drums stream along. There is a haunting vocal effect you can faintly hear in the background. The drumming in this song reminds me of ""Arcade Fire"" surprisingly!9. Var: A relaxing piano led instrumental to close the album. I like it. It is very peaceful and could be used in Movie soundtracks, but I personally wouldn't listen to it as much as the rest of the albums songs. Still a great closer!So Sigur Ros has done it again. They have managed to make a more popular sounding record without sounding like just another pop band.  Though this album is a bit more aggressive than their other albums, it still isn't truly heavy.  The only two really heavy songs are ""Brennisteinn"" and the title track.  The heaviest song from the band in my opinion is still ""Untitled 8"".  The songs are definitely consistently more upbeat than their usual style though.  The vocals are amazing even though I do not understand Icelandic. This is the sound of dreams and beautiful nightmares!  I personally enjoy not knowing what they are singing. It adds to the mystery of the music and allows me to project my own emotions to the songs!  Though I love all of Sigur Ros's albums, this one has to be my favorite one since ""Takk"".  If you are a Sigur Ros fan, this is a must. If you are new to the band, this is also recommended! If you like good music, this is the perfect album to buy. The great thing about Sigur Ros is that their music is timeless.  Their music doesn't fall into the 80s, 90s, or the 2000s.  Sigur Ros music is eternal.  If you are new to Sigur Ros, be prepared, because once you start listening to Sigur Ros, no other music will compare.  I look forward to the emotional journeys this album will continue to take me on!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12CKQKYI8BEDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C1GBOU6#wasThisHelpful","R12CKQKYI8BEDU","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always loved Kanye Wests music.  I never really liked his personality in public, but I love his music.  All of his albums are Hip Hop classics.  His first three releases were all Grammy nominated for Album of the Year.  ""Graduation"" changed Hip Hop forever with its stadium influenced sound.  Then again, he changed how rap can sound with his album ""808s and Heartbreaks"" by adding autotune and giving the genre a more experimental and emotional sound.  The album paved the way for artists such as Kid Cudi and Drake.  Then in 2010 he released what can arguably be labeled his ultimate masterpiece, ""My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"".  It was an epic experimental album that paid tribute to all of the genres Kanye explored through his career with many additional new sounds.  The album was expected to WIN album of the year at the Grammys, but was ultimately snubbed of even a nomination.  Most people, including West himself, blame the fact that he released another hip hop classic soon after with Jay Z, the greatest Hip Hop collaboration album of all time ""Watch the Throne"".  So 3 years pass since his last solo release and many were wondering how he would top his masterpiece ""MBDTF"".  He started speaking about how he didn't want ""radio"" songs on his new album and how there would be no singles.  At first I didn't really think it would be a great album when I saw the bad quality videos on YouTube of his song ""New Slaves"".  The song was good, but I didn't really get excited for the new album just from that song.  The live videos of the song ""Black Skinhead"" didn't help either.  I am not one to get offended by Kanyes lyrics, I just personally thought the song was unappealing.  People started hating on Kanye for these two new songs and I was starting to think the new album would be horrible.  I did feel a bit of hope when I found out that Daft Punk were producing a few tracks, and that the always amazing Justin Vernon of Bon Iver would help out.  Well it was finally released and I must say, though it doesn't top his last album, it does stand out among his collection of classics.  Many think it is another masterpiece, and maybe it is, but the truth is, it was just over hyped.  The album is very, bipolar, in a good way.  Here is a quick track by track overview.1.  On Sight:  This song is okay.  It has a good robotic vibe.  The lyrics are okay for Kanyes standards.  A minute into the song there is a slight interlude that has some nice soul.  I found out this was one of the tracks the legendary Daft Punk produced, and honestly, I was disappointed with it then.  It is a good song for your workout playlist though.  7.5/102.  Black Skinhead:  Many will be offended just by the title, but will have no idea that it isn't a racist song at all.  The lyrics are great.  The beat is amazing, and very similar to Marilyn Mansons song ""Beautiful People"".  The song is somewhat catchy, but it gets tiresome quickly, and the screams of Kanye during the chorus are very annoying.  I can sorta see this released as a single based on its pumping nature, but I still don't see it as a great song.  Still better than the horrible live version that was on YouTube though.  Another Daft Punk produced song surprisingly.  I expected more.  This one is a grower.  8/103.  I am a God:  I know many people will hate the song just because of the title.  This is something Kanye is good at, making people mad!  I kinda like the vibe of the song, but it also gets tiresome quickly.  Most people don't realize he isn't claiming to be GOD, he is saying he is A God.  He is a god of hip hop, you cant deny that.  Despite the egotistical lyrics, this is a great song to work out to.  The pumping house beat is addicting.  Daft Punk produced this track too, and I'm not surprised.  This is radio potential if they cut out the annoying ending that contains screams and heavy breathing.  9/104.  New Slaves:  Good song, but honestly, I skip over it.  The album version is refreshing after the annoying live version that was released prior.  Again, for people who get offended by the title, the song isn't a racist song at all.  Frank Ocean makes an appearance at the end, but it doesn't save the song for me.  The song has a similar feel to the songs on Kanyes GOOD music album ""Cruel Summer"", mostly the song ""Clique"".  8/105.  Hold My Liquor:  Just when I was beginning to feel a bit disappointed with the album, this song came next.  I think this is the best song on the album.  It has a very new and chill sound.  Chief Keef surprisingly sings the chorus in a catchy way.  I never really liked Chief Keef but he did well on this song.  First the Chief Keef chorus starts and it just sounds okay.  The verses by Kanye are amazing and heartfelt with a screeching industrial guitar in the background with a very relaxing beat.  Then the chorus with Chief Keef kicks in, but this time with amazing guitar work who I assume is from Justin Vernon from Bon Iver, who also does amazing vocal work throughout the song.  There is a tasty guitar solo in there too that fits so well into this relaxing song.  You haven't heard a hip hop song like this.  Only from Yeezus.  This can be released as a single.  This song saved the album for me.  10/106.  I'm In It:  A great song to follow the previous masterpiece of a song.  The beat is very industrial and abstract.  The lyrics are typical Kanye bragging, but it's amazing.  Before Kanyes verse a Jamaican rapper steals the show with his nice speed.  Then surprisingly Justin Vernon of Bon Iver makes another perfect vocal appearance!  Futuristic hip hop song.  9.5/107.  Blood on The Leaves:  Great soulful song.  Kanye uses slight autotune and it works so well.  I'm not a fan of Autotune, but Kanye is one of the few who make it work so well.  The sample is similar to Kanyes older song ""I Wonder"" from the ""Graduation"" album.  Another song that saves the album!  The beat is so hype and perfect!  I don't know what else to say.  I love it.  10/108.  Guilt Trip:  Another great song.  I thought Daft Punk produced it, because it has the most Daft Punk feeling vibe, but sadly they didn't.  Still a great infectious song.  Kid Cudi makes a vocal appearance near the end singing with his uniquely awesome voice.  Still better than any of the first 4 tracks.  9/109.  Send It Up:  Another Daft Punk produced song, and you can tell.  The chorus is catchy but this is just an okay song among the recent great songs.  I can see this played in the club though.  8/1010.  Bound 2:  The final song kicks off perfectly.  Arguably the most soulful song.  It contains Kanyes iconic sampling of a classic song.  Reminds me of the song ""Devil in a New Dress"" from ""MBDTF"", and surprisingly this one is better.  Singer Charlie Wilson makes a vocal appearance and he sounds great with the song.  The song has a very romantic hip hop sound, but the lyrics get pretty explicit. Still a perfect album closer that left me wanting so much more!  10/10*First Impressions*So Mr. West has made another classic album.  The only reason the album isn't 5 stars is because the first 4 tracks just weren't up to par with the masterpiece quality of the rest of the album.  Many will love those tracks to death, but I got tired of them quickly.  The album as a whole has this industrial rock influenced sound sometimes similar to early ""Nine Inch Nails"" music, but with more Hip Hop elements incorporated.  I recommend the songs ""Hold My Liquor"" and ""Bound 2"" the most.  Though I would say the last 6 tracks are all the true Highlights and they have the most replay value.  This album will get polarized reviews.  Many are calling it another masterpiece, and many are calling it trash.  It all depends on taste.  But you can't deny that this album is another landmark hip hop album that will surely change the way the genre sounds the way Kanyes other releases have.  I have a feeling Kanye might get another nomination for Album of The Year after being snubbed with his last true masterpiece.  So if you like good Hip Hop and aren't offended easily then this album is perfect.  This can appeal to anyone who likes good experimental music.  Many have also compared it's experimental genre bending nature to the band Radioheads landmark album ""Kid A"", which is actually a compliment!  I also think that like ""Kid A"", this album will be hailed as a classic in years to come.  Another good release from the Hip Hop genre this week was J.Coles more commercial sounding ""Born Sinner"", but it doesn't stand out like Yeezus.  If you are looking for beautiful music that isn't in the hip hop category then pick up Sigur Ros's 2013 release ""Kveikur"".  This album is for music listeners with minds more open to new and different sounds.  Listen to it twice before you form an opinion though!*New thoughts after more repeated listens*I have grown slightly more fond of the first 4 tracks now.  ""Black Skinhead"" in particular has become a hit for me.  I still don't see it as a favorite of mine, and it is still not up to par with the last 6 tracks.  But I have heard it in a trailer for the movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and I found myself feeling pumped and rapping along.  For some reason ""Black Skinheads"" has become very appealing to me and apparently the country.  It is starting to have the same appeal as Kanyes single ""Power"" which has become a popular choice for commercials and movie trailers.  It is even being released as the first single surprisingly.  As for the rest of the album, I still love the last 6 tracks the most.  I keep discovering new layers to each song with repeated listens.  I will try to revisit the album every now and again since the music is amazing, but too exhausting for constant repeated listening.**Months Later**I decided to give this another listen again.  Suddenly I am listening closer to the lyrics of all the songs.  The first 4 tracks too.  ""I am a God"" is suddenly one of my favorite controversial songs ever.  The album sounds new and refreshing and nostalgic for some reason.  I am changing my score to a perfect 5 out of 5 now.  This is a real album.  This will be considered a classic milestone for Hip Hop in years to come.  Truly Kanyes ""Kid A"".**After Bound 2 success**The album didn't have any mega hits like previous albums.  Black Skinhead has been used in commercials and trailers but hasn't charted well.  But after Kim Kardashian starred in the controversial music video of the song ""Bound 2"", things changed.  The song has gotten really popular and is sure to be the big hit of the album.  It is also reigniting interest in the album as it made me come back and listen again.  Once again I'm discovering new elements to the album.  Masterpiece!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQO2H2QB567U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CV5ZPA2#wasThisHelpful","R1MQO2H2QB567U","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I, like most people first discovered the dynamic duo ""Capital Cities"" upon hearing their mega hit ""Safe and Sound"". At first I thought it was an okay poppy song. Then a second listen got me hooked and I wanted to hear more from them! They have this infectious sound and spark to their music. This is their time to shine and I hope they shine bright! I waited and waited for this debut album perfectly titled ""In a Tidal Wave of Mystery"" to finally be released. I just knew this duo would make it big. I hoped that the album would have more awesome tracks beyond ""Safe and Sound"" and I was glad to find out it did! Here is a track by track breakdown of the album.1. Safe and Sound: The ultimate summer anthem of 2013, and hopefully years to come. This is such an awesome feelgood indie dance pop song. It's perfect. The synths, the vocals, the corny but great lyrics, and who could forget those infectious trumpets during the chorus? This song was destined to be a hit. The entire song is amazing and catchy, but my favorite part is this little segment between 1:15 and 1:30 in the song. I will never ever get tired of this tune!2. Patience Gets Us Nowhere Fast: Nice upbeat synthpop song. The vocals are almost as infectious as ""Safe and Sound"". The chorus will make you sing along. The song has an 80s vibe to it. That seems to be happening a lot with recent music and I love it! The bridge around the halfway mark is simple but magical!3. Kangaroo Court: I really like this song. It has this ""Passion Pit"" type thing going for it. The verses and chorus will get stuck in your head. There is a nice trumpet solo. I'm starting to love this duo and their soon to be iconic trumpet moments in their music. Though I like the version they have on the album, there is a version of the song called the ""Shook remix"" that I personally think is better. To each his own. Still a good catchy song and great song for going out clubbing.4. I Sold My Bed, Not My Stereo: There is a strong ""Daft Punk"" thing going on with this song. This sounds like it could've literally been released on Daft Punks album ""Discover""! The chorus is perfect. There is a bridge, that just makes me wanna get up and move to the music. There is a slight trumpet solo that is again magical. This song could be a hit if released as a single! Another great song I could never get tired of!5. Center Stage: This song sort of reminds me of the Hall & Oates song ""I Can't Go For That"" and some Maroon 5 during the chorus. There is even a slight Daft Punk vibe going on again with a robotic background vocal during the chorus! This song is nice and funky. Like the lyrics state, this song is a 'good time'.6. Farrah Fawcett Hair feat. Andre 3000: I like this song. The samples are awesome. The vocals have this slight Passion Pit thing going on again. At first the spoken word parts of the song were annoying, but they grew on me with each listen and now I love it. Andre 3000 provides some nice guest vocals bringing back slight memories of the funky ""Outkast"". It's a great catchy party song! Like the song states again, this song is ""Good s***"".7. Chartreuse. Nice catchy song full of synths. I might like this song more with repeated listens. Their is a really nice bridge with a trumpet solo AGAIN and how could I not love that though? So far this album is consistently awesome. This song is a good song to listen to while driving around a city at night.8. Origami: There is another Daft Punk type sample here. I love the funky guitars during the verse. Their is a soaring trumpet you can faintly hear during the chorus that is just sexy! The bridge is just breathtakingly delicious! The infectious bridge continues in the background during the final chorus. A great feelgood party song! Definitely one of my favorite tracks!  If I was in charge, this song would be released as a single.  It has ""Hit"" written all over it!9. Lazy Lies: There is a Beach Boys and Beatles thing going for this song. This is a very beautiful song that is slower so you can rest from all of the party music that preceded it. The instruments that play after the chorus are the things you hear in dreams!10. Tell Me How To Live: Great song for the clubs! There is also something about the vocals that make a good road song too. The chorus is a synth rocker! There is a tasty Mexican style guitar solo in there as well. I can see the crowd clapping along to this song!11. Chasing You feat. Soseh: Great infectious love song with perfect 80s style synths. The chorus and verses with background vocals from Soseh are just sexy! I can see this being a hit like the Gotye song ""Somebody That I Used To Know"" even though the vocals aren't as powerful. Soseh sings a verse alone and her voice channels that of a young Madonna! Corny, but awesome track!12. Love Away: A playful and infectious song. This like a synth version of a happy Beatles song! There is something about the beeps in the song that give it a space vibe. This seriously reminds me of the song ""Love is Greed"" from Passion Pit, in a great way! 2 minutes into the song things start to build up into a rocking guitar solo! Nice catchy song to end a great debut album that will leave you thirsty for more.So this album is a great debut album and shows that there is more to this musical duo than their hit song ""Safe and Sound"". In fact, that was the song I listened to the least, and I LOVE that song. That is how great this album is. It's also best to listen to this with good headphones or in a car with a nice sound system! The replay value of this entire album is unbelievable. There is no track I would skip. We all have different opinions and some will disagree, but I'm pretty confident that this duo will make it big. I really hope they don't become a one hit wonder. I hope they stay in the spot light with more hits throughout the years! They can be compared to ""Hall and Oates"" from the 80s. Though the sound isn't really that similar, I hope ""Capital Cities"" has a successful and memorable career like H&O! I would love to see them live since I've heard they throw amazing concerts! This is a classic album. Worth a purchase. Great album to dance to or work out to. I will definitely have this album along with ""Daft Punks"" and ""Fitz and the Tantrums"" new albums on replay for the summer. Perfect summer and beach album. Now excuse me while I listen to the album again and again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R314745A6XGEB4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CAZOHDO#wasThisHelpful","R314745A6XGEB4","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first randomly stumbled upon this band years ago when they first released their self titled album.  I was at Wal Mart and saw the album on sale and I thought the name of the band was interesting.  I impulsively bought it.  I had no clue who they were.  I assumed based on their name they would be some new gothic rock band or something.  Then I played the CD and I was blown away!  It was an instant indie classic.  Fast forward a few years when they released their second album ""Contra"".  They were now very popular and the album even reached number one in the US.  That album is also a classic with many great songs.  I personally had a few songs on the album I would skip over, but that doesn't mean other people didn't like those songs.  So years pass and finally I found out Vampire Weekend was releasing another album after long 3 years.  I heard the first two singles and was so glad to hear their unique sound again and couldn't wait for the album.  It lived up to the hype and much more!  I personally think this might be their best album yet.  But that's just my opinion!  Here's a track by track breakdown.1.  Obvious Bicycle:  Another reviewer said this song didn't engage them and gave the song a 5/10.  We all have opinions.  But that was the stupidest opinion ever.  They thought this song wasn't as good because it wasn't as upbeat as other VW songs.  I personally think this is one of the best songs the band has ever made and it is not one bit boring.  It is very peaceful and catchy.  There are many layered vocals and different sounds in the song that are so infectious to the ears.  Give it a listen and see what I mean.  Great album opener.2.  Unbelievers:  This song has a slight ""Beatles"" vibe to it and it works so well.  Such a fun song with catchy vocals.  There are also parts of the song that remind me of ""Arcade Fire"" a bit, but still keeps to the Vampire Weekend sound.  Not amazing, but still a great killer song!3.  Step:  This song.  One of the most relaxing songs from the band.  Ezra hits this note during the chorus when he sings ""bones"", and it is just perfect.  The song has the classical vibe that was heard in songs like ""M79"" and ""Walcott"".  I have had the part ""Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl"" stuck in my head for a while now.  Theres just something amazing about this song.  Great song to listen to while touring a big city.  I feel like going to D.C and touring the museums while listening to this song.  Sure the lyrics have nothing to do with it, but the feel of the song is just so peaceful and cinematic!4.  Diane Young:  At first I thought this song was annoying.  The constant weird ""Babys"" chanted throughout the song.  I didn't like it at first listen.  But I first didn't listen to it with good speakers so I didn't really hear all the perfect layers of the song.  Then I started to love and love the song more with each listen.  It's a classic!  The song has this weird yet awesome vocal effect.  The lyrics even have a deep meaning(Diane Young = Dying young).  I think it is their best lead single so far!  I can see this song featured in awesome movie scenes and commercials for some reason.  Listen to this song with good earphones or a nice car sound system to experience it the best!  You will find yourself singing the 'baby baby babys' in your head.  I can see people singing it in the shower too haha.  The song will blow you away even more  in the last 20 seconds.5.  Don't Lie:  Nice song to calm down with after hearing ""Diane Young"".  Again the chorus is so infectious.  There is something highly anthemic about this song from the vocals all the way down to the marching band-like drums.6.  Hannah Hunt:  The song slowly builds up with calm vocals during the verses.  You really need a good pair of earphones to appreciate this song to its full extent.  The song tells a story.  The pianos tease you in this song making you want more!  This is a very beautiful song!  Toward the end of the song there is a slight upbeat repeat of the chorus before it ends peacefully and perfectly!7.  Everlasting Arms:  The bass of this song reminds me of ""The Police"" slightly!  But the rest of the song is pure Vampire Weekend!  The chorus is so so so so so perfect.  It's just another classic catchy amazing song.  This band can do no wrong!  I don't know what else to say about it.  It's awesome!  It could be released as a single!  One of my personal favorites!8.  Finger Back:  This sounds more like it would fit into the bands first album.  One of the more upbeat songs.  Very uplifting.  The fast vocals might give you a hype feeling.  Halfway through the song the bridge kicks in calmly before the catchy quickly delivered vocals jump back in.  Very fun song!9.  Worship You:  I thought the last song had quick vocals.  The vocals in the verses of this song are twice as fast!  The chorus soars.  The drums also have this marching band feel to them!  The vocals during the verses remind me of the vocals in System of a Downs song ""Violent Pornography"".  No I'm not comparing the bands, they sound nothing alike and aren't even of the same genre, but the scatting vocals are similar in those songs.  Beautiful song either way especially toward the end of it!10.  Ya Hey:  My favorite song from the band so far.  I read that the song is about god(ya hey = Yahweh) and it is just beautiful!  I cannot get the chorus out of my head.  I will just say how perfect and original this song sounds.  Perfect vocals.  Perfect instrumentals.  Everything compliments each other so perfectly.  There is even this weird yet infectious sound during the chorus that works so well.  If you haven't heard the song yet then you will see what I'm talking about.  The song combines the wacky element of the band with the beautiful elements of the band.  The longest song on the album is the best song in my opinion!  Amazing and gorgeous!11.  Hudson:  A new sound for the band.  The song sounds inspired by some of the darker ""Depeche Mode"" songs, but only slightly.  It still has that Vampire Weekend spice to it though.  There is something epic and apocalyptic about the way it sounds.  Yet it is also beautiful and tragic as well.  The song also has a 'vampire' feeling to it fitting to the bands name!  Not an easy listen, but still a good listen!  I could write a whole essay about what this song feels like, but I'll stop here.  It's just another good song!12.  Young Lion:  Ending the album on a peaceful note with this short yet awesome song.  The vocals are so beautiful.  I could fall asleep to this song, and I mean that in the best way.  The song leaves me wanting more and more!So I loved the album.  I think it is personally their best album yet.  Maybe it's just because the album is brand new and I'm still on a high from it, but I'm sure this album will have great replay value for almost anyone who loves good music.  I forgot to mention that each song on the album also has this city life feel to it.  Great album to listen to in any city setting.  You can still enjoy it in the country, but I feel this album is meant best for the city experience!  Some reviewers are complaining that this album is less appealing because it has less to no guitars.  Who said Vampire Weekend needed guitars?  Vampire Weekend stated in a recent review how their three albums all have a different sound, which is true.  This saves them from being typecast to one particular sound.  They can keep exploring new sounds.  So just don't compare it to their first two albums.  This album is great in its own way!  Definitely a strong contender for 'Album of the Year'.  This is one of the best modern bands working today.  They make good, beautiful, and clever music.  This album is a MUST listen for anyone that wants something new and awesome to listen to.  Make sure to listen to each song at least twice before forming an opinion.  This album is a classic. It is a grower.  I can tell I will continue to discover new things about each song through repeated listens.  Great album to listen to during the summer as well.  Now excuse me while I click replay again!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SHJ735U95O2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB22GQM#wasThisHelpful","R3SHJ735U95O2S","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-Minor Spoilers- The film starts off campy with the clown ""Stitches"" going to the birthday party of 10 year old Tom. The kids at the party are bullies to the clown and a simple prank from the kids ends with the gory death of ""Stitches"". 6 years later Tom and the group of friends get back together for Toms 16 year old birthday party. Little do they know that ""Stitches"" has risen from the grave to get revenge.I randomly stumbled across this gem one day at Best Buy and impulsively purchased it.  I had no idea what I was in for but I didn't have high expectations.  Little did I know this was one of the best modern indie horror movies!  Many are going to disagree strongly, but I feel this movie is in the league of cult horror classics such as ""Evil Dead"" , ""Brain Dead/Dead Alive"" , and slasher movies of the 1980s. The budget for this movie is low, and they still managed to make a horror movie better than most big budget movies released nationwide in the US.  The special effects are so indie and realistic at the same time. The jokes and humor of the movie made me laugh multiple times. The music is creepy and the soundtrack is awesome.  There is even a popular song from the 1980s used perfectly in a certain scene that is just fantastic! The gore effects were perfect and realistic. The acting was very believable.Honestly during the opening scene I thought I was going to hate this movie. Then things got serious, while still maintaining the humor. Ross Noble, the British Comedian, plays ""Stitches"" the evil clown. His performance is what makes this movie work the most. I cannot get over how perfect and eerie his portrayal of the living dead clown was. It was iconic. It is in the league of Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger and Doug Bradley as Pinhead. I will even go as far as to say that it was the best clown performance since Stephen Kings ""It"". This movie will make you laugh and cringe. It will creep you out. The visuals are gorgeous for a film with this low of a budget. They need to make more horror movies like this. This movie could be the start of a modern horror icon franchise! ""Stitches"" can be added to the iconic villains list of Horror movies! I am disappointed at the low rating this movie has on IMDB. Hopefully through the years if word-of-mouth helps, this movie will become the Horror cult classic that it is meant to become!Turn off the lights and watch this movie with friends or alone. You will have a good time.  Well worth a purchase or redbox rental if you like good campy horror movies in the vain of ""Evil Dead"" and the original ""Nightmare on Elmstreet"" movies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1ET8OM1BRN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A92MBRO#wasThisHelpful","RM1ET8OM1BRN9","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I honestly first discovered this band from their previous landmark album ""Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix.""  They had this unique, yet familiar sound that was nearly irresistible.  I even went back to their older albums to see what I missed out on.  How their song ""If I Ever Feel Better"" wasn't a worldwide mega hit is beyond me!  But again, Wolfgang seemed to be the bands magnum opus so far and people had very high expectations for what would follow.  I did too, but I remembered that having expectations usually leads to letdowns.  So I went into this new album ""Bankrupt"" with an open mind just so I could enjoy the music.  It was just good to hear new music from ""Phoenix""!  They aren't the only French band who have been receiving some attention.  ""Daft Punk"" have grown and grown in popularity with each year, and another awesome band is ""M83"" who is also gaining momentum.  Now ""Phoenix"" is back in the spotlight too and hopefully this album helps them stay there.  So here's a track by track breakdown.1.  Entertainment:  The lead single off the album that most people have heard.  It hasn't received the popularity that ""1901"" and ""Lisztomania"" did but I still loved the vibe of this song.  The guitars and synths that the song revolves around sounds like a 80's song in Asia.  You will hear a lot of sounds similar to the 80's era of music on this album.  I always think of being in some big Asian city or Beach when listening to this song.  Nice catchy song that grows with each listen.2.  The Real Thing:  Nice groovy song all the way through.  Though there isn't really a catchy hook, the song as a whole is beautiful.  There are so many layers in this song you could miss out on depending on how you listen to it.  The song ends abruptly though.  Gets me every time.3.  S.O.S. In Bel Air:  Nice upbeat song that just makes you feel good!  This is also definitely one of the experimental songs.  It sounds like two different songs mushed together in a awesome way!  One part of the song has this build up to it that will give many listeners a hype feeling.  Then there's the part of the song with the infectious 80s influenced synths.  This song is awesome to say the least.4.  Trying To Be Cool: My personal favorite song on the album!  This song is GROOVY.  Again there's a slight 80's feel to it.  This is pure ""Phoenix"".  The guitars, synths, drums and awesome french accented vocals compliment each other so magically.  I can totally see this song being a huge hit.  I can't get over how perfect this song is!  Listen to it loud and with good earphones.  Blast it in your car while cruising through the night!5.  Bankrupt:  Awesome beat buildups and synths.  Partially instrumental and partially vocalized.  2 minutes into the song it turns into something that sounds like it came out of the ""Tron: Legacy"" soundtrack by Daft Punk.  Truthfully this song sounds like Phoenix was listening to ""M83"" and ""Daft Punk"" while making this album.  This track is nearly 7 minutes long.  Some will get bored by it, and some will love it's experimental layers.  The vocals really add to the song toward the end.  The ending is really relaxing and peaceful.  I personally love the entire song.6.  Drakkar Noir:  I first heard this played live combined with the song ""Trying to be Cool"" and seriously thought this was part of that song.  I honestly think this is my second favorite song on the album.  It's playful and awesome.  The vocals have that ""Phoenix"" spice to it.  I love every single layer in this song.  More listens might make this my favorite song eventually.  Around 2 minutes into the song be prepared to be blown away even more!7.  Chloroform:  This is my third favorite.  OH MY GOD.  So amazing.  This song is relaxing.  I will again compare the sound to ""Daft Punk"" and ""M83"" with the Phoenix spice!  Not enough can be said about how beautiful this song is.  I can tell this album will make me switch between which tracks are my favorite.8.  Don't:  This song gets me emotionally for some reason.  It's not even slow.  It just makes me reflect for some reason.  I love it.  Phoenix are truly magical like that.  The synths are awesome and pulsing during the chorus.  Great catchy upbeat song to nod your head to.9.  Bourgeois:  The 80s are being channeled once again bigtime on this amazing synth-filled chill song.  I've said it multiple times in this review, but again I have to say this might eventually become my favorite track.  This song has this vibe that makes me wanna drive down a long road during the sunset.  This song glides along and I will definitely have this on mega replay.10.  Oblique City:  Of course they end the album with a bang.  The synths on this song AGAIN have that ""Phoenix"" 80s vibe.  This song is so fun and playful.  Like the other songs, this is best enjoyed with earphones!Truth be told, unlike some of the other reviewers, I loved this album to death and I will continue obsessing over it.  Not trying to compare it to ""Wolfgang"" but I honestly enjoyed this album more than that one.  There is not a single weak track on this album in my opinion.  All of the songs are hits for me!  Maybe it's just because it's brand new.  I don't know.  All I know is that this album has ultimate replay value.  Some people are even saying this album is a setback for Phoenixs career.  I strongly disagree.  I can tell this album will be a huge critical and commercial success.  Phoenix deserves all the fame and acclaim they are getting and so much more!  If you like great, catchy, and just genius music then look no further than this nearly perfect album.  This is a perfect summer album too just like most of Phoenixs work!  If you're interested, the deluxe edition contains over 70 demo tracks on a bonus disc.  Just saying.  Now excuse me while I jam out to this album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11QC1WV1XM4G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BDSRISA#wasThisHelpful","R11QC1WV1XM4G9","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I didn't really like Justin those years back.  I thought he was just another white guy trying to be black.  But I was so wrong.  I gave his songs a listen and I loved his sound.  I first bought ""Futuresex/Lovesounds"" and I was blown away.  I wanted more.  I finally purchased his debut album ""Justified"" and was again obsessed with the songs.  He has a familiar yet original sound.  I wanted more again.  Then I heard ""Suit and Tie"" and played that song over 600 times literally according to my Itunes.  It is still my number one most played song.  Then the song ""Mirrors"" followed and I played that a little over 300 times.  Still a lot.  The point is that I was so damn excited to hear this new album.  I even stopped myself from listening to the album when Justin put the entire album to stream on Itunes the week before its release. Then finally I purchased the album at Target with the bonus tracks.The album has such an amazing epic cinematic feel to it.  I LOVE that most of the songs clock in at over 7 minutes.  I loved how some of the songs were like that in ""Futuresex/Lovesounds"" and I was excited to hear an entire album of those types of songs.  It gives the album a progressive and more artistic feel to it.  A progressive R&B/pop record.  Most people are complaining about the length of the songs without logical reasons.  These people usually don't appreciate what music really is.  He didn't make this album for the radio.  This is a masterful collection of songs.  Not a random collection of lame pop songs that were made just to get airplay.  The people criticizing this album about the length and slight lack of mass radio appeal are the opposite of Hipsters, but equally annoying.  Most of them have short attention spans as other reviewers have stated.  I didn't get bored one bit during this album.  I actually wish the radio played more of these types of long songs!  There is a variety of styles on this album.  It's just simply amazing.  I'm a pretty masculine guy and I listen to Justins music proudly without feeling ashamed.  His music is mature pop.  Some of it is good music to make love to also.Track reviews.1.  Pusher Love Girl:  The beginning of this track is cinematic.  The beats and all of the layers are great reminders of Timbalands producing talents.  The chorus has a futuristic sound to it like the songs in ""Futuresex"".  Halfway through the song it breaks down and Justin sing raps.  Nice catchy song.2.  Suit and Tie: If you haven't heard this song then you must be living on another planet.  This is forever the classy men anthem now.  Makes me wanna get my suit and tie and just flirt with all the ladies.  Great first single.  Jay Z has the only guest appearance on the album and it's a good one.  Memorable lyrics from both men.  Very catchy!3.  Don't hold the Wall:  Starts off with a Middle Eastern sound like in ""What goes around..."".  Some might find this song boring at first but I loved the atmosphere of it right away.  Again there is a breakdown near the end and the song takes a whole new direction.  The first half has a fun Latin sounding beat.  Then it turns into another amazing dance song toward the end.4.  Strawberry Bubblegum:  I think this is my favorite song on the album currently.  The vocals are top notch.  Justins falsetto is infectious.  The first half is so magical.  The beat is chill.  The music is chill.  The chorus is chill.  Such a chill song.  Then the song of course takes another turn toward the end in a great way.  Sounds even better with great earphones.  I can see this released as a single.  I want more people to know this song!  The 8 minutes go by so fast.5.  Tunnel Vision:  The beginning ironically sounds like a Kanye West produced song.  (Kanye sorta dissed JT before this albums release.  But oh well) The vocals have a throwback feeling to Justins N Sync days but only slightly.  Very futuristic and beautiful.  Throughout the song there is a bass segment that sounds like it could be in the Inception soundtrack.  Really cool.  The final 2 minutes build up the adrenaline in a great way before bringing it back down a bit for a nice ending to the song.6.  Spaceship Coupe:  Another futuristic love making song literally.  The lyrics talk about making love on the moon.  Smooth and weird in a great way.  The production from Timbaland has more cinematic influences.  Beautiful and catchy song with great vocals of course.  There's even a nice guitar solo thrown in there.  Good homage to Prince.  The final 2 minutes of the song slow it down a bit slightly like ""Set the mood"" from ""Futuresex"" beautifully.  You will have the ""whoo hoo hoo hooo hooo"" stuck in your head!7.  That Girl:  The shortest song on the album.  The speaker at the beginning sounds like Andre 3000 a bit. The song even honestly has a slight Andre 3000 feel to it.  Oldschool and the future collide in this song.  Nice feelgood song for guys in love with 'that girl'.  Could be a successful single if released.8.  Let the Groove Get In:  Like many have said, this has a Michael Jackson ""You wanna be starting something"" feel to it.  I love it.  Gets me pumped up and hype for some odd reason.  The chanting in the song will bite into your musical soul.  Justin even gives a MJ influenced vocal performance.  Definitely not the first time JT has been compared to MJ.  Great catchy upbeat soulful tune!  There's a great piano segment throughout the song.  A hype beat comes in toward the end and the vocals soar!  Again, the chanting of ""Are you comfortable / let the groove get in / there there right there""  is so infectious!  Timbaland and Timberlake are forever a great duo!9.  Mirrors:  At first I thought this was the corniest song Justin ever made, and it kinda is.  The chorus sounded like Beyonces ""Halo"" and Onerepublic sorta.  I love it though.  A different yet familiar sounding JT song.  What's really amazing about this song is the last 3  minutes.  I'll let you experience it for yourself.  Words can't describe how perfect the final 3 minutes are.10.  Blue Ocean Floor:  Great slow relaxing song to end this epic soulful pop masterpiece.  Nice build up with the emotional ambient type music.  Some might need multiple listens to get used to this one.  But you can't deny how great the vocals are.The Target edition came with two bonus tracks:11.  Dress On:  I really liked this song.  It sorta has a ""Gorillaz"" vibe to it.  But doesn't fit the context of the album.  Good bonus track.12.  Body Count:  Fun upbeat dance song.  But still not as epic as the rest of the album.  Kind of a sequel to ""Like I Love You"" musically.Favorite tracks: Strawberry Bubblegum and Let the Groove Get In.But the entire album is amazing.  This will definitely be on replay for the next few months until JT releases the 20/20 experience 2 later in 2013.For me, this could win the Album of the Year Grammy.  I hope it does.I hope this review was helpful.  Now excuse me as I replay this entire album again!Au Revoir!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XE5GTWRA8N4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCZU8WM#wasThisHelpful","R1XE5GTWRA8N4","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I fell under a horror movie high one day and decided to search for the best horror films of 2012. I clicked on various different lists and this movie was featured on nearly all of them. I looked at its IMDb rating and was disappointed with its low rating so I didn't really feel motivated to see it. But I was at Wal Mart and saw this movie there on sale and I just impulsively purchased it hoping the low rating was wrong. I am very glad I decided to buy this movie.-Spoilers-A young man is left widowed and damaged with agoraphobia after his pregnant wife is randomly attacked by a group of hooded kids. The baby is saved while the wife is left comatose for a few months until she finally passes. The young man is now raising the daughter alone in his panicked agoraphobic state. Then one day the hooded kids kidnap his daughter. With the help of a badmouthed priest and his son, he must rescue his daughter and learn the truth about these demonic hooded children.Don't be fooled by the clichéd plot. This movie is one of the more original horror films in the past 10 years. Its a shame it hasn't found a decent release in the US. I'm sure if this was given a theatrical release during the Halloween season it would've been a decent hit. This is the second best traditional horror movie released in 2012 behind Sinister in my opinion. There is something just eerie and unsettling about this film. The terror starts off within 5 minutes with a heart pumping intro. Then the more dramatic aspect takes place for about 20 minutes so that we can get to know the characters. The last half of the movie is just genius horror film making. Sure many things are questionable about this movie, but who cares? Its a great spooky film to watch in the dark alone or with a lover or friends. The cinematography is very well done for a first time director. The directing itself reminded me of Danny Boyles '28 Days Later' in some aspects. The acting is pretty good for a low budget film. There are many scenes that are just perfectly executed even though some of the characters decisions are typical Horror movie clichés. There is a fantastically creeping scene on the bus that will surely stick with most viewers long after seeing this movie. The music is great like most horror films from Europe. The demonic hooded children are some of the scariest horror villains in a long time. Many old school horror fans will think of 'The Brood' when they see the evil kids in this film. But honestly these kids are more menacing and scary. The director is certainly someone to watch out for in the future.Though the movie is not popular yet among US viewers since it has only seen a DVD/Blu Ray release without any advertisement, I think it has potential to explode in popularity. I do hope that the horror fans that appreciate true good horror will spread the word on this movie and help it become the cult classic it is destined to be. Hopefully the rating goes up. Trust me, this movie is one of the good horror movies. There is only one criticism I have for the DVD.  There is no subtitle option, which is annoying at times since there are a few moments of dialogue that are hard to understand.  Either way it's honestly worth a purchase or at least a redbox rental. Give it a shot if you need a fresh simple horror movie to scare you for the night.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UPRGAN4X021H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NP1ZPW#wasThisHelpful","R2UPRGAN4X021H","A1RNSJIOGBUYCC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RNSJIOGBUYCC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Cute little bows that my 8 year old daughter wears on the side of her hair.  These bows are not what I consider large but they do fit perfect to wisp her bangs away from her face.

"Let me get this out of the way: I usually like Dario Argento, so I'll admit to some bias going in.  And who doesn't love Dracula?  So I was among a (I assume) relatively small group of people who were kind of excited about this release.  So is it a good Dracula movie?  Not remotely. But, as a few others have mentioned, it sure is a hoot.I won't rehash the plot here; suffice it to say that Argento and no less than three additional writers took some moments from Bram Stoker's novel, and just gave them some, umm, tweaking.  In one time-saving liberty taken with the source material, pretty much all the action takes place at Dracula's castle.  There is some nice scenery, although viewing the film in 3-D as intended (more on that in a moment) does reveal how spectacularly fake much of it is.  There's plenty of blood and bare breasts, including some obligatory nudity from Asia ""Clothing Optional"" Argento.  There's some horrible--nay, HORRIBLE acting from everyone.  Even Rutger Hauer, probably the only actor who will be known to American audiences, is totally phoning it in.  Like from a rotary phone in 1980.  Seriously, you could throw a rock at a middle-school play and come up with better actors.And (spoiler alert, though I'll bet you've heard this one already) then there's that giant praying mantis attack.  You'll never convince me that Argento meant that to be taken seriously.  It's the ultimate ""WTF??"" moment, made even more laughable by some of the worst CGI ever committed to film.  You almost have to give them credit for originality; in the hundreds, if not thousands, of vampire films out there, I bet that has never happened.I should have also said upfront that I like 3-D movies.  And while this one doesn't break any new ground or really compete with the latest Hollywood blockbusters, it's not bad.  There's a surreal quality to the whole thing anyway, and the 3-D somehow complements that.  If the film interests you, and you have the equipment, I strongly urge you to watch it that way.Bonus stuff: There's a cool music video, ""Kiss Me Dracula,"" that's available in both 3D and 2D.  There's a hour-long behind-the-scenes feature, that may cause some unintentional laughs when you realize these folks were serious when they were making the film.  I love it when co-writer Antonio Tentori says how they hoped to differentiate ""their"" Dracula from the ""zillion other films about Dracula"" out there.  Mission accomplished, Tony.So there you have it.  If you made it this far, hopefully you have a good idea of whether ""Dario Argento's Dracula"" is for you.  It's a bad film that revels in its badness.  It's a passable 3D horror film.  And you really just have to see the giant praying mantis to believe it.  Wow.  Recommended for bad movie buffs and Rutger Hauer completists.  :-D","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNPBKDT2RNJM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FUABHVQ#wasThisHelpful","RNPBKDT2RNJM9","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: This review contains SPOILERS.As someone who discovered Doctor Who with the 2005 revival series, I have greatly enjoyed all 7 (so far) seasons and all 3 (again, so far) incarnations of the Doctor.  And I've slowly been working my way backwards in time to catch up with the ""classic"" era episodes on DVD.  I've bought plenty of books and collectibles as well.  I am a fan.So, like all fans, I was very excited about this highly-touted 50th anniversary episode, which sees, among other things, the return of 10th Doctor David Tennant.  And I will say right here and now that Tennant's interactions with 11th Doctor Matt Smith are among the best parts of the episode.  The episode has a very cinematic feel to it, and I regret not taking advantage of the opportunity to see it (in 3-D, no less) on the big screen.  It looks fantastic, and the main story is very engaging.On the downside, I was quite disappointed that Billie Piper was only playing a sort of Rose Tyler avatar, not the real character.  There is really no reason for her to be there (the character even admits she has appeared to the wrong Doctor, but never changes her appearance).  And although John Hurt is a fine actor and does his best with the material, I never really felt that his character was as dark as the 11th Doctor indicated at the end of the previous episode.And even with one delightful cameo, I still feel there were some missed opportunities here.  It IS a good story, and one that's important to the show's overall mythology.  But it needed to be bigger, with more guest stars.  It needed to be an EVENT, and I just feel it fell short of that ambition.Like I said, I'm a fan.  And I'll definitely be buying this.  I look forward to seeing it in 3-D.  And maybe I'll like it more the second time around. . .we'll see.UPDATE: I've just viewed the 3-D Blu-ray, and I am happy to raise my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  While I do stand by my comments above, watching the episode in 3-D really made for a much richer experience.  On the technical side, it's as good as any 3-D theatrical release I've viewed on my home screen.  The early scene with the TARDIS being lifted by helicopter over London is breathtaking, as are the panoramic views of old England with the 10th Doctor and Elizabeth I.  Since the show itself went to high definition in 2009, it has been among the most visually-striking programs in production.  ""The Day of the Doctor"" raises the bar even higher.The disc also contains a 13-minute ""making of"" featurette, narrated by 6th Doctor Colin Baker.  Make sure you watch the episode first, though, as the special does give away some major plot points.  There are also a handful of delete scenes (nothing earth-shaking), two trailers, and a nice overview of the series in general.  This last feature is basically another, longer (46 min.) episode of the ""Doctor Who Revisited"" series.If you have the equipment, and are a Doctor Who fan, this is absolute must-have.  More than anything, it really made me wish ALL future episodes of the show could be in 3-D.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N8ROM1QDXG9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FAVRHBE#wasThisHelpful","R2N8ROM1QDXG9R","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a fan and collector of the films of Mabel Normand, I was happy to find a few films here that I'd never seen.  These are unrestored prints, and as such, the quality varies greatly.  Three of the films--one with Fatty Arbuckle and the two made for Hal Roach--are in pretty bad shape.  But the rest are acceptable quality.  Collectors might want to know that some of the prints use later re-issue titles, but the original titles are also given on-screen.  This is basically a no-frills DVD-R, but the rarity of the films might make it worthwhile for hardcore fans.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I94WFQTUD5JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BJN60I#wasThisHelpful","R2I94WFQTUD5JL","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a few others have already stated here, Willie Best was something of an unsung hero in the history of African American actors.  While some people these days may view his many similar roles--valet, manservant, butler, etc.--as subservient, the fact is he was often funnier than the stars of the films in which he appeared.  This is certainly the case with ""Whispering Ghosts,"" in which pretty much EVERY supposedly-funny line delivered by headliner Milton Berle falls flat.  The plot is standard b-movie mystery/comedy shenanigans, with able assistance from John Carradine and Brenda Joyce (who is a bit underused, but looks lovely).Be warned that the print used here hasn't undergone any specific restoration, and as such, it looks a bit soft compared to other films of the same vintage that have been cleaned up.  Nevertheless, A/V quality are perfectly acceptable, especially if you are a fan of the film and can overlook the less-than-pristine transfer.  I'd recommend this for  Willie Best fans, or hardcore Milton Berle fans.  It probably wouldn't be a bad warm-up to more enjoyable Halloween fare like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein or Willie Best co-starring with Bob Hope in The Ghost Breakers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35C16PG0M0UHC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BY8DJW8#wasThisHelpful","R35C16PG0M0UHC","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, if you can't past the idea of using the original William Shakespeare text in modern times, nothing will probably make you like this film.  I personally think it was a bold choice.  The works of ""The Bard"" have endured for centuries for a reason.  There are MANY examples of films adapting Shakespeare, many of them great (Forbidden Planet, 10 Things I Hate About You, Gnomeo & Juliet, just off the top of my head).  Whedon seems to be saying, let's let the words speak for themselves.  He then chose to put the words into the mouths of what Joss Whedon fans will recognize as a ""Dream Cast.""  I've been saying for many years that Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof (as bickering lovers Beatrice and Benedick) should be bigger stars.  And while Whedon's film didn't exactly make them household names, it does put the pair front and center where they belong.  And who doesn't love ""Avengers"" and ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" actor Clark Gregg?  He makes acting look effortless, even in the strange tongue used here.  Add Nathan Fillion and ""Buffy""'s Tom Lenk for some great comedy and ""Firefly""'s Sean Maher in a rare villain role, and you've really got something.In the (22 min.) documentary, Whedon offers his justification for the choices he made--shooting in black & white, casting and location.  I think my favorite part is when Nathan Fillion gushes about Gregg: ""I just watched him in that scene and I thought, 'So THAT's how it's done.'""  There are also commentary tracks with the director and cast, but I haven't watched them (as much as I love learning about how films are made, I usually get bored quickly with those).Like I said above, if you can accept the ancient dialects, it's really a very good adaptation.  The themes of the film--the joys and absurdities of love--are universal.  I don't consider myself well-read on Shakespeare, but the story was easy to follow.  Certainly, if you're a fan of Whedon and his cast, this is a must-see.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32PXXLMN6VLDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECR7L0Y#wasThisHelpful","R32PXXLMN6VLDC","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original and, to me, probably THE best of the 1950's wave of 3D movies gets a deluxe treatment from Warner Bros.  While it's true that the film suffers from some graininess in spots, this is not uncommon for vintage films that have been upconverted to high definition.  Unlike today's films, this film was MEANT for 3D, and it shows.  Most every shot composition takes advantage of the process, and there are plenty of delightfully exploitive tricks (the paddle ball gag used by the barker outside the theater, things being thrown at the camera, etc.).  The most stunning scene occurs at the dance hall, as a slow zoom shows a chandelier in the foreground, then another. . .then the crowd. . .then the chorus of dancers kicking toward the camera.  It's a small thing, but the depth and the extent to which it puts the viewer in the action is incredible.  I even caught a 3D ""blooper"": When Carolyn Jones' character is getting dressed for her night on the town (around the 22 minute mark, if you want to check it out), a fly or some other insect was caught on camera.  I had to play the scene back to make sure the darn thing wasn't actually in my living room!And while just having a great 3D copy of this film would have been enough for most fans, Warner really sweetens the deal with the extras.  There's an extensive 50-min. documentary that yields much interesting info about the film itself, and the 3D process in general.  A vintage promotional featurette is also included, as is the original trailer.  And then there's a real treat: ""Mystery of the Wax Museum,"" the 1933 film upon which House of Wax was based.  If you've never seen it, the film is a minor classic in its own right.  And you'll be surprised at how close the two films actually are.  My only complaint with it (and this isn't Warners' fault) is that the film was shot in the early two-strip Technicolor process.  So while the print used is good, the colors often appear a bit washed-out.  The process simply could not faithfully reproduce flesh tones, meaning that all the characters faces have a pinkish hue.Trust me, if you love old horror films and have even in a passing interest in the history of 3D films, this is a must-have.  Now, we just need to get Universal to release 3D versions of ""It Came From Outer Space"" and ""Revenge of the Creature.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CWWOFDTLJJXU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DQLQN3S#wasThisHelpful","R1CWWOFDTLJJXU","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a big fan of Bela Lugosi, so I'll say right up front that it's great to finally have an official release of ""Voodoo Man.""  I previously purchased a copy from Sinister Cinema, and the Legend print is much cleaner.  There are still some scratches here and there, but the overall quality is quite good.  Unfortunately, The Corpse Vanishes isn't as clear.  The opening credits are slightly blurred, and the picture remains ""soft"" for much of the film.  For a better copy of this film, I'd suggest Roan's Horror Classics 07: Corpse Vanishes/The Devil Bat, wherein you'll also find a nice clean copy of ""The Devil Bat.""But back to this release.  I love old drive-in ads and messages, and there are plenty to be found here.  Surprisingly, the video quality of most of them is really good.  There's a Fleischer cartoon, ""Ants in the Plants,"" the quality of which is about the same as the same title on Max Fleischer's Color Classics: Somewhere in Dreamland--which is to say, not great but probably as good as we're likely to see on home video.All in all, it's a very pleasant way to spend 149 minutes, especially if you have fond memories of going to the drive-in.  And the price is right; let's hope Legend Films has more such treats in store for us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AJJ95QU1IB3I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DE1LD6W#wasThisHelpful","R2AJJ95QU1IB3I","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, let me tell you I'm a huge Bela Lugosi fan.  I pretty much like all his stuff, from little-known silent films all the way through his infamous collaborations with Ed Wood.  For some reason, though, I put off seeing this film for many years.  I think I suspected what I eventually learned, in a painful 75 minutes, to be true: It's just not any good.The plot (call it spoilers if you want, and you should thank me for saving you the trouble of watching this turkey) involves the character Mother Riley, who is actually actor Arthur Lucan in drag.  Apparently, he/she was a known comic personality in England during the 30's and 40's.  Aside from being the worst drag makeup this side of Madea, the character is not remotely funny.  Maybe something is lost in the translation, although I watch quite a bit of British films and television shows, so I don't think that's it.  Anyway, Lugosi plays a scientist--not a vampire as the title suggests--who's building an army of robots, one of which accidentally gets sent to Mother Riley's house.  Her subsequent confrontation with him is, again, supposed to be hilarious.  But it's just awkward, and you'll find yourself looking at your watch long before it's over.As for the DVD, VCI didn't exactly go to great lengths to restore this one.  The picture is acceptable, maybe one step above the prints sold by public domain companies like Sinister Cinema.  The sound is also lacking; at times it sounds as though the actors are on a stage having to project their voices to reach a faraway microphone.  The only extras are optional English subtitles.  If you happen to be a fan of this movie (and please explain to me in the comment section WHY that is?), note that it also available under the alternate title My Son the Vampire from Image and several El Cheapo video companies.  I have not seen any of those, so I can't comment on their quality.If you're a Lugosi fan, you may want to check this out.  I give it two stars SOLEY for his presence.  Even with the atrocious dialogue, it's still Bela Lugosi. . .he looks and sounds great. But if you just want to see the horror icon slumming it, stick with Bride of the Monster or one of the other Ed Wood films.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37QTJR108HMOQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D49E9RY#wasThisHelpful","R37QTJR108HMOQ","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always felt the original ""Fly"" was a bit underappreciated.  Watching the film for the first time in several years, and for the first time in sparkling high definition, I may have figured something out.  Despite the title character, which would indicate low-budget ""b"" movie thrills, the film takes itself very seriously.  It is, I daresay, one of the few really ""adult"" sci-fi/horror films of its era.Fox's new Blu-ray, while not quite flawless, is certainly the best the film has ever looked on a home screen.  Prior to watching it, I played the first 10 minutes of the previous DVD release (from The Fly Collection (The Fly / Return Of The Fly / The Curse Of The Fly), and while video quality of that release is quite nice, there are subtle improvements in the new release.  There is still a bit of grain in some of the darker scenes--a common issue with many Blu-ray movies--but I never found it very distracting.  The format really shows its strengths in the lab scenes, with bright fluorescent lights and various other apparatus all aglow.  Outdoor daytime scenes, particularly the garden one near the film's end, are about as good as anything being made today.  Someone complained about the sound mix; but I honestly didn't have any problems with it.  Dialogue was clear throughout, and the occasional scream (including the chill-inducing wail of Andre Delambre's cat after a failed experiment) was fairly unnerving.Extras include the (unrestored) trailer, an 11-minute overview of the film and its sequels, a ""Biography"" episode on Vincent Price, and commentary with star David Hedison.  I haven't played the commentary yet(despite my absolute love of movies and learning about them, I tend to get bored quickly with commentary tracks in general), but the rest of the bonus materials were enjoyable.If you're a fan of The Fly, or just 50's sci-fi and horror in general, this is a must-have.

"As someone who has, to date, purchased ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" in FOUR separate versions over the years (starting with the Anchor Bay VHS tape in the late 1990's), I think it goes without saying that I'm a fan.  And while I don't think it's necessarily the best of the studio's Dracula films, I can tell you that it has never looked better.As you will learn in the all-new 30-minute documentary on the disc, this is a new restoration of the film.  I watched it on a mid-range 3D Blu-ray player and high-end 70"" Smart TV.  And while the image still doesn't quite compare with a new film shot in high definition, the picture is incredibly detailed for a film of this vintage.  One can really appreciate the level of detail, and the use of color, in the castle scenes.  The film's highlight--the Count's rather gory resurrection scene--really had me on the edge of my seat.  James Bernard's simple but highly effective score adds much to the scene as well.The aforementioned documentary features interviews with stars Barbara Shelley and Francis Matthews.  Both have fond memories of the film and its director, the great Terence Fisher.  Carryover features from previous releases include a cast commentary, and an interesting, if somewhat amateurish, episode of the ""World of Hammer"" series focusing on Christopher Lee.  Disappointingly, the ""restored trailer"" is NOT the same as previously available, but a short combo promo for this film plus ""The Plague of the Zombies,"" that actually doesn't show any footage from either film!Those who have the old Anchor Bay DVD will want to hang onto it for the extra features NOT repeated here, including a few minutes of on-set ""home movies,"" and a different World of Hammer episode titled ""Dracula and the Undead.""So if you're one of those people like me who just keeps buying this film in every new release, you might ask yourself is the Blu-ray upgrade worth getting.  I would have to say yes.  The improvements in the image are at times subtle, but those castle scenes and pretty much any outdoor scenes are fantastic.  And you won't find the documentary anywhere else.  And hey, the price is right (as of this writing anyway).  Hopefully there will be more classic Hammer horror on Blu-ray in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160NU4ELU4NFQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D80GMP6#wasThisHelpful","R160NU4ELU4NFQ","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite being a huge fan of 50's and 60's sci-fi movies, I somehow missed this one until it showed up on Turner Classic Movies a few years back.  Now, Columbia offers up a very nice print of this rare movie, and, for the most part, that's great news for us classic sci-fi fans.Serious science-fiction films during the heyday of drive-in ""b"" films were pretty rare.  The decade got off to a great start with films like Destination Moon and The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951).  But the greater part of the 1950's gave us giant critters, alien invaders, and interstellar voyages that were far heavy on FICTION than SCIENCE.  So it's refreshing to find 12 TO THE MOON at the end of that decade, offering another thoughtful--in its own limited way--exploration of cosmic themes [Spoilers Ahead].A truly international crew sets off to explore the moon, and find nothing but trouble when they get there.  But I give the writers credit for the crew idea, coming near the end of the Cold War.  Sure, everyone speaks fluent English, and there's never any doubt that the American Guy is in charge.  And while the 2 female crew members offer solid contributions to the team, an early scene of them showering (very chaste, don't get excited) seems a bit out-of-place.  Predictably, some prejudices surface, most notably between a German scientist and a crew member of apparent Jewish origin.You want aliens?  Well, you'll get them. . .sort of.  The never-seen ""moon people"" communicate with the crew through a series of Chinese writings.  And while this is never mentioned, I think it's kinda cool because even in the late 50's, China had the largest population on Earth.  So might an alien race not assume that Chinese was the dominant language?  There's also the idea that the human race might not be the ONLY race on Earth worth studying: One of the few requests made of the crew is that they leave behind the pair of cats brought along for ""procreation"" experiments (although the felines' fate, as well of that of two crew members left behind, is left to the viewer's imagination).As far as the A/V quality, I think it's safe to assume there will never be a better presentation of the film.  I viewed this on a Blu-ray player and 70"" HDTV, and the image was very sharp throughout.  Only a handful of stock footage scenes, and some unconvincing paintings during the ""big freeze"" finale lean toward the grainy side.  The mono soundtrack is very clear as well.  The DVD also includes the film's terrific theatrical trailer, which looks as good as the film itself.Even if you're a big fan of the genre like I am, there's a good chance this rare film has eluded you.  I'll stop short of calling it a classic, but it IS a very well-made film that offers up an intelligent story, earnest performances, and good (if thrifty) effects.  Definitely recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMMFATB11LA4C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004CZZZTA#wasThisHelpful","RMMFATB11LA4C","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit that, prior to seeing this film, I only knew Rosemary Clooney from White Christmas [Blu-ray].  But since I LOVE her in that movie, I figured I'd give this previously unheard-of film a try.  And although she is, once again, very enjoyable, the movie itself is hard to love.  The idea of a western spoof seems solid enough.  It even CAN work, in films like Cat Ballou and The Villain.  But someone made the choice to have extremely stylized, stage-bound sets, and the effect is rather jarring.  Even the music isn't that great, though Ms. Clooney certainly does the best she can with the material.  And it's almost worth watching just for the title tune, played more or less straight, with a chorus of lovely ladies and their red garters.It also doesn't help that Clooney has no real chemistry with the dull Guy Mitchell or the only slightly more-interesting Jack Carson.  And the white lady wearing (pardon the expression) ""redface"" as a ludicrously unconvincing Indian ""comic"" relief is almost unbearable to watch.  Throw in a standard revenge plot that really goes nowhere, and not even supporting assistance from Frank Faylen and Buddy Ebsen can save this turkey.It's a shame that Clooney only made a few films during her prime.  It seems almost surreal that she could make something like this the very same year she secured her place in the hearts of movie lovers with ""White Christmas.""  Recommendeded ONLY for die-hard Rosemary Clooney fans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1K01UEJ7UU0ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECW9TEU#wasThisHelpful","R1K01UEJ7UU0ZH","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a longtime fan and collector of sci-fi films, I was very surprised to see a major studio offering this collection at a dirt-cheap price.  One might expect to pay the current price ($5.00) for ONE barely-known film from public-domain outfits like Alpha Video.  But FOUR fairly well-known b-movies, from MGM, for less than the price of one?  I took a chance and pre-ordered my collection, and I'm glad I did.""Movies 4 U: Sci-Fi Classics"" represents the major-studio DVD debut of both Beyond the Time Barrier and The Time Travelers.  Most of us collectors would gladly have paid more just to finally get good copies of these films.  The other two (Man from Planet X and Angry Red Planet) were previously released as part of MGM'S Midnite Movies series.  All four films look great.  I haven't done a side-by-side comparison of the latter two films with my Midnite Movies copies, but they seem to look just as good as the previous releases (why would the studio not use the same prints if they already owned them, right?).  This was my first time viewing The Time Travelers, and although I'd have to say it's the least of bunch (in terms of the film itself, I mean), it is the only one offered in the widescreen format.  The print used for Beyond the Time Barrier is a huge improvement over the Sinister Cinema release that's been floating around for years.I'm also a collector of sci-fi film trailers, and I have to say I was a little disappointed that these were not included, especially since trailers were included on the MM releases, and trailers for the other 2 films are easy to find on the internet.As for the films themselves, Angry Red Planet is certainly the best, with its far-out visuals and memorable creatures.  The Man From Planet X, although it's rarely mentioned in discussions of serious sci-fi films of its era, is also very well-made and suspenseful.  It's interesting to see veteran actor William Schallert in a rare villain role.  Beyond the Time Barrier is strictly Saturday-matinee stuff, but has plenty of action and is generally well-acted.  The Time Travelers, as stated above, is my least favorite of the four.  But it's still a fun (and very 60's) trip, and should not be overlooked.All in all, this is a great little package for budget-minded collectors who refuse to settle for murky public-domain prints of these almost-forgotten little gems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23CH2DFUU7HPS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D9EJFZA#wasThisHelpful","R23CH2DFUU7HPS","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is THE animation release of the year for us fans of classic cartoons.  I was beginning to think we'd never see official, restored releases of these true treasures of animation.  I love cartoons from most every studio and era, from Looney Tunes up through the ""limited"" animation styles of the 60's.  But no one made 'em like the Fleischers in their pioneering early days.  Along with the studio's early Popeye shorts, the Betty Boop's are simply some of the most creative, zany, funny, and (let's face it) weird short films ever committed to celluloid.A few others have complained about Olive Film's plans to release the cartoons in four single-disc sets, with a dozen cartoons per set.  I assume the studio is doing this to test the waters, and be sure there is a market for the DVD's before they make them all.  But even if, on a more cynical note, it's just to make more money. . .who cares?  The target audience for these films WILL buy them all, and I for one am grateful to Olive and Paramount for investing in this long-neglected property.As for the A/V quality, both are almost uniformly excellent.  Anyone who's suffered through bootleg tapes, discs, or scratchy Youtube videos of these cartoons will be delighted at the clear and vibrant images.  I did notice a few of the title cards seemed a bit grainy, but the main body of each short is probably the best they will ever look.  If you love old cartoons, or Betty Boop in particular, there's no question that you need this set in your collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11M0TQTTL3NRR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D4C5GXC#wasThisHelpful","R11M0TQTTL3NRR","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a relative late-comer to Doctor Who fandom (I started watching with the 2005 series), I have long wondered why there seemed to be no concise, definitive guide to the ""classic"" years of the show. Sure, it's a lot of ground to cover, but I figured SOMEONE out there has seen every episode since 1963.So, in time for the 50th anniversary, here comes an affordable and highly-portable guide to Doctor Who.  From William Hartnell's debut in ""An Unearthly Child"" up through the 2012 Christmas special, every episode is discussed.  Well. . .sort of.  The immediate problem one notices is that episode descriptions are typically limited to ONE LINE (For example, the synopsis for ""The Edge of Destruction"" merely offers, ""The TARDIS appears to be under alien control. . .""  Really, that's it).  A line or two of ""Observations"" follow, ranging from helpful (such as why a story ended up being 3 parts instead of four) to superfluous, (such as noting things like ""William Russell was on holiday for the filming of episodes 4 and 5"").  A highly-subjective critical comment follows.  Of course, every fan might have differences of opinion here, but I for one disagreed with Mr. Campbell's comments more often than not (a 2 out of 10 for ""The Doctor, The Widow and the Wardrobe"". . .really?).Still, for those of us who are playing catch-up via the broad range of DVD's out there, the guide is somewhat useful.  I've only seen maybe 3 John Pertwee stories ever, so at least I can be slightly better informed when deciding what to get.  I can only hope that, since 2013 is shaping up to be the biggest year ever for Doctor Who, someone is out there right now working on a more comprehensive guide.  Some pictures would be nice, too. :-)In the meantime, don't let the author's oddly negative attitude about the show's future discourage you.  Doctor Who is now bigger than ever, and I don't think it's going anywhere for a long time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2EE15HORQSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0762452404#wasThisHelpful","R1E2EE15HORQSG","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll never claim to have ""seen 'em all,"" but I've seen a LOT of fifties sci-fi.  I love it, even many of the so-called ""bad"" movies that end up as fodder for that bizarre cult know as Misery Science Theater 3000.  And I actually had already purchased this film in a public domain copy distributed by Sinister Cinema.  So I knew what to expect as far the film itself: Ultra-cheap effects, stock footage of rockets, scantily-clad ""alien"" women, a dumb monster, etc.  I love how NO attempt was made to simulate the environment of a alien world (in this case, the 13th moon of Jupiter).  Witness a largely inept crew of spacemen running around with no suits or helmets, a ""monster"" that is just a man in makeup and a black jumpsuit who somehow invokes terror even though his average footspeed for pursuit is on par with that of the mummy.  All these things really don't seem out of place when you stop and realize you're watching a movie called ""Fire Maidens of Outer Space.""So, you either like this sort of thing, you don't, or you like to make fun of it.  But whatever your reasons, if the film appeals to you, you'll be glad to know that Olive Films has done a fine job of bringing it home.  I haven't done a back-to-back comparison with my Sinister copy, but this release claims to be the ""uncut, 80 minute"" version.  If anyone knows what's different about it, I'd appreciate you letting me know in the comments section.  After all, no one should be expected to watch this turkey two times in a row :-)Also typical of Olive Films, this DVD is a bare-bones release.  All you get are chapter stops.  It's a shame, because as I also pointed out in my review of Olive's The Space Children, the film has a pretty nifty theatrical trailer that's very easy to find on the internet.  But like I said, if you enjoy the film, you may be satisfied just to have a good copy of it.For a more enjoyable variation on the same theme, check out Queen of Outer Space.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL9PMRFVLUMDA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D3DJH7S#wasThisHelpful","RL9PMRFVLUMDA","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As some who has owned almost every major game system since the Atari 2600, I can tell you I was pretty excited to learn about this.  I still had many of my games for all 3 of the systems represented here.  And I can only describe myself as ""giddy"" upon seeing the start-up screen of some of my old NES favorites after many years.  But as I spent more time examining the unit and its features, my enthusiasm. . .well, it didn't completely disappear.  But let's just say I calmed down a bit.First, as many have pointed out, the wireless controllers are practically useless.  I couldn't get one of them to work at all.  And I had to sit very still in order for the other to maintain a connection with the console.  Pretty frustrating when you're trying to play a game.  Secondly, I did find a few games that just plain wouldn't work.  But when I tried them on the original systems (I still had the SNES and Genesis in storage), they played just fine.Still, if you don't have access to the original game consoles, this is a passable substitute IF you get the original controllers.  And since I found NES controllers used on this very site for about 6 bucks apiece, it wasn't the end of the world.  But frankly, the whole unit feels very cheap, and I question its durability.Recommended ONLY if you don't want the hassle and expense of replacing all 3 classic console systems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Y4I6VP3IVNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O3EFY2#wasThisHelpful","R28Y4I6VP3IVNM","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been collecting Doctor Who action figures for several years now, and have been mostly very happy with the Character Options line.  However, I wish I'd paid a bit closer attention when ordering this one.  The new series 7 figures are significantly smaller than the previous 5"" ones.  It's a shame, too, because it's not a bad likeness of Clara.  But I want to display her alongside my 11th Doctor, Amy, Rory and River figures. . .but she's just too tiny.  I'm not sure if the smaller figures are cost-cutting measure or what, but I really hope they aren't done with the 5"" ones.If you're a fan and/or collector, you'll probably be reasonably happy with this one.

"Just when I thought I'd seen every sci-fi film from the Fab Fifties, here comes this unknown little sci-fi comedy.  I admit, I got pretty excited when I read the cast list:  Anne Francis, John Agar, Charles Coburn, Spring Byington, Beverly Garland. . .all good actors, 3 of which are known for their genre roles of the 1950's.  I wasn't familiar with the little boy, George Winslow, who is actually the main character, but I'd read good things about him.The Rocket Man (minor spoilers ahead) tells the story of an orphaned 7 year old boy who spends most of his time engaging in make-believe space adventures, and acquires an actual ""ray gun"" from a space man who pops up from time to time.  But instead of being a force for destruction, the gun forces people to tell the truth.  Yep, that's pretty much it.  There's some old-fashioned good vs. evil in the form of a kindly Justice of the Peace who takes the boy out of the orphanage and confronts a crooked politician who tries to shut the place down.  There's the always-delightful Anne Francis in her prime, falling for John Agar (whose character is not what he seems).  It's all innocent fun, and on paper it certainly seems like the makings of a minor classic.But for some reason, it doesn't quite work that well.  The cast does their best with the limited material (from a screenplay co-written by legendary comedian Lenny Bruce).  There's not much tension--there's never much doubt that mean ""Big Bill Watkins"" won't get the orphanage, and very little humor to be found.  But the real deal-breaker for me was little George Winslow.  Like I said, apparently the child actor has a following, and I admit I haven't seen him in anything else.  But his deadpan delivery makes him seem a bit like a robotic Opie Taylor.  He's just awful and thoroughly unlikable throughout the whole movie.I will commend 20th Century Fox for presenting a very nice print of the film.  I watched it on a 65"" Samsung LCD flatscreen, and both video and audio quality were very clear.  As is the case with most of these MOD discs, there are no extras or even a chapter menu.  And I can appreciate the rarity of the film (as far as I know, this is its home video debut), it's just not one I'll be re-watching anytime soon.  Recommended for hardcore fans of Anne Francis, John Agar or any of the other cast.  But it will likely just be a curiosity to everyone else.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7BVI001CO8ZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009L4DTD6#wasThisHelpful","R7BVI001CO8ZH","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're reading this, chances are you're already a Buster Keaton fan.  If you're not, let me just say first off that this set should NOT be your introduction to the legendary comic actor/writer/director.  Keaton's masterworks are the silent ""two-reel"" comedies he made in the twenties (and available in the excellent Buster Keaton Short Films Collection: 1920-1923 (Three-Disc Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray], to which this set serves as a companion piece).  As many of you will know, Keaton's career fumbled immediately following the silent years, with a 5-year stint making features at MGM.  But these films, made for the independent Educational Pictures, represented a return to form of sorts.  Here was Keaton back in his element: the comedy short.  And Educational also gave him back much of his creative control. . .something he lost working as essentially an actor only for the big studio.Truth be told (and understand, I'm a HUGE fan), most of these sound comedies don't measure up to the gems Keaton made 10 to 15 years earlier.  But there's still plenty for fans to enjoy.  Unlike silent stars who had difficulty making the transition to sound, Buster had a distinct voice and used it to good effect.  He wisely didn't stray too far from his origins; the best bits in these films don't require speaking or much sound at all to make them funny.  ONE RUN ELMER and MIXED MAGIC are good examples of this.  Keaton's love of trains and physical, architecture-based gags are also in evidence in several films.As for the set itself, the video and audio quality varies a bit from film to film.  There is the occasional unrepaired splice, resulting in a ""jump"" in the action.  Debris is evident in many cases, although the overall picture quality is quite good for its age.  It's worth noting that Educational Pictures was NOT MGM, and I doubt that the independent company ever made a film as polished as the larger, more affluent studios could.  If you've seen the Blu-ray release of the silent shorts, you know what is possible with restoration efforts.  I would easily give Kino's earlier release of the silent films 5 stars for visual quality; by comparison, ""Lost Keaton"" scores 4 out of 5.  Still a very good rating.Extras aren't as plentiful as with the earlier set, but you still get a wonderfully informative booklet, with info about each film.  There's a still gallery, and a video montage of various stunts and physical gags.  And for those who care about such things (as I do), ""Lost Keaton""'s package design is virtually identical to the earlier release. . .making a very attractive pair of comedy classics on the shelf. :-)Bottom line: If you're a fan, this is a no-brainer.  If you're not (yet), defintiely start with the earlier set first.  Buster Keaton was a one-of-kind comic genius, and Kino Lorber has done him proud with this lovingly-created collector's sets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S74JE8FWMSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006P5KEOQ#wasThisHelpful","R2S74JE8FWMSF","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an avid cartoon collector AND a child of the seventies, I was delighted when I first saw this collection on the shelves.  Unfortunately, being a collector also means that I already had about half of the cartoons contained therein.  Most of the titles here are from Hanna Barbera, and are availble on separate ""complete series"" collections.  But still, it's hard to argue with choices included.I have very fond memories of watching shows like Speed Buggy, Josie & The Pussycats, and the Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour (the only non-Hanna Barbera cartoon here, by the way) and eating a couple of bowls of cereal on those magical Saturday mornings.  And that's the appeal of this set.  It may be hard to get modern kids into silly shows like ""The Funky Phantom"" or the Charlie Chan one, but those of us watching them through the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia are willing to forgive their faults.On a technical note, Warner Bros. has included a disclaimer that not all of the shows are derived from pristine elements.  I personally found them all to be quite acceptable, with the more high-profile shows like The Jetsons and Scooby Doo looking the best.  With over 5 hours of content spread over 2 discs, you'll get your money's worth, even if a few of the cartoons aren't exactly HD quality.Bottom line: If you grew up watching these cartoons, you'll probably still get a kick out of them now.

"There are plenty of reviews of the original 2010 release of ""Teenage Dream,"" so I won't rehash all that has been said.  But I will point out that the album spawned an incredible SIX number one singles.  And whether you ultimately like Katy Perry or not, there is no denying that power of numbers like that.  Teenage Dream is a benchmark album for pop music. Period.Yet if you somehow missed out buying the album, here's a chance to not only rectify that oversight, but receive a nice reward for your latter-day conversion to Camp Katy.  In addition to the 12 original tracks--at least 9 of which are great tunes (sorry, Katy, I'm never gonna like ""Peacock""), here are 7 new reasons to pick this one up:""The One That Got Away (acoustic)"": After 5 upbeat, danceable number ones in a row, the album cooled down with this bittersweet mid-tempo number.  The acoustic version doesn't necessarily better the original, but it's still very cool.  If you bought Katy's MTV Unplugged (CD & DVD) a few years back, you know that she can really make a sparse arrangement shine with her unique voice.""Part of Me"": The newest single, and record-breaking SEVENTH number one single from the album.  It's great upbeat Katy, in the same vein as ""Hot N Cold.""""Wide Awake"": Hypnotic club number that moves along the same speed as ""E.T.""  Probably the least of the 3 all-new studio tracks, but still very good.""Dressin' Up"": A sexy little bit of fantasy indulgence in which Katy actually makes lines like ""You wanna pet my kitty/You're such a dirty doggie"" work.  Yeah, really.  The grinding music in the verses gives way to a raving dancefloor chorus.  Possibly a future classic?""E.T. feat. Kanye West"": OK, I have to tell you I'm no fan of insane racist West.  But this is the version of the song that accompanied the music video, so it's nice for completists to have it on the album proper.""Last Friday Night feat. Missy Elliott"": Now, this is what a remix should be.  Rapper Elliott's intro and mid-song breakdown fit rather organically with the stomping rhythm of this classic tune.""Tommie Sunshine's Megasix Smash-up"": An agreeable mixing of the first six singles from the album is a fitting closer.  Just try to sit still as the beat moves you effortlessly from hit to hit.There you have it.  ""The Complete Confection"" is exactly what a deluxe re-release should be.  It's also probably one of THE best pop albums in years.  Even if you already have the original disc, it's definitely worth an upgrade.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TU3WEQNGC5NB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006XBSAP2#wasThisHelpful","R2TU3WEQNGC5NB","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You know, there's a pretty short list of big-screen movies that have spawned successful t.v. series.  Off the top of my head, there's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, M*A*S*H, STARGATE SG-1, and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.  And while calling this short-lived small-screen continuation of STARMAN ""successful"" might be stretching it a bit, I definitely feel the show outdid the movie in most every way.The basic, Fugitive-style plot, of course, was nothing groundbreaking.  But where Starman shines is in the casting.  It may be hard at first to put aside one's memories of Jeff Bridges--he did, after all, receive an Oscar nomination for his role in the feature film--but Robert Hayes quickly makes it his own.  It helps that his alien character actually takes on a DIFFERENT body than the one in the film, so hopefully he is easier for audiences to accept.  Alien ""fish out of water"" stories were also nothing new, even in 1986.  But again, Hayes is up the challenge.  His Paul Forrester may be an innocent in a cynical world, but his message of peace and understanding is universal.Likewise, the producers struck gold with C.B. (later Christopher Daniel, and no, that doesn't really make sense to me either) Barnes as the teenage offspring of Forrester and the human Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen in the film and Erin Gray capably filling her shoes here).  While Forrester feels a need to protect and teach his son, the boy also does both for him.And then there's Michael Cavanaugh as George Fox, a man who is Jack McGee to Forrester's Incredible Hulk.  Fox is determined to capture this man from the stars, as well as his half-human progeny (""Children are the hope of your species, not the danger,"" Forrester tells an unsympathetic Fox).What impresses me most about the show, even 25 years later, is how positive it is without becoming too preachy.  This ""Starman"" is something of a pacifist, solving problems with his mind rather than threats of violence.  It also is one of the few shows I can recall that presented such a strong father/son relationship (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine also handled this concept well. . .but I can't really think of any other examples).  Kids from broken homes weren't anything new in 1986, but just imagine how Scott would probably be portrayed in a modern series. . .angry and antisocial, and would probably spend more time teaching his estranged father how to hack a website than learning life lessons.Aside from the fashions, cars, etc. I don't find the show dated at all.  I wish there were more shows like this, instead of so-called ""reality"" series and unimaginative and violent crime dramas.  I hope everyone who has fond memories of Starman: The Series, or just anyone seeking decent family entertainment will pick this one up.On a technical note: Be aware that Sony is offering the show in the DVD-R format, meaning it's possible some older (or cheaper) DVD players will have problems with playback.  I play everything on a Blu-ray player, and can't imagine watching a show on my computer. . .but that's just me :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IYDVW2MIGBUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007G8SEF2#wasThisHelpful","R3IYDVW2MIGBUT","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Behold the power of Meat Loaf.  Long-embraced by die-hard fans (if not critics), here's one rock 'n roll rebel that just won't quit.  Sure, the days of ""Bat out of Hell"" and other collaborations with lyrical rock god Jim Steinman may be long gone, but the man just keeps comin.'  And more often than not, comin' on strong.HELL IN A HANDBASKET follows-up 2010's HANG COOL TEDDY BEAR with another set of passionate, well-played rockers and ballads.  And although the album's press materials quote Meat as calling this ""his most personal record ever,"" it seems like just so much hype considering he didn't write any of the songs.  But after listening to it, I'm willing to accept that some of the songwriters must know the man pretty well.  This is evident in the opening track, ""All of Me,"" as credible a self-dissection as you're likely to hear on a hard rock record in 2012.  Over a sea of background vocals, he offers ""This is my anger/This is my shame/These are my insecurities that I can't explain.""  It's a revealing opening statement for an album full of such observations.Other stanout tracks include:""The Giving Tree"" is another well-crafted look in the mirror, lyrically speaking.The 3-song medley ""Blue Sky/Mad Mad World/The Good God Is a Woman and She Don't Like Ugly"" just may send some older fans running for the hills, as the third part includes a rap by Chuck D.  But let it go, folks. . .Meat isn't selling out, he's buying in.  And the songs fit really well together.What to make of a cover of ""California Dreamin'""?  To be honest, I wasn't convinced at first.  Although still possessing plenty of raw power, the guy's voice is not what it used to be.  And the opening raspy ""All the leaves are brown"" had me worried.  But somehow, the melancholy lyrics actually work with his world-weary delivery.  Of course, the always-welcome assist from Patti Russo doesn't hurt(Russo shows up again on the beautiful pop number ""Our Love and Our Souls"").""Stand in the Storm"" includes an eclectic guest roster that includes Trace Adkins, Mark McGrath and rapper Lil Jon.  It could have been a trainwreck, but somehow Paul Crook's production holds it all together.The album closes with the ballad, ""Fall from Grace,"" that's pleasing enough if you don't pay too close attention to the cliched lyrics (Every saint is a sinner, one step forward two steps back, etc.).As for the rest of the album, it's certainly not bad.  Even when the words aren't especially memorable and Meat's voice starts to wear thin, the musicianship remains solid throughout.  For fans who enjoyed HCTD--and I am one of them--what you're really getting is another solid collection of rock/pop tunes. . .although HANDBASKET doesn't rock quite as hard.  It also serves as a welcome change from what passes for pop music these days.  Just the fact that Meat Loaf is alive and well, and keeping rock 'n roll by his side is reason enough to pick this one up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259496UPN8EFF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006VOW2IC#wasThisHelpful","R259496UPN8EFF","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"OK, there are plenty of great song-by-song reviews here, so I'll try not to repeat what you may have already read.  The thing that most impresses me about ""Wrecking Ball"" is that it really breaks new ground, musically.  Sure, there's no mistaking the Boss' voice and songwriting, but the musicianship here is sometimes shocking and almost always invigorating.  Some may take him to task for his politics (and truth be told, I like ""We Take Care of Our Own"" even though I question the validity of what amounts to Bush-bashing in 2012), but Springsteen has been making statements about the country in his music for at least 30 years.  If you don't like what he has to say, just don't listen.  It's not like you will hear many of these songs on the radio anyway, since the majority of listeners have given the Top 40 format over to unoriginal hip hop noise.And therein lies the point, and the problem.  Bruce's fans are loyal, and most of us will buy each new release even though the guy hasn't had a true hit single in 15 years (the 1997 re-release of ""Secret Garden"").  Keeping album-oriented rock music alive is a tall order to fill these days.  But hey, if anyone can do it. . .For those who have remained loyal, here's how ""Wrecking Ball"" stacks up to the rest of the new millenium Springsteen catalog: Better than DEVILS AND DUST and WE SHALL OVERCOME, much better than WORKING ON A DREAM, and a slight improvement over MAGIC (which I don't feel held together as well as an album, despite a handful of great songs).  It does not, however, top THE RISING, which I feel was his best record since TUNNEL OF LOVE.Do make sure and get the Deluxe Edition, as it includes two decent bonus tracks.  The only issue I have with this version is that the CD sleeve (I don't call this fragile cardboard crap a ""case"")is oversized--about the size of one of the old 5"" floppy discs.  So storage could be a problem if you use a standard-size CD holder.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R145WBSXPOL2H6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006ZCWU5K#wasThisHelpful","R145WBSXPOL2H6","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many people here, I'm a fan but I wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on a ""sampler"" disc, when it's clear that the complete season sets are forthcoming.  But curiousity got the best of me, and I picked it up.  And for the most part, I'm glad I did.  All the reviews and Youtube videos in the world can't actually recreate the experience of seeing what has been done with TNG.  It's been reconfigured to accomdodate today's technology. . .so if you don't have a decent-size (at least 42"", I'd say) HDTV and surround sound system, you will be missing out.As a longtime fan, I'm not that thrilled with the episode choices.  I do think ""Encounter at Farpoint"" has been unfairly maligned for decades.  It's not that bad, BUT there are plenty of better episodes from which to choose.  ""Sins of the Father"" is just fine, although if I was going to pick a 3rd season episode to represent the best of TNG, I'd likely have gone with ""The Offspring"" or ""Yesterday's Enterprise.""  Likewise, ""The Inner Light"" is fine episode (and usually ranks among the Top 10 in fans' lists).  But it is very talkly and doesn't really show off the show's visuals.As of this writing, a lot of reviewers are speculating whether CBS/Paramount will go forward with its plan to release all 7 seasons in the format.  I'm quite sure there is enough interest in TNG for that to happen.  It's certainly the most popular (though, ultimately, not the best) of the 6 Star Trek series.  Personally, I hope it sells very well, paving the way for THE best series, Deep Space Nine, to be released in HD.In the meantime, ""The Next Level"" sampler is convincing enough.  It's just up to you whether it's worth spending a little money now, when you are likely to spend it again on the complete episode sets.  I'm actually offering my disc up for sale because it will be useless in a couple years' time.

"Here's a mostly-forgotten bit of monster fun from Hanna Barbera, circa 1980.  The Drak Pack centers on three teenage descendants of the legendary Dracula, Wolfman, and the Frankenstein monster.  Instead of perpetuating the monsterous mythos of their ancestors, these guys are trying to do some good.  Leading the pack is the ""Big D"" himself.  Their comically-inept adversaries comprise the group O.G.R.E. (Organization for Generally Rotten Enterprises).Mix Scooby Doo and The Groovie Goolies and, well, you'd probably still come up with something a bit more fun and engaging than The Drak Pack.  Still, it's good clean fun, especially for monster fans.  As is typical of HB animated releases, the video and audio presentation are more than adequate, if unremarkable.  There are no special features in the 3-disc set.Recommended mostly for nostalgia purposes; I imagine modern kids will find the humor and action rather bland.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RM9OA4F3QSSI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010YO0IS#wasThisHelpful","R2RM9OA4F3QSSI","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a lifelong fan of classic animation, few things get me worked up quicker than the PC police telling me what's appropriate to watch.  Case in point: there are currently 11 acknowledged cartoons (the so-called ""Censored Eleven"") that have not been shown on television in unedited form since the late 1960's.  There are people who feel these shorts contain racist and/or violent gags that are no longer considered appropriate.  Certainly everyone is entitled to his or her opinion on this matter.  And here's mine: If a 70 year old cartoon upsets you to the point where you not only can no longer watch it, you want to ensure NO ONE ELSE ever gets to see it, you need therapy that no amount of censorship can provide.Moving on. . .let me first say how delighted I am that Thunderbean Animation has not only given us an unaltered version of one of these cartoons, ""Jungle Jitters,"" but has provided a typically excellent print of the film as well.  And while the other 14 cartoons in this collection haven't been strictly banned from broadcast, many of them would no doubt raise some eyebrows among the easily offended.The theme here, as the title indicates, is cannibals.  Cannibals and plenty of 'em.  Watch them square off against the likes of Porky Pig, Muff & Jeff, The Little King, Bosko and the original (human) Tom & Jerry.  And while the subject matter may to hard to swallow (ha!) for some, cartoons involving exotic locales and strange practices were common in the 20's and 30's.  The oldest short in this collection actually dates back to 1917.Collectors might wish to note, however, that several of the cartoons here are available in previously-released collections.  The Tom & Jerry and Little King ones can be found on Thunderbean's own compilations featuring those characters; ""Molly Moo Cow & Robinson Crusoe"" is available on Image's Cartoons That Time Forgot: The Van Beuren Studios Vol. 1; ""Korn Plastered in Africa"" is on the company's weird and wonderful The Golden Age of Cartoons: Cultoons! Ads and Oddities; and the Superman short is available on a variety of DVD's.As usual, the company has done a fine job of restoring these mostly-forgotten gems.  The only complaint I have is with the audio.  Quite often I found I had to adjust the volume on my t.v. between cartoons.  This would have been easy to fix in the mastering process--I do it all the time with consumer-level electronics in making ""mix"" DVD's of my favorite cartoons--so I deducted one star from the overall rating.Still, if you're a fan of early animation, this is another no-brainer.  I know I'm starting to sound like a Thunderbean employee (I promise I'm not!), but true fans and collectors should seek out all their wonderful collections.  They are doing what the big studios are no longer willing to: Giving viewers credit for having enough intelligence to decide whether something is offensive or not.  In this case it's simple...if you're having cannibals over for dinner, just hide this DVD.  Although, if you ARE having cannibals over, maybe you should be more concerned about the MENU than the evening's entertainment :-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EEOTDJ833II3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0057RM1Y4#wasThisHelpful","R2EEOTDJ833II3","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As an avid collector of 50's sci-fi films, I've waited a long time for this official release of ""Gog.""  It's one of those movies that many of us heard about or read about for many years, but rarely got the chance to actually see.  So was it worth the wait?  For the most part, yes (please note, minor spoilers follow).Despite being originally screened in 3-D (which was at the height of its popularity in 1953) and featuring a pair of robots, ""Gog"" doesn't really fit in with its pulpy rubber-monster brethren of the same era.  Here's a science fiction film with--gasp!--real science (more or less).  This is both an asset and a liability, depending on how much ""sci"" you like in your sci-fi.  In other words, if you're tuning in to see a lot of killer robot action, you'll be disappointed.  ""Gog"" is a very talky film, although it held this viewer's interest with a plethora of science gadgets and impressive lab sets.Which is not to say there isn't SOME action.  The film racks up a surpising body count, as the scientists and other workers are exterminated by....well, you'll have to see for yourself.  The production values are also pretty high for a ""b"" movie.  The lab scenes have an almost documentary-like reality to them.  And the robots Gog and Magog, while less believable, are well-made and memorable.As I said, I've waited a very long time to see a good print of this film.  And MGM doesn't disappoint.  The color scheme is typical for films of the period: Almost saturated in places, but very bright and well-defined.  The mono audio track is clear throughout.  Unfortunately, there are no bonus features at all, not even scene selections.  But if you're a fan of the movie, or just 50's sci-fi in general, you'll want to add this one to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AUR937D1MJNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TMXXX0#wasThisHelpful","R1AUR937D1MJNL","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a lifelong fan of Looney Tunes, I was intitially excited when I heard they were making a comeback.  Sure, most of the ""old guard"" from the classic years are no longer with us, but I though maybe the characters themselves were timeless enough to sustain a reinvention for the 21st century.Then I watched the show.I can deal with the different looks of the characters. . .every ""classic"" character is going to be subject to some re-interpretation.  I can even understand the premise: Bugs and Daffy are now roommates living in suburbia, and their neighbors are many of the old-time LT characters.  But where the show falls FAR from its roots is in the writing.  The thing is just NOT funny.  I'm not kidding, I will literally sit for hours and watch old Looney Tunes and laugh until I'm in tears.  But over the first few episodes of The Looney Tunes Show, I don't think I managed even a chuckle.In theory, the ""Merrie Melodies"" sections (approx. 90 second musical numbers peformed by individual characters) is fairly original.  But again, there's little enjoyment to be had.  Others have been critical of the CGI Road Runner shorts (which last about 3 min.), but I actually found these to be much truer to the spirit of Looney Tunes that the hand-drawn main cartoons in each episode.  By the way, that hand-drawn animation is typical of today's made-for-t.v. cartoon offerings--adequate but uninspired.For purists, the Bugs and Daffy voices are pretty good.  In fact, Daffy's whole personality has been kept intact, making it easily the best thing about these cartoons.  By contrast, be prepared to have your open mouth hit the floor when Witch Hazel opens her mouth and instead of the beloved voice of June Foray, we are treated to the voice of a sassy black woman (??).  Gossamer (Hazel's son, and again I say ""??"") doesn't fare much better, as he sounds like a wimpy 8 year old.As you can see, The Looney Tunes Show just never had much of a chance of pleasing an old-time fan like myself.  But even if I could somehow erase the memory of those fantastic animated treats of yesteryear, I seriously doubt I'd find much to love about this show.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D571ELJQM8NZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BXY1OW#wasThisHelpful","R3D571ELJQM8NZ","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Witchmaker (a.k.a. ""The Legend of Witch Hollow,"" the alternate title that actually appears on-screen here) is one of those movies that horror fans have HEARD about for years, yet relatively few had actually probably seen.  Its legend among witchcraft-themed movies has loomed large, however, and its ""official"" release on DVD is an important event for horror cinema.[Minor Spoilers ahead] Green Acres' Alvy Moore is the paranormal researcher who stumbles upon murder and supernatural mayhem in bayou country.  It turns out one of his students (the lovely Thordis Brandt) is a descendant of witches.  Their investigation also pits them against a powerful, creepy sorcerer known as Luther the Berserk.Despite being unavoidably dated, all this is played out with dead seriousness, helping The Witchmaker to rise above its surface camp appeal.  There's plenty of bright red blood and some near-nudity (think a late-sixties Hammer feature) to keep things moving along.  The acting is a bit uneven, but one doesn't generally come to this kind of movie looking for Oscar-caliber performances.  Although years of Green Acres reruns have rendered Moore inseparable from his ""Mr. Kimball"" character, he's really quite good here.  The rituals peformed by Luther and his followers are memorable, and add to the atmosphere of dread that runs through the film.I haven't seen any of the various bootleg prints of the film that have apparently been around for years, but the transfer by Code Red is quite good.  Some of the colors are a bit saturated, but it's a fairly common look for films of this era.  There's a bit of grain present, especially in the darker scenes, but the overall presentation is impressive. I only played about 20 min. of the commentary track before getting bored, so that's not a selling point for me.  There are a few Code Red trailers for some movies that I'm pretty sure I don't care to see.I'd recommend this one for all serious horror fans, especially those who enjoy a solid ""B"" movie.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2PG8ZZ2XJDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004X60QYM#wasThisHelpful","R2N2PG8ZZ2XJDY","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like so many people here, I'm a fan of the original Filmation He-Man series, and was quite skeptical about ordering this 2002 version.  But the price was almost unbelievably low (still is as of this writing) for the entire series, so I figured I'd take a chance.  And I'm glad I did, because this He-Man is actually a very good series.  True, it lacks some of the lighthearted tone and cheerful optimism of the original, but the fact is, the animation is a LOT better.  Almost old the old characters are here, just with more modern makeovers.  I also like the fact that Prince Adam and He-Man really seem like two different characters, rather than the Clark Kent/Superman-style not-so-secret identity used in the original show.As a hardcore fan of these characters, I'll always prefer the original series.  It was, after all, the last fully American hand-drawn animated series produced by a major studio.  Most every action cartoon since has been influenced by highly-overrated Japanese ""anime"" (this is apparent in the fight scenes of this series, though no where near as prevalent as it is in the 1990 The New Adventures of He-Man, Vol. 1).  But if you'll give the 2002 series a try, you might find that it's really not SO different after all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXHK44ZQTSAU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DQL34G#wasThisHelpful","RXXHK44ZQTSAU","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a huge fan of Halloween, monsters and cartoons, I expected to absolutely love this rarely-seen 1972 Rankin/Bass special.  The t.v. special had fallen into relative obscurity over the years, even though it was a sequel of sorts to the earlier stop-motion cult classic Mad Monster Party.  Indeed, this DVD debut was the first time I'd ever seen it.  Unfortunately, ""Mad Mad Mad Monsters"" uses hand-drawn animation rather than RB's wonderful stop-motion magic, and that's only the start of the problems.The main thing (and again, I WANTED so much to love it) is that the special just isn't very engaging or funny.  The marginal plot has Baron Von Frankenstein (voiced by a fairly good Karloff imitator, since the legendary star had passed on by this time) creating a bride for his monster, then planning a wedding packed with some wonderfully ghoulish guests.  Getting all the classic monsters together worked fine in Mad Monster Party, but just falls flat here.  The original feature was helped along by some inspired, wacky musical numbers.  Sadly, these don't exist in the follow-up.  The humour, such as it is, falls a few steps below the ""Laugh-In""-style gags of Groovie Goolies: Saturday Mourning Collection (sample joke: Upon seeing his two creatures meet, Frankenstein declares, ""It's like you were MADE for each other. . .wait a minute, you WERE made for each other!"").Fairing slightly better is the bonus feature, an episode of Rankin/Bass's ""Festival of Family Classics"" entitled ""Jack O'Lantern"" (also from 1972).  The half-hour shows were retellings of popular folk heroes and children's stories.  Like the main feature, it features hand-drawn animation akin to ""Frosty the Snowman.""I've given the disc 3 stars because I feel it is imporant to have rare, almost-forgotten animated shows released, and because the prints used by Classic Media are really quite good.  There are no additional features, including addtional subtitles or language tracks.  If you have kids (even grown-up ones) who are monster fans, this might even find a place among their annual Halloween viewing.

This is my first build-your-own toy from Character Building (apparently, a British version of Lego toys), and I was amazed at the number of small pieces included.  The stickers, though very atractive and required to complete the TARDIS, were problematic as well.  Thankfully, a few extras were included for those who, like myself, are inclined to make mistakes.Anyway, it's a nice TARDIS replica, and the Doctor and Amy figures are just adorable. He even has a tiny little sonic screwdriver.  I look forward to collecting the other figures in the set, but haven't decided if I want any more playsets.  If you are a collector, or have a child who enjoys the show, I think this is a pretty good item overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPBMPV45XZDUS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W1T8YW#wasThisHelpful","RPBMPV45XZDUS","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some shows thrive not on the quality of their writing or production values, but on the strength of likable, dependable personalities in front of the camera.  Melissa & Joey is such a show.  Sure, WHO'S THE BOSS? already tackled the ""manny"" premise (although it was called ""housekeeper"" in the 80's), and mismatched couples have been the bread & butter of sitcoms since at least the 1960's.  But by casting two beloved t.v. stars (no coincidence, either, since Hart and Lawrence do double duty as executive producers), the show manages to rather easily hook viewers.Truth be told, I found the first 3 or so episodes to be very average.  But things start to pick up as the chemistry builds between the leads, and the relatively small supporting cast starts to find their own voices.  Melissa Joan Hart has been a gifted comic actress since her pre-teen Nickelodeon years, and it's to her credit than the somewhat edgy Mel Burke remains a thoroughly likable character.  Joey Lawrence, himself a 30+ year t.v. veteran, is solid as well, with a slightly more believable character with which to work.One word of caution: Don't be fooled by the ""ABC Family"" logo.  Melissa & Joey, while never really wallowing in gutter humor, can aim low with the best (or worst?) of them at times.  Still, for appropriate ages, it's as good as anything on network television at the moment.  Whether you consider that a compliment or not probably depends on how much t.v. you watch.  My wife and I watch quite a bit, and even though the show IS very familiar at times, it's still entertaining and fun to watch.  And really, does a sitcom need to do more than that?","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RTS12LEG0CEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R4ZMSQ#wasThisHelpful","R3RTS12LEG0CEO","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Now THIS is how you make a DVD of a fan-favorite show!  In addition to the rarely-seen special itself (more on that in a minute), you get a wealth of great extra material.  I, for one, enjoy learning all the behind-the-scenes info about shows, especially animated ones.  There's over an hour of documentary material here, focusing on the holiday special itself, and the universe of He-Man in general.  There's a pair of great-looking art cards (apparently there are 16 available in all; I got a terric watercolor painting of She-Ra, and one featuring characters from both series), the rarely-seen music video ""I Have the Power,"" plus a brief making-of segment on the video, a well-designed ""character profiles"" feature, trivia, and the complete script.  The packaging itself is full of colorful artwork, an added bonus for fans.As for the show itself, it holds up fairly well (SPOILERS AHEAD).  Unlike many cartoon holiday episodes, however, Christmas is really only a small part of the story.  Orko's bumbling accidentally brings two Earth children to Eternia, where they share the news of Christmas with the denizens of She-Ra's world (and since this IS a kids' fantasy show, the legend of Santa take precedence over the Christian holiday, which gets only a throwaway line about Bethlehem).  It's all innocent fun, although He-Man fans may cringe at how easily Skeletor is swayed by the Christmas spirit.If you're a fan of He-Man and/or She-Ra, there's no question you should have this in your collection.  And if you just like animated holiday fun, give it a try.  As a fan of both shows, I couldn't be happier with this first-class package.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JK98TBZ23YJX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BFO07I#wasThisHelpful","R3JK98TBZ23YJX","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a child of the seventies, I have great memories of this and many other Hanna-Barbera Saturday morning cartoons.  Viewing them now at age 43, I still enjoy them, although many years of exposure to so much animation has perhaps made me a bit more jaded.As you may know, HB were pioneers of the art of ""limited animation,"" which came about in the late 50's and early 60's.  A simple description of limited animation is that the characters don't move nearly as much as, say, those of the Looney Tunes of the Golden Age from the late 1930's thru the 1950's.  It's a time-saving and money-saving technique that worked well for animated shows made for the demanding schedules of weekly television.Anyway, there were still many colorful and funny cartoons made using this technique.  And thankfully, Speed Buggy is one of them.  Like many other HB cartoons of the seventies (Goober And The Ghost Chasers, Josie and the Pussycats - The Complete Series, etc.), Speed Buggy follows the comic adventures of a group of young people as they get involved in various mysteries or tangle with madcap villains.  It's all done with a sense of innocent fun, with the Mel Blanc-voiced lovable title character front and center.Like other recent cartoon releases from Warner Bros., Speed Buggy is ""made on demand"" using DVD-R discs.  This is my second such purchase (after Herculoids: The Complete Series), and I'm happy to report that the series looks and sounds great.  There are, however, no extra features of any kind.  No alternate-language tracks or subtitles, just a menu allowing you to select episodes or ""Play All.""  And as much as I still enjoy the cartoons, I just can't justify a perfect score for a bare-bones release.  Hopefully, WB is seeing that there is still a market for classic animation, and will start putting a little more effort into these releases.  However, if you have fond memories of Speed Buggy, or want to introduce your children or grandchildren to the show, this is definitely worth adding to your collection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NVYLB33RVZX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K5RN2O#wasThisHelpful","R1NVYLB33RVZX0","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As any boy who came of age in the late 60's or early 70's can tell you, The Herculoids was probably the greatest thing to ever hit Saturday morning television.  In an era when funny, talking animals shows were starting to give way to more adventurous fare like Johnny Quest and various superhero shows, the Alex Toth-designed Herculoids delivered the goods better than any other series.For the uninitiated, the show followed the adventures of humanoids Zandor, Tara and their son Dorno on the planet Quasar.  A unique assortment of creatures aided them: Zok, the flying dragon; a giant with rock-like skin named Igoo; the fireball-shooting triceratops-like Tundro; and the amusing blob-like Gloop and Gleep.  Trouble came (and came often) in the form of invaders for whom the planet Quasar must have seemed the ultimate prize.  Hideous monsters and robots of all sorts set their sights on the heroes' homeworld, and were met with deadly resistance.  You want morals at the end of your cartoon?  Forget it. . .the Herculoids were going to defend their turf, and justice was final on planet Quasar.This two-disc set collects all 18 original shows (technically, 36 episodes, since each half hour is comprised of 2 segments of 10 or so minutes each).  There is a very brief featurette about the series, in which various modern artists and writers gush about Alex Toth, and celebrate the boyhood fantasy charm of the show (one commentator points out that the Herculoids was pretty much non-stop stuff blowing up).  And that's the gist of the series, really: monsters, ray guns, lots of action.  As a fan from childhood, I was happy to see that in today's PC world of bland animated kids' shows, The Herculoids holds up very well.As is becoming more and more common, these Warner Archive discs are manufactured DVD-R's, meaning it is possible that customers may experience some playback difficulties in some machines.  I played both discs on my DVD recorder/player and my computer using WMP with no problems.  The prints used are of good quality, although the occasional debris does pop up.  As classic animation remains a niche market and sells no where near as well as modern shows, I'd imagine this is the best release we'll ever see of The Herculoids.  Certainly it's a no-brainer for fans.  And for parents who aren't overly considered about the cartoon violence, I think it's still a fine choice, especially for young boys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QGB33FE70PM8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00553KAK2#wasThisHelpful","R3QGB33FE70PM8","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That's a quote from Ronnie Dunn on a recent CMT interview.  And although I was a little perplexed by the comment prior to hearing this album (What? He didn't enjoy having 20 years of hits with Brooks & Dunn?), I get it now.  Because--and this may be hard to get across in a written review--that album just FEELS so natural and right for Dunn's voice.  I was also concered by the lead single, ""Bleed Red,"" which I was quick to dismiss as another in a line of well-made but somewhat boring ballads akin to B & D's mega-hit ""Believe.""  And while the song has grown on me, I'm still happy to report that it isn't really representative of the album.RONNIE DUNN contains quite a few up-tempo bar-ready rockin' country tunes.  And that's a good thing.  ""Let the Cowboy Rock"" and ""Singer in a Cowboy Band"" wouldn't have been out of place on a Brooks & Dunn album.  Yet, the difference is in the music.  Dunn's band is super-tight, wearing the familiar chords and rhythms like badges of honor.  And when he does slow things down, the band offers up classic country music, well-played. Songs like ""I Just Can't Help Myself"" and ""I Don't Dance"" could just be future classics.  There's even a sidetrip south of the border with ""How Far to Waco.""  Dunn even takes on the economy in the somber ""Cost of Livin'"", with its uneasy chorus speaking of ""Three bucks and change at the pump.""Give this solo debut a try, I think you'll enjoy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EY6YVZKA4NZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004T4YA8G#wasThisHelpful","R3EY6YVZKA4NZO","A2OZBJ58CML9OS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OZBJ58CML9OS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This action camera is very small and light weight. It comes with all the accessories you need to get started. It comes with waterproof housing, USB cable, suction cup mount, helmet mount, and a handlebar mount. It can also be mounted on a standard tripod or selfie stick. The back of the device features a resistive touchscreen. The screen is small but looks decent. These types of touchscreens aren't as responsive as modern capacitive ones but there really aren't many settings to change anyway. You can change the resolution of the videos or photos or you can view photos or play a slide show from the screen and that's about it. There is an HDMI out port on the side for slideshows. The top res for videos is 1080p and they record in the avi format. It says up to 12mp photos on the camera menu but the photo quality especially in low isn't that great to be honest. I thought videos looked pretty decent. The low light is just okay but it works great in daylight. It has a pretty wide angle lens so there is a bit of barrel distortion. There isn't a memory card included. It uses a Micro SD/Transflash. I put in a 32GB card and it says it can record nearly 3 hours of video on the FHD setting. I tested the waterproof housing by running water over it and then putting it in a glass full of water for a few minutes and it seemed to do it's job. You could easily use this as a dashcam also with the included suction mount.

"This comes in an absolutely huge 4 ounce bottle that will last me a long time. I'm not sure what the shelf life is. It also comes with a very nice glass dropper.

"These headphones arrive in one of those zip lock bags and I was a bit skeptical when I saw the package at first but I was very pleasantly surprised that there is a small hard zippered clamshell case inside.  Inside the case you will find the earbuds along with different sizes of both black and blue eartips. You also get the little caps that screw off to change the sound. I've compared them side by side and there is a definite difference in the bass so they aren't just a gimmick. I think the Pop version offered the most bass and those are the ones I'll likely stick with most of the time. I do recommend keeping them in the included bag and they are certain to get lost if you aren't vigilant. The headphones feature high quality a metal design and the cable is flat and tangle free which I really appreciate. There is an in line control but it doesn't have volume controls.

"I really like the keyboard so far. It features backlighting and you can choose from several different colors. The keys have a decent amount of feedback and I find that I can type quite quickly on it. This is the first time I've used a keyboard that isn't chiclet style in about 9 years or so and I'm finding that I'm liking have full sized keys again. The only downside to that is with this keyboard at least it is noisier to type on. Once you install the software you can assign macros to the G keys on the side. It's has a good amount of weight to it which makes it feel a little more expensive than it is. You may think from the photos that the red bars across the top and bottom are led lit but they are not so you will have to be content with red if you purchase this keyboard. You can choose from 3 levels of brightness or turn the backlights completely off. You can also set the lights to stay on all the time or set them to breath/fade on and off. There are volume and playback controls but you have to press the FN button to access them. Unfortunately, there is only one FN button on the right side and I really wish there were one on both sides of the keyboard. You can lock the Windows key so it doesn't function in order to prevent you from minimizing the window or something else while you are playing a game. Overall, the keyboard is pretty nice for the price. As mentioned above the only things I didn't really like were that the keys are kind of loud when typing and I didn't like that the red trim is permanent. I felt like the red clashes with the colors of the backlight if you change them to anything other than red.I think the mouse feels like it's a little higher quality device than the keyboard. It's made of higher grade plastics, has a rubberized matte black finish, has a nice cloth covered cable, and it's well weighted. You can choose from 3 different DPI settings and the led lit logo on the mouse will change according to what setting you are using. Green is 800 DPI, Red 1600, and Blue 2400. You can set up profiles in the software settings and assigning buttons how you want them. The scroll lights up and has a red grippy rubber ring around it. The mouse fits my hand almost perfectlyu and I find it very comfortable to use. There are extra skid pads included in the box which was a nice extra.Overall, for the price, both the keyboard and mouse are great items. You can definitely find something better quality but I doubt you would beat the price. Also, I would recommend the keyboard for anyone looking for a backlit keyboard.Disclaimer: I was sent a sample of this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

When stored it is around the size of a small toiletry bag. To open it you just unzip the pouch and pull the bag out. The pouch stays attached when using the backpack so no worries about losing it. It stores just as easily, you just roll it back up and stuff it inside the pouch. The bag is made of a parachute like nylon. It's lightweight but well made. There is a pouch on the inside for laptops but it isn't padded so a pouch or case is essential. The outside features to mesh pouches on the side for stuff like water bottles and there is a zippered mesh pouch on the front. Overall, this is a great bag if you are like me and don't need to use it often and like the ability to store it away without taking up a lot of space. This is small enough you could easily leave it in a car and it will probably fit in most consoles. The only thing I didn't like was due to keeping it stored in the pouch it will look a bit wrinkly most of the time.I was sent a discount for this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"This comes in a surprisingly huge 4 ounce bottle with a nice glass dropper. I've been using this in my oil diffuser. I put in about 8-10 drops and it is the most effective oil I've used in my diffuser so far. It only takes 5 or so minutes to be able to smell it throughout my living areas. I turn it off after 5-10 minutes and the scent lingers for hours. I haven't used it for anything else yet but as a air freshener it works great. I have pretty bad allergies and store bought air fresheners absolutely kill me and essential oils don't bother me much so I really like using this. I'm considering trying a few drops in my scent free laundry detergent to see how that works out. As large as this bottle is and as little as it takes to put in a diffuser I can see this lasting a long time. I highly recommend it if you like the smell of lavender.I received a discount for this in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"These space bags are of great quality. You get three different sizes. I like that there are different sizes so I can put smaller items in and not have to worry about filling a huge bag. All you do is fold up the items you want in and stick them inside the bags, zip them up, get out your vacuum and attach it to the bag and suck the air out.

"I haven't had this wallet for long but I'm super impressed with it already. It came is a nice gift box. It's a great quality wallet in general not even considering the added security of RFID protection. It is made of a high quality natural colored leather with a matte finish. It smells like real leather. It features a double stitching around the outside edges which looks great. The inside of the wallet features 10 card slots including the two with transparent windows, 2 hidden card slots, 1 cash slot, and one zippered cash slot. The inside of the wallet is lined with a metallic material that blocks RFID signals in order to protect your cards from theft. Please note this is the type of leather that will likely get that distressed scuffed look over time and while I love this type of finish I just wanted to let you know.Overall, I've found this to be an excellent quality leather wallet. It looks and feels great and is well made. I like the added benefit of RFID protection since all cards are getting chips the risk of theft will certainly grow.DISCLAIMER: I was sent a discount code for this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"These headphones work surprisingly well. They have built in bendable wires so you can wrap the around your ears and they stay firmly on place. I have always had difficulty finding earbuds that stay in my ears even when not active and I've found these to be the best fitting earbuds I've ever used.They sound great and have a great amount of volume. There is an in line control and mic. There aren't any volume buttons.Probably the only thing I didn't like 100% is the cable isn't tangle free.

"This is a pretty good MP3 player. It comes with a pair of decent quality white earbuds, a wrist strap, and a USB cable. It has a really lightweight build. It's rubberized matte black plastic with red trim. There is a loop on to for attaching the wrist strap, power slider on the slide, USB & headphone jack on the bottom, and a Micro SD slot on the left. The front has a nice sized screen and a 4 way control button with a function button in the center.To power it on you slide the power button on the side of the device. Once on, you can scroll through the various options by using the skip buttons. To make a selection you use the center button. To go back you press the vol button.It does feature Bluetooth for connecting it with your wireless speaker or headphones and it works pretty well. Please note unless I was doing something wrong you can only use the Bluetooth function with music and don't have access to the radio or video options while in use.In addition to music you can watch videos, listen to FM radio, record voice, and read text files. I consider text and video novelties only on a screen of this size and resolution.The sound quality is pretty good. It has a good amount of volume and sounds good in general.Overall, it's a nice MP3 PLAYER for the price. The Bluetooth function sets it apart from many other players. It's nice that it has a built in Micro SD slot to compliment the 4GB of built in storage. With the Bluetooth function considered I would recommend this for running or exercising since you can utilize those wireless headphones with it.DISCLAIMER I was sent a discount for this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"Prior to using this I hadn't ever used a lens kit for phones before. I was kind of skeptical about how well they would work. I'm actually hugely impressed with it. You get 3 lenses, a clip that will work on most phones, and a microfiber bag. I've found the quality of the lenses better than expected. The are made of aluminum and the lenses seem to be pretty good quality.MACRO LENSThe macro is by far my favorite and I would by this kit just for it. It helps take amazing super close up macros with lots of bokeh.  It's great for coins and jewelry. You do have to get your phone super close to the subject so good lighting is key when using it.WIDE ANGLEYou actually have to combine the wide angle and macro together for this. The quality is good and it really adds a lot more range to the shot. This is great for either taking group photos in a small space or getting more into your landscape shot.FISHEYEThis lens gives you a 180° view. I'm not a huge fan of fisheye lenses in general so I don't have a lot to say about it. It does work well but leaves a black ring around the edges of photos that will likely need cropped out. I actually just set my camera to 1:1 square photos when using it to eliminate later editing.CONCLUSIONOverall, this is a great set and a great value for the price. I highly recommend it if you want to get creative with your smartphone camera without spending a lot of money.Disclaimer: I was sent a discount for this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"I've been using this mouse for the past few days on my Chromebook. So far it has worked great and I really like it.FeaturesIt features a scroll wheel, back and forward buttons, and a DPI selector button. The scroll wheel is a clear plastic with black rubber in the center for added grip. The wheel also clicks and functions as a middle button if pressed down. The back and forward buttons are placed above the area where you thumb rests and easy to press with your thumb. There is also a button just under the scroll wheel that changes the DPI and also acts as a low battery indicator. With each press of the DPI selector it flashes a certain amount of times to indicate what DPI setting you are using. I can't say that I notice in huge difference between the DPI settings in Chrome OS but you may have different experience in Windows. The buttons and scroll wheel all have good feedback.DesignIt's a smaller more portable mouse. Even with it being smaller it feels quite ergonomic and contours to fit my larger hand quite nicely. Please note this probably won't work well for your if you are left handed.  The top of the mouse has a metallic looking gray finish. The sides are a grippy matte black plastic. The bottom is black plastic and features a connect button, on/off switch, and a battery compartment that holds a single AA battery(not included).ConclusionIt functions quite well and the cursor moves very smoothly.

"I just got this and set it up. It comes with very high quality and heavy duty metal hardware including tension hooks, wall mounts, and carabiners. I was very pleased that the material was heavier and thicker than I was anticipating so it does offer a lot of shade.You will need some rope/cord and screws on hand to set it up. I recommend trying to find a neutral color rope so it blends in and minimizes the appearance. I simply laid it out where I wanted it to get a good idea of how I wanted it mounted then screwed the mounts in place. You then attach rope to the wall mounts via the carabiner and then hook that to the tension hook and attach the tension bolt to the sail. Once you have them all in place you simply start tightening the tension hooks. If you have any wrinkles you try to tighten the bolts in the opposite direction of the wrinkles to stretch them out. It's fairly easy to take back down if you need to. Just release the tension, unhook the carabiners, and fold it up.I wouldn't really call it a negative but I kind of wish that the hardware was painted to match the shade material. It looks somewhat industrial to me and would definitely benefit from a paint job to minimize the appearance.Overall, this is a very nice item. It is super easy to install, is well made, and includes quality hardware that will last a long time. It is a great, affordable, and modern looking option to use over a patio, porch, or deck in place of awning.

"Unboxing this headset was fairly simple. It comes in a clear plastic box and you just have to peel the seal away to open them. Inside you will find the stereo headset, 3 sizes of ear gels, and a USB cable.The headset features a mic, 3 control buttons, and a flat tangle free cable.  The flat style cables are my absolute favorite feature of the headset. The USB charging cable is also flat and tangle free to match the headset.The buttons control volume up and down, skip and forward, play and pause for music. Alternatively, you can also use them for calls. I found the instructions just a bit confusing but I was finally able to figure out that holding the volume down key for 2 seconds that it activates the voice controls on my phone.  If you hold the power/play button for a few seconds it will re fine I also your last call. Once you know what to press and hold they work great. I would like to mention it is somewhat difficult to find the buttons by touch. I found myself wishing the controls had more separation or difference to discern what you are pressing by touch.The ears buds were very easy to setup. If you have an Android phone the chances are you have NFC and if you currently had it enabled on your phone you can simply tap the headsets control to the NFC on your phone to quickly pair them. You do have to get them just right over the NFC chip in your phone to get it to work. Otherwise, the normal Bluetooth pairing process is fairly quick too.The audio quality is pretty good. I don't notice any major background noise. They produce a good amount of bass. The volume is probably my main complaint. Maxing out the volume on both my phone and the headset are just at the edge of what I want to adjust my volume to. Other than not being super loud earphones the audio quality is pretty good.The battery life had been pretty good so far.Ovsrall, this is a great affordable choice.  They work great.

"I was sent a sample of this item for free in exchange for a an honest and unbiased review. When I opened the package I was impressed by how large the bottle is. I don't anticipate needing any more for a long time. I just want to say in advance if you are expecting something that smells like coconuts this isn't for your as it doesn't really have much of an odor or scent at all. I wasn't sure what I would use it for at first but I've been using it as a pre-shave oil for shaving with my double edge safety razor and also as a facial moisturizer afterwards. I simply rub this into my beard then apply my regular shaving soap and it makes for a super smooth shave with virtually no burn or dryness afterwards. I am allergic to the perfumes found in most lotions and after shave balms so I have been really happy to use this as it's virtually scent free. I have not had any kind of reaction or breakout. It doesn't leave my skin looking oily or greasy it just gives a healthy fresh look and absorbs pretty quickly. Probably my only con for it is the included pump. I've noticed if I grab the bottle and squeeze it even a tiny bit it will squirt out without even touching the pump. It's a minor but messy annoyance but I wish it had a better pump with it. Definitely consider putting the cap back on if you are traveling.Overall, it's a great item with a wide variety of uses. The price is pretty fair considering how large the bottle is and a little bit of it goes a long way.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XAPPE7QRX9J0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XDPUIP6#wasThisHelpful","R2XAPPE7QRX9J0","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unboxing these over the ear bluetooth was extremely simple. You simply slide the box open to reveal the headphones already packed inside the included zippered clamshell case. You also get USB charging cable and a short 3.5mm audio cable.CaseThe zippered clamshell case is a nice matte black and the inside is lined with a slim layer of neoprene or something similar. There is a loop on the top for a carabiner but there isn’t one included in the box. If you want to attach it to your bag or something else you will need to use your own. Overall, it looks great and is well made.Comfort and DesignThe headphones are an ultra glossy black with matte red accents. They just fit over the ear for me with no room to spare. They are very comfortable and I can wear the for extended periods without any discomfort. The top headpiece features a thick layer of foam padding for great comfort. The earpieces are equally comfortable. You can adjust the height of the earpieces but just sliding them out. They swivel slightly left and right and up and down. When you are finished using them you simply slide the earpieces back into their original position and fold them down for storage in the case.Wireless & Wireless ControlsThese feature Bluetooth 4.0 and have an advertise range of about 30 feet which I find fairly accurate. There are control buttons on the right earpiece. You have call/play/power, volume up/down, and skip back/forward buttons. You press the power button for about 2 seconds to power them on. To pair you hold the power button for about 2.5 seconds after powering them on to activate the pairing mode. You will be alerted by both a voice prompt and the indicator lights flashing blue and red. To turn them back off you have to hold the power button for over 5 seconds until you get the voice prompt that they are powering down.In music mode pressing the Play/Pause once to pause or play and the skip/previous, and volume buttons work as expected.When not playing music I was able to activate Google Now for voice commands by pressing the play button for a couple of seconds.You can use them on two different phones at the same time. One for music and the other for calls.I have had Bluetooth headphones that work both ways but the volume controls on the headphones are separate from the volume controls on the phone or other device you are using.The Bluetooth battery life is advertised as 15 hours of calls or 13 hours of continuous music. I’ve found the battery life to be great so far.  I’ve charged them once since I got them last week and I’ve used them extensively and they are still going strong. There isn’t any way that I have found to just check the battery level. The light does flash every 5 seconds and they make a sound when the battery is quite low. It takes about 4 hours to charge them. They charge via a micro USB cable included in the box but you will need to provide your own USB port or wall adapter as there isn’t one included. They do power off automatically after a few moments if you disconnect your phone.The wireless range is pretty good. if you are in an area with no walls I have little doubt you could probably get the 30 ft range. I’ve noticed slight skipping when getting probably 15-20 feet away if there are a couple of walls in between.Audio QualityI’ve found the audio quality to be pretty good. They have a decent amount of bass but definitely not over the top. I sometimes wish the bass was just a little more punchy. I haven’t noticed any significant amount of background noise or anything of that nature. I’ve tried them on my desktop computer, Note 5, and iPhone 6 Plus and found the max volume to be pretty low on all of them. I like listening to my music pretty loud leave all the volume controls at max to get close to what I want.WiredThere is a line in port on the headphones for wired use with devices that don’t have Bluetooth. There is no discernible difference in either sound quality or volume. The included cable is just a standard 3.5mm stereo cable and doesn’t have a mic or any controls so if you will need your own cable with controls if you want to use them as a wired headset.Pros:Great build quality & DesignPretty good audio qualityComfortable over the ear headphones if you don’t have huge ears(they just fit me)PriceUse on two different devices at once(one phone & one media)Very nice hard carrying case includedConsNo in line controls or mic when using the somewhat short included cable(you can provide your own)Low max volumeThe ear pads might be a bit on the small side if you have large earsOverall, I’ve found these to be surprisingly very good quality and well made headphones. I liked them enough that even with the few minor complaints I listed above I didn't dock and stars. I would rate them a solid 4.5 if I could. I've found myself listening to them versus my name brand wired headphones because of the extremely convenient wireless functionality. They look more expensive than they are and are obviously very reminiscent of a popular name brand pair of headphones(which I also own) and compare surprisingly well in both design & sound quality for a significantly smaller price.Disclaimer: I was sent a discount code for this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"It is a rugged looking and feeling case. It features a two layer/piece design.  There is a kickstand on the back of the case. It includes a plastic screen protector, microfiber cloth, and a stylus.You can use only the silicone inner piece if you want to. The plastic piece with the kickstand is easily removeable and the case looks fine without it. I find myself using it with just the silicone piece around the house and add the plastic piece when I'm out.It offers a lot of drop protection and the treaded design lends a really good grip to the case. I've found it feels slightly rough and edgy in the hand. The black piece has a matte and rubbery finish which also adds more grip.The case is well made and all the ports and cutouts are lined up well.If you are looking for a more rugged case this would be a great choice.I was sent one of these at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFZP76QVGNX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYVM7HK#wasThisHelpful","RPFZP76QVGNX0","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given a discount for one of these in exchange for feedback and an honest and unbiased review. I haven't ever used a diffuser before but was excited to try one out.I love to have my house smell good but have bad allergies and things like candles, air freshener and even scented wax plug-ins really bother me. I haven't really had any issue with this and my allergies so far. Maybe it's because there isn't any smoke or wax but this and the spicy essential oil I purchased separately hasn't bothered me so far.The InstaNatural diffuser was extremely easy to set up. You simple unbox it and then fill it to the fill line with water and then place 5 or 6 drops of your favorite essentially oil in the water. You then put the shade on and turn it on. I was surprised at how it started misting and putting out a pleasant scent instantly. The mist feels very cool and dry when you put your hand over it. If you fill it to the line it will last 7 or 8 hours or so.The shade is lit by pleasant blue led lights. It lights enough to cast a slight glow to the mist as well. Unlike what other reviewers say you CAN turn the light off and keep the mist going. The power button works three ways. Once for LED lights and mist, twice for mist only, and three times for completely off. I do wish you could change the color of the lights or even have breathing/pulsing lights which would add to the calming effect.It doesn't take long at all for the scent to permeate a room. It isn't strong enough to fill a whole house but definitely works for a living area, kitchen, bathroom or bedroom.Overall, I was surprised at how well I have liked this. I thought it should have a few more options for the price but it does seem well made so I'm not sure. I would definitely say it needs changeable led colors for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNENWQDJOQGAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOBEQWY#wasThisHelpful","RNENWQDJOQGAN","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got a diffuser for the first time and this is the first oil I purchased to put in it. It smells great. I find it smells like either a chai tea or especially like the recipe of spicy gingersnap cookies I make around the holidays. I can detect hints of all of the oils in it but I find the clove scent slightly overpowers most of the others. I do love the scent of cloves but I would like it to be toned down a bit so you can really smell the citrus, cinnamon, and eucalyptus a bit more.  I put about six drops in my diffuser and don't find it too strong. It comes in a very small amber colored bottle but I anticipate it lasting fairly long. Overall, a great scent if you prefer spicy scents.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRNS4C1KY0A2X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010ALBEAS#wasThisHelpful","RRNS4C1KY0A2X","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was lucky enough to be offered a sample of these refillable K-Cups to test out and give a honest and unbiased feedback and review. So far I love them. I've had similar ones for my old Keurig 1.0 but hadn't got around to getting one for my 2.0 so I was quite happy to get them. They literally pay for themselves and you save on all the wasted plastic form normal K-Cups. They aren't quite as quick and easy to use as regular K-Cups since you do have to refill them but the cost savings definitely mitigates that. It does help that there are two included in the package so you can basically have an extra one ready to go. I also like that I'm able to use whatever coffee I want to in them even if it isn't available as a K-Cup. You simply fill them about 75% full and pop them in your machine. They appear to be well made. I've had different versions for my old Keurig 1.0 and these look better made and look like they should hold up longer. So far they have worked great and the coffee taste great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BL24I0C2M2WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0136ZB1KI#wasThisHelpful","R2BL24I0C2M2WJ","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I was sent a sample of these to test, give honest and unbiased feedback and a review. I've actually been very impressed with them. You get several pages of large black labels and a white dry erase marker. I didn't realize when I ordered them that they were dry erase so I was very pleased with that. I have put them on my large glass gallon canisters that reside on my kitchen counter tops. They look very good, add a bit of charm and are very easily readable even across the room. If I decide I want to change the contents of the canisters I can simply wipe away the old text. I've also added a few to our everyday cups so we can scribble our names on them and avoid mix ups. I plan to put one on my front door which could be used to discretely say welcome or leave messages to the delivery guy like please ring the doorbell when you deliver my Prime packages (instead pounding down my door).Overall, I've been very impressed with them. They are nice heavy vinyl and seem to have a strong adhesive. The white dry erase marker included works great.

"I'm using this wireless charger with my Note 5. It looks really nice in person. It's a bit wider than a hockey puck and fairly thin. It came with a black USB cable but no charger. The edges are a clear polycarbonate which pulses and glows blue when your phone is charging. There is a raised silicone or rubber lip around the white charger area which prevents your phone from slipping around and prevent wear or scratches.With my Note 5 it takes between 3-4 hours to fully charge with this charger. Since it takes that long to charge I keep it on my night stand and place my phone on it before I got to bed. It does work with my Flip Wallet cover installed on the phone so it will likely work with most cases.Overall, I really like it. It looks great and appears to be well constructed. It doesn't have fast charging though so it's best used as an overnight charger or somewhere where you won't be using your phone for extended periods.Disclaimer: I was sent a discount for this device to test it and offer an unbiased and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LHFRUI4CE80P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0132KZCWU#wasThisHelpful","R1LHFRUI4CE80P","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just got this Flip Wallet Cover for my Black Sapphire Note 5. So far I really like it.Unlike previous generations where you could just pop off the battery cover this one attaches via 4 polycarbonate corners. It is extremely quick and easy to put on. The top, right side, and bottom are all exposed. You have full access to all the buttons, ports, and the SIM tray even with the case on. The left side is obviously covered. There are plus and minus marks where the volume keys reside on the phone. The backside is raised enough to protect the protruding camera which is something I was really looking for. I now feel safe place the phone and a table without worrying about wearing down or scratching the camera lens. The outside of the cover is dark blue/gray with a very slight metallic sheen. It coordinates perfectly with the Black Sapphire color of the phone. The right and left side are slightly curved so it still retains some of the good in hand feel of the Note. The right side is curved enough that the edges don't seem to dig into your hand. It is fake leather and while it is nice it doesn't have quite the same feel as leather would. The flap folds back and closes quite easily and I haven't had any issue where it doesn't quite close yet. It doesn't have any kind of magnet or anything to keep it closed if you put it in a bag or purse so that is something to be mindful of.The inside of the cover is lined with a soft microfiber material. It holds 1 card in the card holder. You may be able to squeeze two in but it will definitely stretch the pouch out and probably make the flap protrude from your screen. It's great to carry your ID or a single credit card in. When you open the cover it does activate the screen. If you don't have your lock screen set up with a passcode or to unlock via fingerprint you should be able to set it to unlock your phone also.The only thing I don't like about this case is since it doesn't have an S-View window it would be great if the indicator light wasn't covered. I find the light very convenient and having a case and especially an OEM one cover it is just annoying.Overall, I'm really pleased with this case. It feels great in and an offers decent protection for the entire phone. The quality is absolutely what you would expect from an OEM case. It just fits perfectly and looks amazing. The wallet part of the case has extremely limited utility. You can really only fit one card in it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPHMW3W8ZJADJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AWADFC#wasThisHelpful","RPHMW3W8ZJADJ","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sent one of these cables to try out, give feedback, and write an honest and unbiased review. I'm so glad I got it because the 10' length of this cable makes it incredibly convenient. It's great to use in a living room or office where the stock cable will barely reach from the wall outlet to a desk or table right next to it. It looks nearly identical to the stock cable and both of the connectors are the exact same dimensions so there are no worries about fitting in certain cases. I love that it's long enough that you can use your iPhone or iPad while charging it without feeling like you are going to rip the cable out of the wall.

"I was sent a sample of this item to test and give an honest and unbiased review of. What I've found is that it is a great, lightweight, and compact sized MP3 player with a screen. It works and sounds great. It produces a lot of volume and has good sound quality. It also features an FM Player, Voice Recorder, video player, and ebook reader. The latter two features are more of a novelty due to the size of the screen and the resolution just isn't good for video or text reading. The version I got have 16gb of internal storage and also has a micro SD card slot to expand on that. The interface is straight forward and easy to use.The back of the player is aluminum and the front is covered in a shiny black plastic. The navigation buttons on the front are a matte black plastic.I recommend this mostly as a device secondary to your smartphone or possibly as an affordable option for use by a child.

"I was sent one of these protectors to test and provide an unbiased and honest review. That said, please let me start by saying that I haven't really found a glass screen protector for either of the devices I use everyday that I'm 100% happy with. I have both an iPhone 6 Plus which is what this screen protector review is in regards to and a Note 5. Unfortunately, when it comes to screen protectors neither device is easy to find a quality one for. Both devices have a subtle curve on the edges of the screen which wreaks havoc with glass screen protectors.I installed this one on my iPhone 6 Plus quite easily. It took only a few minutes and I didn't have any issue with bubbles or alignment. There is a pair of cleaning wipes included in the box(a wet and a dry one) but I really recommend you also have a nice clean microfiber cloth on hand. I've found the best place to install protectors is in a humid bathroom especially after a shower as it really cuts down on lint and dust. Another great tip is to use an old cheap plastic screen protector to pull away any lint or dust that your cleaning cloth might leave behind. Glass screen protectors go on so quickly and it's not hard to get any bubbles out or align it. This one turned out really great and thankfully I have yet to notice any dust or lint under it. The edges have a really tiny sliver of a halo effect. This is where the edges don't adhere quite perfectly due to the curved glass edges of the iPhone screen and have a slight halo around the edges. This one is the most minimal out of 3 different glass protectors I've had on my iPhone but I'm actually really happy with it. I plan to keep this one on so that's a testament to it's quality. I haven't had any issues with it lifting off or anything of that nature.It doesn't feel any different on my fingers than the bare screen does and looks and works great with my OEM leather case. Overall, I highly recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17Z8C5YEFFZ8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014CELN5A#wasThisHelpful","R17Z8C5YEFFZ8V","A2IN1QX4S6SW3W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IN1QX4S6SW3W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you're looking for a planner that has an area for information to input on each day, or something that will allow you to write down appointments, etc., at a certain time, on a certain day, than this planner is probably not for you.

My daughter loves them. Her mom thinks they're cute too. These socks are very colorful, and bright. They go up past my daughter's knees. They do help to keep my baby girl's legs warm because they're so long, therefore covering so much of her legs. However, they're not thick socks. They're not paper thin either, but definitely not on the heavy side, when speaking in terms of thickness. The bottoms of the feet have 'grips' which help to keep her from sliding around on tile, lenolium, and hardwood floors.

"Steven Speilberg had a hand in writing and producing this unforgettable classic. 'The Goonies', although produced years ago, is still as funny and unforgettable today, as it was when I first saw it as a child. My two children can vouche for this. Fondly remembering this movie, I decided to throw it in my son's Christmas stocking hoping that he and his sister would take the time to watch the movie. I was interested to see what their reaction to the movie would be. They love it. And really, who wouldn't? A group of misfit, but good-hearted, kids on an adventure to find the treasure that was hidden by pirates long ago. A treasure map, booby traps, hilarious scenes that'll have even adults laughing, and so much more, this movie is a must for movie lovers of all ages.

"These are smaller Legos. Not like some of the real small Legos I've seen and assembled, yet smaller than what I'd think of as the averaged-sized Lego. At first I was disapointed as I bought these for my daughter, and was looking forward to playing with ""normal"" Legos. I was also disapointed with the container. It's much bigger than it needs to be. The Legos that come in this ""Brick Box"" only take up 1/3 of the space in this box. After saying all that, however, I've come to realize there are all shapes and sizes of Legos. These smaller Legos are a lot of fun to play with as well.

"These are smaller Legos. Not like some of the real small Legos I've seen and assembled, yet smaller than what I'd think of as the averaged-sized Lego. At first I was disapointed as I bought these for my son, and was looking forward to playing with ""normal"" Legos. I was also disapointed with the container. It's much bigger than it needs to be. The Legos that come in this ""Brick Box"" only take up 1/3 of the space in this box. After saying all that, however, I've come to realize there are all shapes and sizes of Legos. These smaller Legos are a lot of fun to play with as well. Perhaps even funnier to play with in some cases.

"Divorce can and is for many people (including myself) a horrible experience to go through. This book was recommended to me by a superior at work who himself went through a divorce. Because I have respect for this individual, I took his advice and bought the book. As soon as the book arrived I began reading, and I can tell you this book was a huge help in turning my life in the right direction. So much of what I was feeling, and experiencing, made no sense to me until I read this book. All of the sudden what I was going through started to make sense. I realized much of what I was going through was normal, and I wasn't alone. It's also aided me in making better decisions post-divorce. I can't imagine how much further behind the curve (per say) I'd be without this book. It was quite possibly my life saver.

"This is a great idea and has a tremendous amount of potential. Unfortunately, it simply did not work well for us and we had to return it. This system comes preloaded with several different programs that make it easier for you to enjoy streaming movies, TV and music at little or no cost. Of course, some of the programs, such as Hulu, still require a subscription. There are also expanded capabilities to add additional programs for your viewing needs.Unfortunately, despite updating the programs/ system even with multiple attempts to upload various media, we consistently received screens that would go into ""working"" for extended periods of time or ""failure"" to upload anything at all. I managed to get ONE music video to play on one evening, it was the only thing we actually ever watched through the HaigerX system. Every other attempt to download various media to watch was unsuccessful. We honestly spent a LOT of time trying to get this system to work for us, to do SOMETHING, anything and it simply would not.I am sure our biggest challenge was that the speed test (which took multiple attempts to even run) showed a very slow connection, despite having the highest internet speed available from our cable company. The problem was, too, though is that the other devices on the line were consistently pulling in between 40-50 Mbps at the same time that this system barely pulled down 2 Mbps. We have to assume the issue was within the TV box and not the actual internet connection. We tried several different things to improve the speed/ connection to no avail. It was all most frustrating, as we really were hoping this system would let us remove everything BUT internet from our cable bill. This was not the magic box for us, unfortunately.It's also worth mentioning that the remote was absolutely MADDENING as it seemed to be hit and miss as to how and when it responded. Sometimes it was very responsive, other times it was sluggish or unresponsive, then suddenly do everything at once. I've heard other buyers bought a wireless mouse to use with this system, as that danged remote was NOT an efficient way to control this system. There were screens where I never could figure how to navigate because the remote didn't do what it should have.I received this system at a discount in consideration of a fair and honest review. I really wished I could get this to work for us, but it was apparently not meant to be. Keep in mind, too, that the instructions provided are minimal at best.

At least the size chart provided actually spells out that an XL is only a US size 8/10... though I think it's sad when an 8/10 is an xl, cause that means for ladies like me (US 16/ XL) could never possibly hope to fit into any of these dresses.The dress itself is a cute, casual dress. I would not really call it a ""special occasion"" dress, unless church is a special occasion for you. It's definitely more casual. The fabric is a poly blend, which should be easy enough to care for, though I haven't had to wash it yet. The material of this one is thick and substantial, so it's not a light, airy sundress.

I am so sad, as I ordered this for myself, but am having to hand it over to one of my teenage daughters.If you look at their sizing chart listed, it's Amazon's standard women's sizing chart, which is NOT appropriate for this line. I assumed, since 85% said the sizing was accurate, that it would work for me. I am a US XL (16), so I ordered the XL in this as well. Nope, not even close. My teenage daughter is US M (10) and it fits her well enough that there is no way it's a true XL. My bust simply cannot fit into this dress. While I am admitted blessed in that department, I was truly hoping there would be enough give for this dress to work for me, but it was not to be.There is another size chart further down the listing, which shows that their version of XL is much more in line with a US large. May I humbly suggest that the ""size chart"" drop down menu actually contain Anni Coco's size chart so that it is more accurate? In certain formats (mobile), the product descriptions are much harder to find and read. I can only home with some more weight loss, I can borrow this back from her for awhile. I received a discount on this dress in consideration of a fair and honest review, which I've provided here.

"Kashi's Organic Promise Cinnamon Harvest Cereal is my 7 year old son's absolute favorite cereal and snack. It's not unusual to find him eating them right out of the box, dry. He loves the flavor and I love that they are USDA Certified Organic, Non-GMO Project Certified and contain less sugar than many of the other things he could be eating. He thinks he's getting a treat, but I know he's eating healthy.I love Amazon's Prime Pantry, as I can have quality organic products delivered straight to my door at a fraction that I can buy them from my semi-local grocer. I have to drive 30 minutes just to find this in a store and they run roughly $2 higher/ box as of this review. I am saving time and money!

However, I should have realized that these crisps are rather thin and they didn't do so well in shipping. Lot of crushed chips, not the best idea.

Thankfully, Amazon's Prime Pantry offers them up and I can have them sent directly to my door at a cost better than I buy other Stacy's products locally.

"Belly Blaster PM is touted as a night time weight loss pill that helps you lose extra pounds while you sleep. It contains the well known ""natural"" sleep aids L-tryptophan and melatonin, though it does not specify the amounts of each. This alone is highly frustrating, as it's not as if these are some super secret formulas and frankly people deserve to know what they are taking, especially when it comes to a hormone such as melatonin.The weight loss part is supposed to come from the blend of Raspberry Ketones, White Kidney Bean Extract, Green Coffee Bean Extract and Saffron Extract. The thing is, I've tried all of these products alone and in various combinations in the past without any real results. I suppose I was hoping that the combination of all 4 together would be more effective, but for me it has not. Not only have I not lost any weight on this supplement, but I've been waking up starving, too. I am the type of person who rarely eats breakfast and can go half the day without eating, as I am just not hungry, but this supplement made me absolutely ravenous in the mornings. I've had to eat by 9 am, which has actually thrown a monkey wrench in my weight loss goals. I also have experienced off and on palpitations, where my heart just starts to run faster than it should and seems to flip around a bit. The only thing new or different is this supplement. Perhaps it's all a little too much for me.The only thing I can say for sure is that it did indeed help me sleep, but that is the nicest thing I can say about it.

"Quinoa is a wonderful, versatile grain that can be used in the place of rice or pasta in many recipes. I have a rice cooker that I have used to cook my quinoa and it works wonderfully for this purpose. This quinoa is USDA Certified Organic, which is important to me when feeding my family. I love that it is a big, 4 lb bag, too. I've spent more on a smaller quantity of organic quinoa at my semi-local grocer.The flavor of quinoa is very, very light. That in itself is actually a good thing, as it leaves lots of room for creativity when preparing it and cooking with it. I like to make mine with vegetable or chicken broth to perk up the flavor. The fact this one is pre-rinsed and ready to use is a huge bonus to me, too. My only real issue with this particular brand, it is made in a facility that processes tree nuts and I have a tree nut allergic child. Bummer!! He tends not to eat the quinoa I make anyway, but I've often prepared it in soups and casseroles, which I obviously cannot do with this one, lest we have to take a ride in the ambulance.I received this quinoa at a discount in consideration for a fair and honest review, which I have provided here.

I have a sister who has multiple food allergies, as well as a heart condition the makes it necessary for her to severely limit her sodium intake. One of our challenges in the past has been trying to make sure her food isn't coming into contact with those we prepared for ourselves. All the while making sure that the grill has been cleaned well before grilling her steak, as she is very allergic to fish, which we grill regularly. These mats take care of all of those issues!Having never even heard of grilling mats before this product, I was pleasantly surprised to find they work as intended. They clean up easily, too.

"aVo Tea Tree Oil + Oregano Oil is the real deal. It is a super strong formulation that I have used on plantar warts, skin tags, and various small skin abrasions/ injuries including staph. I do not recommend you use this neat (undiluted) except with extreme caution as it is very strong and will burn. I'm using it on an underarm skin tag and have to be very careful not to get it anywhere but directly on the skin tag, as it is a strong oil.As I've had multiple issues with impostor essential oils purchased here on Amazon recently, I took a chance on this one with a healthy dose of skepticism. I have been very pleased that it has performed in the manner in which I would expect it to, including helping to get rid of a very staph-y area on my teenager (what do they get into?!) and has already shrunk/ hollowed out another daughter's plantar warts. Like I said, it is VERY strong, so either dilute it with a carrier oil... plain old olive oil will work if you have nothing else... or apply it cautiously directly to the area being treated. A little goes a long way! As for the smell, it smells exactly as I would expect it to. It smells like a cross between oregano and the woodsy wonder of tea tree. It's a great product and will now be a staple in my medicinal essential oil (EO) stash.I received this oil at a discount in consideration of a fair and honest review, which I believe I have provided. I am a frequent and long standing Amazon shopper and a regular EO user who would never recommend an oil we don't happily use here.

"This TNP iPad case was actually purchased to replace an identical style foam case that was pink and had seen better days. Unfortunately, upon removal from the pink case, the cracked iPad screen got much worse and it's being taken out of service until I can get it in to the shop and get the screen replaced.This shockproof case is all that it should be and does a great job of protecting the iPad. It was actually in a different type of case when my then 3 year old managed to crack the screen. Being in the (older pink) foam case has actually bought us a lot of time on it that I don't think we would have had without it. Once I get the screen replaced, I'll place it in our new green one, as I know how protective it is. Please note, for the iPad 2 (A1395), the black plastic frame does not fit on the back of the iPad. Without it, though, it slides right in and still has good protection.I received this case at a discount in consideration of a fair and honest review.

"Naturo Sciences Krill Oil is a great source of EPA, DHA and Astaxanthin which are all known to have healthy benefits, especially for lowering cholesterol and protecting heart health. If you don't know about Omega-3s by now, then you clearly haven't been paying attention. This is only my second time taking my Omegas in krill oil form as opposed to fish oils. Fish oils, unfortunately, have a lot of issues with being rancid by the time they reach the consumer, not only making them unpleasant, but also contributing to less efficacy and side effects, like those dreaded ""fish burps"". Some fish oils are also known to be contaminated by heavy metals due to the food chain in the seas.Krill are not fish, they are shellfish, very similar to shrimp. They are less likely to be contaminated with toxic metals because they are at the bottom of the food chain. This is probably the biggest reason one would choose krill oil as an Omega source over fish oils. It is the reason I, myself, was curious about this form. Also, the Omegas in krill oil are in phospholipid form, making it more readibly available for proper absorption and use in the body.The capsules are smaller than those of my fish oils and they are easy to swallow. As promised, no fish burps when taking this product. It does, however, still have a strong almost fish-like smell to them. Keep that in mind if you are sensitive to such things. I am not noticing any big changes when taking this product, which is a good thing for me since I am already stabilized on Omegas and my body isn't as if they suddenly went off of something it needed. I simply substituted the krill oil where I would normally take my fish oils.

"I am a journalist, and I do a fair amount of travel where I take a lot of photographs and video. I rarely take a tripod because they tend to be extremely bulky. That's one of the things I really love about the Samtree Sampole. This little monopod collapses down to 15"" and expands to 50"" (4 feet 2 inches). The SmaPole comes with attachments for both a Go Pro camera as well as for Cel Phones. The legs on the mono-pod detach and double as a mini tripod as well. The SmaPole also comes with a holder for a GoPro remote.What's great about this SmaPole is that it's light, easy to maneuver and yet solid and stable enough to place and leave. The legs aren't strong enough for a big DSLR but it held my point and shoot and phone perfectly.I'm impressed by how much is packed in to this little monopod.

"I've got a fairly solid library of games, but I was looking for another 2 player, light, easy and fun game which I could use as a warm up or to fill the gaps between two heavier games. Longhorn fits that space PERFECTLY. It's a very simple game that is easily taught (the rules are 3 pages long). The game is basically a light strategy game which involves taking cows from 9 tiles. The number of cows you take then dictates how many spaces you move your opponent. There are a few conditions that end the game, most of which tend to happen within 15 minutes.Since getting this game earlier in the week, we've already played it several time. I played it with my 14 year old and my 8 year old, both really enjoyed it. This game IS a light game, but that's it's charm.

"As you'd expect from Bose, these in-ear headphones sound extremely crisp and clear, especially in the mid and high range. Bose has mastered clarity in this spectrum and it's no surprise that they've again delivered with these in-ear headphones. The bass response is very good, but if you are looking for heavy, booming base, it's just not Bose's forte.The headphones come with the half moon ear pieces in three sizes. this seems to be the prevailing style for sport headphones as it helps keep them in the ear. The fit is very good and they don't need to be crammed in the ears to be able to produce good sound, this is fantastic as many in ear headphones sound horrid if they aren't perfectly placed.Sound bleed is there, but not horribly so. They aren't noise isolating or noise canceling headphones, but they do a great job of delivering really exceptional sound.  The cord is feels short, but it's the same length as the stock iPhone headphones (although the v part is less length). I'm surprised that Bose didn't go with the no tangle ribbon style of cabling, it's not enough the doc them stars, but it seems like the benefit of the ribbon style outweigh the detriments.Controls are solid and they work perfectly with Apple devices. I tried them on my Nexus 5 and the skip/start/stop button worked fine but the volume switches did not work (which is the same Bose Quiet Comfort 15). Again no star deduction as it's clearly stated that these are designed for apple.The headphones come with a nice small fabric carrying case with a carabiner, it's a nice little touch. They are water and sweat resistant which is great as they seem custom designed for running/working out. The cable also has a small clothing clip, it's a small thing, but it helps keep the cord from flailing when you run.Ultimately, it all comes down to the sound and Bose has delivered here with a sound quality that rivals many of the other ear buds in its class.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Z6DE9OFWM2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFOEG#wasThisHelpful","R21Z6DE9OFWM2R","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When building a PC it's easy to skimp out on the keyboard, spending over $100 can seem extravagant when it is 10%+ of the total cost of your computer, but you'll spend more time using your keyboard than almost any other component on your computer. When my son recently built his pc he decided to save and go with the Razer DeathStalker Essential Gaming Keyboard which is about 1/2 the price of this Corsair. He immediately regretted it. While the Razer is a serviceable keyboard it's non-mechanical, and for gaming that makes a huge difference.This Corsair STRAFE is one of the more affordable of the Corsair mechanical keyboards, but there's nothing cheap about it.  The Cherry MX keys live up to the hype, they are a MUST HAVE for anyone who uses their PC to game. The Corsair STRAFE Keyboard uses 2 USB slots, but one of those 2 is a passthrough so you can plug directly into the keyboard. The keyboard has textured key gaming keys which you can swap it. It's very easy to do and it makes a big difference.When it comes to mechanical key keyboards, there's really no one doing it better than Corsair and at this price point, it's a no brainer to go mechanical.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159J79AYKINV1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZUPOMDQ#wasThisHelpful","R159J79AYKINV1","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First and foremost, these are specifically designed to be used as DJ headphones, if you are looking for a good all around headphone, this may not be the headphones for you. But if you are looking for a good pair of DJ headphones these Phillips A5-Pro's which were designed in collaboration with Armin Van Buuren do a pretty fantastic job.The first thing I noticed about these headphones is that they have some real heft to them. They are as hearty and heavy duty as headphones get. There are also a lot of really great touches that DJ's will appreciate. The headphones rotate easily and collapse down into a small package (it comes with a cloth storage bag). The gold tipped plug can be plugged into either the right or left headphone, it's a small thing, but depending on how you spin, it is a huge benefit to be able to configure this.The ear pieces are replaceable, and the ones that come with it are heavily padded and make a solid seal. There is a fair amount of sound bleed from these, but again they aren't designed to be everyday headphones, they are focused on DJ's. They do a very good job of blocking out external audio so you can really hear the music, which of course is key. The audio quality is exceptional with crystal clear low, middle and high notes. The focus here is clarity, so the bass, while solid isn't as disproportionately booming as many of the other headphones I've tried.  The clarity is exceptional and there's zero noise, or distortion.These headphones seem extremely sensitive to the quality of input. I tried them out via headphone port on my speakers, directly connected to my laptop and on my phone and noticed a significant quality difference in the audio.Everything about these headphones is focused on DJ'ing, so many of the things you are paying for are things that matter more to DJ's than your average audiophile. Still, these headphones are exceptionally built and designed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8WFQG2NM5B5T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU2KJSO#wasThisHelpful","R8WFQG2NM5B5T","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Visually, these Gaming Headsets from Etekcity look amazing. Etekcity has nailed cool looking headphones. Both ear phones light up with red led lights and the mic lights up when it's live. The black grill design looks amazingly cool, and the headphones fit relatively well. The headphones are USB and they worked both on my iMac and on our PC.  The cable has a nice volume wheel and switches for the mic and surround sound.The unfortunate thing is that these headsets just don't perform. There is significant audio bleed, and so people can hear your audio pretty clearly. The dynamic range is really tight, the bass is too heavy and really vibrates the headphones, but it's not enough to counteract the overall tinny character of the headphones. The 7.1 surround mode is very subtle and it's often hard to know which mode you are in (there's no real indicator).I tested these headphones with music (from several sources), movies, and games and in all these tests I kept wanting more from the range and found the bass to be too shaky in its delivery.I've never wanted  a pair of headphones to be better. Eteckcity has absolutely nailed the design, but the audio performance just doesn't match (especially at this price point). Etekcity provided a sample for review, but (obviously) it didn't impact my rating.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18623X305JI4W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012EQGAWO#wasThisHelpful","R18623X305JI4W","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beard balms come in a range of consistencies, and this Beardy Beard Balm from First Element is much stiffer and waxier than many of the balms I've tried. This is actually a good thing, as a little goes a long way and it is at taming frizzy beard hair. I also really appreciate the fact that it comes in a 2oz tin as most of my beard balms aren't nearly as travel friendly.In addition to great beard management, the scent of this beard balm is quite light and pleasant. I am scent sensitive, and I have no issues with the fragrance of this balm.  If you are looking for a stiffer balm which is more waxy in consistency, or you travel a lot and need something that will travel well (the tin stays nice and tightly shut in travel), it's hard to think of a better option.*Update* after using this balm for a while I've found that it get's a little gritty and isn't integrating into my beard all that well.

"This little pocket chainsaw doesn't look powerful, but it is extremely powerful. Extremely compact (it folds up into a sleeve the size of most wallets), this pocket chainsaw packs amazing cutting ability in a very small package.Yes, it does take a lot of elbow grease to really get this things moving, but it cuts so much more evenly than a hacksaw and once you get going it really chews through wood.I simply would NEVER go camping without taking this Pocket Chainsaw, and I've thrown it with our garden tool box as it's ideal for dealing with thick bush and tree limbs when you don't want to use a power tool.Stunning Gadgest provided me with a sample for review, but I'd gladly pay for this, and I will absolutely be giving this as a stocking stuffer for the holidays!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35YLDIZR9M11D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCNYJI2#wasThisHelpful","R35YLDIZR9M11D","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Libertalia is a well themed and well designed card driven pirate game. Each player is given a limited set of cards they can play, each with a specific ""power"". The goal is to amass bounty and coins while trying to prevent your fellow players from out looting you. I played this game with 6 players and it played very well. I don't think it would have the same level of excitement under 3 players and its sweet spot seems to be 4-6.I like how this game starts everyone off on an even playing field, but depending on which cards you play and how you play them, begins to shift towards a varied and long terms strategy. I'm docking it one star because it really does need a good number of players to really make it fun.Although it may seem a little complicated to start, once you get rolling this game flows very well and it's easy to go from newbie to experienced in just a couple hands.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1023R7S2XIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=2914849877#wasThisHelpful","R3V1023R7S2XIP","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It scales well from 2-5 players and there's enough player interaction to make sure each game is fairly lively. This edition has a cute stand up Guillotine which stands at the end of the cards, it's a small touch but worth the extra couple of bucks for this edition.Basically, you chose cards from a line up of folks who are waiting to be executed, each card has its own ""power"" and some can radically shift the line up and shape of the game. Very easy to learn and play and it's good for a wide age range. We've played it with our 8 year, 13, 16 year old kids.

The game needs at least 4 people, but it works better with 5-6.I really wanted to like this game, but the few times I've played it, the game didn't last long enough to really be interesting, and at 4 people it felt a little clunky.

The game also has a nice function where you can challenge a player on a roll (who has decided to stop) to keep rolling. It helps keep the game moving along and is a nice game changing feature when played right.This game has been popping up on Amazon around the $10 mark which is perfect.

"If there was one game that really showed me how much I enjoy ""Euro"" style board gaming, it was Carcassonne. This game easily scales from 2-5 players and is as fun at 2 as it is at 5. Players take turns drawing and placing tiles to build a city. You have the option of placing meeples on your tiles for scoring (when a city is complete you score, when a road is complete you score and then there are big pastures which can really rack up points).One tip that has helped speed up game play is that each player draws their next tile after their turn is complete. This gives more time to think and plan your next move.True to most Euros the winner of the game may not be the point leader heading into the finish as there are a lot of end game point add ups that can really swing the game in your favor.It's hard to think of a better, clearer. more entertaining introduction to Board Gaming than Carcassonne!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B4CFOJFSNZ1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008ULAMSG#wasThisHelpful","R3B4CFOJFSNZ1S","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Sometimes it can be difficult to know who is working against you and who is working for you, and figuring that out is a lot of the fun.

"Let's get this right out of the way, this is kind of and oddball in the Humidifier world. The Micro Clean Pot comes with a big bowl which you fill with water and then you place the floating Cool-Mist Humidifier on top of the water. It's kind of an uncommon configuration, but the key here is that it's more sanitary that many of the tank humidifiers and you can really clean out the tank and all the components.Once you get this Micro CleanPot all set up it does begin to produce cool mist within a minute or two. This humidifier comes with two different tops, one which directs the cool-mist straight up (like a volcano) and another which directs it to the side (like a teapot). The external controller has a nice range of cool-mist and is both well made and well designed. All the components of this Humidifier are very well made.How much you like this really depends on if this odd style of Humidifier appeals to you or not. It works, and works well, but the floating bowl style is a bit odd. It does seem to hold more water than conventional tanks, but the downside is that it's open water.Miro recommends using filtered water with this as tap water can cause deposits, and they recommend using low-acid oils for aromatherapy.Another important note, it's important not to let this humidifier run completely dry or operate the floating part outside of water, as without water it can get damaged while running.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MSZ4YAFWM932/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQHABI2#wasThisHelpful","R1MSZ4YAFWM932","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's difficult to really judge the efficacy of a supplement so often it comes down to evaluating any negatives associated with it.

"Amazon has built a reputation in it's Amazon Jewelry Collection for providing quality jewelry at very good prices. Here they've got 10K Gold earrings just under the $100 mark. These gold triangle earrings are textured with gold posts. They come packaged in a small cardboard box with a felt drawstring bag inside.The first thing that struck me about these earrings was the fact that they are EXCEPTIONALLY light. To some this may come of as ""cheap"", which is VERY important if you are buying these as a gift. But once you put them on, they don't look cheap, they sparkle and shine nicely and look really good. For some dangle earrings which are this light may be a big advantage but others may not be able to get past the way they feel.The workmanship on these earrings is solid, and they dangle well on the posts without tangling. The biggest issue though is that they don't ""feel"" like $100 earrings and while they are nice, there isn't much of a WOW factor, making them less ideal a choice for giving as a gift. Even though they are 10K gold, it's hard to wrap my head around the $180 MSRP. These would more comfortably fall in the $60-$75 range (and given Amazon's seasonal jewelry sales, perhaps someday they will be).  At that budget though, Amazon has better options in their jewelry collection line that has a much bigger impact when given as a gift.This is also another case where I wish Amazon would let reviewers rate 1/2 stars, as this is very much a 3 1/2 star product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T0CURWGZTYVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV6OBWG#wasThisHelpful","R2T0CURWGZTYVW","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Renting snorkeling gear on vacation can often cost just as much as actually purchasing your own gear. This set from Phantom Aquatics is FAR superior to anything I've ever rented.The flippers are a mix of molded plastic and rubber. This combination gives them a lot more heft in the water and a lot more power. The heel strap is easily adjustable and it quickly zips in and out for the perfect fit (which is very important for control and power).The Goggles are made from tempered glass and did not fog underwater. These are some of the clearest goggles I've ever used and their wide triangular lenses gave a very wide range of view. the mask part of the goggles is made from silicon, which has wide coverage, was easy to adjust, fit perfectly, sealed great, without any leaking.Perhaps the strongest part of this set is the mouthpiece which has a valve stop so that if go under water (or get hit by a wave) you won't breathe in water.All of this comes in two bags. One for the mask which is plastic (and protects the mask well) and a large mesh bag for the flippers.

"This MP3 player looks a lot like the old iPod Nano, but that's where the similarities end. Cheaply made (mostly cheap plastic) and poorly designed, this mp3 player fails on almost all accounts. The interface is completely counter intuitive. To select things on the player you have to use the menu button (the center button doesn't do anything in menu mode). To exit menus you need to select the pause button, except if you are listening to music in which case you have to hold down the menu button. The graphical interface/OS on this device is circa 1999.The 16 GB MP3 player includes a USB to Micro USB cable and a pair of earbud head phones. The headphones are nothing short of horrid. The music is tinny, hollow and just plain horrible. I plugged in my Bose headphones and that improved the audio quality considerably. The player has several EQ modes, but they only make very very slight adjustments to the audio. It also has a variable speed mode which lets you slowdown or speed up the audio, an odd feature.The player also plays videos, but they need to be in the oddball .AMV format. The quality is poor at best.G.G.

"Sometimes you buy something that is so easy to use and does its job so well, you wish that more products could be like it. That's the case with the Gideon Handheld Portable Fabric Steamer. This little steamer does exactly what it needs to and does it extremely well. Fill the steamer up with water, switch it on and it starts steaming extremely quickly. It's small enough to be able to maneuver around garments and does a good job tackling even tough wrinkles.We hate to iron and it's nice to have a small, easy to use, and effective steamer to deal with wrinkled clothes quickly and easily.Gideon did provide a sample to review, but it's well worth every penny and I'd absolutely consider buying this as a gift, as I didn't know how useful something like this is until we used it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RHVS7G2QIIO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWEO48U#wasThisHelpful","R39RHVS7G2QIIO","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've gone digital with many of my magazines, and let subscriptions lapse to many others. Entertainment Weekly is one of the very few magazines I continue to re-subsribe to and I ACTUALLY read.EW has done a great job of keeping their finger on the pulse of Pop Culture. They're often early  on trends and do a great job with their seasonal wrap ups: New Fall TV, Summer Movies, etc. They've managed to keep the quality of writing up while other magazines in their class have gone to hell.

"Reality TV isn't really real, you know that right? In the industry it's never referred to as ""reality"" it's referred to as ""unscripted"".

"A few months back we had an incident where a worker used a gas powered tool which he left running in our garage. This set off our carbon monoxide alarm and we evacuated the house and called the fire department. Luckily everyone was ok (although my daughter had to go to the ER for oxygen). After I did a lot of research to find alarms which were of high quality but also displayed the level of carbon monoxide.The alarm we had was the Kiddie brand, and it saved our bacon, so I decided to give this one a try. It installs very easily and displays the level of carbon monoxide as well as sounding an alarm. This is helpful because with a single glance we can see that indeed it is a carbon monoxide incident and how bad.If you have oil heating or use gas powered tools in your garage, a device like this could save your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KXDUFTIJT1LB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Y6V5CI#wasThisHelpful","R3KXDUFTIJT1LB","A1XDMYX8QOW07N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1XDMYX8QOW07N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sometimes the simplest and strangest things can elevate an experience from ""fine"" to ""memorable"". The same iced soda or milkshake sipped through these classic-style paper straws evokes such memories of childhood soda shop treats and lakeside summer lunches that having a box of these on hand can turn a little snack into a little mental vacation. I have them in assorted colors because that's the way I roll -- but no matter the shade, there's something about a coke float pairing with the taste and feel of waxed paper between your lips that just takes you away. Until the phone rings and someone busts your chops with a dose of reality. Send them to voicemail, take another sip, and stay away a little while longer -- you'll be glad you went that extra inch.Four stars instead of a full five for two tiny reasons: first, and through no fault of the product because it is what it is, if you're planning on nursing your drink, plan on fighting with a limp, wet, collapsing straw. Not too quickly, but like every paper straw, eventually and unavoidably. Second, I might truly enjoy such simple pleasures, but if I got THAT excited about a piece of rolled paper coated in paraffin, it would serve my nostalgic old butt if my kids had me committed to mental facility...","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O26OE6U2N5XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004K8SSAC#wasThisHelpful","R1O26OE6U2N5XW","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the greatest deal I've seen on this excellent product.I won't rehash the helpful tips of others as they were invaluable in my decision to purchase and invaluable in my practical application when I got my hands on the product.I will add that you should really experiment with your woods to get to know your smokes and flavors.I am a big fan of smoked cheeses and I found the key to success to be as little temperature exposure as possible. This is helped by spreading out the wood instead of piling it, by putting the rack in first for this process (over the roasting wood) and THEN the drip pan, filled with ice. Place individual tins (or foil boats) of cheeses in on top of the ice, which will maintain cool and prevent (or minimize) the melt, and allow more time in with the smoke.A brilliant product and a superior manufacturer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1WXYJZQBYDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004SZ9D#wasThisHelpful","RA1WXYJZQBYDB","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

DEMANDED) three things:Fleece Pajamas; a bowl of soup (OK, mac and cheese, but I didn't want to sound like a pig) the size of my HEAD; and THIS MOVIE.One of my favorites from childhood (I saw it first run when it premiered, right around the corner from where I now live, at the fabled Radio City Music Hall) I didn't think twice before searching for it and clicking ""Heck Yeah!"" on the RENT IN HD FOR 48 HOURS button, and kicking back to enjoy.It did not let me down, and is EVERYTHING it was back then.This movie is just... magic. And what's more, it reminds you of what it's like to be young and hopeful and certain the world is full of mystery and amazement. It only takes a few minutes to suck you in, so when the inimitable Angela Lansbury (starring here as a wanna-be mail order apprentice witch living in the outskirts of London at the onset of WWII) sings to one of her young charges that he's ""At the Age of Disbelieving"", you can't help but shake your head in agreement and slight pity as you side with her, hoping he'll come around and like you, realize what amazing adventures the world holds in store for you.The extra 20 minutes excised from the original theatrical release (it was contractual: Radio City would run premieres with a full-out stage show, and for time reasons films had to fit strict time constraints or they'd just shut the projector or yank the film from the marquee) have been restored here. And considering I was in the fleece pajamas and full of mac and cheese, I didn't miss the stage show one bit, either.If your kids don't love this movie, you're raising them wrong, and shame on you.If you don't love this too, you were never a child and were dropped here from an icy, heartless planet, and you need to get over all the burdens of the world and allow yourself to fall in love with it.I promise you will.Traguna...

"First, the good news:- Inexpensive, as I purchased as an Amazon Prime Add-on product.- Remington is a known and trusted name, so I knew it and trusted it.- It revived the garments I tried first (pet hoodies, of all things) BRILLIANTLY.- Probably the most effective pill remover I've ever tried.Some reviewers complained of fabric shredding pulling issues and such. I had no similar experiences, and I believe if you take care to exercise common sense when using this (ie., pulling cloth taut, type of material upon which you choose to use it, not treating it like a hedge trimmer and hacking at the garment) you, too, will not suffer any damage from using this on your good clothing.Now, the bad:- It's made like junk.- The On/Off switch moves from On to Off, but this seems to be purely for my entertainment because it never actually shuts the motor. Maybe it's just my unit that's flawed, maybe it's pandemic; but certainly, it's a pain.- The battery compartment, once you open it, does not want to stay closed. And I mean when it's empty of batteries because...- THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT COVER DOESN'T FIT WHEN IT'S GOT BATTERIES IN IT.- I had to insert the batteries, leave the cover off, and operate it looking half-built and half-brained. But this didn't make it any worse to use except aesthetically. The batteries stayed in place throughout the process.- But the batteries CAN'T stay in because as I stated above, THE ON/OFF SWITCH IS GLITCHED so the only way to turn the unit OFF is to remove the juice.- This is how I learned the compartment door won't go back on after the batteries are again removed. It just seems that it was made to fit to show all pretty in the package, but once it's been jimmied open, it's just misshapen enough to not fit back where it should be.So now I have a ziplock bag with the unit, the batteries, and the battery compartment door stored together, but disassembled out of necessity.But when I DO assemble it and use it, THE PERFORMANCE ON THIS POORLY MADE UNIT IS UNEQUALED.""Buyer Beware"" is more a case of ""Buyer Be Aware"" because if you don't mind the extra fuss, the results are worth the trouble.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SII2HOZ9WE3D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0034BV6KA#wasThisHelpful","R2SII2HOZ9WE3D","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this because I got a wild bug up my butt to make spaetzle.This was so not essential.Now, it is not only essential, it's religious. It's poetic. It's life-affirming.I had made spaetzle before. Not recently, mind you, because I'm both stubborn and easily swayed to self-directed anger, and having never secured a proper recipe for the fabulous little dumplings I'd tried from sources other than my own kitchen, I never stopped to think ""hey, Italian Boy, maybe this isn't a liquidy typical pasta batter, but an eggy concoction you're underthinking.""And I'd tried to run it through sieves and off a spoon and out of squirt bottles, and it always came out like fluffy, semi-doughy garbage.I got the right recipe recently. I got this.I got a wake up call.This simple little gadget, coupled with a recipe that I now hallow (comparable to the one printed right on this product's package) made what used to be a stress-filled, arduous, long and unfulfilling process an absolute snap.It took me 3 minutes to measure and mix my first batch. It took me 3 minutes to boil, cool and drain that first batch. It took me 3 SECONDS to decide to instantly make a second batch.And it took my family about 3 minutes to inhale the two different varieties I'd made and presented to them.This thing makes perfect spaetzle. It cleans up instantly and beautifully.And it now resides on a very accessible shelf in the cabinet, because any time I need a starchy side, I'll quickly opt for a fresh batch of spatzle, made from scratch in half the time as boiling boxed dried pasta, and a quarter the time of boiling plain old rice.I'm devoted.

"I can't judge the product yet, and I'll explain why at the end.What I CAN say is:- They are thicker than regular balloons, for those who criticized that that's all this is, and seem rather durable.

Things could be worse. The dog realizes this.So I'm staying even-keeled in my star-rating.The PROBLEM is that I didn't look far enough into the product info to see that the Size Small batch I ordered is actually the THIRD LARGEST size available.

"It was hard to find an appropriate card case for a gift for my Mom. Having long overstuffed and outgrown her current one, she mentioned her need (as one can only ""mention"" a need a few weeks before Christmas) for a new one, and lamented the difficulty in tracking down one that would serve her purposes.She doesn't need a coin purse, and this doesn't have one.

"Look: it's a cheap bag that's surprisingly well made for the price, so complaints should be kept to a minimum regardless.But the one thing that vexes me -- and I purchased two of these for gifts -- is that the strap clasp is not placed appropriately.It doesn't matter that the latch on the flap is placed midway up. What matters is that the strap part -- the part on the bag body itself that loops through and back out of the latch to ""tie down"" the flap -- is sewn way too high for the depth of the flap.Meaning that if you actually needed to fasten the flap closed (personally, I carry a messenger bag with a full-sized flap and no closures whatsoever, so it's not necessarily a must to secure the contents) either the bag must be so overstuffed that the flap doesn't come nearly as far down the front of the bag as it can when empty, or (and this will probably be 90% of your problematic closure encounters) the flap has to be rolled or bunched up in order for the strap end of the closure to be pulled through the latch.Think of it as looking at Venetian blinds, which sit beautifully flat when in their fully extended ""down"" position, but which are designed to compress accordion-style when pulled taut.This bag will have to pull taut when closed, though it's not supposed to be (and isn't) designed to do so.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YG2HO8EGHN9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013O579G#wasThisHelpful","R23YG2HO8EGHN9","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"...sadly, I do not.Positives first:- Sleek and good looking.- Lined and warm.- You can indeed manipulate your phone without removing gloves.However -- and here come the negatives...- They run a bit big, so err on the side of going down a size if in doubt.- They are cumbersome. With a smartphone being an extension of the self, practically, it would be great if these were skin-tight, like a latex glove. But they're not.- You have to learn which angle to tap from on the sensor fingers, or you won't be read with precision.- You will never be able to use a real on-board or slide-out keyboard, because the tips are just too glove-like and you will hit 10 wrong keys before finally nailing the one you want.- THIS IS NOT A TYPING GLOVE so don't think you'll be able to text on a virtual keyboard. You can touch your screen and it will read. But you're going to have to be aiming at large, chunky icons like the CALL ANSWER or PHONE DIALER because you simply will never get precise aim with the 1/4"" wide fingertips.All in all, a great glove because it's a hand warmer that is LESS clunky to have on when trying to deal with your phone in cold weather.

"Sadly, among the mixed reviews here, I have to weigh in on the Con side of the argument.I would give this one star, but I don't like to say I truly ""hate"" anything.Though I sure am disappointed.Now I realize, these are cheap. But my kids both have even cheaper products similar to these at school for dorm use, and they've been great -- so price shouldn't be an issue and, as some reviewers here have had much success, obviously isn't ultimately the deciding factor in performance.I have done everything, according to the manufacturer's directions and the troubleshooting advice of some of the better and more thorough reviews here on Amazon.I've even posted and cross-talked extensively in the Help Forum, but to no avail.It's set up properly, there are fresh batteries, I am scanning and almost instantly (one or two scans after reset) getting my TV audio. But it only works within 2 or 3 feet of the transmitter, while virtually every FM radio station being broadcast from within a 50 mile radius is coming in loud and clear.If I hold the unit or, better yet, the hard-wired connection (which is tangle free and which I've tried in front of, behind, under, over, and next to the TV monitor) I can get a clearer signal. But would I have purchased a wireless headset if I wanted to watch TV while standing AT the TV?Nope.Literally, sitting on the edge of my bed maybe four feet away, the signal turns to fuzz with some occasionally discernible TV dialogue coming through.This is not a good unit for me.

"An amazing homage to the Disaster Films on which I fed as a kid. They're all, to some extent, skewered here, from ""Poseidon Adventure"" to ""Earthquake"" with a layover at ""Towering Inferno"" on its way to lampooning the entire ""Airport"" franchise.You have to love a movie that has Stockard Channing (doing, here, an incredible Stockard Channing impression -- a meta-reference to her own self-awareness of her trademark mannerisms as a character actress) delivering with sincerity a line such as ""We hope you enjoy your first stop on your non-stop trip from New York to Denver!"").The primary conceit of the film is that the rich and famous and entitled (if only self-proclaimed) are taking a bus -- A BUS -- to Denver. No spoilers, though it's not exactly ""Citizen Kane"", but at the height of the dramatic goings on, you should never EVER stop to consider, ""why the heck don't they just pull over on the shoulder?""Loved it.

"I've owned several, more expensive Immersion Blenders, and this was by far my favorite.I will buy this one again in a heart beat, because honestly it did everything it's supposed to AND cleaned up very easily.Biggest point of contention I have with all products in this category is ""does junk get stuck in the bottom?"" These are often engineered for more chopping or more aerating or more something, but never LESS clumping and clogging.This one clumps and clogs less.I recently replaced it with a different brand that was discounted at retail and had two speeds. Never again. I'm going back to this one.It didn't even break down or crack or anything I could blame on the unit itself in my need to replace it.Pretty-but-brainless, I was using it to save a ""broken"" caramel for a buttercream, and in my haste, using it while the caramel was boiling away, I let it spend too much time against the bottom of the lava-hot saucepan as I worked it.It melted enough to bend it unattractively inward -- and STILL the darned thing works fine. I just can't look at it, because it's a constant reminder of my own failings. I hurt it. It is a symbol, now, of my shame.So I took it to work, and I use it in the kitchen there, though infrequently. My guilt remains hidden, because I have so much more about which to feel guilty at the office than I do in my kitchen.And this contraption has nothing whatsoever about which to ever feel shame. It's a loyal and effective champion of kitchen mixing causes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20PEEENGDWALQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00023XDJ0#wasThisHelpful","R20PEEENGDWALQ","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, a decent value, but these are what I perceive to be negatives:- Not very true to size. Be cautious when ordering, and go a size smaller. I take an 11 very comfortably, and these size 11s leave room for a friend and a snack. I'm hoping thicker socks in winter will take up some of the slack, but these aren't necessarily cold weather boots alone, and I know that in the Spring or Fall they're going to feel wobbly without the extra stuffing.- Very wide throat. These have zippers, but to be honest I can slip into them with little effort without unzipping them. This is going to make anything but boot-cut jeans rather difficult to wear over the boot, and even a slim slack tucked in (the way I normally prefer) doesn't take up much space. The overall look, then, when tucked, is -- and not unflatteringly, mind you -- more ""Pirate"" than ""Biker"" or ""Hipster"".- Buckles are adjustable, but mostly ornamental. Hoping to ""take them in a bit"" I tightened the buckles a notch; this caused the rise of the throat to start folding unattractively, but it helped across the instep.- I can tell after an hour of wear that in short time, due to the way the leather folds on the foot just from walking, that it will crease and dent or crack along the already growing wrinkles.- Maybe I've never paid attention, or maybe it's a problem with this particular design, but I cannot remember ever owning a shoe that had a seam on the insole quite as conspicuous as this. Looking down at your feet, imagine each being a clock face; on the left at 2:00 and on the right, in mirror opposition, at 10:00, a heavyily stitched seam runs the inch or so up from the outsole to the upper. It's not a decorative choice; it's an oddly situated suture. Imagine if you had a face lift, and the surgeon decided that straight across your cheek was the best place for a repaired incision. That's what this looks like.- The leather will look much nicer when it's broken in, but that sort of lends well to expectations of longevity.This is a pretty attractive and very comfortable, seemingly sturdy boot. So I'm not complaining -- I'm just not throwing a parade in its honor.** UPDATE: 11/16/2012 **I have now been (almost literally) LIVING in these boots for three days. I have received no end of compliments, I am totally pleased with the fit with just a white sock, and they seem to be getting more and more comfortable with each hour.I've also upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars because I think that these are already proving to be an incredible value.I still thing the styling is weird with that funny stitch near the toe, but I'm getting to look at that like a birth mark -- part of its unique charm, and its own brand of beautiful.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BPKSBAU5ZNRV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HEQOJK#wasThisHelpful","R1BPKSBAU5ZNRV","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had been using a different brand of the exact same thing for a year.This is less expensive, and a more appropriate size for my teacup Chihuahua.With a hundred in a pack, they last forever. Well, not exactly; but I do leave one down for a few days until she uses it a few times between walks. They are compact enough to keep in her usual spot, and lock in moisture and odor perfectly.The one exception, which has more to do with my pet than the product, is that the 1"" border is not itself absorbent. Thus, if your pup gets too close to the edge, it will bleed off and get sucked underneath, so you need to position them in such a way that they can't comfortably aim anywhere but within the quilted area.When it does seep, on hard surfaces, the wetness gets sucked under and distributed, so you lift the pad to find a nearly 2-foot square puddle.If used on a carpeted surface, I can only imagine this would wreak havoc on your rugs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNFQ0C903ISF2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TTJ9MO#wasThisHelpful","RNFQ0C903ISF2","A2VRYMER23944K","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VRYMER23944K?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been waiting to see this for eons. I finally found it the other night and was thrilled to have finally sat down to watch.I love a few things: Myrna Loy, whose beauty belied her exquisite comic timing; William Powell, who could be captured on black-and-white film doing nothing more than reading his junk mail, and still be alternately heartwarming and hysterical and worth watching for two hours; and the era, which is captured beautifully here in terms of the costumes and sets, the social interactions, the dialogue, and the morals and mores of the day; and snappy dialogue sparked with wit and intelligence.This is typical of films of the era in that the acting is not consistent. While the stars are indeed stellar, some of the other actors must have been related to or lying under the producers, because while it's a comedy, I found myself laughing at the occasional artless delivery of lines and physicality.Atypical of the films of the era, this manages to cross genres, between comedy and true whodunnit mystery, sacrificing neither through the combination. The writing is crisp and witty, and the twists and turns in the unfolding detective plot will truly leave you wondering which of the many suspects is to blame until the very last.The one totally confusing part for me: three actresses who are all about the same age, all about the same level of not-too-pretty, and all with about the same amount of screen time (with only one exception, never sharing a scene), all seem to share the same platinum blonde wig, as well.

"With so many thorough and spot-on reviews here, I will just toss out the following:- I grew up on the TV series, and though glossy and modern, this is a fitting tribute.- Depp is his usual, scenery-chewing, glorious self -- a character actor of the highest order.- Getting past the fact that Tim Burton cannot make a movie these days without his own wife (Helena Bonham Carter), Johnny Depp, and one or both of them wearing a red wig, this is much more in the groove of his older, classic films.- Having worked off-Broadway with the original Angelique, Lara Parker, I spent the whole movie looking for her cameo; I never spotted her. Apparently, less cameo, more ballyhooed background work.- This is DARK. If you were led by the trailer to expect a comedy, you are not going to find it here. BUT, it is darkly comic and there is a general mood of frivolity and levity; it is not a heavy drama.- This is not for the kids. Though there's nothing showing that should be covered by a bathing suit, there is one particular sexual situation that is beyond saucy and rough, and there's plenty of blood -- though being a hater of the gore genre, it wasn't so heavy as to make me uncomfortable.

"This book takes a look at the lives of professional spammers and the empires that they have book. While fundamentally the book is interesting, it suffers from a bit too much drama. Although spam is an issue that plagues the computer industry, it isn't nearly as critical as viruses, cyber attacks, and many other things that go on in the industry, and doesn't seem to me to be as looming a problem as the author portrays. I also found the drama associated with his trip to Russia to seem a bit overstated. While the author may very well have been scared to travel to Russia, it isn't the scary country of James Bond movies, and one doesn't put ones life in ones hands when traveling there any more than many other places. The best part of the book is the description of the wars that broke out between the various spam groups.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23AGJQ7CK9NCX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L5QGBL0#wasThisHelpful","R23AGJQ7CK9NCX","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It takes a look at her life, the horrible childhood she had growing up the middle east, her efforts to become a citizen and contribute back to America, her time working against terrorists, and then ultimately the case that caught her up in a web of misfortune.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZXP1RPXYUN2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005HWLMBW#wasThisHelpful","RBZXP1RPXYUN2","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a really fun book. The author worked as a television producer in Russia, and as such had access to a broad variety of people and stories, ranging from a group trying to preserve destruction of historic homes in Moscow, to a woman completely torqued by the criminal criminal justice system, to a politicians, models, oligarchs, crooks and prostitutes -- in a world in which anyone can be a mix of all of those at once. It is a fascinating look at the machinations behind what Russia has become, as it yet again burns through its promise with tragic corruption. The book is a fast and fun read, the stories are engaging, and certainly seem consistent with much that I have seen there.

"I have mixed feelings about this book. The book combines personal stories about life in Cuba and the exile community, with gorgeous photographs, and a broad mix of recipes. I enjoy the writing and the stories, and the photographs really capture a sense of sun soaked environments and the food. But, i'm not as positive about the recipes for two reasons. One is simply a matter of personal taste -- many of the recipes don't sound like something I'd want to cook. The other side is that the recipes are fairly terse. This is typical of many cookbooks, but I find I like cookbooks much more that go into details of ingredient selection, how to know if it is prepared properly, etc. For example, I find the writing about food in the The Square cookbook to be much more inspiring. Certainly, the food presented in this cookbook is fairly straightforward to cook, but with so much poetic waxing in the world about Cubano sandwiches, i was hoping for a bit more waxing in the recipes.I'll certainly cook some things from the cookbook, but I was hoping for a bit more on the recipe side than it delivered.

"This is a pretty cool little device. It is a USB rechargeable flashlight that also doubles as a phone charger. So basically, you plug the flashlight into any USB charger, it charges away. Now you have a very bright LED flashlight with a convenient light form factor. To me, this is great. I always like to have something like this when I travel because you just never know... and dealing with batteries on the road is a drag. And, since my cell phone is often dead by the end of the day I can use it to recharge that up with some juice... but without making the phone bulkier such as with a Mophie. I think it is a cool holiday gift for folks.For the downside, don't even bother reading the instructions. If you are over 20 you probably can't read the print without a magnifying lens. It would have been nicer if the charger cable used a standard adapter so you could use a single iPhone cord to both charge a phone and charge the battery... i hate having *so* many cables to carry around.

"This is a delightful and moving autobiography that contrasts the author's life in Russia with her life in the United States, where she moved pre-perestroika by marrying an American. Although the story delves deeply into the life and challenges of an immigrant, it also revolves around her relationship with her mother and daughter, and their experiences in the country as well, the former as a post-perestroika immigrant with no English, and the latter as native born and thus culturally so different. It is a moving tale about the struggles of an immigrant, but more, the struggles of family relationships. She perfectly captures the sense and fear of parenting a tween and teenager, and it is a moving story of overcoming adversity, dealing (and not dealing) with family relationships, and the joys and guilt associated. I found it quite pleasurable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WGTSDGDPJU8J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451689829#wasThisHelpful","R1WGTSDGDPJU8J","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes a fascinating look at neuropathology. The author is an eminent doctor, and the book discusses the value on personal examinations of patients and the many clues that can help unravel the nature of a disease. Although he discusses scans and other automated techniques, a lot of the book focuses on the fascinating ways that diagnoses are often missed with a physical exam. It portrays the deep depth of diagnostic learning that comes with experience, as evidenced through a broad mix of cases of patients with diseases ranging from aneurisms to ALS to Parkinsons. It talks about how the disease works, how it manifests, how it can be diagnosed, as well as mixing in deeply personal stories about the lives of those impacted by the disease. It also mixes in some stories of diagnoses gone wrong.Although there are a few areas that could use some more editing, altogether the book was extremely interesting and engaging, and should be of value to those interested in medicine, the brain and psychology.

"This book is a mix. The early chapters are quite interesting, taking a look at a mix of psychological and mathematical principles behind decision making, and the various things that we often do wrong when assessing issues. The later chapters spend more time on information clarity and dealing with weeding out truth from fiction in the online world. While I found the first chapters quite good the latter chapters dragged on for me, becoming far more obvious and repetitive, and dealing less with interesting anecdotes and examples. While many people are misled by online web sites and don't approach with proper skepticism, having endless chapters and tips on common sense wasn't useful. Overall, though, there are definitely some good anecdotes and examples of how people tend to misjudge or incorrectly analyze situations. For example, it deals with confirmation biases, the strange math of false negatives, and many other topics. Still, not as good as some other books such as Thinking Fast and Slow.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZCBZC5EUPUM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009R4FHSU#wasThisHelpful","R2ZCBZC5EUPUM2","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book a bit disappointing, especially compared to some other books by the author. The author is an eminent Sovietologist, and has spent much time in Russia. The premise of the book is fascinating: what happened to the survivors of the Gulag. To the extent that the book portrays the lives of a variety of Gulag survivors, with what it was like for them in and out of the Gulag, the book is quite good. It is a worthy and interesting topic. The problem with the book is that it spends too much time on the author's experiences with the survivors and less of the survivors experiences. I would have found the book significantly more interesting if the balance were opposite. More survivors, more survivor stories, more Gulag stories, and follow ups ... that would be great. But as it is written, it is too much about the author's life and experiences.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D03TSJUPGCLY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D5RGP0Y#wasThisHelpful","R2D03TSJUPGCLY","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very emotional, cathartic story about a young Jewish boy in Kharkiv Ukraine who moves to the US as part of the great Soviet migration post-perestroika. He writes about his life in Kharkiv and the difficulties he faced there, and then the challenges of immigration ... what it was like to get permission to leave, leaving through the border, going to temporary placement in Austria, and then the eventual move to the US. He weaves in remembrances from his childhood, the experiences of immigration, and what it feels like looking back. The book is beautifully told and emotionally raw and honest. For me, I was surprised that this is his first book. It has excellent pacing and feel. As someone who has been to Kharkiv many times and knows many immigrants from that part of the world as well as many people who live there, I found the book particularly interesting.

"For me this book is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. The book takes a look at two communities: one in the midwest and one in Mexico, and examines the impacts of NAFTA. It profiles a set of factory workers at a Maytag plant, and how their jobs and lives changed through different management, acquisitions and then finally outsourcing to Mexico, as well as workers in Mexico, and how their lives changed with the influx of large factory jobs, significantly lacking in rights and safety compared to the American jobs. The book does an excellent job of looking at the problems introduced in this process, and the struggles on all sides before and after.Although some may criticize the book for its pro-labor bent, I didn't find that at all problematic. While it would have been nice to have more perspective coming from the management side of the industry, the issues to the workers speak for themselves in a very humane way. While obviously the sets of issues with the collapse of American manufacturing are complex, the point of the book is to look more at its sociologic impacts rather than assess whether or not the overall economic changes made sense or not.The subject material is quite interesting, but at times I think the writing style could be a bit more engaging. It certainly isn't an academic book, but it could have done a bit better of a job of letting us into the lives of those portrayed.Overall, an interesting read","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JLD8LF40IU2B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199765618#wasThisHelpful","R1JLD8LF40IU2B","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book takes a look at the mathematics of gambling. Each chapters starts with some basic math around statistics. If you haven't ever studied statistics or basics of algebra, you might find this daunting. If you have and have just forgotten such things, then it is a reasonably fast and understandable refresher into sets, series, combinations, permutations, standard deviations and so forth. After a brief section on math, the book looks at various games of chance: blackjack, craps, roulette, poker, pai gow and many others... and explains the math behind them. For example, what games in a casino have the best odds for the player? what strategies should you play against a poker machine? it all boils down to a simple law the author shares -- if you can understand the game easily, the odds are not in your favor. It's an interesting exploration of how to analyze how often you are likely to use with the various casino games and why the casinos set the rules the way they do. You may find it more valuable to skim through the details of each analysis to focus on the end results, or you might want to read through to see how you can derive house odds and hand probabilities yourself.If you are looking for a guide on how to play blackjack or poker, this isn't for you. It will cover the basics and show you how to think about such things, but you really will want to look for a different book.Sometimes I found the book went into far more variations than was interesting to me. I wasn't approaching it looking for a math class, so as such, seeing the math for a dozen variations of roulette didn't add anything for me.Still, an interesting way to get grounded in statistics with some practical problems, and a good way to see why gambling is so good for casinos.I also like that it points out many of the common fallacies you will see in casinos, such as ""its been red five times in a row, i better put money on black"".","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9G7SO9ZELMMF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1482208938#wasThisHelpful","R9G7SO9ZELMMF","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

These are serious recipes that are not trivial or fast to cook. But, unlike many cookbooks, the author does a great job explaining what you have to worry about -- what the timing is like, what ingredients are most important, exactly how you have to chill something from the cooking, how to tell if it is over or undercooked, how things are going to change during the process. And each comes with a lovely photograph showing what it is supposed to be like.It really is fantastic food and a very fun, informative cookbook.

I'm told the original Russian is very flowery, which doesn't quite come across in the translation. It tells the tale of a security officer in a futuristic post-Putin Russia, where the state is a mix of Tsarist and Stalinist Russia, a blend of totalitarianism and religion, and where the government exerts its violent forces as it sees fit. It is part 1984, part dystopian Sci Fi, and part just crazy. A bit tough at times, surrealistic throughout, but sadly predictive of many things that are going on in Russia today.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MH01G1TNABJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00457X8AS#wasThisHelpful","R3MH01G1TNABJP","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an engaging story about a Viet Nam Marine officer who, 13 days before the end of his tour, runs over a land mine and is severely burned leading to permanent severe facial scarring. The autobiography discusses his service, his recovery, the impact on his family, and how he pulled himself out of depression and became a leading journalist in author. Along the way he gets married (twice), has four kids, gets divorced (twice). This is both a study in tenacity and overcoming obstacles as well as a look back on the author's life. I haven't read his other books, although they sound interesting as well.Altogether it is well written. There are times where it drags along a bit and there are other times when it is very fast.

"I've bought several of these cameras for outdoor use.On the positive side, for the first year or so, they were fairly easy to install, the software works well, and i could easily incorporate them into my security system (I'm running Synology for that)The pan/tilt works quite nicely. Resolution is reasonable and images are reasonably clear.On the downside:Night resolution is fairly poor. If the area isn't lit you can't see a thing. I use a mix of IR and non-IR cameras to overcome thatBut the big issue:After roughly 2 years of use, 1 out of 5 of the cameras has completely failed. Everything it records is now purple and red, grainy and streaky. Basically useless.  2 other cameras are also starting to show the same signs.So I have a feeling that after two years of use, these fairly expensive cameras are all going to have to be replaced. Pretty crappy longevity.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FF9OCVOTWIZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P7X438#wasThisHelpful","R3FF9OCVOTWIZE","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yet again, Michael Lewis delivers a fascinating book about the dirty side of Wall Street. In this book he explores super fast trading that is designed to take advantage of information flow, effectively altering the market by taking advantage of slightly different timings between different marketplaces. It is a fascinating technique, but one that ultimately shifts money into the hands of the traders with no positive impact the economy, economic stabilization, worth or anything else. Thus, it is another way in which certain firms in Wall Street manage to abscond with money while delivering anti-value and fragility. At the same time, it looks at the efforts of a company that established an exchange that eliminates many of the unfair advantages. Along the way it takes a special look at how creepy many of the large Wall Street firms are.Although personally I would have enjoyed a bit more technical exploration of what was going on, altogether it is fascinating and fast paced.

"This book explores the US interactions in Afghanistan, and most importantly, the complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It takes a look at our war in Afghanistan, with a view from Afghans living through it. It explores the effectiveness of our bombing campaigns, counterinsurgency campaigns, surge, and nation building, and explores hard questions about what they really meant and how well they were executed. It looks at the politics of the Taliban revival, the ineffectiveness of Karzai (but with a balanced view at why he was an interesting choice as a leader), and the endless interactions of the Pakistani ISI in trying to control and influence Afghanistan. Much of what the book explores is how Pakistan, while taking huge amounts of money from the US, was at the same time sponsoring the Taliban and anti-American terrorism. Not a pretty picture.The book is fascinating, well written, well researched, and very informative. The only downside is that it errs on the side of the Afghani villagers... it may be interesting to balance out the view with the perspective of Restrepo or interviews that look at the war from the perspective of the allied troops.Well worth reading... an important book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J22T57TQ2D7K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E78ID9G#wasThisHelpful","R1J22T57TQ2D7K","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fantastic book that looks at extinction. The book takes a series of extinct or endangered animals and takes a look at their history, and uses those stories as a backdrop to explore the history of fossil science and what we have learned about past extinctions. Thus the book covers modern science, modern ecology, past ecosystems, and science history, all while maintaining a fast pace human touch that makes the book quite interesting. The book explores how man, especially with our massive destruction of climate and ecosystems, is triggering the next major extinction. One of the fascinating chapters takes a look at ocean acidity as explored by highly acidic ocean vents, and uses that as a predictor of the near future as the ocean continues to absorb CO2. It is not a pretty picture.Excellent approachable science and a very important topic.

"I bought this camera specifically for use at the beach and underwater. Having said that, I also used it as a general point and shoot camera. Primarily I use a DSLR, and using a point and shoot takes a bit getting used to. It certainly is no replacement, but it is also excellent at what it does.The camera is small, light, and easily fits in your pocket. I took it in hot tubs, swimming pools, beaches, the ocean, and scuba diving, and it was great not to worry about whether it could take the beating. In short, unlike my DSLR, where i'm very careful of moisture, temperature range and dirt, with this thing I took it every where.The camera has a broad range of electronic modes that are quite impressive -- a portrait mode that detects when people smile and takes photos then; a pet mode that knows when the pets face is visible; fireworks mode; automatic mode and many others. Although some of these are somewhat gimmicky, they actually work, and given that there isn't a real burst speed with the camera, they are quite useful. For example, consider smile mode. On a nice DSLR you can take 10 photos in a second, so you can usually get a range of smiles. With a point and shoot you really do need to choose your photo carefully and the mode works, which i thought was quite cool.I didn't find the HDR mode to be super useful, but i probably need to experiment with it more. Still, the HDR mode operates from a single click and is very easy to set up...much easier than what i have to do with my DSLR.I had some troubles with the panoramic mode. While it is way cooler than the mode on an iPhone, in that it supports horizontal and vertical panoramas and 180s and 360s, i did find it was a bit finicky, especially with verticals and 360s. There the failure rate was fairly high, where the camera would sometimes end the sequence before the panorama was complete.For battery life, i found the camera worked fine. I turned on GPS (supposed to drain the battery) and WiFi and found i could get 1.5 days of fairly heavy use ... say a few hundred photos. I'm sure the life is much longer if i turned off the GPS, but I generally download and charge overnight so i didn't see this as a big deal. The camera doesn't come with a charger where you pull the battery out and charge separately. I'm sure there are chargers that do that, but again, for my use case it didn't really matter. (By contrast, with my other camera i keep a stash of batteries ready)Charging and downloading involves opening up the sealed compartment. This is fairly easy to do. The camera comes with a brush for cleaning, which i wish i had brought with me, since i covered the thing with salt and sand on a regular basis. Still, it was easy to clean and i always got a good seal.Color tones, resolution were all excellent. I didn't figure out if there is an easy no-flash mode (i'm terrible at reading instructions) or if there is an easy way to adjust ISO.For night shooting i didn't have a tripod so i can't say much about its low light handling.For underwater shooting it was excellent and a blast to use. I've read reviews of the earlier model that said the display was useless underwater but i didn't find it so at all. In a pool without goggles, sure, you can't see the display. But you can't see anything.I took it scuba diving down to 45', and found the display to be crisp, easy to see, and very easy to use. I also loved the depth measurements (not sure if iPhoto stores them or not :( ) which was quite fun for scuba diving, and more convenient than looking at the tank meters. While there were some issues with shake in lower light conditions, most of the photos came out extremely well, and I didn't find there to be significant color problems. The brighter colored fish turned out quite well, and shots in murkier water turned out the way you would expect. Still, it was super easy to use, convenient to go to movie mode, and easy to take stills while actively filming movies. You can also easily zoom in and out, take photos, take movies etc one handed while under water and swimming, which is quite convenient. I used the underwater strap (separate purchase) which worked out great.Downloading is fast and easy, and most of the features are fairly intuitive. For example, the zoom lever is used when filming and also when previewing images.The wifi mode is kind of cool.The key thing is that you need to select the camera's wifi network from your iPhone network selections.. .then run the app. (Not exactly documented anywhere). Once i did that, it worked well and you can see from the camera lens on your phone, take pictures, download them, etc. I suppose that is pretty good for voyeur mode or fancy selfies... i tend to download and post from the computer so it wasnt too convincing for me, but if you primarily operate from your phone it should be quite convenient.Altogether, outside of quirkiness with the panorama modes it worked great.I tried the shake mode a few times but never got the hang of that so didn't bother.I still use my DSLR as my go to camera, but i'll definitely bring this with me at all times as well, and it is a heck of a lot more convenient for general use.Impressive camera, and quite fun for underwater use. Very glad i got it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R251N8WKAIN9PS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IA9LQK6#wasThisHelpful","R251N8WKAIN9PS","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes a look at highly priced contemporary art -- who makes it, what it costs, how it is sold, and some of the insane oddities of paying millions for a work that isn't even created by the artist. I found the first part of the book -- which focuses more on the artists and the art and some of the paradoxes about it to be quite interesting. For example, if a Brillo Box was created in a factory for an exhibit of works that mimic'd Andy Warhol's Brillo Box, but Warhol never made it,or saw it, or new about it, but it was in a Warhol show, is it worth millions or is it just a Brillo box? If an artist makes a show that is a video of them having sex with a client, and being paid for the video as an art work, is it a master work or is it just essentially prostitution?The second half of the book, which focuses more on the mechanics of auction houses, pricing guarantee models, and after markets I found a lot less interesting.Hence, i found the book altogether to be mixed... some inspiration and interesting stories, and some rather dull analysis of auction house funding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FJGXCVNW4ZT4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279087#wasThisHelpful","R1FJGXCVNW4ZT4","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I heard the author speak on NPR, and found his stories fascinating, but the book didn't have that same sense as hearing it spoken. While it paints a very interesting portrait of life in West Virginia, told in a swirling shotgun style, I didn't walk away with any of the characters resonating strongly for me. This is, of course, a purely personal view. I suppose I tend to like a bit less experimental style of fiction, and as such was a mismatch for me.

"I approached this book with very high expectations, and perhaps that is why i came away from it disappointed. The book does an excellent job looking into the life of the author, a black woman who grew up in a poor fractured family in the deep south. As such it is an interesting exploration of the complexities and difficulties women like her face, as well as a elegy of sort for family and friends that she lost. Here, for me, the book becomes trickier, in that while I felt great empathy it was hard to feel sympathy. By this I mean, one can look at the people who died in her life, or the overall societal situation, as one of oppression -- southern white culture has put down the black man, doesn't provide education, and as a result the people portrayed in the book resort to dropping out, being unemployed, using and selling drugs as a way to cope. Or, one could look at it as a tragic cultural norm where some, such as the author, are able to focus on education and make their way out of the cycle of poverty. While the book makes all of the individuals very personal, and paints those that would often be painted as dregs of society as having good hearts, at the same time, as an outsider who has watched many people come to this country with nothing and end up in very different situations, their actions seem very self destructive, in contrast to how the author's grandmothers and mother is portrayed. Early in the book the author comments that people would say ""they got him"" and she asks, who is the ""they"". I would have liked a bit more follow up on that question. Now, I am not a black southerner, so obviously I don't know what it is like and my viewpoint is thus different, but I really would have been interested in more exploration of what to do about the situation and more examination of some of the root causes. I am not suggesting by any means that it is easy to get out of the situations described in the book, but at the same time, i am not sure that as a society we should excuse the results, and more perspective on that in the concluding chapter would have made the book stronger.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LL8ZFXTVXGEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160819521X#wasThisHelpful","R3LL8ZFXTVXGEZ","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a fascinating and engaging book. The premise of the book is that there are just too many people on the planet for sustainability. The author explores this from many angles, primarily by looking at many different cultures and how they are either increasing or decreasing their populations and the impacts that has on the planet. The book is particularly gripping because of the human approach that it takes to this important and unfortunately daunting problem -- instead of simply approaching the facts (we are way over populated and we are consuming too many resources and this is destroying the environment upon which we depend) -- the author interviews facilities in many different cultures. For example, the book begins by looking at the high birth rates among the ultra-orthodox in Israel and the Palestinians, and looks at why they have such a high birth rate, what sustains it culturally, and the impact it has on this very small area of land. He looks at how couples in Italy feel about children, and how the political and economic situation impacts their decisions. He looks at changes in farming and urban planning practices, impact of religion, the impact of the one child rule in China, and many other issues in exploring the environmental and cultural impacts of birth rate.I don't want to spoil the book by revealing too much.. but for me it was a book that I couldn't put down. It is very well written, engaging, and fascinating throughout, and a book that i have recommended many others to read. Really, a must read for anyone concerned about the environment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UVH1AS17EKZQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316097756#wasThisHelpful","R3UVH1AS17EKZQ","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes an evolutionary look at the human body, using that as a way to cast light on a variety of modern ailments. The book starts by looking broadly at human evolution, and how we moved from Chimpanzees to the upright creatures we are today, tracing changes in bone structure, posture, brain size and diet among other issues. He then moves from that to look at various issue afflicting us today based on what he terms cultural evolution. In particular, what did the shift from hunter gatherer society to farm based society do, and then more importantly, what was the impact of post-industrial revolution life. In short, suppose you take a creature evolved to be an active hunter gatherer with a particular diet, and you sit the person in a chair for most of the day, reading a computer screen, embed them in a system surround by hormone disrupting chemicals and other goo, and feed them high sugar processed food... and voila, we have diabetes, cancer, obesity, insomnia and much more. The book describes why, from an evolutionary basis, we have all of these issues, and suggests as well cures... basically involving having a diet and exercise pattern more in keeping with our evolution.Altogether, a very interesting book. At times it is a bit long or a tad repetitive, so i would have preferred if it could have been reduced a bit to be more succinct. But, you will learn a lot reading it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1294L3LTKQAG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307379418#wasThisHelpful","R1294L3LTKQAG3","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book takes an in depth look at the lives of a handful of vets who return from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD and TBI, and how that has impacted them and their families. This book doesn't attempt to look at vets at large, nor does it try to address the social or political implications of our war policies. It simply looks at the tragic side effects of war on a handful of individuals, who return home broken by either mental trauma from the death and destruction they have seen, or from side effects of brain injuries and physical injuries. These vets return to a system that doesn't understand or support their needs or those of their families. While it doesn't lay blame, it does show the difficulties of coping with the various physical and mental injuries, loss of loved ones, high rates of suicide and much more.The strength of the book lies in the compassion with which it treats the vets and their families, the brutal honesty with which it explores the issues, and the depth of involvement into what the lives are like.

The book covers the author's fairly dramatic life style, from dropping out of high school, meeting up with a bunch of emerging (and quite famous artists), hanging out with the emerging gay scene in NYC,  and becoming an amazing forger. It is quite fun learning how easily he was able to fool all of the major auction houses (Christies, Sotheby's, et al) as well as ply his trade in forging famous artists. I particularly enjoyed the technical details of what he was doing, but would have liked a bit more about how he pulled off creating paintings so quickly. The book skates over parts of the artists own life .. and maybe should have delved in a bit more... but overall quite fun and certainly makes you think twice about the art market.

"At first I didn't think I would like this book.

Not exactly typical guy fare, especially as I often read history or science books. But, once I settled in tot he book I found it extremely interesting and moving. The author digs into her mother's life, her life, and her daughter's life, and how their upbringings and relationships have shaped and tortured them. I don't want to spoil the book, but suffice it to say that the book is filled with tortured and tragic lives, early deaths, alcoholism, affairs, and lots of drama and conflict, as well as resolution, healing and love. It is raw at times and always emotionally honest, and made me think a lot about a variety of people I have known, which at the end of the day, was part of what I liked the most -- the story brings you in enough that you are not only interested in the lives of those discussed, but you extend beyond those lives into your own.Good stuff, and for me, surprisingly enjoyable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37X18EAGB5UD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=140006936X#wasThisHelpful","R37X18EAGB5UD3","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an interesting book that focuses on changes to war as the world changes -- in particular it looks at changes in battles that will occur as populations increase and become more concentrated, move towards the coasts, and become more connected. The book looks at a variety of fascinating case studies -- ambushes in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Black Hawk Down episode in Mogadishu, the attack in Bombay, battles in Kingstown, and many more. These case studies are the best part of the book, which, at other times, might be a tad academic for the average reader. But the case studies ... quite fascinating. The author looks at what causes some of these attacks, the tactics used, and how they are altered by the various shifting factors mentioned. I found the discussion of the attack in Bombay particularly interesting, especially with how the attackers used media and social media to stay one step ahead of the police and counter terrorism units. The picture painted isn't particularly pleasant, and as resource patterns shift and coastlines of poor countries are impacted by climate change, the expected chaos is formidable.Very interesting thoughts and observations, although occasionally slow.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16HMDDZ5XKY3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199737509#wasThisHelpful","R16HMDDZ5XKY3S","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this book. It covers a fascinating period in China's history, when it opened up to the West, and before the Revolution. Ruled by isolationist emperors with a rigid power structure, this book traces the rise in power of one of the emperor's many concubines. Initially a low concubine, she is elevated when she becomes the mother of his first (and only surviving) son. This in turn eventually leads to a coup in which she assumes power. Often vilified in history, this book tells the inside story, and reveals the many struggles Cixi overcame, and the fascinating reforms that she lead. It is filled with history, intrigue (with numerous plots and attacks from the inside, Western countries, Japan) and the tricky paths that she navigated and she helped steer China into modernity, while still ruling more or less within the traditional gender defines.The book is beautifully written, elaborately researched, and has enough twists and turns of history to keep you turning the pages.

"This book focuses on the role of women in Hitler's killing machinery. It profiles several German women who were caught up in the war -- nurses, secretaries, wives and others -- and looks at what they did before the war, how they became involved, what they did during the war, and what they did after. Some of the women were indirectly involved in the Holocaust and others were active participants.There are a number of interesting perspectives in this book, in that it is focused on women who were involved in the war, an often uncovered topic. It looks at the shifts in women's roles in German society after World War I, and how they got involved with the war, and hypothesizes that a very large number of women were directly involved in the happenings of the Holocaust.With the exception of a few chapters (most notably the one wondering about women's psychologies), the book was quite interesting -- both in terms of the changes in society that altered women's roles, the activities of the various profiled women during the war, and how they were almost all let off the hook after the war. Each of these areas is colored by gender and gender relationships.An interesting book about the war and a very different perspective.I would have liked a few chapters cut and a lot more chapters added, but certainly worth reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNQNY2LICHTEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547863381#wasThisHelpful","RNQNY2LICHTEC","A100NGGXRQF0AQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A100NGGXRQF0AQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Good Shimano quality. Really does eliminate chain slap and the ride is very quiet. The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is due to the added stiffness in shifting. Moving up the cassette (from small ring to larger rings) the added tension makes the pressure required on the shift lever a bit stiffer. Not so much that I would go back to the old style shifter. Once you get used to it the added effort just becomes second nature, but still noticeable when the shadow plus is disengaged or if you ride another bike without this feature. Still, I would recommend this derailleur, the pluses by far outweigh the one slight negative.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YJUK8JBVFGYK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L2ZT666#wasThisHelpful","R2YJUK8JBVFGYK","A31QQPKAC0WFCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31QQPKAC0WFCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really like it and I have now purchased 3 of these. They are quite economical and take up little space yet can do a large job (see pictures including a large 12 inch sauce pan). Easy to operate and extremely fast, so far they doo all that the manufacturer said they will do. I am quite pleased. I can store when not needed and even take out side in good weather and use in conjunction with my BBQ.I have had to get used to cooking so quickly, this is not like an electric hot plate, this is real induction cooking. You can cook 2 ways one by setting and monitoring the temperature or, two by setting an a specified level that will not be temperature sensative, great for searing. There are built in safety provisions such as auto shut down after 70 minutesYou must have proper cookware, check your pans with a magnet.

I was not disappointed, the quality is good and the fabric is heavy.The label states ""assembled in El Salvador of a U.S.A. fabric"". As I stated, the quality is good and the American textile (cotton) is definitely better and heavier than any you will find in the average box store.The size runs a little large. I ordered a large and it looks like an extra large but that is ok. The shirt is 100 per cent cotton and will shrink.

"Good storage solution for the price. I looked at others that were quite a bit more expensive however this one does the job. Arrived quickly and the pieces just slide together, no tools required and about one minute to assemble.I tried it as a free standing unit and found what other reviewers noticed, that it is not stable on its own. Once I placed it squarely against the wall and screwed the top into the wall (see close up picture) with the screw that was provided, the unit is stable enough.Easily holds two bikes, note the supporting arms are adjustable to accommodate a variety of bicycle frame configurations. The bike on top has a straight cross bar so the support arms are parallel. The bike on the bottom has a dropped cross bar so the support arms are adjusted to facilitate this bike.The rack is made somewhere else so don't expect heavy materials or close tolerances for a tight fit.

"Really nice product. I was skeptical at first but after reading reviews I tried it out and I am happy that I did. The finished product indeed looks professional and appears to be durable and good quality. Pictures posted.Read the instructions, take your time, use gloves and old clothes and place something under the container to catch drips and for sure have great ventilation! The can is difficult to open, well-sealed for shipping I suppose, just keep working around the rim and eventually it will surrender. It took me several minutes to open the can.Comes with a pad to rough up surfaces, 1 paint brush, 1 roller handle and 2 roller pads, you need two coats. The roller handle is really cheap but it gets the job done and it is a throwaway. I completed my job within 24 hours allowing drying time for the first coat. I did a diamond-plate flatbed, about 38 square feet, with 2 coats and still have about one half gallon remaining. It appears there should be plenty for a standard bed pick-up including sides and tailgate.I used painters blue tape for edges but that did not work well on the diamond-plate, the liquid carrier ran underneath. For the final coat I used duct tape to obtain the crisp line I wanted and it worked. I rolled it on directly out of the can, I left a paint stir-stick in the can and as I worked I stirred the coating each time I dipped the roller in. The consistency appears to be just right I did not need to thin it out, stirs easily and is rich with texture (see close up of finish on diamond-plate.)Dab product in corners with paint brush, don't try to paint in normal fashion, when using the roller do not press down, it just thins out the application, get the roller well coated (mind the drips) and just move it across the area to coat.The first coat looked good however appeared to be a bit thin but the second application really did the trick, I now have a nice looking and thick application.

"I would have given a 5 star rating had the product not taken 12 days to get to me. I read previous reviews and learned that the installation instructions are printed on the inside of an otherwise plan cardboard box so I was careful to open to get the instructions.The instructions are very generic and are not specific to your vehicle, there are some diagrams but are very difficult to see and are crowded and not clear. However it is pretty easy to install these things they snap on at the top and the bottom, there is a metal band that acts as a retaining spring. I found that if you have a small flat blade screwdriver you can pop that band off and you are ready for install.On the mounting ball or stud where you are going to snap the new strut onto I apply a tiny bit of white Lithium grease for ease of installation.These struts were a little shorter than the factory struts (2002 Trailblazer) but they work flawlessly.

"These are surprising nice ammo cans for plastic. They are quite sturdy and seem to be reinforced in the right places for strength and durability. They seal nicely with a large latch that will accommodate 2 pad locks (see posted pictures.)I took photos as I loaded these two boxes to demonstrate the generous size I am not sure what order the photos will appear but I started in each box with 200 rounds of .223, 100 rounds of 38 Special, 50 rounds of 12 Gage, 1,100 rounds of 22LR, 150 rounds of 380 and 100 rounds of 9 MM. Later I added to each box an additional 50 rounds of 38 Special and 50 rounds of 380.Altogether each box contains 1800 rounds of ammo all in original packaging and I believe there is still room for another 200 rounds. I would not be surprised to get 2,000 packaged rounds in each box.Now for the real test, do you dare to pick it up by the plastic handle? Yes, the boxes and the handles are quite sound and lift the weight handily, I had no issues with the abilities of the handle vs. weight.The boxes have small tabs on the top so they are stackable and do not slide around. The top has a small ""O"" ring seal and the manufacture states they are water resistant, I do not think they are waterproof. However these will serve me just fine for keeping my ammo dry stored in the house, shop or cellar or in a tent in the field.For the price and with Super Saver Shipping I believe they are a good deal especially with the cost of steel ammo cans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCS2C1DGUO4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ISKM9K#wasThisHelpful","R3CCS2C1DGUO4S","A31QQPKAC0WFCZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A31QQPKAC0WFCZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and asked me to write a review.My job required me to listen to streaming broadcasts and write articles about them, so I've been on the lookout for a good, reliable set of wireless headphones that I could wear so I wouldn't be chained to my desk or risk missing out on important content during the day. So, I've tried out several of them that are available on Amazon. For my purposes, the Otium Wireless Bluetooth Headphones work well, but those whose primary concern is music quality may be more demanding.The headphones are actually a pair of earplugs that are angled to fit into the ear better. For me, they fit quite well and did not fall off or dislodge in normal walking around, bending over, etc. The headphones come with two alternate-sized pairs of ear buds as well. The headphones themselves are black, with an approximately two-foot long yellow cable connecting them. When wearing them, the bottom of the cable was about midway down my chest.The package also includes a mini-USB charging cable that is less than six inches long. This small cable may make recharging the cable inconvenient depending on your power source, but the headphones work with other USB charging cables as well. One earphone has a tiny LED that turns color from red to blue to indicate the headphones are fully charged. The charging cable connects to one earphone while the controls are on the other earphone.The Otium Headphones have two fairly large control buttons, both of which are easy to access while the earphone is in your ear, and which are far enough away from each other that you shouldn't accidentally push the wrong button once you learn their locations.. The buttons are also colored yellow to contrast with the black earpiece. The power button is on the bottom of the earphone, while the volume button is on the side.It takes about 1.5-2 hours to charge the headphones, according the the instructions. According to the specs, the power should last 4-5 hours while in use, but the longest I've used it is about 3 hours at one time. You turn the power on or off by depressing the power button until the voice says ""power on"" or ""off."" Pairing and connecting is very fast and virtually automatic if you've set the Bluetooth on your phone or computer to seek new devices. The volume button has a considerable range from virtually mute to blasting your ears, so everyone should be able to find the volume level they want the first time they use the earphones.Although I don't use the headphones with a cellphone, according to the specs, you can answer, hang up, or reject calls by pushing the power button once or twice (the headphones alert you of an incoming call). The power button also allows you to play or pause music while the volume button allows you to advance or go back through the channels of music.Overall, I was quite pleased with the operation of the Otium Headphones. They had a decent but not great range; I was able to go 25 feet or so away without losing the signal, and if I walked further away in the building, the headphones could easily reacquire the signal when I came back in range. The sound quality of voices was very good; I could clearly distinguish what was being said. The only problem I noticed, which was not a problem for me personally considering how I use the headphones, was the quality of the music playback when I listened to some music videos on Youtube. The music quality was okay, but not the most dynamic in the world, with a slightly hollow sound. The bottom line is that they are perfectly acceptable for use while running or working out, but I wouldn't want to use them in my living room to listen to my best CD's.For use as advertised as a set of sports/workout headphones, the Otium Headphones should satisfy most people unless they are very particular about the quality of the music reception through the headphones. They are also competitively priced and user friendly. The only other possible drawback is the very short charging cable. Certainly they met my needs and I would definitely recommend them for use in an office setting as well as for a set of wireless workout headphones.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VWTQC8TNG95E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PXPJUM#wasThisHelpful","R2VWTQC8TNG95E","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bernie Madoff's gargantuan Ponzi scheme is the stuff as dreams are made on, specifically the dreams of fiction writers who leaped at the idea of using variations on Madoff's chicanery as plot vehicles. Morris Fenris has done just that in ""Maximum Redemption,"" a breezy novella about a con artist who puts Madoff to shame. However, Fenris' story becomes just a bit too preposterous from time to time.Maxwell Sheppard is the new Madoff, a crooked financier who stole over $100 billion but got caught because he didn't pull up stakes quite in time. He's now one of the most hated men in America but is surviving in prison thanks to his ability to use some of the money that he squirreled away to grease the wheels. Sheppard is not a total sleazeball, though, as his new cellmate, an undercover FBI agent soon discovers. He made sure that every person he conned could afford to lose the money. So, he's quite hurt when he discovers that a group of ordinary people in a small Iowa town stand to lose their homes because of his scam. Max is even more upset when he figures out that a crooked businessman used Sheppard's plan as cover to perpetrate a swindle of his own. So, he makes a deal with the FBI to turn over the bulk of his missing money if they will let him go to Iowa to try to set things right.""Maximum Redemption"" is light easy reading; most people will probably go through it one sitting. Max is an engaging sort of guy, and he has an easy going rapport with Wilson, the FBI agent who posed as his cellmate. It's not quite Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in ""48 Hours"" but the byplay between the two of them is good. If anything, the 90-page-long  ""Maximum Redemption"" feels like it's a few chapters too short. It takes half the book for Max and WIlson to arrive in Iowa. What follows is a whirlwind of activity as they talk to bank officials, affected homeowners, and the crooked businessman. This material could easily have formed the basis for a top notch financial thriller, but Fenris rushes through it all in just a few pages.I also had a problem with the sheer implausibility of the magnituted of Max's scam. Fenris blithely notes that Max stole about $100 billion and still had at least $70 billion of that total. Those amounts are approximately five times the amount Madoff took. Further, the FBI learns that Max had the money hidden away in the form of bearer bonds. However, bearer bonds have not been issued since the early 1980's, and there simply aren't that many of them still in circulation so that someone could buy up that many of them without being the transactions being recognized. I realize that all thrillers (and indeed much of the rest of fiction) require a certain degree of suspension of disbelief, but I would have thought an author writing about financial chicanery on this scale would have done a bit more research on the subject or scaled back the size of the scam.Overall, ""Maximum Redemption"" seems more like a well-written, fairly detailed outline for a thriller than the thriller itself. The less people think about it, the better it reads, because there seems to be a fair amount of the story missing in the sketchily written second half, and there are nagging plot implausibilities along the way. Fenris could also have used some better copy editing; there are some nagging grammatical errors along the way (using ""Calvary"" instead of ""cavalry""). ""Maximum Redemption"" is acceptable lightweight entertainment, but it could have been considerably better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQM6Q1X0WH2IC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G4CEEBY#wasThisHelpful","RQM6Q1X0WH2IC","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and asked me to write a review.Living in a condominium in which we share a building with three other units, one directly beneath us, has given me a healthy respect for fire, smoke, and carbon monoxide hazards, especially those coming from other parts of our building. So when the Mudder people asked me to review one of their CO alarm detectors, I was more than happy to do so.The Mudder Carbon Monoxide Alarm Detector is a small, easy to use, and easy to install detector. The unit is white and looks like a hockey puck, measuring about four inches in diameter and 1.5 inches thick. The unit comes with a removable back plate that can be mounted on a wall or ceiling (screws and plastic inserts included) and runs on three AA batteries (not included) that are inserted on the back of the detector. Once the batteries are in place, you place the detector on the back plate and give it a half twist to lock it in place.The Mudder CO Alarm Detector has a blue LED display that indicates the exact CO level in parts per million (PPM). The LED lights up automatically if the alarm is triggered, or you can push the test button to get a reading (it's been 000 each time we've tried it). The unit has two small lights. A green light flashes every 30 seconds or so to indicate the detector is working, and a red light will flash if the batteries are low (the unit will also chirp intermittently if that happens) or the unit is malfunctioning.To test the alarm, you just hold the button down for five seconds or so. The alarm will emit a burst of four beeps immediately and then again five seconds later. It's loud enough to be heard from an adjacent room, but if you live in a large house, for a number of reasons, it's a good idea to have more than one detector. The detector has another good feature, a memory alarm feature. If the alarm goes off for any reason while you're not at home, the detector will display a warning signal and keep a record of the maximum CO level recorded. This allows you to investigate and find out why the alarm went off.The Mudder Detector has a fairly detailed instruction manual with advice on where to install detectors and how many detectors to use, the significance of various CO levels, symptoms of CO poisoning, and other helpful information. Unfortunately, the manual was obviously translated into English from a foreign language (the detector is made in China), so some of the instructions are a bit difficult to understand. The company sells three different detectors on the same Amazon page at different prices and with different features. The unit I was sent was the Classic version. I don't know how that compares with other models.I find it a bit difficult to assign a rating to this detector for the simple reason that unless and until we have an actual alarm it will be difficult to know how well it works. I am impressed with the setup and testing and willing to use it in my house (it's already in its permanent location), but I hope I'll never have to find out for real just how well it works. Because there's that inherent uncertainty, and because the instruction manual leaves a bit to be desired in terms of comprehensibility, I'm giving the Mudder CO Detector a four-star rating. However, the Mudder Detector is a definite keeper.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OEEVBF8GF8SZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L8F3EKO#wasThisHelpful","R2OEEVBF8GF8SZ","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and requested that I write a review.With workspace at a premium in my office, I'm interested in avoiding as many wires and as much clutter as possible, and I felt that one solution would be a wireless mouse for the work laptop. So, when the TeckNet people asked me to test out their mouse, I thought it could definitely come in handy at the office. It has certainly exceeded my expectations, especially considering the usual sale price under $10.The TeckNet Pro Wireless Mouse is stylish and well designed to fit the hand. It's also fairly small, measuring about 4.5"" long by 3"" wide at the widest point. It runs on two AAA batteries (not supplied). The bottom and sides of the mouse are black, with the left side grip a rubberized pad with holes in it for better traction. The top of the mouse comes in four different colors at virtually the same price (black, blue, purple, red). The mouse I was sent was red.The mouse includes a dongle receiver that plugs into an open USB slot on the computer. One good bonus feature about the TeckNet mouse is that is has a slot on its underside for storing the dongle. Dongles, including this one, are usually very small and very easy to lose or misplace if they are ever disconnected from the computer for any reason, and the storage slot on the mouse makes it almost impossible to lose the TeckNet dongle. When I plugged it in and turned on the mouse (an on-off switch on the underside), the computer recognized the mouse in less that a minute and it's been smooth sailing every since.The TeckNet mouse supposedly has some energy saving features (the Amazon page claims 18-24 month battery life) including three different power saving levels leading up to a sleep mode. I can't verify that exactly, but it does seem to go into a sleep mode when not in use for a while, but it responds instantly to the push of a button. As for buttons, the mouse has five of them. In addition to the standard three buttons on the top, there are forward and back buttons in the left side depression where I can press them easily with my thumb to scroll backwards and forwards through Internet pages. The mouse also has an adjustable DPI switch right below the wheel on the top of the mouse. For those who don't know, changing the DPI changes the sensitivity of the mouse, in other words, how much the cursor moves in response to physically moving the mouse. Users can adjust the DPI level to their particular liking by clicking on the DPI switch.I have found the Tecknet mouse to be very responsive as I've used it so far. I've used it on two surfaces, the wood-like desktop at my office and the mousepad at home, and it works well on both of them. It also is very good at highlighting large amounts of text for copying or moving without hanging up, and it does a good job of precisely capturing a few characters as well, to provide a link to one particular word, for example.This TeckNet Mouse appears to be a newer and slightly smaller version of a similar Tecknet Mouse that's one of the best sellers on Amazon. I don't know enough about the two mouses (and I've never used the older mouse) to know how they might differ, but I can predict that this mouse is also going to become quite popular as users discover it. The new TeckNet Mouse works very well and has an impressive array of features for a wireless mouse selling under $10. The Tecknet Pro is a definite winner.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V98WXVA0G8AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NBT7LI#wasThisHelpful","R2V98WXVA0G8AT","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"According to his Amazon biography, Michael Monhollon, author of ""Trial by Ambush,"" teaches business law at a university. His legal experience is evident in the two brief courtroom scenes in the book, which, not coincidentally are the best written sections of the book. Unfortunately, the remainder of ""Trial by Ambush"" reads like a cross between ""Nancy Drew"" and ""Letters to Penthouse Magazine,"" except that the level of actual detection and mystery is far greater in a typical Nancy Drew novel.""Trial by Ambush"" is the first in a series of ""courtroom thrillers"" featuring Robin Starling, an associate at a prestigious Richmond, VA, law firm. By the end of the first chapter in the book, it was apparent to me that Monhollon had fallen into the trap that catches a lot of male mystery/thriller writers with attractive female protagonists. Namely, the main character and everyone with whom she comes in contact has to be obsessed with sex. Robin is bothered by her unsatisfactory sex life while at the same time, every male character in the book practically drools over her and every other female character. Within that first chapter alone, the male lawyers at her firm do enough outrageous things to subject themselves to about a half dozen different sexual harassment lawsuits.Robin brings on a lot of the grief herself. She has a bad habit of finding reasons to take her clothes off in public and parade around in her underwear or less in front of perfect strangers. In one scene, in order to search a witness' apartment for evidence, she tries to break into an upstairs balcony window and winds up ripping her dress and taking it off so she can give a couple of contractors below an eyeful of an attorney in underwear. I've read a number of Grisham books, not to mention Perry Mason, Philip Marlowe, and Lew Archer novels, and never once did those guys have to strip down to their tightie whities in order to get into an apartment.I'm sure Monhollon didn't intend these episodes to be serious, but if his idea of humor is an attractive woman repeatedly having to strip in front of strangers, then something is very off about this novel and the author's idea of a joke. Nor is ""Trial by Ambush"" redeemed by an entertaining thriller plot. The story involves an old college friend of Robin's telling her that the former classmate's employer has been cooking the corporate books. Naturally, the woman soon turns up dead, and Robin tries to get the goods on the company.For most of ""Trial by Ambush,"" Robin is either being chased and attacked by corporate goons or trying to break into the homes and offices of the company's officers where she can get in fights with them and hope they will say or do something to incriminate themselves and the company. And that's it, for 300 monotonous pages, with one fight followed by another. Monhollon's description of the chases and action are reasonably competent, but they grow tiring rather quickly.The only time that ""Trial by Ambush"" shows any signs of life are in the two courtroom sequences, which, combined take up less than 10% of the book. Ironically, one of those sequences involves a summary judgment hearing, a proceeding about which most non-lawyers are completely unfamiliar (as they probably are with the term ""summary judgment"" itself). Further, it's a case that has nothing to do with the plot of the book. The second sequence involves a preliminary hearing for Robin's boyfriend, a fellow attorney at Robin's firm, who is arrested for the whistleblower's murder. It's not exactly something you'd see on TV, but Robin adapts a most unusual (and clever) line of defense for the accused.I'm giving ""Trial by Ambush"" two stars because Monhollon has some writing talent and he can write an entertaining courtroom scene. Unfortunately, for a ""courtroom thriller,"" those scenes are few and far between, while the rest of the book seems to have emerged from the fantasies of a high school student who's just discovered internet porn. I'm certainly no prude, and I don't mind the spiciest of sex scenes if they have a relation to the story, but in ""Trial by Ambush,"" the story is all sex and sophomoric fight sequences.  Monhollon should stick to his area of expertise, the legal arena, and leave the sex and violence to those who know how to integrate them into a story. ""Trial by Ambush"" should be disbarred.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLO0DWZMO7BMT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005AYSN8M#wasThisHelpful","RLO0DWZMO7BMT","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The author graciously gave me a copy of this book and asked me to write a review.Author Stefania Mattana takes readers to the Italian countryside along with her hero, former Scotland Yard detective Chase Williams, in an entertaining mystery novella ""into the Killer Sphere."" After having left the police force in his homeland under strained circumstances, Chase is now working for an import/export firm in the small city of Tursenia, somewhere in the Apennine Mountains. Tursenia, like Jessica Cabot's hometown of Cabot Cove, seems to have an inordinately high number of strange murders, and Chase's boyhood friend Angelo, who's now an inspector with the Tursenian police deaprtment, calls Chase in to consult on difficult cases.The case in ""Killer Sphere"" is certainly strange. A wealthy man is found dead in his home, apparently crushed under a chandelier. However, after inspecting the crime scene, Chase figures out the man was actually conked on the head earlier, after which the killer cut the chandelier loose to fall on the corpse. There are quite a few potential suspects: a number of the deceased's relatives were in the vicinity when the murder occurred.Even though the novella is only 80 pages long, author Mattana takes her time in telling the story. Interrogations go on for a while as Chase allows the various witnesses to expound their theories on the case. But, although the pace is leisurely, the story doesn't feel padded. Each interview and encounter advances the case along, and readers will easily get caught up by Mattana's story-telling style. The solution to the case is rather ingenious, and Mattana does a good job of planting the clues as she goes.While Mattana plays the usual mystery writer's game with readers to challenge them to figure out whodunit, she's also playing an intriguing game regarding her main character. Chase is a man of mystery himself with an interesting backstory about his relationship with his own father and how he came to Tursenia in the first place, but Mattana chooses to reveal only bits and pieces. We do get a few good anecdotes, such as Chase's struggle with the local bureaucracy to avoid parking tickets for his car, all of which serve to make him a character about whom we're interested to learn more.""Into the Killer Sphere"" is an amusing light read whose main attractions are the lead character and the author's ability to weave the Italian setting into the story. The detection in the book is a mix of keen observation, scientific analysis and offbeat discussions on topics like whether a particular killing is a ""man's"" or a ""woman's"" type of crime. Some of the transitions between scenes are a bit awkward, as is an occasional sentence (which may result from the author's not being a native English speaker herself). By the end of the story however, readers will definitely want to read more about Chase Williams and his new Tursenian home.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBOIW3U8NY25/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FITRTQ6#wasThisHelpful","R3NBOIW3U8NY25","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and asked me to write a review.The Karmick Luxury Hot/Cold Eye Mask is a lavender scented sack that's designed to be placed over the eyes when resting. I agreed to check it out because my wife often has headaches and troubles falling asleep, so I thought this mask might help. While it's good looking and easy to apply, neither my wife nor eye were able to use it when warm for more than a few seconds due to the overpowering lavender smell.The mask is actually a sack with a lot of grains inside that slide around easily. It's royal blue in color and measures about 9"" x 3.5."" It's made of satin or a material that feels like satin. When placed over the eyes, the Karmick mask extends about an inch past the edge of each eye socket, and the grainy material molds itself to the contours of a person's face to block out light nearly completely.The mask can be applied either hot or cold. When i put the mask in the freezer for several hours, it was cool when applied to the skin but not cold enough to burn. The seller recommends microwaving for 30 seconds to heat it up, but that got it a bit too hot for our tastes, so i cut that to 25 seconds so it would be warm.According to the seller, the mask is filled with natural lavender and flax seed. We have used the mask hot, cold, and at room temperature. When cold, the mask is rather comfortable and soothing with the lavender smell not too strong. However, at room temperature or especially when heated, the lavender smell is quite overpowering and has remained so after several uses. My wife doesn't have a very good sense of smell, but even she had to remove the mask after a minute or so. When warmed up, I found the lavender smell overwhelming and was unable to keep it on my face for more than a few seconds.It's possible that the lavender smell may fade with time and become more bearable. However, we put the mask aside for two weeks after our initial unfortunate experience and found the smell to be just as strong when we reapplied the mask. It's a pleasant lavender smell... from about five feet away, but not when it's less than five inches from my nose. In this case, the nose knows best, not to use the Karmick mask.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128YDERU4AFQE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKVHRW8#wasThisHelpful","R128YDERU4AFQE","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and asked me to write a review.My wife is a very organized person and has about a million jars, bowls, covered dishes, plastic boxes, and other containers in our kitchen and spare room in which she stores things that go in the refrigerator and in the workshop. And, considering that some of these containers are opaque and sit in the refrigerator for months, it's hard to tell at a glance what's inside. So, when the Kicty people offered me a chance to review their reusable Chalkboard Labels, I thought they would be a lot of help for her, and I was right.Although Kicty sells these labels with various numbers of labels per package, the package they sent me contained 72 black labels, six on a sheet, on 12 different sheets. The package also contains a liquid white chalk pen with a reversible tip, one end sharp and the other end more rounded. All the labels are the same decorative pattern, measuring about 3"" x 2"" each.The labels are easy to peel off and stick to any reasonably smooth surface. Once applied, they can be removed and re-attached multiple times without leaving any adhesive gunk on the surface, but they won't fall off on their own. The labels are fairly thin, but they are also fairly durable; most people will use a fingernail to dislodge them which might crinkle them a bit, but they can be smoothed over without damaging the corners. They also won't tear under normal stress, such as yanking them off a container too hard.You can write on the labels with any chalk pen or good old fashioned chalk. When dry, the chalk won't rub off easily, but if you use a damp paper towel or cloth, the chalk ink comes right off. You will still be able to see the dark impression of the letters on the label unless you use a bit of elbow grease to rub it out thoroughly.My only problem with the labels, other than the lack of variety of patterns, was with the ink pen itself. It has to be primed before using, which requires shaking it, and then pushing down on the tip until the tip fills with ink. Anyone who has worked with this type of pen before will know what to do, but a novice may well be disappointed at not being able to uncap the pen and write on the labels immediately. Anyone reading the description on the Amazon page or some of the more detailed reviews similarly will learn how to prime the pen, but it would be more advisable to put some instructions either on the pen itself or in the package (the package does indicate the pen is reversible but not how to start the ink flowing).Overall, the Kicty labels are easy to use and apply and reuse, and they don't fall off either in at room temperature or in a refrigerator. While  there's no variety in the pattern offered, the package of 72 labels represents very good value for the price. And, frankly, there's a fun factor involved in using these chalk labels rather than post-it notes or taping pieces of paper to a covered dish. You can chalk these up as a good value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AB09ZBQ395SY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YX9BTKE#wasThisHelpful","R1AB09ZBQ395SY","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I was a college student, the governor of Georgia was Lester Maddox, well known for being a man of action. Right or wrong, good or bad, Lester would go after whatever he perceived as the evils threatening the people of Georgia. One of his most highly publicized foes was an entire town, Ludowici, GA, which had established a well earned reputation as being one of the country's worst speed traps, located on US 301, the main route from the Northeast to Florida. Eventually, Lester actually put up large billboards at the city limits warning motorists of the dangers to their wallet they faced in the town and kept state troopers on duty to protect the signs from being vandalized by the locals fearful of losing the town's main source of revenue.For most people however, Ludowici won't ring any bells, but Joey Ledford, who was an Atlanta Journal editor and columnist for over 20 years, remembers Ludowici very well and has made the town the thinly fictionalized subject of his novel ""Speed Trap."" The novel is set in the south Georgia town of Astoria, the Ludowici stand-in, and set in the late 1950's, the heyday of the real Ludowici. As a time capsule of the era in the State of Georgia and a description of the massive amount of illegal activities going on, Ledford's work is excellent. However, as an actual novel with supposedly real characters, ""Speed Trap"" leaves a bit to be desired.Most of the first half of Ledford's book describes life in Astoria. In addition to the local police just waiting to pounce on and ticket unsuspecting tourists passing through, the town had other sources of revenue. A downtown stop light was controlled by a lookout in a nearby hotel who could change it from green to red in an instant. Local gas stations doubled as crooked gambling joints, luring tourists into futilely trying their luck at rigged games. And, if they didn't watch carefully, their cars could mysteriously develop engine trouble shortly after leaving the station. Also, a couple of nearby brothels catered to other needs of the tourists.In the midst of all this, the Georgia governor (unlike Maddox, this governor is quite a womanizer) decides to take on the county boss, Earl Griffin. Unlike Ludowici, however, Griffin's stooges on the local police department go a lot farther in terms of illegal activity, including rape and murder. So, the governor dispatches a straight-arrow state trooper, Cal Bocock, to Astoria to try to get the goods on Griffin and his crooked cops. What ensues is a battle that grows increasingly violent.The second half of ""Speed Trap"" is less of a fictionalization of Ludowici and more of a typical B-movie redneck sheriff melodrama with highly stereotyped characters. Bocock is practically a Dudley Do-Right, while the villains seem to have come straight off the set of ""Deliverance."" The only interesting characters in the book are the rascally governor (a Burt Reynolds type) and the ""Three Musketeers,"" the tweenage children of the three local cops, who seem to have wandered into this book from a better, coming-of-age one. The concluding chapters of ""Speed Trap"" are still escapist fun to read, but not as interesting as the more factual opening.Joey Ledford has obviously done his research and, when he sticks close to the actual story of what went on in Ludowici, ""Speed Trap"" is fascinating reading, so much so that I wish he had scrapped his melodramatic fictional plot entirely and written a non-fiction book on the actual town. The action that wraps up the book isn't too bad, but his main characters leave a bit to be desired, and Cal Bocock in particular is simply too good to be true. Still, ""Speed Trap"" is an entertaining reminder of of what life was like in the not-too-bygone days in rural Georgia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FUCD3CAP7PAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QJRKMT2#wasThisHelpful","R2FUCD3CAP7PAM","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and asked me to write a review.The Atalanta Durable Weekly Wall Planner is a perfect example of the phrase ""caveat emptor,"" or more specifically that potential product buyers on Amazon need to look very carefully at the entire product description rather than rely merely on the title and large picture that accompanies the product on its page. I freely confess that when the Atalanta people asked me to review this product, I glanced at the picture and title without looking all that closely at the description and assumed there would be sending me an actual chalkboard suitable for use as a weekly planner. I was wrong, as, I suspect, some customers who buy the product will be. And, to make matters worse, this product is really of very limited use for any purpose.The ""Wall Planner"" isn't a wall planner and it isn't a chalkboard. It's eight very thin vinyl sheets with a sticky back side (plus a liquid chalk pen). The sheets measure just under 8"" x 12"" each. To use the sheets, you peel them away from the thicker white backing to which they are attached and apply them to a wall or other hard surface. It's very important that the surface be smooth; attaching it to a spackled paint wall leads to bumps and possibly tearing the vinyl. One of the pictures on the Amazon page depicts one of these sheets attached to a brick wall, something which would lead to the sheet matching the contour of the bricks with their mortar valleys in between, not a suitable surface to write on or something aesthetically pleasing to look at. Even on a smooth surface, you're likely to get air bubbles and wrinkles when applying the sheet. Plus, if you're like me, it might take several tries to get the sheet perfectly vertical, especially if you're trying to line up multiple sheets to form a large writing surface.Whether you're just trying to straighten the sheets out or you want to relocate a sheet in a different location or other room, trying to remove a sheet and re-apply it is quite difficult. The result is like trying to remove any sticky object like adhesive or duct tape; the vinyl doesn't come off smoothly and instead scrunches together because the sheet is so thin, making it difficult to separate. Then, when it's reapplied to another hard surface, it's even more difficult to smooth out without wrinkles. Frankly, the one time I tried to do so, the result wasn't anything I would want on display in my office or anywhere in my home where people could see it.On a positive note, the Atalanta Chalkboard is easy to write on. It's black (not the gray shown on the Amazon page), and most color chalk show up well. Even when dry, the chalk comes off quickly and easily with a damp cloth. So, if you can apply a decal smoothly and successfully on a surface, you will be able to write on it repeatedly. And, when I did remove it, it didn't damage the wall or leave any residue, so the wall was in considerably better shape than the decal itself.I just don't see this product as being very useful, and calling it a wall planner is like calling a blank canvas the Mona Lisa because you theoretically might be able to paint Da Vinci's masterpiece on that canvas if you had the talent. I doubt most people will be able to assemble something that looks as professional as the planner in the picture on the Amazon page and will instead have decals that are somewhat misaligned, with ridges and air bubbles and that look even worse if a vinyl decal has to be removed and reapplied for any reason. In addition, several of the sheets I received got damaged somewhat in shipping so they were already wrinkled when I got them. Knowing what I know now, if I want to use one of these sheets on a wall, I would simply leave the decal attached to its backing (which makes it thicker and sturdier) and merely tape it up on a wall with the backing still attached.Ironically, the Atalanta ""Chalkboard,"" which isn't a chalkboard or a blackboard, is categorized as such on Amazon and is listed alongside other actual chalkboards selling for comparable prices that actually can be used as weekly planners. And even people looking for wall decals will probably want something that's easier to apply and re-apply. I appreciate the Atalanta people sending me a sample of their product, but this is one planner that really needed some better planning.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1URK99Q80ZEAV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014THF5YA#wasThisHelpful","R1URK99Q80ZEAV","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There's good news and bad news for those who pick up a copy of Nick Poole's ""Dirty Cop,"" expecting to read a story about a tough but crooked policeman. The good news is that Poole has included a second story, this one a horror story entitled ""The Murderess,"" along with ""Dirty Cop,"" so readers actually get two stories for the price of one. The bad news is that Poole has included a second story, so readers are subjected to two examples of bad writing instead of one.The title story, ""Dirty Cop,"" is the worse of the two, although it's probably somewhat of a hair-splitting distinction.  The title character is a tough guy named Mark who, in the opening scene in the story, catches some robbers bare handed. However, in interrogating their leader, he hits the man too hard and the robber dies, prompting Mark to make it look like the robber was actually killed by Mafiosi angry at his invading their turf.  Naturally, this doesn't sit too well with the local Don, whose uneasy truce with the cops goes by the books. This leads to an escalating sequence of violence, somewhere in the midst of which Mark manages to fall in love with the daughter of one of the mobsters.The only good thing about ""Dirty Cop"" is that the story is relatively short. It's filled with spelling and grammatical errors, as well as awkward phrasings and extremely long paragraphs. The characters are uninteresting and unbelievable. The author apparently has no knowledge of forensics or police procedure at all. The story is extremely choppy and rushed. All in all, the writing seems on the level of a not-very-talented middle school student who spends all his time watching reruns of ""Law and Order.""  Reading this story is the equivalent of listening to an hour of fingernails running over a chalkboard.""The Murderess"" is a slight improvement if only because the typesetting on the Kindle edition has wider spacing between the lines and the paragraphs are shorter. Plus, the story itself isn't bad, and, if it were written by a competent.author might have been decent. Unfortunately, Poole displays the same lack of familiarity and comfort with the English language here as he does in ""Dirty Cop.""Five college girls go off on a winter skiing trip to a family cabin near a rather creepy small town. Unfortunately, while on the way to go skiing, they decide to cross a frozen lake. Now there are four. The story fast forwards five years, and the four remaining girls decide to go back to the same cabin to pay tribute to their dead friend. If the first trip was bad, this one turns out to be much, much worse.Poole's writing is somewhat improved here, at least technically. ""The Murderess"" has fewer spelling and grammar errors than ""Dirty Cop."" However, even though Poole spends more time with the characters, they still are ill formed and uninteresting, serving mainly as targets for some very bad things that eventually befall them. I don't expect characters in horror stories to make intelligent decisions, but it's difficult in this story even to figure out what they're doing. If ""Dirty Cop"" appeared to have been written by a talentless middle school student, ""The Murderess"" reads like a story written by an unpolished high school student. With better editing and a couple more drafts, it might have made a decent story.This is my first exposure to Nick Poole's work, and I got this book free as a promotion. I did note however, that he normally charges $2.99 for this and several other of his books that appear to be about the same length (40-50 pages). Plus, based on the reviews of his other books I've read, it appears that he includes ""The Murderess"" as a bonus in other books as well. Three dollars is somewhat high to pay for less than fifty pages of well-written material. It is completely ridiculous for writing that is at best high school level with one story that seems to pop up in multiple locations to pad the length of what would otherwise be an even more ridiculously short work.On a rating scale, I would give ""Dirty Cop"" one star and ""The Murderess"" a generous two stars. However, combine the two and the result is still pretty much of a mess, and a considerably overpriced one at that.The only thing that's dirty about ""Dirty Cop"" will be the words readers will mutter under their breaths if they pay money for it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXMVJEU4LTGWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y9KSIF6#wasThisHelpful","RXMVJEU4LTGWB","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and requested me to write a review.The Enpassion Bike Mount Holder Cradle is a flexible lightweight cell phone mount that will securely attach cell phones to bike handlebars and similar tube shaped structures. It's easy to set up and seems to be able to adjust enough to secure even the largest current iPhone or Galaxy phone.Enpassion sells three versions of this cradle, a yellow and black version and two black models. The black models differ in how they attach to the handlebar. The model I received has a ratchet strap to attach it. The cradle comes in two pieces. The ratchet strap is held in place by a large nut that easily screws on or off to allow users to secure the handlebar as tight as necessary and easily unscrew it again to loosen. When it was tight, I was unable to move the cradle with normal force.The grip includes a back brace upon which the mounting bracket is secured by means of four tabs that fit into slots on the bracket. The bracket easily snaps into place and can't be dislodged in any normal bumping and jolting the cradle might receive. The back brace also includes an elastic band that can be wrapped around the phone for additional security. Once attached, the bracket can rotate 360 degrees to allow viewing when attached to any handlebar. It also tilts from side to side approximately 45 degrees in either direction.The mounting bracket itself measures approximately 2 1/2 x 4 inches with a grip on the bottom and one on either side. The user simply puts the phone on the bracket which depresses a button on the bracket causing the side grips to snap shut. The side grips can extend wide enough to accommodate a large phone. There are two tabs on the side of the bracket that when pressed cause the side grips to loosen. The bottom grip is manually adjustable up or down or from side to side and once in the desired location can be screwed shut using a knob on the back.The first time I tried to install the mount, it took me less than five minutes from getting it out of the box to having it installed and a phone attached. The instructions on the side of the box are simple and fairly intuitive. Once in place, I could rotate or tilt the cradle around to allow use of the phone in a wide variety of positions.The only concern I had with the cradle was in regard to long term durability. It is rather lightweight, and I'm not sure how the side grips will hold up if they snap in and out frequently over a period of a few weeks or months. In addition, although I don't think it's very likely the mount could come loose from the handlebars or that an attached phone could come loose under normal use, I'm not sure how durable it would be if mounted on a bike whose handlebars hit the ground in a fall (admittedly, the cell phone itself might well break under those circumstances). Of course, not wanting to break the cradle, I didn't put it to the test of applying excessive amounts of force or knocking a bike over.All in all, I think the ease of setup and use of the Enpassion Bike Mount Cradle, combined with its flexibility, versatility, and secure grip make it a very good product for those who want easy availability of a phone during outdoor activities. The cradle's all plastic construction might mean that it's not as durable as a similar metallic device, but at a cost of around $20, it's a very good value for those who have the want or need for this type of product.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT1WWFIZBGV3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT8U9UC#wasThisHelpful","RT1WWFIZBGV3N","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I get occasional notices about free books available from Amazon for the Kindle, and I have to admit that sometimes I will get one based solely on the title. Such was the case with Nick Cato's ""The Last Porno Theater."" Frankly, I didn't know what to expect, but I almost certainly didn't expect what I actually got. Part noirish drama, part sensationalism, and a large part some type of wild fantasy, the book mixes some things with which I was somewhat familiar and others that go way, way beyond.The year is 1989, and Herschell Schwartzbaum, narrator of ""Porno,"" is fighting a seemingly losing battle to keep the family business going. Once one of many porn theaters in Times Square, Herschell's theater is now a last outpost for the sex trade on Times Square, as a combination of home video and urban gentrification have been gradually shutting down the competition. Herschell inherited the theater from his dad, and he struggles to make ends meet and keep paying his only two employees. Then, his concessionaire Marge disappears one day and, to make matters worse, Herschell discovers that the theater is literally changing right before his eyes. I wouldn't dream of giving away just what's going on, but it's something that Herschell is not prepared for and that threatens to shut him down.  And to make matters still worse, some busybodies from the mayor's office show up with their own ideas of shutting him down through bureaucratic red tape.""The Last Porno Theater"" is actually a novella, slightly under 100 pages, but in those pages, Cato engages his fantasies and allows them to go completely wild. By the time the story ends, readers will feel they've been experiencing an R-rated version of a ""Godzilla"" movie. To be frank, I'm not sure how author Cato intended this material to be taken. It's certainly not scary or suspenseful or exciting. And it wan't all that funny, especially when it got out of hand. Fortunately, the book's fairly short length helps here, as Cato has to resolve the storyline rather quickly. And when he does, the last couple of pages again get back to his more realistic, enjoyable style of writing.That more hardnosed style makes the first half of the book extremely enjoyable. Cato, through his narrator Herschell, is a realist when it comes to the type of ""entertainment"" that the theater is peddling. But he affords it a certain type of dignity and the passing of the lifestyle a certain melancholy sadness that makes Herschell's struggles to keep going quite interesting reading. Frankly, I would have preferred a more realistic story on the same theme without the fantastic elements. But what I did get more than compensated for some of the silliness in the second half of the story.Although I'm not a New Yorker, I did spend time there and got to see a bit of Times Square in its ""heyday.""  On balance, the city is better off without the tawdriness. However, eliminating the tawdry also means eliminating a bit of the city's character and, as seen through Herschell's eyes in this story, the livelihoods of some of its residents as well. Cato managed to create a sense of loss and nostalgia in this story through his apt descriptions and insight into Herschell's personality. I realize that the book's subject matter is not everyone's cup of tea. The story itself isn't pornographic, but it's not Disney either. For those who have any interest at all in this type of material, ""The Last Porno Theater"" is certainly well worth reading and almost undoubtedly not what you might expect.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRVZX0990JBDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DH70KNA#wasThisHelpful","RRVZX0990JBDY","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jeff Bennington is a published Amazon author who has written a number of horror books. I don't know how good a writer he is, but, based on this self-help guide innocently entitled ""Reader Giveaways,"" he's a worthy successor to P.T. Barnum. His book isn't in any sense a guidebook; it's merely a rather slickly disguised attempt to attract people to his website.Bennington's promotion for his ""book"" on the Amazon page states that it is ""a simple and informative guide that explains how easy it is for YOU to win [various valuable prizes] with just a few clicks on your digital device."" Strictly speaking, he's correct. I looked at the advertising and the content of the ""book"" itself and I didn't see anything that appeared to me to be factually incorrect. However, like P.T. Barnum and his famous egress sign, it's misleading as all get out. At least, Bennington doesn't charge for this book, but there's an old saying: you get what you pay for.While readers might believe from reading the blurb that they're getting a guidebook to finding various giveaways and contests (and there are a lot of giveaways on the Internet and books and services on how to find them), what they are really getting is a sales pitch designed to get them to go to Bennington's web site and subscribe to his newsletter. The site promotes Amazon books by a variety of different authors. Bennington obviously is an Amazon affiliate (as am I) and will make money if someone winds up buying a book through his website (as do I). While on Bennington's site, readers can find and enter various giveaways for real prizes.The previous paragraph pretty much sums up all the valuable content in the 20 pages or so of Bennington's ""book."" He adds a good bit of fluff about himself and the internet and a list of prizes and winners (first name and last initial only, i.e., John D.) However, remove all the fluff and misdirection, and what's left could be summed up in a short e-mail. But, instead of sending the e-mail out to lots of people and hoping to get a response, he's trying to to take a shortcut and and let the readers come to him via this guidebook. In all fairness, he does include links to four other giveaway sites that don't appear to be affiliated with him, but that's the extent of actual content in ""Reader Giveaways,"" four links buried at the end of 20 pages.Bennington apparently has been rather successful in promoting ""Reader Giveaways"": it ranks in the top ten in a couple of Amazon categories.  I have to say that on some level I admire Bennington's skill in wording this guidebook carefully enough to avoid legal difficulties and out-and-out misstatements. However, as far as this being a ""guide,"" as it's described on the Amazon page, the only thing it guides people to is Bennington's website through some less-than-forthright promotion. It's hucksterism pure and simple, the ethics of which are at best open to question.When I review books on Amazon, I try to give potential readers a good idea of what they are getting to let them make up their minds. To that end, I'm specifically avoiding mentioning the name of Bennington's website here. If you are interested in learning more about his site and the giveaways it contains, by all means get this ""guide"" (it's free). However, if you are actually interested in finding details about giveaway sites in general, then look elsewhere. The only thing ""Reader Giveaways"" will guide people to is one particular website. Amazon is already riddled with worthless ""guidebooks"" whose only real effect is to guide readers' money into the author's pocket. ""Reader Giveaways"" is nothing more than an admittedly slicker variation on this too prevalent theme.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V09PB9RZERK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VR4ZNGE#wasThisHelpful","R1V09PB9RZERK6","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: One of the authors graciously provided me with a copy of this book and asked me to write a review.Historical fiction is a tough genre to master because an author has to walk a literary tightrope between historical accuracy and an interesting story line. Too often, authors pay lip service to the era and setting and just plunk down modern day characters dressed up in costume. Although I'm not an expert on pre-Revolutionary War America, I get the feel that Evan Ronan and Nathanael Green did their homework before writing ""Language of the Bear,"" a tale set in that era. Unfortunately, at times they stray too far in the other direction and let the setting get in the way of their story.The setting is Pennsylvania, a few years before the Revolutionary War begins. A renegade Englishman named Azariah is assembling an army somewhere out in the wilderness and recruiting anyone who will join him: whites, Indians (using the historical term) and escaped slaves. His goal apparently is to set up his own independent state and his army is getting powerful enough to wreak havoc on anyone who gets in his way.To stop Azariah, the local British commander sends one of his officers, Lieutenant Hugh Pike, accompanied by an Oneida Indian guide, Wolf Tongue. Pike isn't given very clear guidance about how he's supposed to accomplish his mission, so he essentially spends over half the book wandering around the wilderness getting in one scrap after another with a variety of rough characters. Nor is Pike some sort of backwoods James Bond... he's just a well meaning, reasonably intelligent officer with a sense of honor that gets in the way of his accomplishing his mission for a while. His insistence on behaving like a gentleman (intending to give Azariah the chance to fight a duel) doesn't help him much. Fortunately, he's got Wolf Tongue, who is a skilled fighter and outdoorsman to help. The authors write well, and their descriptions of life in those days are quite good. Rest assured that ""Language of the Bear"" is not one of those ""novels"" in which we get a dozen pages at a time on how farming or blacksmithing was done in those days. Instead, the authors work what descriptions they have fairly seamlessly into their story. The most interesting sections are the plentiful battle scenes. Warfare was quite different then, because, although soldiers were armed, neither the pistols nor the muskets were capable of repeated fire, so once a soldier fired a shot, he was helpless until he reloaded his weapon, a laborious process. Thus, an enemy armed with a sword, tomahawk, or even a pair of fists could do considerable damage. Individual fights thus became far more a battle of tactics than quick draw. And, the battles were much smaller, often pitting Pike and Wolf Tongue against three or four enemies. The biggest battle involves about 80 troops on each side.The weakness of ""Language of the Bear"" is the overall story line and what goes on between the battle scenes. The plot isn't all that focused, seeming more like a crosscountry trail hike than an organized attempt to pull off a military mission. Pike and Wolf Tongue have some good exchanges of the mismatched-allies-who-bicker-then-bond variety, but I never really got into the characters. Here, the authors' attempts to have them act ""authentically"" rendered them a bit too foreign (Pike's insistence on dueling Azariah is a plot strand that never feels right). In addition, Azariah, who by all rights should be a charismatically evil figure, is little more than a plot device. Indeed, almost every character in the book except for the two main characters, is cardboard thin.The authors apparently intend ""Language of the Bear"" as the first in a series, and their ability to write compelling action sequences gives it promise (there's also an exciting scene involving the main characters in a roaring river). However, I hope that, freed of the need to spend as much time developing the main characters, they can work on creating a more compelling story line and supporting characters. ""Language of the Bear"" is worthwhile reading, hence the three-star rating, but as is,it's a book that will soon tempt readers to flip through a number of pages to get to the next section of ""the good stuff.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUGTCLC8D9V2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XABBF5U#wasThisHelpful","R2GUGTCLC8D9V2","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoy word games and puzzles, but I sometimes find it hard to find one for the Kindle that's pitched at the right level of difficulty. Some require you to be a professor of linguistics (or get lots of hints) to solve, while others are about as difficult as spelling cat having been spotted the ""c"" and the ""a."" ""Seven Little Words"" is the rarity, a game whose puzzles generally require some thought to finish, but can usually be solved in five minutes or so.As its title implies, each puzzle requires players to identify seven words given crossword style clues. The answers are all contained in a 4 x 5 grid underneath the clues. Each box in the grid contains two to four letters. Assemble the letters in the right way and they form a word that's the answer to a clue. So, if a clue is ""something you read (4 letters)"" and two of the boxes are ""bo"" and ""ok,"" the player can assemble them to form the word ""book."" As players identify each word, the boxes forming that word are removed from the grid and, with fewer remaining boxes from which to choose, the remaining words become easier to solve.The game itself is free and players get two sets of 50 puzzles to start. In addition, the designer, Blue Ox, publishes a new free puzzle every day. Players have access to the last three daily puzzles, in case they miss a day. Thus, without ever paying a cent, a player can play at least one puzzle a day forever. In addition, the game has a hints feature. Players get 15 hints for free but can buy unlimited additional hints for $2.99. I honsestly don't know what type of hints they have since I've played the game for six months and never had to use one.Although the basic game is free, players can buy additional sets of puzzles. The base price is $0.99 for 50 additional puzzles, although they offer some bulk discounts and some premium packs that cost more. Many of the premium packs are arranged by difficulty level, so players can buy anything from very easy to ""impossible"" puzzles. The standard puzzles (and the daily puzzles) typically vary in difficulty from one to the next, with few that are either extremely easy or extremely difficult. Players can also buy packs containing former daily puzzles.""7 Little Words"" is a great game for those who like word puzzles. It requires both vocabulary and word recognition skills. The free daily game feature ensures that players will keep it on their devices to get the app equivalent of the daily crossword puzzle. The only quibble I have, not enough to deduct a star (I'd rate it 4 1/2 stars if I could) is the fact that players can't play the game without knowing the number of letters in each answer. I'd rather try to figure the puzzles out on my own for a more challenging game, but I don't have that option. The free game provides 100 puzzles, but most people will wind up buying additional puzzle packs (players can get free bonus packs for buying certain numbers of additional packs). People may differ whether 50 additional puzzles for a dollar is good value (a good player could get through all but the most difficult packs in about three hours or less), but there's no question that the free portion of  ""7 Little Words"" is one of the best word puzzle games available for the Kindle, regardless of cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37TUG2Q2305HF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008IXP8IU#wasThisHelpful","R37TUG2Q2305HF","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All room escape games are pretty much the same, and ""Escape from Work"" from MobiGrow although well made, is about as generic as they come. Although the general rules and object of these various games are quite similar, each developer approaches the game a bit differently. MobiGrow has a number of good features in the game, but still, solving some of these puzzles is a matter of guesswork and brute force as much as logic.""Escape from Work"" has 15 levels, each of which requires solving a half dozen or so minipuzzles along the way. A player must solve each level before advancing to the next. Each puzzle can be solved by either using the objects the player has found at that level or figuring out codes or combination locks based on clues found on that level. MobiGrow makes solving the puzzle a bit easier by removing objects automatically from a player's inventory once they are used. So, for example, if a player finds a knife and using it to cut something open, the knife is automatically removed from inventory (unless it's still needed for some reason). Less clutter in the inventory makes guessing the next step in the puzzle easier.There is no real storyline to ""Escape from Work."" When a player begins the game, an onscreen avatar informs him or her that the game is actually an app designed to help people discover the jobs for which they are best suited (thus the ""work"" in the title). Apparently, solving a level indicates an aptitude for that job. To be frank, I honestly couldn't figure out what most of the jobs were supposed to be, not that I really cared. The explanation has no bearing on game play whatsoever.""Escape from Work"" has no internal hints feature; however, the game has links at each level to a YouTube video walkthrough of that level so that players with internet connectivity can get as many hints as they need. MobiGrow provides additional help for beginning players to get through the game's first level in the form of the aforementioned avatar at the bottom of the screen. In addition to explaining the game's title, the avatar ""talks"" to players, suggesting that they look in particular parts of the screen to find and use the objects needed to solve that first level. With this help, beginners can learn pretty much all they need to play this type of game in less than ten minutes.The graphics are quite clean, and it's easy to spot the objects players will need to solve each puzzle. When players click on an area of any level in which they can find objects or solve some of the puzzles, the game zooms in so players can see a closeup of the area. Each level has 3-6 or so of these closeup areas that can be found pretty much by random clicking on different parts of the viewscreen.My biggest quibble with the game is that randomness factor in solving the puzzles. Some of them pretty much depend on assembling the right number of smaller objects the player finds into larger ones, then applying that larger object on the right spot of the viewscreen in order to progress. Some of these processes are logical (combining a spear and a spear gun to make an entire weapon then placing it in a location where it can ""catch"" an object in an otherwise inaccessible area). However, others are not, so it's pretty much a matter of trying everything the player can think of combining, by trial and error, then randomly clicking locations on the viewscreen until something ""works."" This rather crude approach was effective in letting me finish the game, but it lessened the feeling of accomplishment.With 15 levels for $1.99 at normal game pricing (I got it as a FAOTD), ""Escape from Work"" seems to me to be a bit short in terms of gameplay for the money. There are a number of free apps available on Amazon that have almost the same number of levels. Depending upon players' familiarity with this type of game, most levels can be solved in 10-20 minutes, although, obviously, less experienced players will take longer. Unfortunately, the game doesn't have a save feature, so if a player quits during the middle of a level, he or she will normally have to start that level over again when resuming the game.All in all, ""Escape from Work"" is a reasonably challenging room escape game. Beginners to this type of game may want to try out some of the many free room escape games first before paying their $1.99 to see if they like the genre. More experienced players may also want to consider the dozens of other options available that offer longer and sometimes more interesting gameplay for the same or less money. For those who like room escape games and don't mind spending $1.99 for a game this length, however, they will get some decent entertainment, at least, as long as the game lasts.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V4JL91YS5WAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QTCOJPU#wasThisHelpful","R2V4JL91YS5WAM","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The difference between good horror and mediocre horror isn't necessarily originality, because, let's face it, there are few original ideas for horror stories nowadays. It's how the stories are told. That's why, when youngsters gather around the campfire late at night, the familiar tales of crazed killers and urban legends can still evoke chills, even though the listeners have heard them year after year. It's all in the way the story unfolds. And, based on my first experience with Jeff Menapace, he knows how to tell a story.""The Straw Man and a Murder"" will sound quite familiar to any reader who has even a nodding acquaintance with horror. Not only that, but the readers can guess pretty much what's going to happen from the first page. A young boy, Thomas Bowen, lives with his father on a farm. The boy's mother ran off with another man, and Thomas' drunken, abusive dad blames him and takes out his frustration on the boy by means of some rather vicious beatings. Thomas' only ""friend"" is the scarecrow in the field, for whom he draws pictures of a happier family that doesn't include his father.I won't spoil what happens in ""Straw Man,"" but it's not tough to guess, especially given the story's title. But knowing what's going to happen and seeing how it transpires are two different things, and Menapace is a gifted writer who is quite good at describing brutality and savagery. He takes his time here, first showing just how hellish Thomas' life with his abusive father is. Menapace's language isn't excessively explicit, but he describes some rather coarse brutality heaped on poor Thomas. And, he is patient as he does so, allowing readers' anger to build. And then, things change. Again, Menapace takes his time in describing what happens. Overall, the story has a measured pace to it, with the author allowing his morality play to run its course. And he finishes the story with a flourish, a clever play on words that puts a highly enjoyable exclamation mark on the goings on.""Straw Man"" actually plays out somewhat like an episode from a television horror anthology, and, indeed, there are a number of similarities between this story and a classic episode of Boris Karloff's ""Thriller"" that also involved a scarecrow, a nasty person, and a secluded farmhouse. Of course, freed of the censorship restraints that held back a 1960's TV program, Menapace can fashion a considerably more gruesome tale here, and he does.""The Straw Man and a Murder"" is the rare story that seemed to me to be exactly the right length. It took a fairly straightforward story and told it without padding or attempts at explanation of how some things in it were possible while, at the same time, describing events in full as they unfold. It's the type of story that could easily have been told around the campfire. Fortunately, readers here can choose to do so in the more reassuring light of day.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R69LH5GIAR4TH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QWZAQ2#wasThisHelpful","R69LH5GIAR4TH","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The author graciously gave me a copy of this book and asked me to write a review.Some authors, especially authors of series, offer their readers pretty much the same thing from one book to the next in terms of characters, style, and storyline. James Ross, however, is a fan of golf, so it's fitting that his Prairie Woods series is like the fictional golf course near St. Louis where some of the action in his books takes place. For, just as the course differs from hole to hole, so too do Ross's books vary widely. His latest, ""Shari's Shot,"" can be described in golfing terms as a hole in which he hits a couple of excellent approach shots and then misses a short birdie putt.The best club in Ross's bag is the title character, Shari Daniels-Donnelly, the sexpot wife of adoring real estate tycoon Tyler Cy. Shari seemingly has it all, but Tyler Cy is not much in the looks department, so Shari decides she wants out of her marriage, so she can pursue new male companionship more openly than she has in the past. Surprisingly, Tyler Cy, although upset, still proves to be a nice guy and very understanding of Shari's whims. Since Tyler Cy cancelled their membership at a swanky country club, Shari takes up golfing residence at Prairie Winds, where she meets up with Ross's cast of clubhouse regulars, including club pro J Dub and his pals, guys with names like Pork Chop and YouWho.""Shari's Shot"" has a plot, several of them actually, but it takes author Ross quite a while to get around to them. Eventually (about halfway into the book), there's a murder of an ex-boyfriend of Shari's, and she becomes a suspect. And, while that's going on (and the legal maneuvers surrounding her divorce are going on), Shari wins a chance at a million dollars (the titular ""Shot"") in a promotional contest, if she can do well in a practice round prior to a major tournament that's a fictionalized version of the Masters.Despite its rather leisurely pace, ""Shari's Shot"" is entertaining, especially in the earlier sections that focus on Shari's varied misadventures. Ross has created a colorful antiheroine here, a bullheaded, somewhat dim, extremely arrogant, completely spoiled woman who makes life miserable for Tyler Cy and the host of poor waiters, hotel staff, drivers, and anyone else who has to deal with her. She and hubby Tyler Cy are quite well developed characters, and seeing her pitch her fits (and Tyler Cy cleaning up after) makes for an enjoyable first half of the book.The fact that Shari is such a major force of nature in this book means that J Dub and the regulars at the country club are largely absent and relegated to essentially bit roles even when Ross is writing about them. For those who have read Ross's other books, this may or may not be welcome news. I did appreciate it, since I've never found these characters to be as interesting or funny as the author seems to (""Shot"" is the third Prairie Winds book I've read). Ross's golf talk is considerably more interesting, and Shari's big round takes up a small but exciting and quite descriptive portion of the book. Also taking up a small but rather graphic portion of the book are Ross's sex scenes, less noticeable than in his other books but still possibly disconcerting for those who don't care for that type of material.I found most of ""Shari's Shot"" to be breezy, light, often funny reading, even once the murder investigation kicks in (with a couple of investigators who would give Barney Fife a run for his money). However, Ross has a few major missteps late in the book that lowered its rating from four stars to three in my view. First, although he makes a point to rail on about the injustices of the legal system, especially as it leads up to the murder trial, his portrayal of criminal investigations and the law are badly flawed. Second, and even more annoying, Ross attempts a ""trick"" ending to the book. I like surprise endings as much as anyone, and if an author has legitimately tricked me (as in the classic ending for ""The Sixth Sense""), I admire that. But here, the ending flatly contradicts certain events that are described earlier in the book. This represents either sloppy writing or simply not playing fair with the reader. In either case, ""Shari's Shot"" ends on a sour note.All in all, I did like ""Shari's Shot"" enough to recommend it, with the reservations noted above. Ross has the ability to create entertaining characters and scenes and tell colorful anecdotes. However, sometimes he loses his way in his books, as he did towards the end of this one. An old golf saying goes ""You drive for show but you putt for dough."" Similarly, it's the ending of a book that often shapes a reader's overall opinion, and ""Shari's Shot"" ends on a weak note. As a mystery/thriller (as it's characterized on Amazon), ""Shari's Shot"" is a bit slipshod. Fortunately, the book reads much better, especially in the earlier sections, as a light character piece. Shari is a force of nature who is as much fun to be around on the written page as she would be excruciating to have to be around in real life.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12XTWXF5U08OZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T0I7GHS#wasThisHelpful","R12XTWXF5U08OZ","A3CJN2S0XLVVLM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3CJN2S0XLVVLM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and requested that I write a review.With the advent of RFID chip technology in credit cards, the idea of a blocking device like the Protectif Blocking Sleeve to keep prying applications from hacking the data on them is a good one. However, for a non-technologically oriented person like myself, reviewing this product presents a major problem. Since the only purpose of these sleeves is to prevent people from stealing data, the only way I can conclusively know one way or the other whether they work is the hard way... namely if I get hacked, they don't work. And since I've never had my credit card data stolen, the mere fact that they aren't hacked in a few months of using the sleeves may just mean that, like the majority of people, I've been fortunate. So, I tried to come up with a test and I did conduct an admittedly imprecise one. However, based on the results, I would be very hesitant to use these sleeves, and I can't recommend them.The package Protectif sells contains ten credit card sized sleeves and two passport sleeves. The sleeves are white, with a shiny silvery inside surface. The cardboard substance they are made of is about as thick and resistant to bending as a standard business card. When bent, the sleeve can easily become permanently creased or wrinkled The credit card sleeve measures 2 1/4"" x 3 1/2"" with a small half moon hollow at the top. The passport sleeve measures about 4"" x 5 1/2"". In each case, I had difficulty bowing the sleeve to fit a card or passport inside, and once inside, the contents were a very snug fit. I'm frankly not sure how well the credit card sleeve will hold up to repeatedly removing and inserting a card over a period of time. Both sleeves had the Protectif name and logo that identified the product as an RFID blocking sleeve. I'm not sure how wise an idea it is to advertise that you've got something inside the sleeve about which you have security concerns.I was able to test the sleeves by putting an ID tag that admits me to a basement gym in my office building inside the credit card sleeve. This tag is about the size of a quarter. Unfortunately, when I put the tag in a sleeve and held the top of the sleeve together as tightly as I could, the tag opened the door at just about the same distance away (1-2"") from the sensor pad as it does without a sleeve. I also have a metallic card case that's supposed to be RF blocking. When I put the tag inside that case, it would not open the door, even when I touched the sensor pad with the case.I then tried a second experiment. We have a car that operates on a Smart Key, and this time I put the Smart Key inside the passport sleeve and brought it to within about a foot or so of the door. The Smart Key worked perfectly to unlock the door as though the sleeve wasn't there. Again, this is the same distance away as the key without any shielding opens the door. Admittedly, the Smart Key was too large for me to put in my metal case, so I couldn't make a comparison. But I opened the car door with the Smart Key in the passport sleeve without a problem on two occasions. Plus, the second time I tried this, it was raining, and the passport sleeve got a bit wet. It's now badly wrinkled at the top, despite being exposed to the rain for less than ten seconds.All in all, although I appreciate the seller asking me to review these sleeves, I was quite disappointed. If I paid for this product, I would definitely have asked for a refund. Based on the testing I've done, the sleeves don't appear to work. Further, based on the somewhat limited handling and use made of these sleeves, they don't appear to be sturdily constructed enough to hold up under repeated use, especially not the daily use a credit or debit card might necessitate.

"After passing up opportunities to buy Brink for the thousandth time, I finally bit the bullet and got this game courtesy of Amazon for a really cheap price. (wasn't even 3 dollars with shipping included)Prior to getting this game, I heard mixed opinions about this game and didn't know what to make of it. Now that I have it. I'll review it.Here's my review-Graphics-You'd think with the Virtual Texture Technology advertised for this game it would at least be a good looking game. Sadly, Brink is either too dark or it's textures are popping in constantly. At times, I'd take a look at the ground and it has no texture whatsoever. Even after installing this game to my hard drive, I was unable to see any improvement other than a slight difference in load times.Brink does have a consistent frame rate which maintains a smooth 60fps, only slightly dropping at times; but nothing noticeable.The color scheme in this game is slightly on the cartoonish side featuring pastel-esque palettes rather than the more conventional gritty tone.The maps are pretty big but the level design in this game doesn't bring anything new to the table. In fact, I was looking forward to some parkour when I noticed, I rarely even thought of using any other than perhaps getting the drop on an enemy from above.The characters look pretty good; but are cartoonish. Characters were reminiscent of RAGE (Xbox 360, PS3, Bethesda) with their cartoonish appearance. Big heads, oddly shaped body types and oversized feet are the norm, however, it's not that apparent being that you once you play Brink, the game's pace is fast and you'll often be trying to spot enemy AI which are uninspired. (red suits or clones)Nothing impressive here and really this may be the worst looking Bethesda game to date.Score- 6/10Sound-The sound is actually good in Brink. When you shoot a shotgun or a rifle or perhaps a handgun, it actually sounds like the weapon. (Especially the handgun and shotgun) The dialogue is interesting as well featuring a slew of different accents. (my favorite being the Carribean/Jamaican)In this department, I actually haven't one complaint being that the sound is satisfying.Score- 10/10Gameplay-This is where Brink has it's problems. But before I get into the Campaign, let me start off by saying you'll get the most fun out of multiplayer. Multiplayer can be played online against Humans and Bots or Offline against Bots. In either form of multiplayer, you're given options to tweak gameplay such as choosing objective based gameplay or all out TDM style gameplay. But in any event, Brink is teamwork oriented meaning that you're not going to get far trying to be John Rambo unless the difficulty is turned way down. The Bots have good aim and are good enough to play against if you can't get online. Also, against bots you'll earn rewards such as new weapons, skins, clothing, gear and perks.All in all and again, this is where you'll get the most enjoyment.Then you have the campaign...which is just endless spawning and objective based combat. In fact, the story's fairly weak and it plays nearly identical to multiplayer (and you're also granted rewards, the only difference is that the campaign is where you'll earn most of the achievements. (even though offline multiplayer or online mp earns them as well, just not the same achievements)The game's control is something that bugs me a little. Afterall, mapping ""run"" to one of the bumper buttons instead of the left analog stick when pressed in is weird. There's even two different runs in the game. If you press in the left analog stick and move, you'll move a little faster, but it seems more like a jog than a run and finally, when you press one of the bumper buttons for run, you move much faster like a real run.Aiming is a bit on the weird side also. Anyone whose played Section 8 for Xbox 360 can relate to aiming at an enemy and killing them much faster rather than hip fire. In Brink, hip fire does nearly any damage unless you're super close and even then you can still take a dirt nap courtesy of AI/online well placed shots from a shotgun or rifle.In any event, I also have a slight quirk with aiming in this game being that it feels strange. Even with sensitivity tuned, Brink gives me too much of a Killzone feeling. (not quite as bad but close) Aiming is a little on the sluggish side.Brink also brings some decent ideas to the plate that could've been better if these concepts were worked on. For example, in the beginning of Brink, you're given the freedom to create a character only to realize that there's tons of stuff to unlock, but nothing will stop your characters from looking odd. Also, and although this is a minor gripe to me, Brink doesn't give you the ability to create a female. (one of the standards in Bethesda games)However, what Brink does get right is how balanced the weapons and class system is.You can choose Soldier, Medic, Engineer etc and each class has it's pros and cons. For example, an engineer is able to place turrets throughout a level or repair bots, an engineer can even give boosts to it's infantry in the form of weapon perks. The Medic can revive infantry as well as himself when downed and the Soldier is similar to the Engineer but much better at close quarters combat.In addition to all the great shooting action Brink offers, you're given the weakest looking melee attack ever. Seriously, with games like MOH Warfighter, Battlefield 3 and 4, Killzone and such in existence, you'd think for once that a FPS game would have brutal looking melee kills; but sadly, this is not the case at all.If I actually paid 60 dollars for Brink, I'd be pissed due to it's lack of story and underwhelming gameplay mechanics (underutilized parkour), however, being that I paid not even 3 dollars for it, I'd call it a steal. It offers online and offline multiplayer which is a huge plus being that so many games force one option to work with. The sound design is nothing short of fantastic and although it's graphics are a bit underwhelming with texture pop-in or muddy textures, Brink still is an enjoyable experience. It's just unfortunate that with all the hype that surrounded this game when it initially launched, Brink did not live up to it.One of the best aspects I love about this game is that there's no lone-wolfing missions. Combat is realistic in a sense that playing 1 against 300 isn't even possible. The AI can be quite challenging and despite what other reviewers say about friendly AI, I purposely did not choose engineer in a few multiplayer and campaign missions and got past the mission just fine.Score- 8/10","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14K73FB177A67/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002DC8GKE#wasThisHelpful","R14K73FB177A67","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, before I get into this review about this DVD HTH set, I'd like to share that my wife cried loads of times watching these episodes.Personally, this is a fantastic collection with some minor flaws that I will get into.Review-This DVD set includes all 25 episodes of season 1 plus a bloopers episode. While this sounds great on paper, my biggest problem with this set is the fact that the episodes aren't remastered or even bumped up in resolution. They're 480i (480p would be progressive scan clarity which means better color, more detail etc) and it retains it's original quality when aired on TV.While I wouldn't ask for HD resolutions of 720p or 1080p (or 1080i), there's loads of ""stuttering"" frames once you hit disc 3 that look awkward.I'd of personally preferred the production to be a tad cleaner.With that said, this still doesn't detract my score of this DVD set. You get 5 episodes of classic HTH which you WILL NOT find on any other set for the price. (Nor would you get better resolution being that there isn't a remastered set)The first DVD alone is a tearjerker and as you progress through discs, a tad of humor's tossed in.There are however some edits, especially for those that remember the original episodes in their entirety.That about sums up my review of the HTH DVD set. It's 5 discs, bonus bloopers out takes, not remastered, but is an absolute steal at the low price it's going for. I actually ordered my wife the second season and I look forward to it coming in the mail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25YXBRNXVA6GI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUWD7NE#wasThisHelpful","R25YXBRNXVA6GI","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Months prior to this purchase, I bought an Alldaymall tablet with Google Play and with slightly less horsepower. Beforehand, I've bought other budget tablets such as Coby Kyros brand, Zeepad and Asus. Anyway, enough with the back story, here's a thorough review of this tablet.Specs-This tablet uses DDR3 memory with what's supposed to be 4 GB's of storage, however, it's split into RAM and storage. The ram's about 1 GB, while the internal storage is around 2GB's. The android runs on a modified ICS version 4.0.4, Kernal ver 3.0.8 and Baseband version 1.5.It's max resolution is at 800x480.One of the better features about this tablet in comparison to the Google Alldaymall tablets is it's ability to ""backup and restore"" the OS with an actual command. (holding Volume Up while holding the Power button)You can expand the memory with Microsd cards, hard drive (with usb port) or a flash drive (being that it comes with a female misco SD port). Micro SD card support is up to 32 GB's or greater. (haven't tested it beyond 32 GB's)Interface/features-This tablet's features are identical to Google's Alldaymall tablets. Of course, if you haven't owned an Alldaymall tablet, here's the following to clarify what you're getting.A modified version of ICS with Google Play, Power control options (to dim the brightness which can be a bit overbearing at default), Widgets, up to 6 screens or more to store apps depending on storage. built in wallpapers, live wallpapers, HD wallpapers, it has a Camera that has decent resolution but nothing to scream about. (Bottom line, it takes pics that while not the most crisp in resolution, can look good) Calendar, Calculator, Gmail, a hi-q mp3 recorder for recording voices or music, the camera also has a video recorder that is Youtube ready, Search tab, Wi-fi, Date and Time settings etc.The interface itself and setup features huge app icons that are a bit oversized if you're used to tablets with smaller app icons. This is one thing I wasn't crazy about even with the Alldaymall tablets. Basically the appearance and this tablet being Google Play ready is what separates it from other budget tablets.Score- 9/10TouchScreen-The screen is advertised as 7 inches. However, it's around 6.5 or slightly less. It's not that big of a deal. But when I compare it to a Coby Kyros that's 7 inches, it literally looks an inch less. (at least it looks that way. Again, it's not that big of a deal being that I feel the screen is a good size)The screen itself is very responsive. I had no problems opening or exiting apps, games played beautifully (for example, Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds which use swiping motions work perfectly)The only drawback is the screen's resolution and graphics.The resolution's not that crisp and the graphics are a tad on the oversaturated side in which it looks like the brightness is too high even in the lowest brightness settings. The end result is that the color never really looks rich or vibrant. With that said, it still displays good image even with Youtube videos or apps such as Netflix and Hulu Plus.Score- 9.2/10Apps/Functionality-If anyone's curious, YES, THIS TABLET WILL DETECT WI-FI FROM ANYWHERE. Meaning, if you were to leave your home and go anywhere that has internet, it will scan and connect. (Like a cell phone)Now onto the good parts, the APPS.This is a google play ready tablet granting you access to the Google play market. That means thousands of games, apps ebooks etc.But the other good part is that this tablet runs the Amazon App and Kindle like a champ. It also runs Skype, Facebook, Angry Birds and lots of other games, Youtube, Hulu Plus, Netflix, Crackle and other popular apps perfectly. In fact, I haven't had an issue with apps and they run very smooth. The ICS (ice cream sandwich) version on this tablet is really fast and loads pages at good speed. Youtube videos run at excellent speed.With that said, the only problem I had thus far was that the tablet's camera crashed during it's first boot.I'd of really liked this tablet more if there was a way to control the brightness and make the colors more rich and vibrant, but that would be the only complaints I have with this.The boot up time's about 20-30 seconds.Score- 9.5/10Sound-The sound without headphones/earphones is decent and it will ultimately depend on what you're watching. However, and in any case, you'll definitely want to stick with earphones or at least get a volume booster app.Battery-The battery life is great. I've gotten many hours out of this tablet by simply adjusting the brightness. Initially, and even with the brightness cranked, you can expect a little over 4 hours. With the brightness tuned, this has lasted nearly an entire day. I have to say, I'm thoroughly impressed with the battery life.Overall.I got this tablet for a little over 50 dollars and in comparison to other budget tablets (including alldaymall's google tab), it's a steal. It's well worth the money. It's very fast and the touchscreen's responsive. (no deadzones) It's googleplay ready and rootable. I really haven't a complaint about this tablet especially at the price I bought it.For slightly more you could buy a Coby Kyros which is graphically better, but has to be rooted and can be a pain with crashing. This tablet does not crash and runs beautifully. I've never even heard of this brand but I will be getting a few more just for the collection.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8T7ZFS4FWPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B7SMR3C#wasThisHelpful","RY8T7ZFS4FWPH","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought Anarchy Reigns after putting off a purchase for a few months due to the brutal reviews that were generated courtesy of this title. Here's my take.Graphics-The graphics in Anarchy reigns is somewhat of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have fantastic looking character models that are beefy looking and highly detailed. On the other hand, there's the cutscenes which looks a bit under par. For example, in the game's opening cutscene, the actual scene is pretty grainy and while the characters look accurate, you'd swear from the opener alone that this game would look below average. (which isn't the case)The other problems would be technical issues such as instances of texture pop-in. This doesn't occur often; but often enough to be a slight annoyance.Now, onto the good parts.The explosions look really good, the character models look great, and when you hit an enemy with an uppercut that lifts him into the air, you can feel the impact. Also, the enemy types are varied and detailed which usually isn't the case with games like this.I was pleasantly surprised with the graphics, but for God's sake, why is the blood blue in this game? Even it's predecessor Madworld has red blood and gore. This game definitely lacks in the gore department.Score- 8/10Sound-I wasn't too crazy about the music, which is really vulgar hip hop inspired tunes. (Not because it's hip hop either. The songs are just not tasteful IMO) The sound effects are good. Hit someone really hard actually sounds like it has loads of impact, blowing something up sounds like the good ol' arcade days, but the voice acting is a bit on the mixed side. The game's protagonist, Jack, curses an awful lot. You'll hear the F-bomb ever so often even when he fights.Score- 8/10Gameplay-Anarchy Reigns is similar to MadWorld for the Wii, only it offers more melee moves, but is lacking in the object interaction department. For example, in MadWorld, you could toss a garbage can over an enemy's head, stick a pole through his head while the garbage can's still stuck on his head, set him on fire and then toss him in a trash compactor which would result in a combo kill and loads of points. Anarchy reigns features little of what made madworld a hit on the Wii. You still have the ability to toss objects (or even cars and buses) at enemies, but gone are the really innovative kills that swamped Madworld. Instead, and in it's place, are different interactions such as QTE kills, the new Rage finishers, and there are vehicles, aircraft, guns and weapons to use. Just don't expect the same robust engine Madworld had.One thing that really improved would be the melee. There are a good amount of moves at your disposal. You can melee, use a killer weapon, perform air combos, pull off multiple finishers, there are a good amount of slams and suplexes and the fighting system is much better. The other good thing about anarchy reigns would be the enemies. No longer will you be forced to run through a crowd of enemies that are brain dead or just wait for you to hit them and getting killed is quite easy being that certain enemies such as mutants or enemies with flamethrowers alongside environmental hazards can occur at any time. For example, you can have a huge fight going on and all of a sudden there's a giant vehicle with rolling spikes that could kill you instantly unless you escape it. Other times, aircrafts will bomb the entire area. There are also enemies such as Mutants in which you'll need your rage mode to defeat. (unless you intend on fighting them for 5-10 minutes) The fights with mutants are tough; but that's just a taste of the first stage.Anarchy Reigns borrows the stage selection found in MadWorld, only this time there isn't a time limit on grinding for points. In fact, you can fight in the game at any time you want for as long as you want, even if you're not partaking in the game's two mission types; which is free mission and Main mission.Free missions give you objectives such as fighting a specific amount of enemies with a time limit or they can also be an escort mission. The main missions progress the story and is where you'll unlock characters and fight bosses.You're also given a choice in the beginning of the game whether you want to pick ""black side or white side"". In short, the campaign is loaded with action with two different campaigns resulting in two different stories and different characters to play with.The game's story isn't really it's strong point. On one hand, in the game's opening, the protagonist, Jack Cayman is in a bar where a group of russians come in and one hits him in the stomach...and then the campaign begins. During the first stage, there's little if anything at all that hints or at least builds on the story. Instead, you'll meet a bunch of characters that you'll befriend or fight...and the story will somewhat pick up where it left off.But being that the gameplay is centered around mindless violence and geysers of blue blood, I doubt there's a reason to care about it's story. The gameplay more than makes up for the lack of story.There are other modes of play besides the campaign which fall into multiplayer, co-op, training, versus etc.The multiplayer actually has an offline bot battle mode that's fun, but the online multiplayer is just meh. I tried it but there weren't too many people on it.In the end, Anarchy reigns reminds me of PowerStone for the Sega Dreamcast (ironically, this game is made by Sega) with it's arena style battling. (that's somewhat Sandbox like. There is free roaming)I'd highly recommend this game for the price it's going for now. The graphics are good, the gameplay is frantic, the campaign is somewhat lengthy and once you're done with campaign, there are plenty of modes to choose for replayability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFI10JX65Y15/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L9WGDA#wasThisHelpful","RPFI10JX65Y15","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought Asterix and Obelix- Kick Buttix, which is a title that most probably never heard of nor will ever play thanks to it's limited exposure. Now comes the time in which I give this game a full review. Here's the review-Graphics-Asterix and Obelix is a good looking game and is reminiscent of a Gamecube platformer, bursting with lots of color and great level design.One of the things I was very impressed about with this title is that it's a PS2 game with virtually no loading time other than level intermission cutscenes. The worlds are HUGE and detailed, complete with some particle effects, and lots of vibrant popping and while there may be some ""jaggies"" throughout the game, there isn't much to detract my score on the graphics overall.Another thing worth noting would be the amount of enemies on screen at once; which is impressive. (although not as many as Dynasty warriors)I rarely ran into slowdown. At times, the framerate would dip slightly when things get chaotic, but considering the sheer size of the game, and how variable the levels are ranging from a walk in the woods, forests, ancient Greek temples, a mountainous scene with snow and ice covering everything and so on, I'd say this is amongst the more impressive PS2 titles ever. It really reminded me of Jak 3, but with better graphics and considerably bigger worlds plus much more variety.The only thing I could possibly say about the graphics would be that the games enemies are a bunch of clones with some different types tossed in to mix things up such as barbarians or a large spartan. Overall, it's a great looking game.Score- 9/10Sound-There's not much music to speak of, but there's some great dialogue that's loaded with references and some rather meaty sound effects. For example, punching baddies has a heavy ""bass"" to it that sounds good but if a bit loud. All enemies have their own grunts and groans which are comical to say the least.I really liked the voice acting and some of the background effects like roaring winds, water or just animals like crickets, birds and such.I only wish there was a bit more music.Score- 7/10Gameplay-While I love this game and really have little to complain about; I still have my gripes.Namely, the camera is bad. It's very jerky, limited in scope and tilt, and somewhat inverted in a wonky manner. There's no way to adjust the camera at all, but instead, you're to adapt to it's speed by altering your pressure on the right analog stick. Things become really annoying when you're trying to make jumps and you often can't see the ground below you or the camera decides to go haywire altogether. This leads to some cheap deaths during boss fights or platforming.Being that Asterix and Obelix is a beat em up platformer with some customization involved that's pseudo RPG-esque, the upgrades system ranges from purchasing new combos, health or other extras, but what isn't explained at all would be how to pull off these combos. You'll see a description of the acquired combo you purchased complete with button presses, but unfortunately, it does not tell you that you have to hit an enemy a certain amount of times to get your combo multiplier going and then attempt the combo. The combinations are weird too. This lead me to simply use the standard attack button and use common sense to get past the majority of the game.Now, onto the good.Asterix and Obelix is a platformer beat em up game with huge worlds to explore and while the beat em up aspect is used to good effect, there's lots of puzzles to solve. I personally thought the puzzles were fantastic, they can range from carrying a torch into a cave that blows wind ever so often and figuring out a way to get beyond the cave without your torch going out (not to forget, the fire doesn't last forever) to co-op buddy platforming in which you'll have to rotate or hit switches in order for either Asterix or Obelix to get to an objective. During these puzzles, you'll often have to multitask by fighting off enemies or defeating a certain number of enemies, but when all is said and done, the game retains it's exploration aspect which I absolutely love.On occasion, you'll switch from being either Asterix or Obelix. (Asterix, faster, but smaller, Obelix, bigger, slower, stronger, hits harder), and each character has their own abilities. It's just too bad this game isn't 2 player.The story basically boils down to Asterix and Obelix battling against Julius Caesar's army with the help of one of Caesar's ex-spies.Overall- I highly recommend getting this game.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36CWIQLM9OY73/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001XQ8QQ#wasThisHelpful","R36CWIQLM9OY73","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before buying this game, I did a little research on it and came up with barely anything. In fact, review sites barely gave this title the time of day being that it's next gen big brother versions overshadowed this title; easily. Here's my review-Graphics-Comparing CODWAWFF against the likes of COD Big Red One (which I played for the Gamecube) isn't quite the comparison. For one, the graphics in this game are really dumbed down and loaded with jaggies. There's also way too much bloom at times and it really suffers from low-res textures. I realize it's the PS2, but there have been some great looking games at times. (think God of war, Mark of Kri, Gungrave, WWE games etc) Even against the likes of Medal of Honor- Vanguard for the PS2, this title just doesn't hold up well.This game is amongst the worst looking games for the PS2, but there are some decent looking parts about the game.The guns look decent, certain backgrounds just look okay and enemies look okay also.But overall, being that COD big red one uses the same exact engine, I'm left scratching my head wondering why this game didn't at least look similar to it. At max, this game runs about 20 fps if that and the framerate stutters when ""a lot"" happens. (Yep, all 5 enemies rushing at you)Score- 5/10Sound-The voice acting is pretty good, but the sound effects and music aren't exactly much to write home about. Some of the weapons just sound like loud bangs, while others sound a bit better. Again, nothing to write home about.Score- 6/10Gameplay-Finally, we have gameplay which could've been this game's saving grace. CODWAWFF plays almost like Big red one or Finest hour, but lacks the ""oomph"" of those COD classics. You'll basically gun down 2-5 enemies at a time with bare bones objectives to accomplish and nothing that really sucks you into the already nonexistent story.There are some moments that occur during the campaign like a soldier fighting off the Japanese and dying, only for you to pick up his flamethrower and give him slight justice so his death isn't in vain, but sadly, there aren't enough moments like this and the levels end up being corridor shooting galleries rather than at least having a decent pace. Most levels lack the Call of Duty pacing found in other games or that arcade feel.With that said, the controls are tight and there's even auto aim assist in this game. The campaign is also a decent length, but some levels are incredibly short. (I went through one level in 4-5 minutes)One of the things I didn't like about this game at all would be the lack of enemies. You'll get 2-3 enemies or 10 max in a bunker to clear out and it really seemed like devs didn't take the time with the engine to give a better experience being that most of the experience is like playing Medal of Honor 1 for the PS1 with limited enemies and backgrounds that are barren.Although it seems like I'm bashing this game, there are some levels that come up later in the game that were great to play and pushed the engine/game a lot more than it's shoddy beginning. I loved playing in what appeared to be a burned down battleground and shooting enemies. But overall, I felt the game didn't provide enough of these moments to keep me interested.In comparison to it's HD releases, certainly this game doesn't compare, but even when compared against the likes of games like Black Hawk Down, Cold Winter, Red Faction 2, Killzone or most 6th gen fps's, this game just doesn't add up. It feels rushed, the graphics are bad, the framerate stutters often even though it features good control.I'd still recommend a buy being that it's cheap and it does offer something good at times.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15Z5XBR19TULN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0033T1UWW#wasThisHelpful","R15Z5XBR19TULN","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a Prismacolor pencil sharpener from Amazon and was initially a bit worried if I overpaid for a manual sharpener. Afterall, the description for this product says it's a ""colored pencil sharpener"" which is somewhat absurd being that any sharpener should be able to sharpen a colored pencil. Here's my take on the product.First off, it's a lot smaller than I thought. I was expecting something possibly 4-6 inches, but this sharpener is really small; barely over 2 inches if that.But here's the good news. It sharpens a pencil to a really good point. I actually bought some Mirado black warriors, an art kit with HB pencils and such and my art kit came with a terrible little sharpener.Thank god for the prismacolor. It doesn't even take long to sharpen a pencil to a fine point and I haven't had any issues with breakage.Another good tip you may want to know about is that instead of rotating your pencil to sharpen it, hold the pencil firmly in the sharpener and rotate the sharpener instead. You'll get good results every time.I highly recommend this sharpener being that it's the best manual sharpener you can get for the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EVMIJOLB6YLD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004F9QBGE#wasThisHelpful","R2EVMIJOLB6YLD","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After being pleased with a Coby Kyros Mid 7122 and later being disappointed after buying a Coby Kyros MID 7042, I decided to give a shot to another budget tablet company that I haven't heard of. In fact, I'm not even sure what the name of the Tablet is other than an A13 tablet.I have to say...I'm more than pleased with my purchase. Now, onto my review-Appearance/Design-The first thing I noticed about this tablet is the fact that it's really thin. Not paper thin or anything, but comparable to Razr products being that it's about a centimeter in thickness.The colors are quite typical of budget tablets; it has a dark gray finish with black trim around the screen.One thing I wasn't too crazy about because I'm so used to my budget tablets being Coby Kyros design, would be that the inputs are in awkward spots. For example, the AC power jack input it located at the very top of the tablet as is the USB input. It just seems weird.The power button is on top (when I'm used to it being on the side as well) and the volume button is on the side of the tablet. (right side)Score- 8/10Interface/stability-This runs on android 4.0, but it can be upgraded and I believe mine is running on 4.1 or something along the lines.The one thing I wasn't crazy about was how big the icons are. I mean, they're huge and seem more suitable for a 10-inch tablet, however, this isn't the case. I've also noted that there aren't any options to change the size of the icons whatsoever. (Perhaps there's an app to help out, but why waste space?)Anyway, unlike the craptacular Coby Kyros mid 7042, this tablet DOES NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH CRASHING.The customizable options are a little limited however and certain options found in earlier versions of android tablets are nowhere to be found in this one.Apps work really well on this tablet. Apps such as Netflix, Youtube (which is not pre-installed), Angry Birds, Temple Run, Fruit Ninja HD (which is pre-installed), Fish game and others run just fine with the only flaw I can possibly think of being that if you play a game while using a live wallpaper and the screen goes to ""sleep"", once you tap the program again, the screen will be a weird color (equivalent to that of a negative photo), until you do a quick exit and tap the game again to play it. This was minor at best and it wasn't a tablet-breaking experience. This minor quirk also didn't ""freeze"" the tablet or cause it to restart.It's just an excellent firmware with 4.0 plus interface that works as described.Score- 9.5/10Speed-This tablet is really fast. The speed is comparable to the Coby Kyros 4.0 or perhaps even some high end tablets.The only downer is that at times after web pages load, you'll often have to touch the screen an extra time or two because for ""some"" web pages, it has a slight delay. It's really not much to speak of but still worth noting. Games run like a charm. I played Fruit Ninja and it's really fast, the graphics have no lag, there's no input lag or anything.Netflix was slightly different because it needed a little extra time to start, but once it started, I was able to watch movies and shows, exit and re-initialize the program and actually the second time I re-opened Netflix, it loaded slightly faster for some reason. The start up time is somewhere around 20 seconds or less in some cases.Score- 9.8/10Features/toucscreen/Sound-This tablet features Google Play and it's very easy to setup. Basically, if you have a google account (gmail), you'll enter your gmail with password and it syncs. Nothing more needs to be done. In addition to syncing with google, you can also add your regular emails to keep in sync with everything.Personally, I'm not that crazy about Google play and I sort of prefer 1mobilemarket, but in Googleplay, you have all the apps you could possibly ask for with the exception of the few that are signature apps such as Amazon Kindle (my favorite)...This tablet also has a sound recorder, camera/camcorder (yes, you can do skype and such, but the camera is just ok. Make sure you have enough light or at least tweak the camera settings for Skype), it comes with what's called a 2160p pvideo player which actually has really good quality for streaming videos off an SD card or downloaded videos. I haven't tried the music player but there's one pre-installed, it has voice search capability, I'm assuming a GPS/satellite addy that comes with Google play. I have the slightest idea how it works, and it also comes pre-installed with some games.Anything else that you want will have to be downloaded by Googleplay, amazon app or 1mobile etc.Now, onto the touchscreen which I love. It's fast, it's responsive, however, you can't calibrate it. It's no big deal because it's sensitive enough. The only delay you'll have with the touchscreen would be when web pages are loading.One of the odd things about this tablet is actually the screen, because I'm not sure what it's made off, but it isn't slick like the other tablets I own. It feels dry, and it doesn't smudge for me.The sound is good, but it doesn't have an equalizer or any tweaks to boost the volume. You may want to download an app called 'Speakerboost' if you want loud volume. Of course, it sounds great with earphones/headphones or any external speakers.And finally, my cons list-Cons-The first thing I noticed about this tablet was how bright it was. It's extremely bright to the point of calling it slight oversaturation. Similar to if you turn your TV's brightness all the way up. This has no effect on videos but it does bother the battery life.The battery life itself was really bad until I turned the brightness all the way down. (don't worry, it's still going to be bright) and downloaded an app called ""Night Mode"" which helped the battery life. Initially, however, the first few minutes of fiddling around with the tablet, the battery was dying by the minute. I can't estimate how long the battery life is but I've tested it without charging it for the past 2 and a half hours and it's still kicking at around 50 percent and lower. (Keep in mind that initially, I DID NOT download an app to tune the screen brightness)Now that I have that app installed, the battery is quite normal. I'll have to update with an edit to tell everyone the exact battery life.In my opinion however, the Coby Kyros brand has a much better battery life than this tablet. (also, the ac adapter doesn't plug all the way into the jack. It sticks out slightly. It looks weird)Really, that's about the only con I could think of because I really like this tablet. It's fast, it was cheap (62 dollars), the placements are a little on the weird side, but the fact that it's so cheap and is comparable to my high end tablets, I'd definitely recommend buying this. Just keep in mind that the battery life is probably not the greatest, but you really can't beat the features for such a cheap price.Edit- May, 13th, 2013I'm still very happy with my tablet and still stand by my review. I'd definitely buy another one. Anyway...The battery life is variable. It really depends on how bright the screen is and since there's no way to adjust the contrast other than an app extension, I'd estimate it around 3- 3 and a half hours max. (That's considering the fact that Wi-fi is on, sound is used and the device isn't on a charger)The good thing about this tablet is that although the battery life isn't the best, it will charge really fast. (Barely takes 30 minutes to get it near full charge.)I'm actually thinking of having a battery transplant done to this tablet.Also, I had a question e-mailed to me about the date and time display on this tablet. The problem with the date/time is the fact that you have to manually set it. You really shouldn't have to set the time/date being that it's google play ready and the Wi-Fi connection usually takes care of that.Update- (July, 10th, 2013)Tablet is still going strong. I actually used it to play Rockpacalypse and it runs the game good.

"I was a little skeptical about ordering this controller for the PS3. Afterall, about a week prior to this I bought a third party controller from Gamespot (wired) and the lack of precision due to stiff sticks and such drove me up the wall in gaming madness.Anyway, after reading some reviews about this controller, I found that the ratings for this product were mixed or that some people complained about this controller.Here is my take on the controller and a fair comparison alongside an Official Sony DS3 controller.My review-One of the best features about this controller is that it's a SixAxis controller (built in motion, required for some games and compatible with many), it does feature rumble support, a home button and the standard features that are native to Dualshock 3 controllers. It charges about the same speed and actually holds a charge for a pretty long time.The buttons are labeled the same as an Official controller, the only difference being that the buttons (not the symbols) are slightly lighter in color.The only difference I can point out (that's really not much of a difference to note nor hinder performance) would be that the sticks aren't as loose as a standard DS3 controller. It's about slightly less; but the performance is identical.I specifically tested this out on Killzone and it felt just fine to me. I then tested Uncharted and it felt like the real deal.For the price, the quality, the features and performance, this is well worth the money. I picked up a controller for about 13 dollars as opposed to 30-60 dollars for a Sony controller that works the same exact way.I'd definitely buy an extra controller or two, and this is the first third party controller that I've found to have unmatched quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GRX8QQFBKJFG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089TAPFE#wasThisHelpful","R3GRX8QQFBKJFG","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyond the hype of Sony addicts and gamers alike lies a game that should be given a complete review if for no reason less than to note it's place amongst the trilogy. Here's my review-Graphics- 4/5After completing GOW1, 2 and the psp entries as well as playing GOW ascension, I was more than a little curious about the graphics in this game being that they've been overhyped and or touted as the PS3's best.Unfortunately, I didn't think so.While this game does have some good graphics, at times (namely, when fighting Chronos or Hades), there are plenty of parts in this game in which the graphics were dull or jaggy at times. I also felt there were some issues in this game that weren't in the previous GOW titles.For one, I'd jump to land on a platform whilst gliding and was sure I'd land on it but landed way off the target. There's also the fact that Kratos is so small for the majority of the campaign. At times, way too small. Keep in mind that I'm playing this on a 40 inch HDTV with HDMI cables.This game also features way too much Motion Blur and although the framerate is steady most of the game, there are many sections in which it stutters. The motion blur can be a gift or a curse respectively.With that said, I did not find this to be one of PS3's best looking games, although there are several parts worth noting as far as game design is concerned. Some of the bosses are huge and there are some brutal fatalities. The locations seemed just ok in comparison to previous God of War games.The one thing I liked about God of War 3 was the fact that the scale of the game is impressive. For example, fighting the Titan, Chronos, is like fighting an entire level because of his sheer size and I actually did feel very tiny in comparison. But for moments like this, the game engine trickery is to pan the camera out so far whilst making Kratos so tiny that he literally looks like a white blob on an otherwise HUGE boss. I wasn't entirely crazy about the camera panning out so many times throughout the course of the campaign.There are also subtle details included within the game such as splitting open a Centaur's stomach whilst his intestines and entrails spill out, ripping off Helios head while the organs stretch and blood spills everywhere. In short, the gore factor is done in such a fantastic manner. There were also some parts of the game in which there was no difference between the cutscenes and the in-game graphics.God of War 3 is a pretty game for the PS3; but in comparison to games like Uncharted 2, Killzone 2 and the many multiplats available, I'd strongly disagree that it's one of PS3's best; but it certainly isn't one of PS3's worst.Sound- 5/5I have absolutely no complaints in this department. The sound is fantastic. The voice acting is superb. The music while not as good as God of War 1 or 2 wasn't bad at all. I really liked Hepheastus's voice  and Hades' voice was badass all the way.The sound is fantastic.GAMEPLAY- 5/5God of War 3 does nothing too different from the previous games except give you more power, weapons and bosses. My biggest problem in Gow1 was the fact that there weren't enough bosses, however, in 3, there are plenty of bosses ranging from Poseidon, Hades, Hercules, Chronos, Zeus, a Giant Scorpion, Hermes and others.The one thing I didn't like about the enemies was that there was such a limited enemy type featured in this game.Kratos' usual combos are back except now he has better weapons than the previous entires such as Hercules' Cestus, Claws of Hades, Blades of Exile and some electric chain which I didn't care for.Gow3 also features some in game flight missions, possibly the best boss fights in GOW history and a pretty good story. I wasn't particularly fond of the ending being that it was a tad on the cheesy side with that slight Hollywood touch that made me cringe a little. Also, the story doesn't tell you much about Kratos' origin unlike the PSP games, but what it does accomplish is to give you a better insight on why Kratos is so angry, his regrets and deals with his ""finale"" in such an epic way that I loved this game. I couldn't help but think of Dante's Inferno when playing this game, especially during Hades' level.The control is tight and responsive, the graphics are good, the boss fights are epic and this game I feel follows a tried and true tradition of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". To others, this game may appear to be a simple button masher, but to a GOW fan such as myself, this is an awesome experience that isn't to be missed.While it doesn't have cleaner graphics like GOW ascension and it doesn't have the story of GOW1, it is still an excellent offering in the series. I highly recommend buying this game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G3L0PZC3J77Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BBQAEG#wasThisHelpful","R2G3L0PZC3J77Y","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Chances are, if you've actually played Killzone for the PS2 or perhaps even Black for PS2/XBOX there are some striking similarities as far as the FPS engine goes. In this review I'll discuss my take on Timeshift for the Xbox360. Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics in Timeshift are pretty good to be honest. But I felt throughout the course of this game that there was something missing to really propel the graphics beyond just looking pretty good. For example, in first person games, I'd prefer not to just see a floating gun model. But in Timeshift, it's slightly beyond a floating gun model but not much to look like anything beyond the category. At times, I could barely see my characters arm until he reloaded.The gun models are decent in my opinion and especially when you compare it to games like SOF-Payback, COD, Battlefield, Bulletstorm and such. One thing I really, really liked about this game was the enemy's reactions to being killed.Enemies will fall off buildings, roofs, through windows, or tumble over in a more satisfying way rather than just falling. This was reminiscent of games like Black or Killzone (though better than Killzone IMO)...this was easily one of the best graphical features within the game.There are also the time effects which look pretty good.The framerate is very smooth and I didn't have problems with any hiccups during gameplay; at least nothing major.Overall, the graphics are good, but could've been much better. I felt that the enemies looked a bit too generic, the gun models were passable, the backgrounds were pretty good, but man is this game dark in the beginning,Sound-The sound in this game is a mixed bag. On one hand, I can say that I liked some of the sound effects and on the other hand, there's no way to actually equalize the sound to hear the speech clearly in a coherent manner. At times, a character would try telling me something only for his voice to be drowned out by the overpowering ambient volume. To make matters worse, there's no way of adjusting the volume in any way that's beneficial. This was the game's low point IMO.Gameplay-At first, I thought the concept of using time in a FPS was a wasted concept in the genre, however, this is where the game shines. You don't HAVE TO USE THEM unless you have to solve some obvious puzzles or perhaps slow down the pace of action only to steal an enemy's weapon and or take out an entire group of enemies without them knowing what happened. This was a cool concept, but is far from what I'd like to play in this game.The story is a bit on the dull side and honestly, I didn't bother with it much being that the cutscenes just didn't quite have that ""oomph"" factor.I did like solving certain puzzles using time powers and the gunfights are nicely done.One thing that was not good in this game would be the fact that there's no way to run which is a standard set by BF, COD and such. There's also not much of a selection in guns to choose from even though this is the future. Nothing is being done with weapons in this game that any other game has done; which is a good thing in my opinion. I could care less about using high tech lasers or scopes on every gun and thankfully, the game doesn't feature much of that.Timeshift also features a number of vehicles which makes the game feel Halo-esque and the game itself lasts quite a while beyond the usual 6 hour FPS's available.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this as a buy. It's very cheap and is worthy of being in your 360 library.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY2UISXMPQAF3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H94PVO#wasThisHelpful","RY2UISXMPQAF3","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This game is a big improvement over the previous UFC games released for the 360/PS3; but I question why UFC 3 wasn't UFC 2 undisputed.The game features a huge roster, more weight classes, more fighting moves, smarter AI, a better career mode, a more polished look and tons of unlockables as well as the all-new Pride Mode.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics are a bit more polished while the game itself features the same engine from UFC Undisputed 2009. While this isn't a bad thing, why not just update the entire game model appearance altogether?Sadly, THQ shoveled the same looking game to us and polished it a bit more. The frame rate is smoother, the fighters sport newer clothing, but one of the best updates to the game's graphical engine would be the cuts and bruises now actually look like actual cuts and bruises. Whenever you get a mouse around the eye  or if your head's split open, it really shows. When fighters bleed, they tend to bleed more frequently. However, after a round ends and they're back in the ring, they look a bit dolled up and the cuts seems to not be as significant no matter how bad they were. This is not always the case being that you can really make your fighter look nasty looking with severe swelling and cuts.Another update would be the camera, which seems a little better in my honest opinion. In addition to all the obvious improvements, the collision detection is much better in comparison to the the last UFC Undisputed game. (which I'm not a fan of)The Pride fighters roster looks pretty good and I loved the Pride arenas.With that said, my biggest gripe about this game is probably the replay. When you pound an opponents head brutally or submit them, the replay doesn't show any of this at all. It's the same slow replay that's been force fed the past two games which could show major improvement. The game still does look quite nice.Sound-I liked the commentary a lot better in this game than the last two. It seems much better paced and not so clunky. While Undisputed 1 and 2 had issues with commentary halting prematurely or just too much talking, the commentary in UFC 3 feels more natural. The sound effects aren't good and still sounds too ""light and fluffy"", but the music is pretty good.Gameplay-Here's where the game shines.The roster is huge; and I do mean huge. You also get new weight classes such as Bantamweight and Featherweight which include fighters like Dominic Cruz, Mighty Mouse, Kid Yamamoto, Renan Berao and others.There's also Pride Mode featuring legends like Mark Hunt, Bob Sapp, Henderson and such. Unfortunately, the Pride roster could've been deeper with more weight classes and fighters but it's the least evolved half of the game. I did like the fact that in Pride Mode you can hear Jenne Hardt aka the Crazy Pride lady announcer and you also get Pride rules and Pride arenas so it really is a separate mode altogether. The options are also updated in both modes.The control is smooth and responsive, you can even cancel moves mid arm/leg. But the biggest and best feature to this game would be the fact that fights last longer and the AI is much better. The fights aren't so robotic or stiff feeling especially since you're given newer transitional moves, fighting moves and positions. Basically, this boils down to a smoother and more authentic fighting experience being that you're able to ground and pound in different ways or do new takedowns.The system itself takes a few notes from EA's MMA game that was released although not quite as deep.Skipping beyond the fighting system, there's the career mode which I actually like a lot more than the previous games as well. You actually get ranked  and there's a win/loss system that actually does hinder or help your progress. You can also go up in weight class or lower depending on your weight class. Obviously, if you're a bantamweight, you can't go any lower in this game. In career mode, you'll fight your way through organizations be it pride, ufc, AFA and so on and the difficulty actually depends on what's recommended for you after the short length tutorial which isn't as punishing as the previous games thanks to better control. This career mode actually feels like you can play it any way you want to. Unfortunately, I didn't make a C.A.F so I used a roster fighter, therefore, I wouldn't know how deep the CAF is.In addition to Career mode, there's also Event mode, Ultimate Fights mode, Pride Mode and XboxLive. The online is this game is not good and with the AI being much better than the previous games, I could care less.The gameplay is really good, but I do have a few gripes, namely, about the roster itself.The heavyweight roster seems so bare. Featuring less fighters. The Pride Roster is too small despite unlockables and DLC. I'd of really liked to see a few more heavyweights than the ones featured. The good part is, this game does feature fighters like Melvin Guillard, Alistair Overeem and such who were absent from past UFC games or even DLC.Overall, I want to give this game 5 stars but a new engine would've been better than just a big update and honestly, everything done in this game could've been done in the second game which would've made this game even better. As far as UFC is concerned right now, this is the best UFC game to date and is definitely worth a buy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SSCJ74AIM8VU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053BSNZU#wasThisHelpful","R2SSCJ74AIM8VU","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought Wheel of Fortune for the Xbox 360, after trying the demo out 2 months prior. Here are my thoughts in this honest review.Graphics-Certainly while this game isn't going to win any awards for graphics, the graphics are still really good for a game like this.The show hosts look exactly like the real Pat and Vanna, the gameshow board and wheel are spot on and the many different arenas you're able to select look quite good. The characters themselves are more ""big head style"" with huge heads on a smaller body.The menu interface looks nice and is reminiscent of a tablet game interface rather than a true console game interface.My only complaint would be that at certain times the character you choose will drop framerate slightly which is silly considering this game pushes nothing to hamper it on a 360. That's about it.Sound-The sound's really good and identical to the show. You not only get the hosts full speech and grunts and groans from characters, but you get the backup announcer whom tells you about the prize you could win. The music is limited, but it does feature some nice jazz that's short lived; unfortunately. One gripe I have about the sound would be no background music. I'd of preferred a light tune in the background to make it seem more lively; but the crowd does chip in quite a bit to make it sound better. Not bad.Gameplay-There's nothing much to speak of in terms of gameplay being that WOF is a ""fill in the hidden letter"" game that gives you the ability to spell out the word. You're also given a good amount of time to solve each puzzle being that this game doesn't have Kinect support; but probably features keyboard support.One of the first things I noticed about this game from the beginning was just how easy it is to earn achievements. Literally, in the first five minutes of gaming, you're likely to earn 10 achievements alone and that's not counting the completion of one game. Basically, if you play this game long enough, you'll earn all the achievements.The difficulty can be quite a pickle at times and some of the answers had me saying ""what the heck was that?"" altogether.In addition to winning games, you can also choose prizes which range from  new arenas, concept art, props, clothes and such. You can also customize the character you want to use or just use your Xbox live avatar.This game supports up to 3 players.Overall, for the current price it's going for, it's not a bad buy, but I'd prefer buying this at around 9.99 to be honest. This is actually a pretty good game offering some good gameplay that is easy to get into, and is a godsend considering the other ""bare bones"" gameshow games like Family Feud Decades for the Wii. (which was a disaster)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GD9RZVV2X9FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090PX7W4#wasThisHelpful","R2GD9RZVV2X9FS","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first played Arkham Asylum and beat the game whilst collecting all the Riddler trophies and thoroughly enjoying the story mode and challenges, I felt like I actually wanted more Batman than what was offered. In any case, Arkham Asylum was an excellent game which should be owned by any Batman fan. (Alongside Batman Begins for the PS2/Xbox) But what's even better is Batman Arkham City. Here's my review.Graphics-The graphics look a little better than Arkham Asylum; but not by much. If anything, AC looks darker and grittier than AA and also, the color seems to have much richer detail; especially if you're using an HDMI cable. But perhaps the biggest difference between Arkham City and Arkham Asylum would be the fact that Arkham City is an open world game in which you get to openly explore Arkham and it's a pretty big city.The game is not just limited to Arkham however, for example, you'll get a chance to go to Ras a Ghul's demon realm which is a big wasteland full of sand and rocky cliffs with erupting lava and it looks fantastic. It easily looks better than the Scarecrow's nightmare realm in the last game. The game's menu interface looks really cool as well and you can tell the production value was high on this game. To make things even better is the frame rate is silky smooth with no graphical hiccups that I can speak of that are game breaking.With that said, the one complaint I have about this game would be the fact that most of the bad guys are simply clones and not varied enough. Fortunately, this is only applied to the minor bad guys while the main bad guys like Clayface, Joker, Ras a Ghul or Riddler are nice to look at. A minor gripe of mine would be just how dark this game is. I mean, it's really dark and if you lighten it too much that brightness will oversaturate the graphics with too much brightness. This causes most of the game to be done in detective mode instead of enjoying the actual scenery. Other than that, it looks fantastic.Sound-The voice acting in this game is really good, especially when you encounter the Joker or Harley. I found Bane to be the only villain that wasn't particularly voiced well. I really loved the soundtrack to this game. There are certain battles that feature the main theme and it feels extremely badass. I only wish some of the sound effects weren't limited to thuds and muffled smacks. But even the sound effects were really good.Gameplay-Here's the meat of the game. The gameplay in Arkham City is good. Not just good; but excellent. First off, the fighting system is nearly the same as AA only the system's been polished quite a bit. You get more moves, more gadgets and new ways of taking out enemies and most importantly, there are a ton of bad guys. In Arkham Asylum, one of my biggest complaints was the fact that there wasn't enough enemies or bosses. Now in Arkham City, that complaint is a thing of the past. Not only are there more enemies, but the enemies are harder, smarter and take a lot more damage. Taking down a group of bad guys is not easy and if you intend on button mashing, then prepare to lose a lot. Even on normal this game will be quite challenging.The hardest battles are when you find yourself surrounded by thugs and a few thugs have guns or perhaps there's an area full of Snipers.The one thing Arkham City does manage to do well is challenge you to use wit and devise a plan in battle.The story mode is much better. It includes lots of side missions that feel natural and somewhat of an extension to the story mode. For example, no matter what you do in AC, the writing and execution of the side missions are still relative to the main story which really adds a ton of replay value to this game unlike Arkham Asylum which featured only the Riddler trophies and minor side quests.In addition to playing as Batman you can also play as Catwoman. Speaking of Catwoman, there are a lot of Cameo appearances that turn into actual encounters  by villains like Bane, Two Face, Riddler, The Identity Theft, Croc and others.This game takes a long time to complete and there are plenty of cool unlockables.Overall, Arkham City took everything ""bad"" (if you can call it that) about AA and polished it whilst giving you an entire new experience. You can literally traverse the entire city of Arkham and take on any mission at any time while enjoying the game for what it is- An instant classic.The only bummer about this game would be that the ending was somewhat of a cliffhanger, but there's supposed to be a third Batman game that will make news this year or perhaps next year. (I think it will be 2013 though)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13STXQ54LVACO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002I0JAVK#wasThisHelpful","R13STXQ54LVACO","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before writing this review, I'd like to note that I did not purchase the previous Sherlock Holmes Vs Jack the ripper game, therefore, I can't compare the two. With that said, here's my review-Graphics-While I actually like this game a lot; the graphics are not good at all. The graphics aren't even average to be honest, but there are some parts of the game that look a lot better than the majority of the game.The in game characters look fine as far as the main characters are concerned, but then there are characters that either look identical to another in a different outfit, or, the lesser know characters just don't look good at all. Most of the backgrounds aren't much to yelp about either, and although they're not bad looking, there are certain aspects about the backgrounds that ruin the experience for me. Namely and for example, sometimes grass or plants look too green and at times there's a good amount of screen tearing or graphical bugs.Speaking of bugs, one of the worst graphical bugs would be getting stuck in front of an open door which happened to me at least 6-8 times. Other bugs included Watson blocking my path one too many times.Some of the backgrounds looked good such as the Cemetery in Whitechapel or the cobblestone path of the Whitechapel district and of course, Sherlock Holmes office which has a fine amount of detail. I often wondered why the rest of the game didn't look like this. The graphics had potential, but I feel it wasn't given enough of anything to make it more than a below average looking game for the 360.Sound-I love the sound of this game. The background music is suitable for games like this, but the voice acting is excellent. At times, the dialogue can be funny with Sherlock and Watson wisecracking one another, but if there was one thing that got on my nerves in this game would be the sound of the footsteps. The footstep sound effects are loud, and I mean extremely loud. Luckily, you can turn down the sound effects.Gameplay-Here's where the review becomes a mixed review. I like this game, however, I don't particularly care for most of the puzzle elements.The Testament of Sherlock is somewhat like L.A Noire, except without fighting or gunplay. Instead, you progress the game based on pure wit. The small number of action sequences are few and far between if any to be honest. With that said, the game is very engaging and easily sucks up a few hours per play.Sherlock has the ability to use all detective abilities including the help of his partner Watson and his dog, Toby. I have to admit that it felt fun to actually wonder where or who the villain was and every time I got close to figuring out who the killer was or what situation I'd analyze, the trail went cold or the villain was that much craftier.The best part about this game would be the fact that you weren't given the L.A Noire style interrogation by questioning. L.A noire seemed never to have a good answer or a useful answer, with this game, it's a much different ball game.This is what I liked about the game. Now, onto my gripes-With so much mystery and puzzles packed in this game, I'd have to say that the puzzles or clue gathering could be very frustrating most of the time. Not because it isn't supposed to be hard, but because something is hidden somewhere right under your nose and you've little to no clue about how to find it or what to do next.The puzzles themselves are very hard at times. But luckily, the game gives you an option to skip puzzles based on how close you are to completing them or how long you're puzzled. (No pun intended) I caught myself often saying ""WTF, I already looked there/WTF, I already tried that and it didn't work but now it does...really?"".Then, there's Sherlock Holmes Deduction pad in which you'll have to piece together facts in order to conclude this or that...these parts were easily some of the most frustrating parts of the entire game and I didn't care for them at all. Often, I found that solving these parts seemed as if I solved them prior or at least something eerily similar.With all that said, this game is pretty good. Unfortunately, in this day and age there are so few of these game types.This is also a pretty long game. Solving anything takes a good chunk of time. This is not a short game.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SKB6LGHCNG8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0087Y3M5G#wasThisHelpful","R3SKB6LGHCNG8U","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being that I'm collecting each SVR game for the PS2, I recently purchased this game from Amazon even though I own the xbox360 version. Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics are actually good for this game and it seems like the character models are a lot bigger than before which is good; but also bad. One of the main issues I had with this game would be the inaccurate sizes of featured wrestlers.For example, I made a match ""Batista Vs. Big Daddy V"" and at first, I thought ""Big daddy V looks big""...that was until he actually got in the ring with Batista who was even bigger and taller which is not true.Big Daddy V towers at nearly 6'8"" or 6'9"" while Batista is around 6'4""/6'5"". The weight difference between these two are huge with Big Daddy V being around 550lbs or better while Batista is around 280lbs...but you wouldn't think so if you picked a match with these two in the game. Not only is Batista taller, but he also looks physically heavier. The 360 version does not have these quirks.Another issue would be Mark Henry, who looks about 250lbs at max on this game. THQ took the exact same Mark Henry Model from SVR 2008, polished it a bit and put it in this game. Unacceptable.With that said, the animations are updated and the characters move a lot smoother. In fact, I'd say around 90 percent of the roster really look life like while the rest have their issues. But in comparison to games like SVR 2006, SVR, or even HCTP, this game just feels like a polished version of SVR 2008 which isn't saying much.Overall, the graphics are good but questionable.Sound-The sound is good. Every theme is accurate, however, the sound effects are a bit on the dull side. You'll hear more dull thuds rather than hard bangs on the mat. The crowd is decent at best. One thing that I found weird as with the previously released SVR 2007 and 2008 would be how the crowd halts to dead silence during a pinfall. It's really awkward.Gameplay-SVR 2009 introduces the ""Inferno Match"", an updated grappling system with chain grappling and a pretty good roster. In fact, I'll speak of the roster first.While I wouldn't consider it the best roster in a WWE game; it is a step up from the awful SVR 2008. The roster features the following-Jeff Hardy, Ric Flair, Triple H, Cade and Murdoch, Kane, Boogeyman, Undertaker, HBK, John Cena, CM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Great Khali, Umaga, the return of Chris Jericho, Edge, Elijah Burke (aka The pope D'angelo Dinero), Finlay, Big Show, John Morrison, Mark Henry, Big Daddy V, Batista, The Miz, Randy Orton etc.here are some hidden wrestlers as well, but if I'm right, the roster's about 50 plus wrestlers.The match types are the usual pick and the fact that the Inferno Match was tossed in seems a bit on the lazy side. What about King of the Ring or 3 way tag elimination matches?I suppose I can't complain too much because the amount of matches you're able to make/choose on this game are vast. Everything from Elimination Chamber, Royal Rumble, Hell in a Cell, Ladder, TLC, Hardcore, 1-ON-1, triple threat, fatal four way, six man tag, falls count anywhere, Cage match, Handicap etc etc.The actual gameplay borrows a note from SVR 2008 with the grapple system but ups the ante a bit being that the engine feels a bit smoother. The grapple system itself is mapped to the analog sticks and modified with the triggers. The AI is a lot better in this installment unlike 2008 with it's ""way too easy"" matches. But if you at least want to have a decent match in this game, boosting the difficulty all the way up and adjusting the AI actions proves to be useful.Overall, I recommend this game for the simple fact that it has a good roster, smooth control and a slew of matches. The xbox version is far better but the PS2 version isn't bad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7X0V309ODKSH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00175GC4K#wasThisHelpful","R7X0V309ODKSH","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've reviewed jewelry before and to my surprise this ring was much better than I'd anticipated.The turtles on this ring are small, but not too small. Not gawdy looking. The silver is really shiny and arrived in a small ring box with a cushioned bottom whilst the ring was actually in a small separate bag. Anyway, for the price this ring actually has really good quality. The silver is sturdy, the rhodium finish makes it look nice and shiny and the actual weight of the ring was good. It wasn't lightweight. Actually, the ring that you see as the description doesn't exactly describe this ring well. It looks much better.I highly recommend this ring for any turtle lover or for anyone looking for a ""bang for the buck"" purchase. I really liked the box it came in as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R159G4UGJ15H29/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007QS6FLM#wasThisHelpful","R159G4UGJ15H29","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought SDHCTP, and although I've played it in the past, I'm still going to stick with my opinion of it being a good wrestling game, but nowhere near the best.Here's my review-Graphics-I have mixed feelings about the graphics in this game being that this game has a smooth framerate, crisp textures for wrestler models and arenas and definitely looks better than previous Smackdown games, and then, I compare it against the likes of Day of Reckoning and find that D.O.R looks better than HCTP and that HCTP does have some interesting graphical quirks.For example, Kane's face from a side view looks very odd looking. His nose is almost witch-like and while he has some detail for his face, he's lacking the essentials to be considered ""life like"". In fact, HCTP sports a more cartoonish look in the form of smooth polygonal models much like DOR except not as good.With that said, I enjoyed the in game menus and presentation, and HCTP does have some redeeming graphical qualities worthy of praise.One thing I didn't like about HCTP would be some entrances which didn't look that impressive. For example, Scott Steiner's entrance is terrible and his ""muscles"" just look like bags of air with flat textured veins all over them. His face is also very awkward looking as are most wrestlers during the intros.Other than that, HCTP looks good.Sound-One thing I didn't like about HCTP would be that it featured no commentary. While this isn't a big deal, it does feel a little strange if you turn the music down  leaving the sound effects way too loud. Occasionally, the crowd will chant, but it sounds really cheap and will probably last about three chants at best. I found that weird. The background music is actually pretty good and I believe it's also featured in Wrestlemania 19 for the Gamecube, except this game features probably a few more tracks.Gameplay-Easily the best part about Here comes the pain would be it's gameplay, it's roster and the fact it was the first game to introduce the elimination chamber.First, let's talk about the roster-The roster in this game is similar to Wrestlemania 19's for the Gamecube, but features some wrestlers not found in WM19 alongside a good number of legends. The roster features-Rodney Mack, Scott Steiner, Test, The Hurricane, George ""the animal"" Steele, The Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff, Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane, Jazz, Big Show, Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin, Kurt Angle amongst others.The roster is extensive, there are plenty of unlockables and it's impressive to say the least. The last game to feature a roster this big before HCTP would be WWF No Mercy for the N64. Also, this is the first Smackdown game to feature full entrances. (even though most are partially clipped)The gameplay of HCTP is strikingly similar to that of Day of Reckoning except faster with better control thanks to PS2's dualshock controller vs. The gamecube controller. (which is better for platformers and racing games)I really didn't find anything revolutionary in HCTP besides the fact that it's a fast and frantic wrestling game with accurate finishing moves. The computer gives you a decent match on normal but is much better on higher difficulties. (Unlike WWE12/13)Royal Rumble mode is equal to that of Day of Reckoning but faster. The elimination chamber match is great.One thing I particularly liked about this game would be that the controls are perfect. You can have a high paced match with lots of things going on at once without mashing buttons or pulling off silly combinations. The control scheme is simple and straight to the point. I wish games could be like this nowadays, but unfortunately, THQ went nuts with analog stick grapple control schemes. Hopefully, the next third party company making the next WWE game will completely tweak or perhaps revamp this control scheme.In addition to the great control, excellent roster and graphics, there's CAW mode which is very deep. You're able to do whatever you want in CAW mode, but in the end, don't expect highly realistic looking wrestlers more than you'd expect cartoonish wrestler models detailed to your liking.HCTP is not a bad wrestling game, but is in no way like I've heard it was supposed to be and or the greatest wrestling game of all time. In fact, Smackdown Vs Raw (the first one) is superior to this game in many ways from the amount of moves, graphics and control. Still, this is not a bad wrestling game at all, but being that I own almost every wrestling game to date, I feel as if most people haven't played games like Day of Reckoning for the Gamecube to understand that this game is eerily similar to it and offers nothing more than the fast paced, arcade style wrestling which is lacking in many games. If you happen to buy HCTP, at least treat yourself to SVR (the first one) and compare. You'll see exactly what I'm talking about. This game still ranks high in my opinion.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTNU8D0TC88WU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000AHOOK#wasThisHelpful","RTNU8D0TC88WU","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Before I begin this review, I'm not going to pick on anyone else's review on Amazon, but I will state that this is my personal opinion of the abomination that is Wrestlemania X8.Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics for this game aren't the best; and there's no excuse being that the majority of Gamecube games have excellent graphics. Still, I'm at least able to say the wrestler models are smooth, and the framerate is consistent, but man o' man are the graphics buggy and collision detection is truly crap. In fact, most wrestlers lack detail altogether and look about as generic as possible. The arenas themselves are decent at best and looks very crisp with clean textures, however, the crowd looks about as bad as it can get which would be a giant block of humanity flattened and displayed at 2-frame loops.Nothing special to talk about here. The wrestlers don't sell moves, generally do not look hurt and aren't exactly too accurate in size. Generic, boring graphics galore.Sound-One redeeming quality of Wrestlemania X8 would be the sound...and that's as far as music goes because the sound effects are muffled and bad. The music is really good. Each theme is accurate and a lot better than I anticipated. Just don't expect much when you hit a wrestler or slam them other than a light slapping noise or a muffled thud.There's no commentary which really sucks. I often wondered why WWE games for Gamecube couldn't have commentary when Ultimate Muscle- Legends vs new generation for Gamecube does.Gameplay-Here's the really bad part, as if the sound and graphics weren't bad enough, in comes the incredibly boring gameplay.Westlemania X8 does feature a decent enough roster, but the moves are limited and that's the main problem with this game. The movesets given to each wrestler is about 5 or so moves, a finisher, running attacks, standing attacks and some ground attacks. On paper, this wouldn't be bad, but considering every wrestler has the same bodyslam, suplex, as well as other moves shows just how much this game truly sucks. Even the smaller wrestlers movesets are about the same with minor exceptions.The match types wouldn't be bad if this game was better. You get single, tag team, TLC, Hell in a Cell, Cage, Rumble, Handicap and some other match types.The roster could've been really good, but the graphics are so bad that I could truly care less who's featured in this game. The roster consists of- The Hardy Boys, Rob Van Dam, Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Stone cold steve austin, Triple H, Undertaker, Kane and a few others. There are about 40 some odd wrestlers plus some unlockables. But the one thing that truly pissed me off was the fact that this game had the NWO in it and is such a crappy game. I can't stress it any more how much you should stay away from this game. Bad controls, collision detection problems, bad graphics, limited engine, and so many more screwups makes this title only worth owning if you intend on buying the entire series of wrestling games like myself. If you're a collector, get it, if not avoid this one. It's literally the worst wrestling game of the 6th gen and possibly ever ranking alongside such failures like WCW Nitro, WCW thunder and the abysmal WCW BACKSTAGE Assault.WCW Vs. The World for the N64 is a helluva lot better than this game in every way and that's a wrestling game that's 4 years away from being 20 years old. Terrible.","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14IANJAUV161U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000631WE#wasThisHelpful","R14IANJAUV161U","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought Bulletstorm from Amazon; and are very impressed with this game. Excellent graphics, top notch control, good dialogue and WTF moments with a creative killing system makes this title a must own. Here's my review-Graphics-The graphics in this game are fantastic with some exceptions. Epic uses the Unreal engine for this game if I'm correct. The backgrounds are reminiscent of Gears of War but with much more color though less draw distance perhaps. The gun models look good, each enemy has detail, though at times, I noticed some texture pop in issues on certain levels. One enemy I killed just lay down looking very muddy looking and lacking detail altogether. This didn't happen too often but it did happen quite enough to notice. There's also some issues with texture pop in at times with the ground which looks really bad. But again, it doesn't happen that often.Aside from those minor gripes, the graphics are excellent.I especially liked those ""WTF"" moments in which you'll see a gigantic creature chase you that's so big it's head can swallow a ship. I'd couple this alongside the likes of Gears of War two in delivering huge bosses.The visuals are sharp and crisp looking and when shooting an enemy, the graphics have tons of impact that make you feel as if your gun has a load of firepower. There's also the character models which look fantastic. The cutscenes are a little less than the in-game graphics and the framerate is noticeably lower; but that's just the cutscenes.The in game framerate is silky smooth and I didn't run into any hiccups. Overall, just a really good looking game and could easily be mistaken for an exclusive title.Sound-I really loved the sound. Kicking someone over a cliff will result in ""ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh"" with the actually space of the sound lessening as they drop lower. This game has suggestive dialogue and lots of sexual dialogue littered with lots of curse words ranging from the F bomb, MF bomb, and again, sexual dialogue.The guns sound good. I particularly liked the sound of the shot gun. Also, explosions sound really good as well.The storyline dialogue is fantastic and believable. There's no real music to speak of other than at times some 70's funk will pop up when you enter a club. No complaints in this department.Gameplay-Bulletstorm challenges your ability to kill creatively. I have to admit that before buying this game, I was unsure of a FPS that isn't Battlefield, COD, Operation Flashpoint or Arma etc. But this game has a really creative gimmick that works.In Bulletstorm, you use something called a Leash which looks like a laser whip thingy. It acts like Scorpion's harpoon from Mortal Kombat in the way it pulls an enemy to you. You're also given the ability to kick which works very well. The gunplay mechanics is smooth and I haven't had any issues with aiming.The best part about Bulletstorm is that if you happen to die in game, it's not because you didn't have enough skill, but rather that the Cpu was more skilled. I like the fact that it doesn't have cheap deaths.The campaign is fantastic. I really loved the story and this game definitely has that Gears of War feel to it.Unfortunately, that's all you'll enjoy in this game because the multiplayer is not good and is very limited.Other than that, you have one of the best FPS's in bulletstorm. This game is a must buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73A4CVRQJ52I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004WYTUCO#wasThisHelpful","R73A4CVRQJ52I","A2G44NES0MQOAC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2G44NES0MQOAC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this primarily to use as a phone holder in the car/truck, but it has come in handy in a couple other ways as well.My phone, a Samsung Galaxy Note II, makes a perfect GPS unit in the car or truck.  The jaws of the phone holder open wide and grab your phone (or GPS unit, or what have you) in a secure-but-gentle grip.The neck is a little stiff, but once you have it adjusted the way you want it, it stays.For use in autos, the gooseneck arm is a convenient length for mounting on the passenger's side or in the center; it can be angled as needed.Finding a place to clamp it on can be a challenge — a c-clamp or something along those lines on the non-phone end might serve a little better (though it would be less convenient in other settings).  This is a problem that one can easily work around, though, with a little planning and ingenuity.Pro tip for automotive use: before adding your phone, clamp the gooseneck on to your vehicle,  figure out how you want to bend it, then take it off and use both hands to shape the neck accordingly — *then* mount it and pop your phone in.I've also used the gooseneck clamp to attach my phone to a kitchen cabinet so I could keep a recipe at eye-level while cooking and to attach my phone (in a plastic bag) to a sliding tub door for reading Kindle books while soaking in the tub.I see strong possibilities, here, for fixing my phone up in a good spot and using it to read instructions or watch how-to videos while working on bikes.  I think it should also serve as an impromptu tripod for recording ballet rehearsals or watching technique and practice videos.It's really nice to no longer have to juggle my phone and anything else I might handle as passenger on long  drives.I haven't tried to suction-cup clamp yet, but it seems well-made and will probably be more convenient for use from the driver's seat.Mine came with phone clamp assemblies on both units, by the way — no need to use only one at a time, or transfer the phone clip back and forth.Details:Construction — 8/10, possibly 9/10Convenience — 8/10Versatility — 10/10Value — 10/10","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HZ1ONSZXK504/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0126JQ9G6#wasThisHelpful","R3HZ1ONSZXK504","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've bought two pairs of these trousers, and in some ways they're as unlike as apples and oranges.The first pair was a solid, heavy cotton twill similar to what you might find in a pair of casual khakis; the second a much lighter fabric more closely resembling the fabric one might expect in summer-weight dress trousers.  Both have nice drape and a smooth hand, but the inconsistency in materials is a little troubling.Both had similar fit characteristics -- slim cut through the calves and lower thighs, with a much-roomier fit in the upper thighs and buttocks.  However, the calves of the second pair were significantly slimmer than those on the first pair, which creates a profile that's tapered at the bottom and rather blousy at the top.  I loved the cut of the first pair (which proved ideal for someone like me, a dancer with the attendant fit difficulties that result from highly-developed thighs and gluteals), but found the second unflattering.Construction and finish on both pairs were pretty nice.  The fabric of the first pair has faded a bit with washing, but is still a nice chocolate brown that works well in many settings.  The second pair has only been worn and washed a couple of times, so it's hard to say how it will hold up over time.At 152 pounds/68 kg, I'm now too slim for both of my pairs of these trousers, though my husband is able to wear them.  I may buy another pair, but I'm honestly on the fence.  If I could be certain that they'd fit as well as the first pair did, I'd buy them in a heartbeat, but the inconsistency keeps me from pulling the trigger.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J6TT0TRTDF2C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PI2IHMS#wasThisHelpful","R1J6TT0TRTDF2C","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these to use with a costume -- at the price, I figured that if they held up for a couple of outings, they'd have done their job.It turns out that they're actually pretty well-made and surprisingly practical for use in ballet class.  They fit well (my calves are not small, by the way -- at their widest point, they're about 15""/38cm), stay up, and don't get in the way.  They've held up well through their first couple of cold-water machine washes (color has remained bright; they don't seem to shrink) and have now survived a trip to Black Rock Desert, which speaks well of their quality.These are thinner than my previous leg warmers, which I made from recycled wool sweater arms, so they're a sound option for most classes, though I plan to continue using the thick wool leg warmers on really cold winter days.My only complaint is that these get pretty fuzzy with use and will probably pill.  That's not the end of the world, though.It's hard to say how these will endure over the long run, but I'm quite satisfied with them at the price I paid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11JQZ2GEZOJ0A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BRBMTC#wasThisHelpful","R11JQZ2GEZOJ0A","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update first!I brought these to Burning Man this year.  Once I broke them out, I pretty much never wore anything else.  They wipe clean, they held up beautifully in the alkaline dust, and they looked great.  Everyone loved them.I expected to need arch supports with them, but forgot to bring them.  My feet held up all right, though they were sometimes very sore at the end of the day.  I wouldn't want to wear these (or any other high-heeled shoe) on a daily basis year round, but for one week a year, they're fine.On colder nights in the desert, I very much appreciated the extra width so I could wear extra-thick socks.  Walking was no problem even in uneven footing or pockets of deep dust.  Being 2"" taller than usual didn't hurt, either!  ;)They also came in handy as part of the most ridiculous post-modern gladiator costume ever conceived, but that's neither here nor there.I liked these so much that I think I'm going to order a second pair for clubbing.  I left my original pair in our camp's year-round storage so I won't have to schlep them back and forth to the desert.BTW, for travel, wrapping the buckles in plastic wrap did the job beautifully.  I carried these shoes in my small carry-on bag along with a bunch of other random stuff, and they came through in perfect shape.Back to the original review:Full disclosure: I'm a guy, a dancer with the attendant high arches/flexible feet going on, and not a regular wearer of high-heeled shoes, chunky or otherwise.  Thus, your mileage may vary significantly.Onward!  I bought these to wear with costumes and so forth, and I've never really owned anything similar, so I don't have much direct basis for comparison in terms of comfort and so forth.  That said, I'll do my best.Appearance and Materials:These are simply really cute shoes.  They look quite a bit better than I expected them to, in fact.The color of the plastic stuff the shoes are made from is quite a bit darker than you might guess based on the picture, but as another reviewer mentioned, that's actually a good thing -- the shoes look great, and the sparkly stuff (which is safely contained inside the plastic) really shines.The buckles do, as often mentioned, seem pretty cheesy.  Considering that these shoes cost me fourteen bucks through Prime, I really can't complain about that.  A previous reviewer posted an effective fix; I plan to employ that if the buckles give up the ghost.  Also, if you're traveling with them packed, you might want to wrap some plastic wrap around the buckles to prevent them from snagging on things.Be warned that the shoes might smell weird (mine did!) when they first arrive (ironically, mine are stamped ""Natural Breeze"" on the inside of the foot bed -- ""I do not think that word means what you think that it means..."").  Let them breathe for a couple of days, and the smell will dissipate.Fit, Comfort, and Arch Support (or Complete Lack Thereof):I wear a European size 40 - 41, so I ordered a US 10, and the fore-aft fit is spot on.I was also pleased with the width, which is pretty good (in addition to being weird, my feet are narrow).  I could use one more hole on the strap for barefoot wear or with really thin socks; with normal to thick socks, these would be about perfect.I thought the plastic footbed would feel weird, but to be honest, I pretty much forgot about it after the first few minutes.  I wore these around my house for several hours the day they arrived, then again the next day; they definitely behave as you might expect plastic shoes to behave when you accidentally dump water in them, but they're really basically pretty comfortable.That said, unless you have really flat feet, do not expect these shoes to come anywhere near your arches.  If you've got high arches, expect to feel contact at the heelbone and the balls of your feet and basically nowhere else.  It may wind up looking a bit odd, but I'm definitely going to wear these with arch supports in them.  I'd rather look a little weird than risk screwing up my feet.As it stands, I can wear them fairly comfortably for a couple hours, then not terribly uncomfortably for a couple more, but eventually my feet start to hurt.  I have pretty strong feet, so that's probably worth noting, but the closest thing I've worn in terms of heel-to-toe ratio has been a pair Iron Age work wellingtons with pretty substantial heels.  That said, those were the most comfortable boots I ever owned, so that might also be worth noting.Oh: walking in these is also no big deal.  I expected to feel like I was going to fall over and kill myself, especially going down the stairs, but I didn't feel that way at all.  Even if you tend, as I do, to a mid-foot stride, you'll probably be fine in these shoes.  Performance may vary on uneven surfaces, though.  I'll find out next week.So there you have it.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with these shoes -- they look nice, seem pretty well-made, and aren't horribly uncomfortable.  Flimsy buckles and lack of arch support can be compensated for as needed.I'll try to get a picture added ASAP, maybe with socks on so you don't have to look at my snaggly toenails.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AAX1EL43S1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZYJ48ZA#wasThisHelpful","R9AAX1EL43S1I","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very pleasantly surprised by these.  I didn't expect much, but the price was right, so I figured I'd give them a try.  In fact, the quality of both materials and workmanship seems really solid.  The nylon parts are not paper-thin, but in fact quite substantial; the mesh, too, looks like it's going to hold up to a lot of use.  Zippers open and close easily (which is saying something, because for all my apparent dexterity, I am severely zipper-impaired).The sizes are about perfect -- I can fit all three in my rolling carry-on (which, to be fair, is close to the size limit for carry-on luggage).It's nice to be able to keep all my stuff organized, particularly when I'm traveling with a bunch of ballet stuff and costume stuff and also trying to shove some normal clothes in somewhere.Little handles on the sides make it easy to grab whichever packing cube you want and sling it onto the nearest flat surface for ease of access.I look forward to no longer having to dig under my street-swear t-shirts to get my tights out, or what have you: ballet stuff gets its own compartment; street wear another one; underwear and other small miscellany the third.  These would also be handy for organizing off-season clothing items.  I will almost certainly order more -- come to think of it, I wouldn't mind a couple of the small ones for my everyday dance bag.This first set of packing cubes is going to Burning Man with me.  Antarctica or the moon might be a better the harshest tests of a piece of luggage, but Black Rock Desert isn't far behind.  I'll report back on how things shake out when we return.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DISHOQE1DOYE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NOMB8JS#wasThisHelpful","R1DISHOQE1DOYE","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of my ballet teachers frequently uses Plumpton's West End To Broadway in class.  Mr. Plumpton plays with accuracy, expression, and no small measure of wit, providing a river of music on which ballet class flows along swimmingly (okay, well, we swim better on some days than on others).  Meanwhile, we all get a boost from the familiar showtunes -- I just about died the first time ""Good Morning, Baltimore"" came rolling out of the music system.  Sometimes I find myself quietly singing along during easy combinations.If you're looking for some music that will inject some fresh air into your ballet class or daily practice, West End to Broadway might be just what you need.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P608Y7PGJW0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004ZH1GWK#wasThisHelpful","R3P608Y7PGJW0W","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice road-bike mirror, but near in mind that the included plastic clamp is not large enough for some modern road bars even if you mount it under the wraps.It can, however, be swapped out for a larger clamp (the hard part is finding the right size).With a clamp that would fit more bars, this would be a solid four or five star mirror (I'm unsure only because durability is definitely a factor in commuter gear, and I haven't had mine mounted long enough to assess that).

"I must concur with many previous reviewers — there's a distinct trade-off between form and function, here, but Fit & Fresh Cool Coolers are a good solution for the right applications.Fit & Fresh's Cool Coolers are perfectly sized to include in a sandwich box or cram into a tight lunch pack, but because of their small size and the high ratio of surface area to interior, they do thaw faster than many ""ice brick"" products.  That's worth considering when you're packing your food.That said, I am still quite happy with them.  My husband, a physical therapist who specializes in clients with intellectual and developmental disabilities, travels quite a bit on some days to meet his clients at their day centers.  His lunches may sit in a hot car for most of the day, so keeping them cold is a priority.  I pack his lunches in a well-insulated soft-sided baby bottle cooler (Childress brand, from Amazon — I bought it specifically to use as a lunch box because of its shape and excellent insulation); he puts one of these cooler bricks in before he leaves in the morning.He likes hot  lunches, so any leftovers presumably are still warm when he puts them back in the bag.A single Cool Cooler brick will be thawed but still cold when he returns home; leftovers, too, will be cold.  That suggests better staying power than I'd expect.In short, I wouldn't rely on one of these to cool food in an uninsulated bag all day, though I imagine you can increase cooling time by adding more Cool Coolers, if you have room.  They are not quite as effective as thicker ice bricks.However, they fit nicely into tight spaces where rocket bricks don't and will keep food at a safe temperature inside an insulated bag for several hours.  They also don't take up much space in the freezer, which is nice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3G36TDC53BHA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FO2B5U#wasThisHelpful","R3G36TDC53BHA1","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you're an amateur dancer, a balletomane, or even if you just enjoy a good, witty non-fiction book, do yourself a favor and read Stephen Manes' _Where Snowflakes Dance and Swear._  Through Manes' fresh, wide-open eyes, you'll get a good look at the day-to-day life of one of the United States' premier ballet companies, and to a lesser extent into the inner workings of ballet itself.  While this is, in a sense, a very serious examination of the world of ballet, it's laced with Manes' wit (as the title suggests) and never bogs down under its own weight.Very good read -- well worth the price, and deserves a spot in any balletomane's bookshelf.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V718LY49ANE5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005NRQZ5O#wasThisHelpful","R3V718LY49ANE5","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For what it's worth, I'm a guy, but mens' unitards are generally ridiculously expensive.  Since I wasn't actually sure I wanted to commit to the whole unitard concept, I figured I'd try this one first.As a general rule, I like it.  It's soft and supple.I wasn't thrilled about the cotton content -- I was worried it would get waterlogged in class -- but my concerns were unfounded.  It turns out that Eurotard's tank unitard wicks surprisingly well.That may be a function of the fact that it's pretty thin.  It's not quite ""dude, I can see your dance belt"" thin, but I did have my concerns at first.  I'm still not sure it's 100% opaque, and as a result I always wear something over it outside the studio, but this is definitely my go-to garment for warm days in class right now.The trade-off for the lightness of this unitard is that it doesn't offer much in the way of compression or support: of all the dancewear I own, it is the least supportive (though also the least restrictive, and that's saying something when you're talking about an entire industry devoted to making the least-restrictive garments possible).I've now washed my unitard a bazillion times (seriously, I've worn it 2 - 3 times per week since I got it, washing it on cold/gentle and tumble drying it on low, since it arrived), and it's holding up well.  That's a big point in favor of Eurotard's workmanship.Overall, a good buy for the price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HNF634P92JXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O0G33G#wasThisHelpful","R3HNF634P92JXY","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My big, lazy cat is surprisingly okay with this.  To be fair, he's pretty easygoing, but I think the design leads to less resistance than a standard harness would.I used the increasing-exposure approach -- popped the harness on for a few minutes while cuddling the cat, then took it off; popped it on again for a bit longer and let him wander in the living room (he seemed unsure at first, but got himself sorted soon enough); then increased the duration a little at a time.  Now he's content to wander around with the harness on.Initial setup is a wee bit complicated, but once you've got your cat fitted and the harness is adjusted, putting it on is no big deal.  Escape might be possible for a determined feline, but I'm not sure anything can actually contain a cat that really wants out.This is a great option for a people-oriented indoor cat who wants to get outside, explore a bit, and get some exercise (or who wants to get outside and explore a bit, and whose person wants him or her to get some exercise).  It's not perfect, but it's pretty good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R5DIWBMIIYZY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OBFHXU#wasThisHelpful","R3R5DIWBMIIYZY","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I never expected to be writing a non-dance specific underwear review, but I guess there's a first time for everything!  Then again, I was a little hesitant to order 8 pairs of _anything_ this essential.  If this review helps someone else feel secure in making a purchase, then I can ride off into the sunset knowing that I've left the world a better place.I ordered these recently enough that Amazon still thinks they haven't been delivered yet (ha!), but they got here way ahead of schedule, and I'm glad they did (though, obviously, that means I can't say much about long-term durability right now).Personally, I'm a fan of minimalist underwear.  Simply put, for an active guy, it just plain gets in the way less often than the full-coverage kind.  My goal is to put my underwear on in the morning and forget about it all day.  The ideal pair brings to the table no bunching, no chafing, no sagging, and definitely no squeezing.SiikWorld's Ice Silk Thong Low Rise passes all those tests.  It just works.  It's comfortable and functional (and comes in a bunch of colors, though I would have been just as satisfied with an all-black set or, really, anything except all white or all beige).At 5'8"" and 156 pounds, I wear an American mens' size 32 in trousers; here, the Asian L -- equivalent to a US medium -- is a very nice fit.  It would probably do equally well for someone who wears a size 34.  If you're smaller than a size 32, I'd order the next size down; bigger than a 34, you might be able to wear the Asian L/US M, but I'm not sure.  My ""fits as expected"" rating reflects the sellers' sizing instructions.The waistband has a comfortable, fleecy terry backing and offers enough grip to stay where it needs to, but not so much that you feel like you've got an angry python wrapped around your waist.  The remainder of the fabric is silky, supple, and supportive -- though maybe not quite ""I'd use these in place of a dance belt while dancing the Le Corsaire variation"" supportive.Quality and workmanship seem pretty solid.  Should I discover any early unraveling or anything like that, I'll definitely check back in -- but right now, I expect these to last a good, long time.  (They'd better, because I just replaced half my underwear drawer with them!)  All eight pair passed my quick quality-control check.Definitely recommend these for anyone who leans towards the minimal-underwear approach but isn't quite into the idea of going commando.One more random bit: each pair comes packaged in its own little zipper pouch.  That could come in handy for travel, or you could repurpose the pouches -- they might be perfect for containing the millions of micro-USB cords that are slowly multiplying in every home in the developed world.I've included a photo to provide a sense of the various colors included in the package.  Not shown is the black with red waistband and trim.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AH4FJ5SA0CLP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8R89US#wasThisHelpful","R2AH4FJ5SA0CLP","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Instant, painless sync with my Galaxy Note 8 tablet.  Nice action, if just a touch uneven, on the keys; also sounds nice (note: if you're looking for a silent keyboard that won't disturb your roommate or partner at night, keep looking).  Quick, responsive typing.Quite a few useful function keys -- you can turn the brightness up and down, for example, without having to touch the screen; the F1 button lets you tab through open apps much as you would with Alt+Tab on a Windows machine.  You can even long-press a key to access accented characters (Windows could learn a thing or two there!).Small enough to be portable; big enough to be useful.  This will be traveling with me quite a lot, I suspect.  It will go to Burning Man inside a gallon-size zipper bag.  It will definitely be traveling back and forth to school/work, where it will help me get meaningful work done without dragging along my 4-pound notebook PC.There are a few key combinations that this keyboard interprets a little strangely.  I'm not entirely sure yet what they are; I've just noticed some interesting responses (apparently there's a keyboard shortcut for changing the system language, for example, that corresponds to something I do automatically a lot on regular keyboards; I type really fast, so it might take me a while to figure out what's actually triggering these things).I rather like the idea that I can also sync this to my phone or my laptop (where it can work as a YouTube remote if I'm feeling really lazy!) -- that's a lot of use packed into this inexpensive little package.So far, this keyboard meets all expectations, given its price-point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5QYFPU0AJVUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H09Z50E#wasThisHelpful","R5QYFPU0AJVUK","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quick to inflate (really only about 20 breaths!) and quick to deflate; easily as comfortable as my bed at home; packs light and small.  I've camped in sub-freezing weather with this pad -- sure, an insulated pad would probably have meant it took less time for my bag to warm up when I headed to bed, but with a heat-reflecting blanket tucked into my bag (between bag and liner), I was fine.Ultra-light backpackers and bikepackers may find it worth their while to pay a little more for something that packs even smaller, but for most of us, this mattress is just about perfect.  I wouldn't even hesitate to use it for a guest bed in a pinch!Edit: I realized some physical stats might be useful, here.  I am male, 5'8"", just shy of 160 pounds, athletic (dancer and cyclist), fairly low body fat, with plenty of projecting bony spots that can create uncomfortable pressure points (but not, sadly, julienne carrots) in seconds.  No pressure points at all with this mattress!  The ribbed design does a fantastic job preventing themI'm also a restless sleeper.  With my old mattress, I had to shove it inside my bag to keep from rolling off -- and, ost of the time I still woke up every couple of hours throughout the night with the pad on top of me, or beside me, halfway out of the bag, or whatever.  I put Klymit's Static X under my slippery-sided mummy bag instead of in it, squirmed like a caterpillar in my sleep all night as is my wont, and woke up in the morning feeling refreshed and still on the mattress.  That, right there, is nothing short of a miracle.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZUK5J7Q8YET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RFG0NM#wasThisHelpful","R2ZUK5J7Q8YET","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update: Today I hit an unseen patch of gravel while riding my bike back from ballet class and went down hard.  My tablet in its Fintie case was in the lightweight, totally-unpadded backpack I use as a dance bag.  It clearly took a hit; there's a gouge in the front flap of the case -- but the tablet is perfectly fine.  I'm typing his review on it thanks to my Fintie case.Edit: Still going strong, still no problems with the magnets.  Seems pretty durable.  Folded stand only really works in one position (the other works only on some surfaces), which is a tad annoying; on the other hand, the viewing-angle of the position in which it *does* work (seen in the main product picture) is great for many settings.  I won't be looking for another case any time soon, though I might buy a second one of these in another color, just for fun.I'm pleasantly surprised with this little case.  I failed to notice that it had magnetic features when I ordered, so I was deeply skeptical at first (magnets are notorious for killing the digitized on Galaxy Notes)  -- but the magnets seem to be well-places and sufficiently low-powered to prevent damage.  The case fits snugly and folds into a useful stand.  It's light enough that it doesn't make the tablet feel unwieldy.I could care less about the auto-wake/sleep feature, and I would rather have a tab-and-slot or similar mechanism for keeping the case closed (because I'm still a bit paranoid about the magnets), but overall I'm satisfied.  We'll see how this little case holds up over time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QUN62EHBEDVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CGVF8E4#wasThisHelpful","R1QUN62EHBEDVW","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great little tablet at a great price.  I bought it to replace a first-generation Acer Iconia a500, and I'm glad I did.  It's lighter, faster, and overall a more effective tool for a student on the go.  The slightly smaller size (8"" versus 10"") had turned out to be an asset instead of a detriment.In fact, the size is really nice - just right for reading or watching documentaries (because I'm a giant nerd).  The Iconia was a little too big for my hands (and much heavier).The display, meanwhile, is beautiful and crisp, great for playing games.My only quibble is that the battery life isn't awesome (note: the battery came almost fully  charged and ready to rock!).  That's a trade-off I'm willing to accept for the excellent on - screen writing functionality that the Note family provides.  An aluminum body would also have been nice for durability, but that's nothing a good protective case won't take care of.One caveat: My particular Note 8.0 came with a couple of small scratches on the screen.  That's no big deal for me - with a Tech Armor screen guard in place, they're not even visible.They don't seem to affect the function of the device in any way, and I consider minor cosmetic scratches entirely acceptable in a refurbished tablet at this price point.I'm noting this for those who might be really lucky about the appearance of their devices -- for me, this tablet is a tool (okay, and a toy!), not a fashion statement.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FMMQGFFL6HRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWCM5AW#wasThisHelpful","R2FMMQGFFL6HRD","A34ZEKVLYY0QZM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A34ZEKVLYY0QZM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This soap leaves my face with very clean and no greasy feel,  a lot of face washes kinda leave a film and make me wash my face again with a different wash, this one is great and does not cause any irritation or discomfort.

But all in all we are quite satisfied with this wash and i (dont tell the kid)  like to use it on the back scrubber and wash my back.  This is an all over wash but in my house it is for faces only.

"I actually was surprised with the quality of these shadows! L'Oreal has made a creamy eye shadow palette with a decent mix of matte and shimmery pink, gray, and brown based colors (I think this palette definitely has more of a ""cool"" tone to it than ""warm"" so buy accordingly to your skin tone). I do want to be clear, though- without a decent primer (I used Urban Decay's Primer Potion in Eden) these colors are not as pigmented as expected (especially the light pink ones- numbers 1 and 8) and need to be reapplied occasionally or applied over and over again to reach desired pigment. Without using a primer, the colors all blend together and wear off and you won't get the defined look that is so popular these days.The colors in this palette are numbered 1 through 10 from left to right. I think it would have been amazing if L'Oreal had named these colors! It would have added more of a ""higher end"" department/makeup store feel. For the price and quality, I believe that this is a decent mid range palette for those starting out and not wanting to spend over twice as much on other palettes that are available.The brush that is included with this palette is not too bad. One end is soft and decent for adding all over color and the angled sponge end is useful to blend out the corners for a dramatic look with the darker shades.I mostly liked the packaging... the palette opens up completely flat which is nice to hold and the half length mirror is great! I didn't like that I had to really stick my nail in between the clasp to open the palette. Doing this chips my nail polish and I would rather just pull the two sides open like my other palettes.All in all, this is a great palette for beginners or for mixing with higher end colors to achieve your desired looks. I think the variety of colors in this palette is decent and will compliment most cool skin tones. Just start naming your colors, L'Oreal and you'll be on your way!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AEGP0GE90LHZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQEZB2S#wasThisHelpful","R3AEGP0GE90LHZ","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently gave this game a try on a camping trip with my mother and father-in-law and my biologist husband and everyone had a blast! This game has everything you need to play with many animal cards, the game board, and wooden marker cubes for marking your guess and score.The card box obstructs the view of the bottom half of the card where all the information is. Players take turns betting on where in world the animal lives, how much it weighs, how tall or long it is, and how long its tail is(if it even has one). Players earn points by betting correctly or betting adjacently(next to) correct weights, lengths or locations.My father-in-law who is a retired engineer really enjoyed guessing at the weights and lengths and did very well in those areas and my husband was surprised at how many of the animals he had never heard of. Even though we all had different knowledge about the animals the game was very close until the end and competitive and fun for all players","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBAE0U7SQ3W9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004P6V2G6#wasThisHelpful","RBAE0U7SQ3W9I","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This truly is a soothing oral rinse that is gentle and effective. I have recently begun whitening my teeth and this can be very painful for me as I already have sensitive teeth and thin enamel. I noticed that after using this oral rinse 2 times per day as directed, I didn't feel the usual pain from hot and cold foods after whitening. I was very pleased with this!I should note that one thing that confused me was the actual uses for this product. Printed in the ""About the Product"" section listed on Amazon, it reads, ""Dentist recommended for post-whitening use and to help relive sensitivity associated with tooth whitening."" The bottle reads, ""Dentist recommended for post whitening use"", however on the side of the bottle it reads, ""Does not relieve or treat sensitive teeth, oral pain or gum disease"". These statements tend to contradict each other. Does it help with sensitivity or not? All I can say is that I did notice a different (an improvement) in how sensitive my teeth were after whitening.This rinse has a mild feel and flavor. When swishing it around in my mouth for 1 minute (as directed) I did not taste a flavor at all! It was cool and refreshing but very gentle and non evasive. It wasn't until I spit it out that I could taste the pleasant flavor. This rinse is alcohol free so there is absolutely no burning!As others have posted, I too noticed the soothing effect from this rinse when I had cut some skin on my soft palate from eating crusty french bread. I used this rinse after noticing the discomfort and within a few minutes, felt much better.Overall, this is a very mild, pleasant, and soothing oral rinse. The 16oz bottle size is convenient to store (not too big) and just the right amount to try this product out consistently. I also appreciate that this produce is Vegan and Kosher and is all natural, containing zero artificial flavors or colors.Would recommend!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYVAA69R3OT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VN04SY0#wasThisHelpful","RFYVAA69R3OT3","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this case shortly after I had upgraded my old phone to a new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.The color of this case is called ""Ice"" but as you can see from the picture I have uploaded, it is totally clear. I have the white S6 phone so the white from my phone is what shows through.This case is much thicker than the more attractive (but less functional) case I had bought with my phone. This case adds a nice amount of protection to the back, sides, and corners of this phone. If you are familiar with the S6, you will notice that the sides of the phone are curved. This makes it hard for this phone to be fully protected as the long vertical sides are exposed if tipped on an angle. I appreciate that this case comes up as far as it can on those sides without compromising the function of the phone.I love how the buttons on the phone are quite raised and prominent. They are easy to find and have a nice ""click"" sound when pressed. The other feature that I really like is the ridged back which allows for an amazing grip! The style of the S6 Edge makes it difficult to hold and text with one hand,  however, the ridged back makes it much easier to do so.The microphone plug, charging plug, and speaker are all easily accessible and have excellent sized openings (see pictures). The camera and flash/heartbeat sensor are adequately protected and can still be used without taking off the case.Overall, I am very pleased with this case. It has an industrial look to it but as a girl, I still find it attractive and don't mind compromising a bit for style to have better protection :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3812HH7ACVO7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TRG8K0A#wasThisHelpful","R3812HH7ACVO7V","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are highly pigmented, long lasting, large sized lip liners for a terrific price! I am obsessed with the variety of colors in this 12 piece set :) They vary from dark browns, deep purples, bright reds, matte nudes, to hot pinks! I've included pictures to show how pigmented these colors are. As a makeup lover, I have a multitude of lip sticks, glosses, and stains and it can be expensive to buy individual lip liners to match all the colors. This set achieves that for the price of 2 drugstore lip liners! These are also full size pencils! Longer than typical liners. The tips are fine but are easily buildable for thicker lines. The quality of the color is excellent, very creamy and easy to apply and sharpen. These last about as long as my lipsticks do and I didn't notice any irratation or breakouts after wearing. Their main ingredients are listed as: carnauba wax, bees wax, ceresin, cocoa and shea butters, octyldodecanol, isopropyl myristate, diethylhexylcyclohexane, butylparaben, and BHT. These are listed as ""made in China"".Overall I am extremely pleased with the quality and feel of the pigments, the variety of colors, and the size of the pencils.

"This pencil sharpener works great and is perfect for my crowded desk at work!This top feeding pencil sharpener has no problem putting a nice point on the school pencils I use at work. It has an auto-stop mechanism that won't allow you to sharpen beyond a nice point, saving pencil length.I like most the small footprint of this sharpener.

"This is my third year of buying Audubon calenders but my first ever,  World of Trees calendar! I have never been disappointed! The format is similar to their other calendars if you are familiar. Each month of this calendar displays a beautiful tree from around the world. At the bottom of the page is a paragraph that describes the area (geographical location, climate, wildlife, facts about the trees, etc.) and also includes a cute picture of wildlife that may live nearby.

"I am not very impressed with this particular brand.  Some of these off brand concealar palettes are usually not too bad however this particular palette is the worst that I've tried. The concealers are very oily and are minimally pigmented (if you don't rub your finger in the pot like crazy- see picture). I found that it barely added any real coverage and actually made the lines on my face more visible! (Again, see picture- my fingerprints really stand out). If you try and use a brush to apply, all of the lighter colors go on clear and oily and are not very buildable without completely drying out (I know, the opposite of oily but they completely dried out on my skin). The consistency is very cheap and difficult to deal with.  This was a waste of money and I am sadly disappointed :( Beware!","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2INODFB7F34G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXQNE42#wasThisHelpful","R2INODFB7F34G5","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was a gorgeous gift card to send to my mom for Christmas (she lives across the country and we don't see each other often). The Holiday design was beautiful (looked better than the picture!). I love that the Nordstrom Gift Card can be used at Nordstrom stores, Nordstrom Rack, and online as well. Very convenient! I only wish that there were other denominations for this beautiful design so that I could have sent some to other friends and family without breaking the bank.

"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas. We've been together for almost 15 years and I thought this would be a cute way to remind him of all the things that I love about him. When he opened it, I was genuinely surprised at how touched he was. He couldn't put it down and has revisited it several times since then. There are 50 pages that allow you to personalize sweet sayings to your loved one. There are no rules with this book, and the instructions support that. Sometimes I added extra words or extended a sentence. However you use the book, it is guaranteed to make someone feel good and loved :) I also found it refreshing to really think about and meditate on all of the things that make my husband great and why I love his so much. You really can't go wrong with this book.

"I am really impressed with the design and ease of use of this fruit and vegetable slicer. The title, however is a little deceiving. It is not a ""2-in1 ... cutter"". You actually get the apple slicer piece that is attached and then you get the lattice slicer separately. You have to remove one piece to use the other. The only other issue I had with this slicer is storing that additional piece safely as it does not attach to the slicer when not in use. I had originally placed it in the side of my cooking drawer. On Christmas Eve when I was looking for my turkey thermometer in that same drawer, I noticed that my pinky finger was bleeding like crazy. It took me a good minute to realize that I had accidentally sliced my finger on the lattice cutting piece and didn't even notice! I recommend storing the extra piece in a place that is out of the way, perhaps even in a separate container for everyone's safety.When using the fruit slicer for piecing up apples, I noticed that this cutter went through my large honeycrisp like butter! It was easy to remove the core and easy to clean. I also liked that the handles on this slicer are flatter compared to similar tools. This makes it less awkward to store. The vegetable slicer worked extremely well on potatoes. Overall this is an inexpensive and handy tool to have in your kitchen. Again, please be careful with how sharp this item is!! ;)","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BI2PX3MYPDIY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OPXKN3W#wasThisHelpful","R3BI2PX3MYPDIY","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, I love the 8 different prints that you receive with this order (3 of each, total of 24 cards). They work out to be very economical! These cards are made from 100% recycled paper and you know what's even more awesome? They are made in the USA! Don't you just love when you can really feel good about a purchase? ;) Besides the adorable designs, the cards are blank inside, leaving room to write your own message. All of the cards do say ""Merry Christmas"" on the outside so these might not be best when sending to friends or family of different religious backgrounds. The only reason these cards lost one star for me was the fact that they are really small... about 4.8 in by 3.3 in. You can barely fit a gift card in these little envelopes! I suggest that these just be used to send a happy message for the Holidays and you'd be better off buying a standard sized card to send photos or gift cards in.I would definitely recommend these cards as a cute and economical way to wish others well this Holiday season!","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROF1495EPRMUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EJ0A6I8#wasThisHelpful","ROF1495EPRMUD","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased my Fitbit earlier this year (February 2014) and was really excited to use it! I wore it everyday for several weeks and loved the fact that it counted my steps, monitored my sleep patterns, and allowed me to connect to friends through their online community. After about 3 months, I did notice that my band was starting to tear, especially where I would bend it to place the Fitbit back in after charging. This was unfortunate and I decided to purchase some replacement bands. I didn't mind doing this since I love that I now have a variety of colors instead of just the Slate. I never took the band off! I showered in it, swam in it, I checked it throughout the day to see how I was doing toward my goals. I really enjoyed it.Unfortunately, in June of 2014, I broke my wrist in a hiking accident. I needed surgery and was unable to wear or use my Fitbit for about 3 months. When I went to use it again, it had trouble holding a charge and eventually just died. I finally just got around to contacting customer service. Within hours, I received a reply email from a Fitbit representative who offered some suggestions/troubleshooting ideas. When that didn't work, I was asked to send a screen shot of my purchase (order confirmation) of the Fitbit that I purchased from here, at http://amazon.com. I just received a confirmation email that they have shipped my replacement Fitbit and that I do not need to send them my broken one. This was remedied in less than 5 hours, on a Sunday, for a Fitbit that I purchased 10 months ago. I was very happy with how well customer service handled this although, I see a lot of reviewers here reporting that they did not have such a great experience. I suggest you email them again. It couldn't hurt! I'm thinking there is a year warranty on these things so don't give up!I gave the Fitbit 4 stars because:1. If you wear it everyday, in the shower, etc. the bands really wear out.2. I wish this model had a heart rate monitor and was able to differentiate between walking on level ground and climbing stairs (I see there are some newer models that do these things).3. The size -is- a little bulky for women with smaller wrists but I appreciate the medium and large bands included.4. It is not -that- accurate... I think I get a couple hundred steps in doing my makeup in the morning (which of course is not correct ;)5. It died within a year.I love this Fitbit because:1. It makes fitness fun and I enjoy connecting with my friends online and comparing activity levels. (Also easily connects with MyFitnessPal)2. I like the different colored bands that can be purchased separately to match my various outfits.3. It is waterproof for showers, sweat, and swimming.4. It is easy to clean and take care of. The app is great and the online dashboard is easy to use as well.5. I actually was really impressed with my recent customer service experience.All in all, I would recommend this produce to friends and family members. There are some reported hiccups with these things not being able to last a long time but I'm willing to give it another chance. We'll see how I feel if my replacement breaks down... lol.

"I was very pleased with this Z-Vibe. I was worried that getting the plastic handle would mean that the quality would be less than the metal ones but I liked the lightweight feel of this one and the ease of cleaning it. This model has a nice bumpy feel to the handle that helps with grip. This is a great tool for SLPs to use with children with oral motor difficulties (low muscle tone, sensory issues) as well as for bringing awareness to the articulators for children with childhood apraxia of speech or other severe articulation impairments. This is a great product and there are many interchangeable tips that can be bought and used with this handle.

"I am very pleased with the SMS In-Ear Biosport Biometric Earbuds! These earbuds need the RunKeeper app for best results (available for GooglePlay and the iTunes app store). If you have an Android, set up is really easy. You literally download the app, make an account (through Facebook, Google+, or with email), and plug in the headphones to your phone! I was pleased to find that these earbuds come with 3 different interchangeable sizes (small, medium, and large). I also found these earbuds to fit quite comfortably in the ear. In addition, you will receive a nice pouch to keep your headphones in as well as the extra buds.Once you have downloaded the Runkeeper app, it will default to ""GPS"" settings. This is easy to change if you are going to be working out indoors or on a treadmill. When you click ""activity"", there are two options at the top of the page, ""GPS Mode"" and ""Stopwatch Mode"". If you have not changed the position of the slider from microphone mode to heart rate mode, the little heart icon in the app will have a ""!"" sign on it. Simply move the slider to the hear rate monitor position and click ""Begin (workout)"". You are informed that your ""activity has started"" by a very serious voice from the app. Your heart rate is now listed underneath the stopwatch and will fluctuate based on your activity level. When you pause or stop the workout, the voice will also inform you of this. I think this is handy in case the buttons are pressed accidentally in your pocket. When you have completed a workout you can adjust the distance and calorie burn, make notes, share to various social media sites, and add workout reminders.I liked the fact that when my phone rang during my workout, I just slid the slider back to the microphone position. Unfortunately, the heart rate monitor stops and you still have to manually pause your workout or else the timer will continue counting. I also liked that in the RunKeeper app there is a music note that once you click it, will automatically connect to your music library. When you move the slider the microphone position, the music and heart rate monitor pause, and once you move it back, they both begin to work again.All in all, these are great fitting earbuds with decent sound quality. I was happy to use these when working out instead of regular earbuds and really appreciated the heart rate monitor feature and ease of use of the RunKeeper app for Android.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GQIO341NZVPI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PDHXL8I#wasThisHelpful","R2GQIO341NZVPI","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My cat LOVES this Kong Kickaroo!!I couldn't even get this cat toy out of the package before my 7 year old Bengal cat, Gibson, grabbed the package and got to ""kicking"". I am so thankful to have found this toy :) My Gibbs usually grabs hold of paper towel rolls or pencils and goes to town, kicking and scratching away. It wasn't until I saw him grab one of my Husky's dog toys, that I thought I needed to look for something for Gibson to kick. After searching, I found this Kong cat toy and he absolutely loves it. I think the Tiger pattern looks a lot better in real life than in the pictures. It is a great sized toy for the price and the furry black tail at the end of the toy is very soft. Gibson couldn't wait until Christmas for this present!

"3 1/2 starsThis hair dryer has some great qualities and could easily have earned 5 stars if it weren't for the most awkward button positions ever!What I love about this hair dryer is that it has an incredibly quiet sound during use. The low setting, which is what I use all over my hair to help it dry before using a round brush, is so quiet, I can still hear my husband talking to me from the room over! This is a big positive. I also like that the cord is retractable and easy to store without getting tangled in with other cords from my flat iron or curling irons. My final positive and feature that I really like is that the nozzle where the air comes out of is quite narrow and concentrates on the area I want to dry without blowing the rest of my hair all over the place!Now for what made this dryer lose 1.5 stars: the buttons. This hair dryer uses two ""slide"" buttons. One for ""cool"", ""warm"", and ""hot""  levels and one for ""off"", ""low"", and ""high"" levels. 1. I wish these buttons were reversed. I use the ""low"" and ""high"" levels every time I dry my hair and these buttons are located on the most bottom part of the handle. This means that it is almost impossible to slide the button on to dry my hair without using two hands. As you may already know, most women use one hand to hold the dryer, and one hand to hold a brush. This is a hard task with this dryer. I know that this is also a new dryer but I find the slider buttons to be extremely hard to slide up and down. I am hoping with use they become less stiff.  2. I wish the ""off"" button was in the middle of the ""low"" and ""high"" options. It adds an extra step when I go from ""high"" to turning it off. The dryer has to go through the ""low"" setting first and when you're fumbling with the buttons already, it makes this seem like an unnecessary extra step.All in all, I enjoy the sound and weight of this hair dryer as well as its drying capabilities. The major cons are that the buttons most used are located in a very awkward position that makes drying my hair more laborsome than it should be.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZLXFY8M93Q2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O0WRO08#wasThisHelpful","R8ZLXFY8M93Q2","A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2ZXBFBA7EKYNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the first entry in the 4-part series, which teamed up two of my favorite authors, Kendra Elliot and Melinda Leigh.On Her Father's Grave finds former LAPD cop Stevie Taylor returning home to her small-town roots in Solitude, OR.  Stevie followed her beloved father's footsteps into law enforcement.  Her father, the chief of police in Solitude, has passed away suddenly.  Stevie decides to move back to Solitude and join the police force there.Stevie's family is very well-known in the small town. Besides her late father's position, her brother, James, is the town's mayor.  Her younger sister, Carly, is a social worker who is married to Seth Harding, an investigator.Her father's second-in-command, Roy, decides that the top job isn't for him.  Instead, experienced officer Zane Duncan takes over as chief.  Zane has lived in Solitude for over 5 years now, but still feels like an outsider in the small town.Stevie and Zane are immediately thrown into an investigation when a teen dies after taking a new street drug.  Zane is taken with Stevie, but Stevie is still healing from breaking up with her ex-boyfriend, a fellow officer in LA.  She's not sure that she ever wants to date another cop.It's no surprise that the characters are well-thought out, given the two authors who worked on the series.  Stevie is strong and smart without being hard-edged.  Zane is kind and patient, realizing that Stevie has a lot of healing to do.  The story ends too soon, leaving you wanting more.Having grown up in a very small town myself, I appreciated the following moments:*  Small Town Rule #2: Reputations are made in five seconds and stick for twenty years.

"This was a freebie for Kindle users last month.  It's the first novel by Robert Dugoni I've read.Tracy Crosswhite said goodbye to her younger sister, Sarah, one day, not realizing it would be for the last time.  Though Sarah's body has never been found, Edmund House was convicted of her murder and sent to prison.  However, Tracy, a chemistry-teacher-turned-cop has been unable to accept that verdict and continued to investigate her sister's case.There's a couple of things I want to talk about that involve spoilers, so I'm going to say....SPOILER ALERT!I thought that the majority of the characters were believable.  You could feel Tracy's angst as she wanted to make sure that she had done everything possible for her sister, as she blamed herself for letting Sarah drive home alone that day.  I also thought that the way Sarah's disappearance affected the family for years to come was very realistic.  Tracy became engaged to ex-husband, Ben, the night of Sarah's disappearance.  Tracy's parents let their anger center on Ben as the cause of Tracy not looking after her sister that day.  Even though Tracy married Ben, their marriage fell apart as Tracy was obsessed with investigating Sarah's case.Dugoni also did a good job of throwing red herrings out there.  I was pleasantly surprised to be, well, surprised, at the end.Highly recommend.© Angela Risner 2014.

"I was interested in this type of light therapy for two reasons:1.  I suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder and we're headed into fall/winter.2.  I am ADD.  I take my stimulants, but I'm trying to reduce my dependency on multiple doses per day.The light itself feels well made.  I thought that it said it had a rechargeable battery, but the one I received has to be plugged in to work.Does the light wake me up when I start to lose my concentration?Yes, it does.  But I think that has to do with the color of the light itself and how it mimics the affect of our devices' screens.  I'm sure you've seen the articles that discuss how the light from your laptop, tablet and/or smartphone keeps you awake.  Here's an excerpt from an app that I use on my laptop to help combat that:******Blue Light Affects Sleep (and here's why)We know that night-time exposure to blue light keeps people up late. We believe that f.lux adjusts colors in a way that greatly reduces the stimulating effects of blue light at night.To understand the effects of f.lux on sleep, we've spoken with some researchers, and we've read a whole lot of papers.The science that explains why blue light keeps you up was begun many years ago in the study of bird migration, and it continued in humans with the discovery of a new photoreceptor in the eye, called Melanopsin. Many are familiar with the ""rods and cones"" that provide our visual capabilities, but it was only about 15 years ago that retinal ganglion cells containing melanopsin, which are sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range, were discovered, and their unique effect on sleep was investigated.The experimental research suggests that an average person reading on a tablet for a couple hours before bed may find that their sleep is delayed by about an hour. Clearly, the details are complicated, but that's why we get to cite so many very interesting papers.******So, really, if you're in front of your computer, you shouldn't need this light to help you stay awake.  It's hard to say whether or not it's an effective treatment for SAD until I've had it for longer.  Until then, i would be cautious about purchasing this item.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VXBEJFAQ9SW8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3SGCUE#wasThisHelpful","R2VXBEJFAQ9SW8","A3E02KBFI21TY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E02KBFI21TY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full disclosure: I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.I happened across Paul Kearns' name while doing some research on consulting in the learning field. Kearns wrote a series of articles, ""From Trainer to Learning Consultant,"" back in 2004. Those articles formed the basis for his new book, Organizational Learning & Development - From an Evidence Base.If you've been in the learning and development field for more than a few years, you know that the hardest part of the job is trying to demonstrate your value to the organization for whom you're working. Whether you're an instructional designer, trainer or both, you typically show up on the books as an expense. When the business hits a rough spot and has to make cuts, you are usually considered to be the most expendable.To be honest, most of us found ourselves in this profession by accident; we were Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) or super-users. Because we performed our jobs so effectively, we were tasked with training new people (even our own bosses.) I was doing instructional design before I knew that's what it was called. When I was thinking about graduate school, instructional design programs were few and far between.It took years before I learned that I didn't have to say yes to every request for training, that training was not always the answer (because the question was one of performance management and training can't answer that question.) It's only been in the last decade that the learning and development field has started to think about their role in the business as a partner, rather than a ""necessary evil"" (as one of my managers said to her team in order to get them to come to training.)In 2006, the authors of The Six Disciplines of Breakthrough Learning (known as the 6Ds) challenged the learning and development world to only provide learning that aligned with your company's objectives. Training for training's sake was no longer the rule; the only acceptable form of learning would improve an employee's job performance, which would ultimately improve the performance of the business.The 6Ds is a great step in the right direction. However, speaking from experience, it can't work unless the organization itself is at a certain point of maturity. Unfortunately, the 6Ds does not address this. Kearns' book does.Kearns applies his previously developed HR Maturity Scale to learning. There are six stages of maturity on a scale from reactive (where training requests are ""reacted"" to and there is no curriculum mapping or conscious design of learning) to strategic (where learning is a natural part of the business process and the organization becomes a whole system.)For a business to truly evolve into a learning organization, it must be honest with itself about where it is on the Maturity Scale. To move up the maturity scale, everyone must be rowing the boat in the same direction.Kearns also takes on Kirkpatrick's Four Levels of Evaluation. He correctly states that they do not hold the training department accountable to any business objective; instead, they simply evaluate the trainer as a facilitator. Using the Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA) model instead to establish a baseline measurement or evidence base makes much more sense.This book is the best blueprint we have to move learning and development into full-fledged business partners with permanent seats at the table. If we can follow the principles in this book, L&D will no longer have to fight to stay relevant and prove its value.I have pages and pages of notes marked, but here are some favorite moments:• ...it marks the shift away from focusing on training, which is always an input, to learning, which is an output.• Professionals are always focused on business impact; amateur trainers are satisfied with their training activity.• Evaluation is not just about measuring success; it will equally expose training failure.• Traditional processes for performance review and development planning tend to suffer from a common condition - the culture does not allow for difficult conversations to be held in an open, honest, transparent and grown-up way.• Performance management works best in mature organizations, with Stage 4 being the minimum goal, where performance management is perceived as less of a big stick and more of a positive reinforcement of valuable behavior.• Learning should be encouraged to happen naturally and organically; it should not be designed as intervention, nor viewed as such.• Education means looking at how somebody else made a fire. Training means you have to know how to make a fire, not just describe the process. Applied learning means you make a fire.Highly recommend.

"I don't know why, but I've ended up in tears during the last two Murnane books.  I guess that's a good sign, in that the writing is really connecting with me.Katwalk follows Katrina as she attempts to break out of her mundane life by moving to New York City.  Katrina has always played by the rules; they've never been HER rules, however.  Her parents have always told her what to do, what to study, where to live.  She became an accountant and has been with the same company since her college graduation.  Her best friend, Deb, convinced her that they needed to break out of the rut by saving up enough money to quit their jobs and move to New York City for a few months.  Unfortunately for Katrina, Deb ends up with a better offer from her current job and decides to stay.  That leaves Katrina with the decision to head to the Big Apple alone or stay in her safe life. She opts for the adventure.  Katrina becomes ""Kat"" to her new friends in NYC and begins to explore the city.Murnane paints NYC in both dark and light colors.  People are either so desperately unhappy that they spend their evenings in bars and having affairs or they are...wait, it's mostly dark.  Sure, Katrina's neighbors befriend her right away and she isn't ever mugged or robbed, but most of the people in the book are really unhappy with their lives as they are.  They wish they could do something other than the 9-5 grind.Overall, though, I still liked it.  It wasn't sappy, but more realistic about the choices that we all feel forced in to making - the jobs we take because of the money, not because they will feed our souls or our passions.Some favorite moments:•  “I think a lot people do that, especially straight-A high-school students.” “Do what?” “Put their heads down , study to get a degree, get a degree to get a job, get a job to get a paycheck, get a paycheck to buy a house. Everything’s focused on the next step, and before they know it, they’ve spent all their best years always aiming for the future and never really enjoying the present.”•  ""In your life, it shouldn’t matter what anyone else is doing , or what anyone else thinks. You are the only person keeping score of your life. All that should matter to you is what is important to you. If you make major life choices based on what other people expect from you, or what will earn the approval of others, you’ll never be happy.”•  “Mom, Dad , I know it’s not going to be easy, that it’s going to be quite hard, in fact. But this is something I want to do, something that will make me happy. I’ve spent too many years living a life that makes other people happy. All that did was make me miserable, and I just can’t do it anymore.” Recommend.© Angela Risner 2014.

"Officially, the character of Maxine (Max) Revere is introduced in this Kindle single, but I read Notorious first.  The single is a great appetizer, though this particular story has nothing to do with the events in Notorious, the full-length novel that is published after this.Max Revere is an investigative reporter whose former college classmate is after her to become the star of a new TV journalism show (think On the Case with Paula Zahn.)  Max hates the idea and tries to say no.  Meanwhile, she is interested in the case of missing college student.  Frustrated with the students who were with the boy when he went missing, she pushes the local police department as well as the college to find the truth.Great character and definitely an interesting read.© Angela Risner 2014.

"I'm so glad that Allison Brennan has introduced a new character, Maxine (Max) Revere.  I actually think that this was one of Brennan's best books to date.This book follows Max, an investigative reporter, as she returns to her hometown to attend the funeral of a former high school friend.  Max's life has been turned upside down many times:  1.  Her mother abandoned her as a child.  2.  Her best friend was murdered while the girls were still in high school.  3.  Her college roommate was abducted and is presumed dead, though the body has never been found.  Max's wealthy family, including the grandmother who raised her, would like nothing more than to have their lives kept out of the press and for Max to let sleeping dogs lie.  However, Max wants to uncover the truth, no matter the cost to her family's reputation.I have enjoyed Brennan's Lucy Kincaid books, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to swallow.  I like that Max's character is, as she puts it, not restricted by having to adhere to the law in the way that law enforcement does when investigating a case.  Max doesn't have to worry about the chain of custody for evidence, etc.  She is able to go places the cops can't.I look forward to future books about Max Revere.Highly recommend.© Angela Risner 2014.

"I had high hopes for this book, but I'm so happy that I didn't have to pay for it.  There are some valuable insights in here, but as another reviewer said, the layout and the way the information is organized and presented is terrible.  Very few people want 792 pages of black and white text.  I would think that with all of the studies out there concerning adult learning theory, reference books and/or textbooks would have evolved into much more user-friendly forms, with more colorful graphics.With the availability of materials online today, I'm sure that the majority of the companies featured in the book have some (if not all) of the information available through other means that purchasing this book.Only recommend if you are going for your PMP Certification.

However, these have such great sound that I'm thinking of getting a second pair for my husband.I plugged these into my Galaxy Note 3 and was impressed with the amount of range.  I heard bits and pieces of songs that I've never been able to hear before - and I've listened to these tunes over and over.The fit of the earpiece was great, too, which can be an issue for me as I have very small ears.

"I was very excited to read this book, as I completely agree with the premise:  That kids today are over-scheduled, over-managed and over-protected.  Many parents, with great intentions, have managed to turn their kids into people who feel that they are entitled to things without earning them - such as respect, job titles, fabulous homes or apartments, etc.I see my friends post updates on Facebook that they're helping their kids with their homework or running their kids to soccer then to track then to this or that.  And I think, when does your child have time to be a kid and when do you have time to do anything else?  I think I asked my parents for help on homework maybe once or twice (and the internet didn't exist when I was in school.)  And after-school activities ended by 6pm, if not earlier.I will say, though, that the issue does not lie only with the parents.  We have a ridiculous education system in which you are judged by standardized tests.  Tell me the last time life through something at you in the form of a standardized test ?  Did you use your No. 2 pencil to fix your marriage ?  Was your job saved when you demonstrated that you could fill in a Scantron?However, the book itself was not that enjoyable to read.  The writing wanders a great deal and seems to stray from a point often.  I am never a fan of writing just to fill space.  While I do enjoy conversational style writing, I don't enjoy pages and pages of rambling on when you could have finished it in a couple of paragraphs.As Mr. McCullough is an English teacher, I know he loves words.  A great turn of phrase is something magical.  But the writing in this book seldom reaches that point.  It's like being stuck in traffic not far from your destination or foreplay that doesn't go anywhere.In the end, while I agreed with some of his statements, I felt as though this book needed a much better editor to keep it on point.  It became more of a stream of consciousness and I found myself putting it aside more often than not.Cannot recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34PSZLCJHIT1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006225734X#wasThisHelpful","R34PSZLCJHIT1H","A3E02KBFI21TY0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3E02KBFI21TY0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a great anti aging moisturizer. I like the feel of it on my skin. It has a silkiness to it that glides right on and soaks into your skin instantly. I have noticed a lessening in my deep wrinkles around my eyes, and between my eye brows. The texture of my skin even feels smoother, not so rough a texture. After two weeks of use it my skin feels so smooth and holds the moisture on it.

"Better to describe as a water circulating bowl. I have cats and my vet recommended a fountain to encourage cats to drink more often.This bowl circulates water under the waterline vs having any type of falling/splashing water available in most fountains.The kitty's are not inspired to drink from this bowl.The bowl is large, holds enough water for more than a few days in a 3 cat household.

"I've never owned a dust collector before, but after using this one, I'm sorry I didn't pick one up sooner.  My shop has never been cleaner.This thing is a beast.  I'm a fairly large dude, and moving the box around when it first arrived was a bit of a challenge.  Assembly wasn't too difficult at all, and took me about 45 minutes total (I was taking my time, as well). Everything about this unit is made very well.  As heavy as the motor is, moving and maneuvering the unit around once it's assembled is absolutely easy - it's like pushing a shopping cart.This also has the added benefit of letting me move it around my smallish shop.  I don't have to install ducting in my shop because I can just move the dust collector to where it needs to be, when it needs to be there.  It *is* a bit loud, though - about as loud as a shop vac.  That said, the suction this thing has is considerable.  Make sure you don't accidentally get the ducting near small or lightweight parts, because it will suck it up in a second.I've been using it for a while now, and I have to say, I can't imagine not having a dust collector.  If you're thinking about getting a dust collector, I'd highly recommend this one.  It's made very well and works like a champ.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HIETXN4E9JI4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146RKJRQ#wasThisHelpful","R1HIETXN4E9JI4","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Typically when you sign up for broadband access through your cable provider, they want you to rent a modem from them, which ends up being a huge scam.  Buy this modem / router combo, and it'll pay for itself in about a year.As soon as I had this modem activated, I noticed an immediate boost in speed (from 80 Mps to 120 Mps - I tested this through speedtest.net, just so you know). I'm sure there is a long and lengthy technical explanation as to why this occurred, but the only thing I cared about was a faster connection, and it was *very noticeable*.I also set up the guest network for my kids' friends who come into the house and want to connect.  The parental controls are good, but not great.  Also, this modem has crazy coverage - we have a *very* large house (5k+ square feet), and the signal is very strong in all corners of the house.If you're renting a modem, stop it.

"This is an outstanding solution for a solo performer, or someone who wants an all-around PA solution.  We use this for a PA system for music and announcements during tennis matches, and it works *wonderfully*.  The number of input and EQ options for this speaker make it super-flexible and we'll be using this for pretty much any function or gathering we have in the future.I don't think I would necessarily recommend this for use as a bluetooth speaker only - there are other way cheaper solutions for that on Amazon.  This is much more of a PA system, and while it's definitely loud, it doesn't really carry the sound quality of a Bose or Sennheiser. It's more of a blunt instrument than a scalpel in that regard.If there was anything that really hung me up, it would be the app integration.  You need to download the free Mackie app in order to really unlock the more powerful options of the system.  That said, once you have it downloaded and you've connected the speaker, it is *ridiculously* easy to control every aspect of the PA system, right from your phone or device.It isn’t built to be everything to everyone, but if you're looking for a really flexible PA or small performance speaker, this is an amazing solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34F708M9XBSML/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RBQV2XK#wasThisHelpful","R34F708M9XBSML","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This thing is pretty awesome once you've got it up and running.  We don't have a lot of power outages in Phoenix, but I'm *that guy* who likes to be prepared, and I used the excuse that we could take this camping to get the wife's buy-in (it was reluctant, to say the least).That said, here are some things to be aware of:When I unboxed the generator, it was apparent it had seen some hard times in transit.  The styrofoam was crushed all over, and one of the circuit reset buttons had been broken (a dot of superglue fixed that).  The packaging isn't really designed to withstand the weight of a generator, so it was impressive nothing else was broken (UPS is awesome).The assembly directions didn't include the need to bolt on a bottom support bracket.  No big deal - it was two bolts - but it probably should have been mentioned in the directions.  The biggest problem I found was that I was missing 2 c-clips to keep the tires on.  Again, not a big deal for me, as I have these in my shop, but they're kind of a specialty thing, and if you don't have a hardware store nearby, you could be waiting for Honda to send you replacements.In the box, this thing is *heavy*.  I'm not a small dude, and I had to put some effort into getting it off the front patio and into the house.  If this might be a problem for you, you might want to make sure you're home when the delivery guy shows so you can have him bring it in for you.The good stuff:It started on the first pull (!).  For anyone who's tried to start a lawnmower that's been sitting a while, this is one of those amazeballs things you can't believe happened. Also, for a generator, it's not really loud.  I mean, it's a gas engine, so it's not whisper-quiet or anything, but it's not difficult to have a conversation around it, either.The power it puts out is *substantial*.  It has 4 plugs on it, and you can run a large number of things.  I was able to run an industrial grinder and a miter saw at the same time (it didn't like it when I added a shop vac to the mix, however).  If this is backup or recreational generator for you, you'll have no problems with powering the things you want/need to.After getting it assembled, I was really surprised at how well it performed.  If you're looking for a really solid generator, I'd highly recommend this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VRKI171G22D2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJRP11I#wasThisHelpful","R2VRKI171G22D2","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I regularly use C4 for my pre-workout, and even though I've tried other brands, I keep coming back to C4 because of it's effectiveness.This version of the pre-workout is good, not great - depending on what you're looking for.  The reduced amount of caffeine means you don't get the crazy ""holy crap I need to go lift a car RIGHT NOW"" feeling the standard version gives you (Cellucor C4 Explosive Preworkout Supplement- 30 Servings -Mojito - G3 Chrome Series, for example).  Personally, I look forward to that feeling every morning when I step into the gym.  However, if you're a crossfitter or other workout type, that may not be what you're after, and in that case, this might be the pre-workout for you.The taste is pretty good, and I'm kind of a taste baby - if it's nasty, I'm not drinking it.  One thing to note is because of the creatine, you have to make sure you do a good job mixing it, or you're likely to get a mouthful of grainy bits.  Also, the amount of creatine contained in this isn't really enough to have the effect most lifters are after, so you're still going to have to keep taking another creatine supplement.If you haven't used a pre-workout before and want to know what it's like, this would be a good entry level product, as the usual side effects (that tingly feeling, increased heart rate) aren't an issue.  If you're all ridiculous with your workouts and want as much of a beastly boost as you can get, you should probably stick with the standard version or try the C4 50X.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YN53CQMGN0JX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U464HYK#wasThisHelpful","R2YN53CQMGN0JX","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have Monster High in your life, you know the need to collect dolls is almost more important than playing with them.

"Okay, wow.I'm a bit of a bluetooth speaker aficionado, as I use them all the time for camping, pool time, park time with the kids, etc.  I have to say this is the most impressive speaker I've used so far.  It edges out some of the solid performers, such as the NYNE Multimedia Inc TT Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black/RED/Silver) and the JBL Charge 2 Portable Bluetooth Speaker |- Black.The important things are all quality:- The sound performance is outstanding, with excellent bass response, and it gets loud without distortion.- The build quality is *solid*.  An aluminum reinforced housing makes it feel solid, and it survived several drops without a scratch.- You can accessorize it to make it perfectly suit whatever you're going to use it for, from a solar panel to a ""glow deck"" (which is a good way to light up your tent at night).- It supports pass-through charging, which means you can use the speaker, and use the USB port on the back to charge your phone.  With the solar panel option, you could technically have unlimited recharging power.- The battery life is substantial.  15 hours is the listed time, and it came very close to that, but we also had the volume close to the max most of the time.- It's waterproof.  I didn't test this functionality, but the housing is rubberized in all the right places.Some thing to consider:- Not all the accessories are available right now, presumably due to the popularity of the speaker.  I wanted to buy the solar panel, but it's out of stock with no availability date.- It doesn't come with a charger, only the micro USB cable to charge it.  This isn't necessarily a big deal, as I have more than a few USB chargers, but for someone that doesn't have them lying around, this could be a problem.That's really all I could find to nitpick.  I absolutely love this speaker, and we use it constantly.  It performs well, and takes a pretty good beating with no problems.  If you're looking for a good, rugged travel speaker, this is the one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH9Z2ZH6B185O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UVQ7PRY#wasThisHelpful","RH9Z2ZH6B185O","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Nice snug fit, with all phone perimeter buttons protected but still functional. There are cut outs for camera/flash, charger, headphone jack and on/off switch-the perimeter speaker has 6 holes.The cover provides back, corner and side protection-as well as a ""lip"" over the phone face; helping to protect the face if dropped face flat. This case does not cover the majority of the face of the phone.It is easy to remove if needed. It is not heavy or bulky.Sides are slightly textured, while it is a harder plastic, it is not overly rigid.  There is a slight flex to the areas colored black, for grip and comfort.

"I purchased this set to replace the chrome handle I bought at The Art of Shaving store that had recently broken.  I spent *way* more on just a handle than this entire set.The set's badger hair brush is bona-fide badger and is quite pleasant to use. The razor handle is a tad bit short for my hands, but I'm kind of a bigger dude, so it may fit perfectly for someone else, but it still works very well for me.  Both the brush and the razor are very nice weights and definitely feel quality. The stand holds the entire shooting match easily and stylishly.I've only been using this for about a week, so I don't know if there will be issues with the chroming yet. I can tell you I'm super-happy with this as a replacement, especially since I thought I was going to have to go shell out some serious cash at The Art of Shaving store to replace my handle.If you're looking at this as a present for your guy - this is the one to get.

"I've had some experience with external microphones in the past, and I'm a pretty big fan of this one.  I've used lav mics with my DSLR for interviews previously, and the sound is good for voice, but pretty poor for anything else.  This mic solves that issue and has the added benefit of making your camera rig look pretty awesome, too (I know this isn't a ""feature"" of the mic, but all the same...).It's helpful if you're somewhat familiar with external condenser mics, as the instructions are 1. sparse and 2. full of technical jargon (""...the microphone uses its line-cardioid element exclusively to provide excellent off-axis rejection."").  The concept behind the mic isn't difficult to understand, however, so it's pretty easy to get up and running with it after fooling around a little bit.The 3.5mm jack is permanently attached to the mic, so that's one less cable to lose (note: make sure the camera you intend to use with this has an external mic jack - not all of them do).  It also comes with both a foam windscreen and fuzzy windscreen (which my daughter calls a ""muppet""), which is a very nice add.I used the mic in mono mode to do an indoor interview and was *very* happy with the audio results.  Granted, this is about the best possible conditions for the mic, but the results show it's a quality piece of gear.  With the fuzzy windscreen on, it's still able to maintain very passable results outside and in a considerable wind.The rubber shock mounts on the mic kept any kind of motor noise (for example, the autofocus) from bleeding into the audio while I was using my DSLR.  This is something I've noticed with other external mic models, but is conspicuously absent from this one.Overall, it's a pretty great mic and a good piece of gear to have if you're even remotely serious about shooting video.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GFZIT7TVTF16/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V66XWTI#wasThisHelpful","R3GFZIT7TVTF16","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Because I'm a total spice baby.  Don't judge me.The closest thing I can compare this to is Frank's Red Hot sauce (Frank's is way more vinegary, just for reference), except this stuff is really, really delicious. Really.  It's more of a mildly spicy, garlic vinegar sauce that is so addictive, I can't eat pizza without it now.  As a matter of fact, I order pizza just so I have a good reason to get into the sauce.Even my wife, who is on a mission to find a sauce hot enough to melt her face, admitted this is really good.  It's been disappearing a bit faster than it should, so I think she's sneaking it when I'm not around.If you like the idea of hot sauce but don't have the tastebud fortitude for it, or you're just looking to add some awesome flavor to your food, get this.

"As a competitive shooter, I have a wide array of hearing protection, from the simple foam inserts to $800 custom-fit ear canal protection.  I just seem to accumulate that kind of stuff, for some reason...That said, I didn't expect a lot from these earmuffs, considering the price.  For over-the-ear protection, I typically wear big, liquid-filled 3M Peltor uber-muffs, so I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to ear pro.  However, I was more than a little surprised when I unboxed these.I'm bald, so I'm super-picky when it comes to the fit of muffs, but these were really comfortable, and they don't give you the typical compression headache after wearing them for a few hours that some other muffs might (the Leight models come to mind).  They have a 3.5mm headphone jack so you can listen to music or whatever while you're using them - this is a feature that is usually reserved for the more expensive models.  The muffs are very solidly built, and don't feel cheap in any way.One small silly detail I really appreciate is there is a string attaching the battery door to the muffs.  When you're juggling things at the range, or especially in a competition, it can be a challenge to keep track of small parts, and having the door attached just makes things that much easier.  Again, a super-small detail that makes a difference, in my opinion.The muffs performed very well while shooting my .40 cal and .357 (both competition guns) - at least as well as my muffs that cost more than twice as much.  You can tell there is a top-end range of sound protection for these, however. I probably wouldn't recommend using these while zeroing your Barrett 50 cal, for example.  I saw another reviewer say he uses these with his black rifle, so I would think you could trust these up to at least a .223 / 5.56.If you're looking for a pair of really good muffs for a pretty exceptional price, I'd definitely recommend these without hesitation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NO0DXBRZDHNS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R2NO0DXBRZDHNS","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The waterproof feature of the speaker is top-notch, and it has survived several trips to the pool, where my kids promptly put it into heavy use by taking it into the water.  It then became a bit of a toy as they threw it back and forth to each other.  This hasn't affected the performance or functionality of the speaker one bit.  A single charge also lasts longer than we would need it to for a daily outing, and connecting multiple phones to it via Bluetooth was no problem whatsoever.That said...I just don't like it as much as it's non-waterproof brother (The NYNE Portable Bluetooth Speaker: http://www.amazon.com/NYNE-Multimedia-Inc-Portable-Bluetooth/dp/B00I9ID070/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1429031820&sr=8-8&keywords=nyne+speaker).  I understand the waterproof aspect of the speaker has a detrimental effect on the sound (even out of water), but I'm a total baby about how speakers perform.  This speaker sounds tinny, and has very little bass response.  Bluetooth speakers in general don't always have the best performance, but there are a few on the market - including the NYNE speaker I linked to above - that provide substantially better sound.If you're needing a speaker you can totally abuse for your outings to the pool, lake, etc, and you don't really care too much about the sound, then this should definitely be your go-to.

"We feed our 2 cats a diet of primarily wet food, as per our vet.  We also always have a bowl of dry food for snacking and keeping their teeth healthy.  We are consciousness of fillers but also know that they need something to ""stick to their ribs"" since the wet food seems to scream right through.Take a look at the label and make sure your kitty's agitation is not in the ingredients.  Fortunately, we think our kitty soft stools come from the richness of their wet food and having a bit more corn/wheat would give them a bit more dietary balance.We slowly added this to their previous food (Iam's kitten because we were looking for gentler formulas) and they did not turn up their nose and ate as normal.  As we continued to increase the Gentle to Iams ratio the girls did not boycott their dry snack--good sign.What I did notice in the first week was an improvement in their poo. (So nice we can share:)) The girls were having a more solid stool for the first time.  Not something that looked like it would be a challenge to pass but, a normal healthy deposit.We are on our 3rd week of trial and kitty's are happy and the litter box room is a bit more approachable.

"If you love the pain of some crazy spicy sauce, this will deliver!The flavor is light, does not demonstrate the usual vinegar or heavy salt found in most. It delivers the heat without over powering the main course. It did a nice job of enhancing the food-making it hot and delicious with a slight smokey flavor.The spice is not a joke. The tip of my tongue was quite angry, the simple passing of my breath was painful for more than 5 mins after consuming.With ghost pepper I would add 2-6 drops on pizza or soup.

It pulled out where it meets the headphones within a week.  I did some dad-surgery on them and got them repaired, but had been a perpetual struggle until they finally separated for good about a week ago.It's entirely possible I got a bum set of headphones, but it's odd the manufacturer build the headphones like a tank and the cord like a Yugo.

"I have some mixed feelings about this fan (mostly with the price), so I've gone with the pro / con approach:Pros:- The fan's grill is fine enough that it would be difficult for all but the smallest of fingers inside.- The build of the fan is very solid - not flimsy at all, so no rattling or odd noises.- The nightlight is located on top of the fan, and works very well without being too harsh at night.- Being able to lock out the controls is a very neat feature, and keeps the 1 year old we have in the house from changing the settings.Cons:- The price seems pretty high for a fan.  This isn't much different than any Vornado fan you could get anywhere.- The speaker on the fan is kind of tinny, and some of the sounds come out distorted.  The crickets sound great, however.Overall, this fan has worked really well for the 1 year old, and it's definitely substantially baby-proofed, which makes us feel a *lot* better about leaving it in his room.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R301ZNK282545Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N6XB8WC#wasThisHelpful","R301ZNK282545Y","A2MPXAJK3K61IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2MPXAJK3K61IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you consider yourself to be a ""professional"" I would not get this unit. Let me explain.I, like many of you have made purchases over the years to increase the production value of my videos. Starting out small, and growing over time, increasing my investments into new gear. When I first decided that I wanted to steady my camera movements, I opted for an Opteka X Grip. I was limited by budget. Then I decided that I could invest just $250, so I bought this DVC Flycam 5000. I had a very difficult time getting the thing to balance properly.The thing about this type of rig, its for a run and gun type of video shooter. For weddings, music videos, and other similar types of work. I am constantly moving from one location to another. Each time I put the thing down, whether the camera was attached or not, the damn thing came out of balance. Meaning that I would have to spend 15-45 minutes getting it back into balance before being able to shoot again. This is a HUGE issue for me.The center post does not tighten down well enough to keep it from slipping from side to side. After just a few times using it, the coupler that holds the screw to tighten the up and down movement on the center post broke. I couldn't get it tight enough to hold, so it ended up breaking.I got fed up and sent it back for a replacement, thinking maybe it was just a faulty unit. I was wrong.After having issues with both units, I decided to up my game and invest in a Glidecam HD 2000 which was double the price, but far worth it. The adjustments were much easier, and the hardware was machined aluminum or steel, not plastic like the Flycam.I used the Glidecam for a few months, and decided to get a bit more crazy. I invested in a came-TV 7800 version which set me back about $1,500. At this point, far easier to adjust! It takes just 5 minutes, instead of 30. If you are willing to spend $250 on a Flycam, SAVE YOUR MONEY until you have enough to buy a Glidecam and you will not be sorry that you waited.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R24LECR1RYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005EF1R62#wasThisHelpful","R1R24LECR1RYG","A2SEG7IZFEI5U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SEG7IZFEI5U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This lens is terrible..I bought this lens as an ""all around"" lens for what I do. I am a videographer, and I shoot a lot of weddings, commercials, and music videos. I needed a lens that would allow me to get up close, as get images far away from the subject. This lens worked well for a little while, but then it stopped working. I have actually been through two of these lenses. The next time around, I will be getting a different lens.First issue: I use this lens with my Canon 70D for video. Almost every time I am shooting video, seconds into shooting I hear a ""click"" then an error message pops up on the screen saying ""please make sure the lens is attached"" then it tells me to attach the lens and press the record button to continue. For a while I used the lens for still photos only, or to shoot B roll when my 18-55mm lens wouldn't cut it. I learned that I would never use this for a live event because it's not dependable. I eventually replaced the lens with the same lens, assuming that it was a defect.. not the case. The new lens does the same thing.At this point, I decided that I really still NEED the lens, but I would adapt my operations and only use it for stills or B roll. So I take it on a portrait shoot with a new client and I notice a spot in the image that was not going away. I cleaned the sensor, lens both the front and back side, and ended up finding out that there was a piece of dust under the glass. I got through the shoot, and decided to edit the spot out of all of my images which was a HUGE pain.. Then, the next time I went to use it, I saw what appeared to be a small hair in between two pieces of glass inside the lens.I am simply done with this lens... It is apparently not sealed very well.Others may have a different experience, but I can't trust this one to keep up with what I need it for.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJL3EONGXXW4Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007WK8MQ#wasThisHelpful","RJL3EONGXXW4Y","A2SEG7IZFEI5U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SEG7IZFEI5U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do LOVE this quick release plate.. my ONLY gripe is that the bottom does NOT mount flush. What the hell were they thinking?There is a small pin that locks the mechanism in place so the camera doesn't accidentally fall out of place, the housing for the pin protrudes below the flat surface of the bottom leaving this really odd bump on the back left corner making it not sit flush if you have the plate mounted to a monopod or tripod as I do most of the time. I have had to install 3 washers between the plate and the monopod or tripod to allow enough clearance for the little bump on the left back corner. Really annoying!Other than that, the mount is excellent. It's made of sturdy steel with a nice large tightening ring on the bottom that doesn't feel like it'll be going anywhere anytime soon like some other ones that I've used in the past.If you have to use a quick release plate, this is the one to get.. as long as you can adapt to your images not being level.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BP4RK9BBSREZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001ASU1QO#wasThisHelpful","R3BP4RK9BBSREZ","A2SEG7IZFEI5U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SEG7IZFEI5U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Easy to use, really straight forward and simple to setup. You don't have to ""sync"" anything (at least I didn't) with my Canon 70D.I use Neewer TT560 flashes off camera with my 70D and have never had an issue. The trigger works by screwing into the hot shoe slot on the top of your camera, the flashes get screwed into the hot shoe slots on top of the receivers in this kit and there ya go! No more setup required.I do wish the bottom shoe mount on the receivers were something more than they are, but for the price you can't complain. The bottoms are flimsy plastic, and I feel like they are going to break with a heavy flash mounted to them.

"This battery grip is excellent.Keep in mind that I have never used a Canon branded battery grip, but I don't expect the Canon branded one to work any differently than this one.You get two battery trays, one for the Canon batteries, and a second for AA batteries. I recommend not using the AA batteries, unless you absolutely have no other option. The AA batteries die way too fast! I am a Videographer and use a Canon 70D for wedding videos, commercials, and promotional videos as well as music videos. This battery grip allows you to use 2 batteries at a time (if using regular Canon batteries) so you can literally double the usability time. For me, 2 batteries last 2-3 hours (for video) while running live view most of the time. I do turn off the camera when not in use, but it is on most of the time.The build quality is just fine, the buttons have a satisfying click to them. The only thing that I bring into question is the threads and housing on the bottom of the camera. I use this camera mostly on a tripod or monopod with a Manfrotto quick release tightly threaded into it. The bottom doesn't seem quite as sturdy as it could be, it could be that I am just overly worried about my camera falling off, but it has never done anything to suggest that it would.Overall, I would recommend this battery grip for anyone who needs to get more battery our of their camera for events where they don't have the time or ability to switch batteries constantly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E13AY71QJL22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GHALL1E#wasThisHelpful","R3E13AY71QJL22","A2SEG7IZFEI5U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SEG7IZFEI5U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Another great book from a brilliant mind! I have read other books from this author and have been greatly impressed by the unique writing and excellent plots. Once again, Erez Aharoni brings us a book that is more difficult to put down than the last.

Reading about kidnapping just hits home, it really makes you have feelings for these characters.

"I am so glad I found this stuff!Since I was little, my dad was always warning me about the harmful chemicals and additives in deodorant. I took it for granted all these years, but recently started doing my own research and decided to try some natural products for myself.I stumbled upon this stuff and I am so glad that I did. It has a clean, natural scent that is pleasant. My wife was a bit hesitant at first, but how she is using it as well. I love that it has no harmful chemicals and is all natural.

" 1:02 MinsI bought this aerator after hearing from some people I work with how amazing it is. I love how it comes with the little travel pouch so it is easy to carry around and know that it won't get damaged.The box is sturdy, and really makes the product stand out.The product itself is made of an acrylic that is really built to last. It is thick and feels very durable. It is also very easy to unscrew and clean, that is very important.I poured wine into two glasses, one of them with aerated wine had a marking on the bottom of the glass so I could tell afterwards. I blindfolded myself and drank from both glasses. There was a very defined difference between the two glasses. I am impressed!

They are much more durable than the typical stake you would find in just any hardware store. I just helped my neighbor put down some erosion blankets a while back, he used these stakes and was talking about how amazing they were.Most stakes I have used in the past have been made of a cheap plastic, most of which had the heads broken off before we got too far into the project, rendering them basically useless.

"My name is Katy, I thought I'd add my two cents for those of you considering buying this product. Baladea was recommended to me by two friends who raved about it, so I decided to try it. I have to say I’m absolutely amazed with the quality of these DVDs and my results. I have been able to lose 18 pounds in 4 weeks and feel great! I have tried several other workouts and diets in the past but they never really worked for me. The included guide explains what this product does differently: It combines new fitness exercises for calorie burning with wellness exercises for stress reduction. Together wellness and fitness help your body to better release stored fat for faster weight-loss. It really seems to work, I’ve have followed the program as recommended and my weight keeps dropping :) Ok, some other thoughts in random order: First of all, finally a workout system that’s specifically for women. Thank you Holly Perkins! Also, I want to add that it’s great to have so many different DVDs included. Every workout feels new and it the program doesn’t get boring. So overall this is a great product that actually works and I really, really like it. Highly recommended!-Katy","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F14Z25SL3GKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9P0TTU#wasThisHelpful","R2F14Z25SL3GKU","A2SEG7IZFEI5U2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SEG7IZFEI5U2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have struggled to take the pounds off that slowly packed on over the years. I have tried several ""diets"" but have failed miserably.The hardest part of any diet is the feeling that you are always hungry.

"For the last 15 years I have been addicted to Mountain Dew. I have tried to quit many times, but have failed miserably with every attempt.I was absolutely flabbergasted at how effective this product worked! I didn't have the nasty caffeine headaches like I did in my past attempts. I used to drink 100+ ounces of Mountain Dew every day, no kidding. No water at all. And I wondered why I gained so much weight over the years. I was drinking my calories. Now that I am no longer addicted, I drink water 99% of the time, and I feel great! I have lost some weight in the process, as a byproduct. I now have more energy. I have even been inspired to join a Gym and get back down to my high school weight once and for all.If you are looking to rid yourself of your addiction to caffeine, this product really does work!

"I love this product. I have used some other Big Mike's fitness products and have loved them, so when I found this I knew I had to give it a try. It is easy and painless to install, and easier to use.You can easily pull it down in seconds in the event that you don't have a door that you can leave it on all the time. It rests securely on the door frame and feels very sturdy.The build quality is nice and it is comfortable to use. That is where the comfort ends!If you struggle to get to the gym, or if like me later on in the day after visiting the gym, you itch for an extra little burn, you can easily do some chin ups with this bar.You can also pull it down and use it for push ups which are always great, easy, and very effective. If you spend your money on one piece of fitness equipment, get this one. It offers multiple workouts with one purchase.You can get an upper body workout in just a few minutes a day.Having this thing hanging from the door you look at every day makes it a constant reminder that you need to work out. That makes it much more difficult to make excuses for why you shouldn't get to the gym.

At the first sight of sun, my boys started begging to go outside, but after a few days they seemed to get sick of the sand box. When I found this swing set, I ordered it as a surprise for my twins' birthday and set it up when their friends came over to play. Much to my amazement, two weeks later, they are still playing on it every day as much as they can.Swing sets seemed so overrated to me until now. They love it, and I love the free time to fold laundry, vacuum, and wash dishes..The swing set itself is made of durable steel, and comes with all hardware and instructions necessary to set it up. You can choose to cement it in the ground permanently, or leave it above ground as I did so it can be moved if you want to.

I also love that I got them while they were on sale, so I thought I would write a review so other people out there know what to expect.I dig the coloring, the light wash is a nice touch. They fir just right on the hips, carefully designed to fit snug on the thigh, but leave plenty of room with the flared leg opening.The stitching is top notch, with nothing left to be desired. The material itself is perfect, not too thick, but not too thin. You can tell they took special care when designing these jeans.

It is an easy addition to any pack without adding any weight, or unwanted bulk. It is easy to use because all you have to do is drink out of the straw.

"For years I have used several diets that simply went nowhere. When I was younger, I worked jobs that required me to lift heavy weight all day long so I was always fit. After a while, I started damaging my back so I got myself a desk job. The sad thing is that I didn't change my eating habits. It used to be that I could eat anything that I wanted, and still maintain my fitness level because I was literally burning thousands of calories daily. When I got my desk job, I didn't change my eating habits, and I never questioned it. I always knew that I was gaining weight, but I never knew how bad it was until I hopped on the scale and saw 300 pounds.I knew that I needed to do something! I did some research, a LOT of research. I had to literally re-learn how to eat. I know that sounds ridiculous, but as humans, we are trained wrong. The food guide pyramid is just wrong. We need more veggies, more fruits, less carbs, and some healthy fats. This book literally changed my life! By implementing the strategies found in this book, I am down 22 pounds in about 3 months.I am not saying that you will lose 22 pounds in 3 months, you may lose more, or less. What it comes down is your discipline, which I used to have none of.It's NOT about dieting. That word needs to be stricken from the dictionary. You need to never diet again!

"It's hard to imagine that this is the same the author of wonderful books like Lord of Fire and Lord of Ice.  I hate to be mean spirited but this book and the preceding novella are just terrible. I purchased them because I thought Foley was going back to the style of her Knight's Family Series. Not so. This historical romance not only has an unredeemable man-whore hero and a complete idiot for a heroine but literally overflows with contemporary dialogue.  Too bad. Another previously auto-buy author bites the dust.To digress-It seems that my list keeps getting smaller and smaller.  Gone is Mary Jo Putney, Julia Quinn,and  now Foley.  I have mixed feelings over Madeline Hunter and Eloisa James.  Elizabeth Hoyt is very good and Mary Balogh is excellent. I wish Joanna Bourne would write another book and am hoping against hope that Cold Hearted Rake by Lisa Kleypas is excellent.

"I don't know what it is about the combination of Regency Rakes and Christmas but it's simply divine. Perhaps it's that I love to see historical bad boys reformed during the most magical time of year.  Or its perhaps it's that I love reading about all that warm wonderful holiday spirit.  Or perhaps it's really for the mistletoe scenes (ok, I admit it! ;)).  Luckliy, you get all three in Christmas at Rakehell Manor. On one hand there is Hugo, the elusive and secretive Lord living in the scandalously dubbed Rakehell Manor.  What exactly is going on in there? What of all the whispers and rumors of shocking behavior and... orgies? On the other hand, there is Prue, the sensible and highly capable companion, able to handle any situation thrown at her with aplomb.  But will she be able to handle being forced to take refuge at the Manor? What will she think of the goings on in there? Will she uncover the secrets of the mysterious Lord? Would she even dare to?It's wonderful to see these two characters slowly open up to each other healing their wounded hearts. And the back drop of the impending holidays couldn't have set the scene any better.I read it in one sitting, couldn't put it down.

"I wasn't entirely sure about this odd looking teardrop shaped iron until I used it.  Surprised it worked so well. The wand produced some very nice beach style waves on my long hair (see photos).  And the curls only got better looking (more relaxed) as the day wore on.I think there is a lot of confusion about how to use an iron without a clip, so I tried to explain that visually with a photo in the images section.****You are NOT supposed to touch wand/iron with your gloved hand, let alone hold it there. The glove is meant to protect hand from an ACCIDENTAL touch. Look at the photo on the side of the box and please read the instructions. Also, nowhere on the box or in the instructions does it state that there are multiple heat settings but rather interchangeable barrels you can purchase.Here's what I think of the teardrop wand.PRO-creates very nice beach style waves-great for long hair-easy to use after you get the hang of it-barrel can be removed and replaced with other shape (conical etc)-inexpensive compared to other brands-smooth barrel-swivel cord-barrel rest prevents counter surface damageCON-only one heat setting (410)-you have to buy the other barrels (couldn't Remington just include them?)-not for shorter hair lengths, hair would wind up sticking out in kinky anglesRecommended for longer hair lengths seeking easy beach waves.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KRGC0YYVJEQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H345TXO#wasThisHelpful","R3KRGC0YYVJEQB","A2NICGGIGIFU22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NICGGIGIFU22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second pair of these gloves that I have purchased for my 10yr soccer goalie son. One pair lasted him an entire travel season (granted, at the end they were, to put it mildly, disgusting).  I use the goalie glove soap one these to keep them lasting longer. The finger guards are the reason I purchased them. Prevents injury but also limits mobility. Its a trade off he is willing to live with until he gets older and better.Recommended","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K680AWCJGF6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BO7PXHS#wasThisHelpful","R2K680AWCJGF6H","A2NICGGIGIFU22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NICGGIGIFU22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've had the curl secret for over a year. While it does an excellent job of achieving a certain type of curl, it doesn't  necessarily  replace a curling iron.PRO-achieves a consist curl on both sides or your head-easy to use once you get the hang of it (great for anyone who struggles with using an iron)-the absolute best part of the this iron is that hair is heated on BOTH sides so curls LAST LONG! Sometimes days with minor touch ups!-multiple heat settings allows a variety of curl coil (tight or loose)-Perfect for above the shoulder length hair.CON-really only makes one type of curl, either loose of tight depending on how long you hold it (vs. an iron where you can alternate direction, thickness etc)-takes waaaay longer than an iron because you can only curl VERY small sections of hair at a time-HEAVY! If you have a lot of hair be prepared for an arm workout!-tangles hair. No matter how many times I have curled my hair over the year, I ALWAYS tangle (at least one piece of) my hair.  Its probably because I'm frustrated by how long it takes so I take sections that are too wide into the machine.-tangles (getting hair stuck in machine) hurts a lot! Its one of those OW!!! ""Get this thing off my hair!"" moments. Its a mad rush to reverse and unplug before permanent damage happens.-the longer the hair, the more likely it tangles-price. You can get the same look with a curling iron for much less moneyOverall I would recommend the curl secret for anyone with above the shoulder length hair and/or anyone who has trouble using a curling iron.*see my curl secret photo for long hair in customer images","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YTA9XDXRW3LZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E68O4JU#wasThisHelpful","R2YTA9XDXRW3LZ","A2NICGGIGIFU22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NICGGIGIFU22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I felt like I was entering the twilight zone reading this book. Everything seemed the same but yet everything was different. What the hell has been happening to the last several books? Where's the drama, the camaraderie and the dam action?!?! I felt like the whole book was compartmentalized into Wrath/Beth, Assail/Sola, Trez/Serena and Xcor/Layla.  Barely anyone else was mentioned or interacted with. So unlike the beginning books of this series.My proof that we are in the Twilight Zone-1- NO lessers (Come on, there are more letters in the alphabet to use! What about a Mr. S, Mr. M, or Mr. P?) Miss the Omega.2- Band of B's - Xcor just decides, yup, I'm going to put the whole ""overthrow the king"" thing on the back burner while I go shopping for some new duds to impress my ""pregnant by another dude"" pseudo girlfriend.  So the big scary (oh I'm shaking in my boots thinking about the creepy lip) leader is shopping at Macy's?!?!? Huh. Wonder if he bought Tommy Hilfiger or Ralph Lauren. And where the hell is Qhuinn?!?!?3- No Shellans. Hello? Was Beth the only one in this book? Blink and you miss the slight mention of the others. They used to be so prominent in previous books. Everyone worked together like a FAMILY. They ate together, they played together, they laughed together, they worked out together etc.  The whole family life seems to be crumbling.  I miss the mundane. It was so endearing. I want to read about them hanging out and watching movies, playing billiards and other stuff.4- Finish what you started. Way too many new characters with unresolved issues. Am I supposed to forget about Murdher and Lassiter while Assail, Xcor, Trez and iAm come into the picture? I want to invest time into a character and CARE about them. I don't want drips and drops here and there.5- Lacks depth and information. For example -Shadow -OK so Trez and iAm are shadows or whatever Ward calls them. Well, what about them? What can or cannot they do specifically? Who and Where are their people? What are their rituals/customs? How are integrated into the Vampire community? I felt like this was a huge missed opportunity.  Remember all the details about sympaths in the previous books? Well, what about the shadows?And those things are just off the top of my head!Sigh. OK, I finished my vent and I probably would not have been as harsh if I hand't recently re-read my favorite parts of previous books. I didn't completely dislike the book.  There are certainly parts of it that I enjoyed (Wrath/Beth) but the rest was just unremarkable and uninspiring to say the least. Nothing close to what Ward is capable of and thats the problem.  Spectacular this is not.  Praying to the Scribe Virgin the next one is better.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R392TMZ9MT870Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGZIC24#wasThisHelpful","R392TMZ9MT870Z","A2NICGGIGIFU22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NICGGIGIFU22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm all for all natural products and am willing to pay extra to purchase them over synthetics, but I'm torn with this burn relief gel. It works as advertised (relieved my pinkish mild shoulder burn) but I didn't care for the brownish gel. It left stains on my white clothing and bedding. I waited 20 minutes after applying and the gel seemed to be completely absorbed but still stains. Perhaps I applied too much? Not sure, but when in pain, I like to put a nice layer of burn relief on.  The texture of the gel is weird too. Its more of a slimy gel verses  gels that I'm used to (if that makes any sense).

"I like this restorative oil. I use 3-4 pumps on my damp (post washing) mid-back length highlighted blonde hair.  My hair is rather thick and absorbs the oil well.  Afterwards I allow my hair to air dry.  The result is nice soft manageable hair.  I never use oils on my hair when it is dry, the result is usually greasy looking.I think you have to be careful about the amount you use though. Its very easy to wind up with an oily looking head. I would only recommend this to people with thicker hair.  Any other type of hair might get severely weighed down.For anyone interested in trying hair oils, at this price point, its worth a try.For highlighted or bleached hair I highly recommend my absolute favorite Kerastase Elixir Ultime.

"I would give this book 10 stars if I could.  Seriously, I think it's that good.  I won't spoil it for anyone but there is a clever twist in the book which separates it from the average bluestocking/libertine romance, but this is not what blew me over.  The yearning to absolute anguish the hero( Ian ) and heroine (Corinna) go through in this book is remarkable, particularly the last gut wrenching quarter of the book.  Neither of these two believe their love is reciprocated, so they stay silent about it.  Every meeting thereafter is an emotional roller coaster till the end.  I absolutely loved that.Reminded me very much of Judith McNaught's emotional writing style.**Coincidentally, I read the author's note at the end and she mentioned that Truly Madly Yours (one of my favorite contemporary romances) was one of her inspirations for the My Lady, My Lord.  I highly recommend this book if you enjoyed Gibson's book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39M0CKAAEIJPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IXTQ4B4#wasThisHelpful","R39M0CKAAEIJPR","A2NICGGIGIFU22","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2NICGGIGIFU22?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In general, I like Toni&Guy Shampoo and Conditioner.  Used together it left my long bleach blonde hair soft and manageable.  The smell is pleasant and not overpowering.

"The Wrath of Cain (Syndicate #1)By: Kathy Coopmans3/5 starsCain & Calla were star-crossed lovers. Their fathers hated each other and thus they weren’t allowed to spend time with each other, let alone date one another. Instead, they were forced to hide their relationship and sneak around. But at 18 years old, they thought that their parents would have to acknowledge their relationship if they were married, so they eloped. To say that their parents were less than happy is an understatement.After Cain goes to tell his father & step-mother, Calla shows up later only to find him in bed with another woman. She is devastated & heartbroken. She ends up leaving and going to college & law school out of country. We didn’t get to see any of these intermittent years, they were only briefly described. Then six years later she returns to Cain to have him sign divorce papers, but it doesn’t go as planned.There are betrayals, there is danger there is hot sex and intrigue. There is some loathing and love. Feelings and emotions are all over the place and at times, cause whiplash.I loved the premise of this book, but sadly, it missed the mark. I wished there was more time for us to see the relationship between Cain & Calla to develop when they were just high schoolers. I wanted to see the love blossom & grow between them. But I didn’t, so I didn’t really feel their soul-deep connection. Therefore, I didn’t really care for how quickly and easily she fell right back in with Cain & without much discussion. It was like, insta-love, insta-forgiveness, insta-now & insta-future. I just didn’t feel their love or connection.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11V6JMX7PDLD5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015WIJV18#wasThisHelpful","R11V6JMX7PDLD5","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Crave (Bayonet Scars #5.5)By: JC Emery4/5 starsElle Phillips has long since had a difficult, strained and sometimes estranged relationship with her father, Chief, a now deceased member of the Forsaken Motorcycle Club. Her only real connection to Forsaken was mainly through Grady as they had been friends with benefits for years. Grady was 10+ years older than Elle and also her father’s best friend. At first this also made me wonder if she had daddy issues, which she actually did. But once Grady hooked up with Holly, Elle was dropped faster than he even had a thought.Diesel has had a long crush on Elle and always believed that she deserved better than Grady ever treated her and more than he ever offered her. Diesel wants Elle, but has never crossed any line with her because of her connection with Grady. But he ends up keeping tabs on Elle for Grady and thus getting to know her a little better.Elle is a private detective and when she gets a case that also involves club business she knows that she can’t talk to anyone in the club about her newest assignment. But Diesel is determined to stick with her. He doesn’t know her assignment either, but will never leave her high and dry.What I didn’t like about this novella was the insta-love. There wasn’t time for their relationship to develop and thus deeper feelings. I think that it could have been done better had the author shown us the getting to know each other period and all the times that Diesel spent checking in on her. But those weren’t expounded upon, only his last visit.There are some crazy revelations and I can hardly wait for the next book because the personal drama in that one should be ramped up!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM1DK5P63MGVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017HQ50N6#wasThisHelpful","RM1DK5P63MGVB","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He joined the Hellions after returning home and knowing Shooter and wanting to belong to a family. Therefore, he seems to mainly be a loner.Purple Pu$$y Pamela is a barfly, someone that is just there to provide a good time to the club members.

"Reaper’s Fall (Reaper’s MC #5)By: Joanna Wylde5/5 starsPainter and Melanie have had a rocky, up and down history. Painter has been a member of the Reaper’s MC for years, ever since he was released from prison the first time. He’s been a jerk from the time that he first played a bigger part of a book. During the book Devil’s Game, he led Em on for a while and when he finally got his patch, instead of going for her, he went for the club girls, which drove Em into the arms of Hunter, a Devil’s Jacks member. Then in book 4, Reaper’s Stand, Painter followed London for Picnic and also hung out with Melanie to keep her occupied while she was also living at Picnic’s. We learned a lot more about Painter & Melanie during Puck’s book, book 1 of the Silver Valley series. This book occurs almost within the same time frame as Puck’s book.The book starts from when Painter gets out of prison with Puck and being back in Idaho. But he has his doubts about Melanie. She is just too pure and innocent for him and the life he has lived and will continue to live as a member of the Reaper’s MC. But the connection they had was too much for either one to deny and though Painter tries to stay away, he and Melanie spend time together which develops into something more and then something deeper than that. But of course something goes sideways, causing a separation.Melanie loves Painter and has for years. She wrote to him throughout the 5 years while he was in prison with Puck. So she wants to start a relationship with him right away. She spends time pining over Painter’s avoidance. But when they start something, she’s ecstatic for the entire time, until things get a little too real, and their circumstances change. Melanie makes decisions about her life and the future and does what she has to in order to get through it all. But when Painter re-enters her life, she doesn’t have room for him.Now, many readers had a total, full-on hate relationship with Painter, because he does have a tendency to say things & act like a jerk.

"Slut (Twin Duo #2)By: Jettie Woodruff5/5 starsThe cliffhanger at the end of book 1, Suit, made it hard for me to focus on other books. I kept coming back to it and hashing things over in my head about it. I talked it over with a group of friends and we all had theories and if someone had a different theory, then it started the discussion all over again.I feel that if I review this book like I normally review, that it will spoil it. And this is definitely a book that you need to read and discover the truths for yourself. I absolutely loved this book and stayed up super late to finish it, because I just had to know what happened!Gabby still has no memory, and she tries to figure out more of what her life was about. You’ll love Paxton, then hate him, understand him and not understand anything about him and then love him again. Their daughters are still as adorable as ever, who will make you laugh and make you think deeply.So many things were answered, and a couple new questions arose. I really didn’t want this book to end, I wanted more! And Jettie announced via Facebook that there will be a follow-up novella around Christmas time, so it may include the holiday time for the Pierce family as well.*I was provided an Advanced Copy in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DHEFL654Z2L2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0184EPJ40#wasThisHelpful","R1DHEFL654Z2L2","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Coup De Grâce (Code 11-KDP SWAT #7)By: Lani Lynn Vale4/5 starsMichael is known as Saint to the SWAT officers because of his caring & ability to take care of the people that they rescue, especially the children. But Michael also holds himself a part from the team because he fights different demons. Michael actually went to college to follow the family footsteps into the medical field before he became a Navy Seal, where he became great friends with Nico & Bennett and Foster & Miller.Nikki Pena is Nico’s younger sister, and has been attracted to Michael for years. Previously they had a relationship, but that went belly-up for reasons unknown to all their friends and the readers. Well, we finally figure it out and it turns out to be a poorly worded argument/reason and an ensuing misunderstanding between the characters. Nikki is a nurse in the hospital where quite a few of the heroines of this series and the Freebirds series work.The personal, familial & work drama was all intriguing. But the past drama between Michael & Nikki seemed to be resolved way too easily and almost immediately once they resume actually speaking to each other, which happens early in the book. It just seemed like it was glossed over and for me that seemed to cheapen their valid argument when they went their separate ways. I just felt like I needed more communication between them than just a few lines and they jump back into a relationship like nothing ever happened.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MTWYK4WK6XP2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013H3U2ZO#wasThisHelpful","R2MTWYK4WK6XP2","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Beyond Her Words (Corrupt Chaos MC #1)By: Bink Cummings5/5 starsMagdalene has had a rough life for the last 10 years. She’s been on her own without any living family or friends. She’s always been a bit different having been raised by her grandmother in rural Kansas on a small plot of land. She grew up gardening, raising some small animals and falling in love with the boy next door and learning all about vehicle mechanics & restoration. But for the last 10 years, Magdalene has lived in just as many one-horse towns, working odd jobs, living and even dating, before moving on again. But on her last trip, a storm forces her to pull over, which turned into a much longer stay than just pumping some gas.Lachlan is a firefighter and brother in the Corrupt Chaos MC and to top it all off, he’s Scottish! Bink does provide some common translations for how Lachlan pronounces some words and speaks. This wasn’t hard for me to read, and I found myself reading with an accent. Lachlan is a wonderful father, loyal to the core and a gentle giant. Though, he does have the ability to be a jerk at times, as well. That does seem to come from his inability to understand women, and possibly because of the way he was raised, since most everyone around him seems to know that he can be a total jerk.Both Magdalene & Lachlan suffer from doubts and insecurities that have built up over the years that have also caused scars. Slowly but surely, they begin to open up and show feelings. For the first time in years, Magdalene opens up to the possibility of having real friends and Lachlan has to confront his fears so that he can move forward.The supporting characters were so fleshed out that I really felt like I knew them all. I was almost just as invested in their side stories as I am about Lachlan & Magdalene’s. I’m looking forward to more in this series, I’m very intrigued!! I wasn’t ready for the book to end and I’m also sad that Lachlan isn’t a real man out there, but will remain a great book boyfriend!The writing style is similar to Bink MC Chronicles series, but she has really grown as an author and I think this book really shows it.*I was provided with an Advanced Copy in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37NGMYGSR2Z8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01837G95G#wasThisHelpful","R37NGMYGSR2Z8X","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tequila NightsBy: Melissa Jane5/5 starsThis is Melissa Jane’s first foray into contemporary romance and I think she nailed it. I loved her dark cartel series and was excited to hear that she had something different in the works. She had nothing to be concerned about switching up the genres for this book. I fell in love with the characters and their friends.Josie is a college art student and somewhat of a natural klutz a condition that is exacerbated when she’s nervous. She’s chasing not only her dream but also her mother’s. Her mother was a gifted art student, who later developed Alzheimer’s and died early. Josie is following her advice to paint the world beautiful, while also following her love of art.Leo is a perfect gentleman who also likes to get down and dirty. He’s a genuinely nice guy, a man who knows how to treat a woman, who is sensual and has a love of life in general. He is a giver and a pleaser, but all alpha in his wants, needs and Josie seems to pull that side of him to the surface even more than usual.Leo & Josie are a passionate couple who found each other by chance, had an attraction and developed a relationship even with a pending separation headed their way. I love the way they are together and though everything happens quickly, it doesn’t feel like insta-love at all. I was thoroughly intrigued by the side characters as well. Since this is a stand-alone, I was glad that Melissa Jane also wrapped up the side characters stories and didn’t leave me hanging.*I was provided with an Advanced Copy in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3R3E8U0Y8IH9T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017ODW5WG#wasThisHelpful","R3R3E8U0Y8IH9T","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blood & LoyaltiesBy: Ryan Michele4/5 starsThe Lambardoni family runs a large enterprise that spans all across the United States. Catarina Lambardoni, the only daughter, amongst her brothers, to the underboss of the family, grew up knowing about the type of business her family was a part of. Though she can’t be involved in the family business, because of her gender, it doesn’t mean that she hasn’t picked up things along the way. Her brothers made sure that she could use a gun well and knew how to protect herself. However, they are so protective over her that she doesn’t always get the chance to use her self-defense skills or date any good men. Her brothers scare men off or dissuade them from even trying to date her. She needs someone who isn’t afraid to stand up to her family.Jag Maratelli works for the Lambardoni family and is the consigliere. But he’s not well known around the area since he runs the family distribution business in California. When he sees Catarina for the first time he is taken by her beauty & ferocity. He wants to know her better and in more ways than one. However, this is something that could cause tension since she is family, he won’t be in town long term and she won’t move to California. Despite everything that works against them, they get close to each other and form a relationship.But past sins of fathers come back to haunt the young couple. This causes a physical separation since Jag has to find the men causing problems. More things happen which puts more time between them and now, emotional separation. Their road back to each other may not be easy, but it is something that will happen.I liked this book, but it felt like it was missing something compared to Ryan’s Ravage MC series. There were some parts that seemed like they were added, just to create a little bit of drama, that didn’t seem to go with the storyline. But I liked it well enough and will most likely read the rest of this series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R382YFPWCF5KQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014V9O8K8#wasThisHelpful","R382YFPWCF5KQL","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Calm & Storm (Night Horde SoCal #6)By: Susan Fanetti5/5 starsThis is the epic conclusion to not only the Night Horde SoCal series but I believe to the Night Horde series all together. There will be a standalone book for Nolan (Havoc & Corey’s son) that will still be about the Horde, but will not be the start of a series.Ronin is a bit older, more than 50, and he’s always been the quiet one of the club. He’s never been into the all-night parties or crazy shenanigans. He joined the service at the age of 30 and joined club life late as well. He was just a prospect, for the Scorpions, during the Signal Bend series when they went to war with the Perros Cartel. But he’s a loyal man to his very core and even though he voted against getting in bed with La Zorra & her Cartel, he does everything that is needed & required of him. But he’s one of the few who still sticks with a “straight” job, even though he has more money than he needs and has no family. But he enjoys his stunt riding for TV and movie productions. While working, he happens to see the woman who broke his heart 25 years earlier. They are a bit awkward, but both seem to want to catch up.Lorraine aka Rainy felt like she had no choice but to walk away from Ronin when he left her to join the military & go to war. But so many years later, she still regrets it. She refers to Ronin as her ‘Great Lost Love.’ But that’s the thing about life; you can never go back and get the chance to redo anything, you can only move forward. Rainy did several of the things she had always dreamed of doing. She was married & has a son, became a chef & now owns a restaurant. So when she sees Ronin again after all these years, she just has to try to get to know him and see if there is anything there left to rekindle. But there has been so much time go by and water that has passed under the bridge, that they are almost 2 completely different people.The club is also dealing with burying some of the brothers in previous books and the need for more members & prospects in order to be there when the war goes down. In the last book, we learned La Zorra’s plans to “salt the earth” and essentially end the drug producing land & trade in Mexico. This was also information that the officers voted not to share with the whole club. Not all officers agreed, specifically Connor, and the tension between Connor & his dad, Hoosier is not only obvious, but almost in everyone’s face. This causes concern and some discontent within the club in general and Ronin. But he is loyal and trusts his officers. But the war is still coming to La Zorra, and thus, the SoCal Horde, so they all prepare.There are twists and turns to Ronin and Rainy’s story. She really made me mad and it was kind of difficult for me to like her, which did eventually happen, but not in the sense that I loved her character. Ronin was almost too Zen at times, but that was an admirable quality.There was club craziness, in which people were harmed, which was to be expected. Even losing a character/s would be par for the course. I loved seeing many of the Signal Bend characters at a couple points during this book. Isaac & Lilli, the two who started it all off are my favorite. But we also saw Showdown & Shannon, Badger, who is the Signal Bend President, Len & Natasha, and some of the younger guys like Nolan, Double A & Dom. Susan Fanetti knows how to write emotional, gut-wrenching scenes, love scenes, high-energy scenes & steamy, hot scenes. She always delivers. This book made me feel happy, sad, bitter, loving, bittersweet & hopeful. For me, Ronin & Rainy’s love story came in second to the club story and how Susan was going to tie everything up for this series. This book ends at 78% which is where the epilogue novella, Home & Safe, starts and ends at 100%.I can’t go into the description about the novella because that would give away a major plot point. But it brings everything full circle and wraps up both Night Horde series. I cried almost through whole chapters of the epilogue novella. Susan Fanetti draws out the emotion almost effortlessly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UW42AV5JO0XO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DZ4T5C#wasThisHelpful","R3UW42AV5JO0XO","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty in Ink (Bodies Ink & Steel #2)By: Scott Hildreth5/5 starsI love Stevie & have since she was introduced in book 1, Blurred Lines. She’s a foul-mouthed Kansas transplant from San Diego, California. She’s openly stated that she only dates bikers. But her choice of men in the past hasn’t been good. She’s unfortunately attracted the men who are financially dependent upon her or who use her as a punching bag. She’s loud, in your face and no apologies are given. She’s fully sleeved and a tattoo artist at Blurred Lines and has been a tattoo artist for years.Asher Wilson has lived in the Midwest his entire life. He’s wealthy in his own right as a day trader. As an only child, his parents were overprotective so he was homeschooled, mostly by a caregiver, who also provided him with almost the only love that he felt. They only wanted the best for him, but the thing he felt like he missed out on was love shown & given to him by his parents and having friends. His parents seem to base his and their own self-worth off of his financial statements and his success.Wilson & Stevie meet by chance at a grocery store and though Stevie tries her best to snark her way out of a conversation with him. But they end up talking, since Wilson wasn’t deterred. He asked her on a date, and though he wasn’t what she always thought was her type, she decided to give him a chance.Stevie learns to love herself and that she is worth all the showering of attention that Wilson pays her. She starts to blossom as a human and woman learning to trust again with him. In turn, Stevie gives a new meaning to Wilson’s life. It’s not all work, money, working out and business. She revives his spirit and teaches him about living his life. They may have some doubts and times when they are down, but with hard work, those don’t last.Wilson is truly a gentleman and damn near Prince Charming. I love the guy and hope that every woman out there finds her Wilson. A good thing to remember, is taking chances often bring the greatest rewards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUJ5NDX2G7WO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178VNZ2I#wasThisHelpful","RKUJ5NDX2G7WO","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blood of Eve (Trilogy of Eve #2)By: Pam Godwin5/5 starsAt the end of the first book, Eve, her three guardians, Roark, Michio & Lakota aka Jesse and the 2 guardsmen, Georges & Tallis, all return to the Blue Ridge Mountains to the other 3 Lakota. They are 2 years into the apocalypse, with the virus that turns men into aphid monsters, turns women into nymphs and has killed all the children. But they are also returning with answers & possibly a solution to the problem, an antidote to the virus, Evie’s blood.In all of the testing and with some experimentation, they have learned that Evie’s blood causes the aphids to explode, but is able to cure the nymphs, bringing them back to human life. After a brief resting period, the group sets out searching for nymphs to heal. They traverse much of the United States looking for nymphs, because women are needed to start repopulating. And Evie is still refusing to have any more children. It is necessary to heal as many nymphs as possible. But they face more challenges than just the aphids, running out of ammo and keeping safe from other, probably dangerous survivors and surviving the wilds themselves. The aphids are no longer just mindless monsters, they are evolving.They all learn more about each other during this time. Finally, we know why Jesse won’t allow himself to be physically involved with Evie and his visions. Jesse desperately wishes to have a deeper relationship with Evie, but holds back. Michio is also hiding secrets, some that are about him and some that are about Evie. Michio is still the slightly jealous and possessive man in love with Evie. Roark is still deeply loyal, protective and in love with Evie. Roark is still laid back and easy going about sharing Evie with the other guardians. His views on his priesthood celibacy are evolving, and it is so HOT! All of the sexual encounters are off the charts!There are twists and turns, and plot lines that make you just wonder WTF is going on?! This entire book is just as well mapped-out and planned as the first book. I’m in awe of how Pam Godwin’s mind worked this entire storyline out. The amount of time that she must have spent researching and then making sure everything worked out damn near perfectly, had to have been in the hundreds range. But Pam delivers with this novel in a HUGE way!!There were definite sad parts, heart stopping points, funny & sarcastically funny conversations, but most of all, there is hope. There is hope for the future, for humankind and for the group. It may have been a bittersweet ending, but I was filled with so much hope and love. I’m excited for the final book. I know Pam has a couple other books in the works before finishing up this series, but I have no doubt that it’ll be worth the wait and every bit as epic as the first 2 books.*I received an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review, but I also bought my own copy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30BA4F1GAZLLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B017AL87Z6#wasThisHelpful","R30BA4F1GAZLLI","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chasing Claire (Hell’s Saints MC #2)By: Paula Marinaro4/5 starsClaire Winston is Raine’s (h from book 1) younger sister, who is a recovering drug addict. In the first book, we realize that Claire is more vulnerable & not as mentally strong as her sister. But during her time recovering at the lake house, she & Reno started spending more time with each other and were getting along well. But something happened and they both went their separate ways. In this book, we learn what it was that caused them to separate.Reno is Dolly’s son & nephew to Prosper, the Crownsmount chapter, Hell’s Saints President. At first, he didn’t really care for Raine and the way everyone bent over backwards to help her out. But at first sight of Claire, he knew she was different than he expected and he not only wanted her, but wanted to be with her.They both let their own insecurities get in the way and then they let their hurt feelings get in the way. When Claire tried to go back and explain, Reno had already been to hurt & pissed off to listen. That’s when he went to the West Coast for club business and spent some time out there. But the pull to be with Claire eventually hit him and he just had to get home to be with her. But he was epically stupid, but in the end, it only kind of mattered to her, which I felt was not true to Claire’s personality or if it was, it made her lust-driven or she has a low self-worth.There is club drama and some personal drama, which all goes with the flow. I am intrigued by Reno’s mom, Dolly and her possibilities in the future, and also I hope that Glory and Jules eventually get their own book.I did get annoyed with Claire in this book. She still had so much insecurity and feelings of inadequacy so late in the book that it just got to where it was tedious and made me roll my eyes. By that time, I just wanted the book to be over.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTE0HYZQIS1SC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015EUTI58#wasThisHelpful","RTE0HYZQIS1SC","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Taming Crow (Hell’s Saints MC #3)By: Paula Marinaro4/5 starsI have loved Crow since book 1, when he befriended Raine and took a shot with her. But at the same time I was also mad at him for hiding that he was married, even if it was a marriage that he wanted out of. I felt sad for him when he lost Raine because he truly did love her as well and those feelings never went away, even as he watched her life morph into dreams of happiness when she married his MC brother Diego, and had a daughter with him. In book 2, Crow knew that he had to make a change and went Nomad, where he didn’t have a home charter and was on the road all the time, doing the work the club needed done. Crow decided to do that to take time to clear his mind and hopefully gain peace of mind and heart.Melissa is a single mother, widowed when her Air Force pilot husband died in a crash while on tour in the Middle East. She lives with her young son, Jett, and is a massage therapist. Her life is simple & quiet, until she meets her new landlord, Crow. While her entire world was orderly & tidy, having Crow around just has her about to combust with all the differences that are driving her haywire. But she can also see how good he is to her son & how her son responds to having a strong male influence in his life.There isn’t much club drama, though I think that it could be boiling in the background. This book is more about the personal lives of Crow & Melissa. But I didn’t like all of this. Crow never talked to Melissa about the club and its importance in his life. While Melissa told him her life story, he never opened up and told her about his. So even though they were supposed to be falling for each other and in love, I didn’t always feel their connection. It also took them a long time to have the getting together conversation and to actually become a couple. The epilogue jumped in time, and to me the whole ending felt rushed.We did get to see some of the Crownsmount club members & their families a couple different times throughout the book, Jules probably the most. Then we also got to meet several of the club members from the Hell’s Saints chapter that was just an hour away from Crow’s house. I don’t know if the author is planning a spin-off series, but I wouldn’t mind a Charity-Tommy book, but who knows. I’m still hoping that Glory and Jules get their book.At the end of the book, I kind of felt lost, like I didn’t know where the characters were going from the end of the book and where the author is taking the storyline. Granted, this book was billed as being able to be read as a standalone (and it can) but I don’t know what Crow & Melissa’s plans are for the future or where this series is going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IL9LV86Q5D8R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016GXMUA2#wasThisHelpful","R2IL9LV86Q5D8R","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full Circle (Rockin’ Country #3)By: Laramie Briscoe4/5 starsThis is the final part of Garrett & Hannah’s story. They are married and have made the best of their situation of being located in California and Tennessee. Hannah had also already decided to take at least a year off from her grueling schedule, seeing as she has been going non-stop for six years. She also took the time so she could spend it with her husband, while his band finished recording their new record and then going on a world tour.Hannah had some disagreements with Shell, her best friend and manager, mostly about the time being taken off and how much time she was spending with her husband, instead of her career. But they get things ironed out and Shell is happy to try something new and just for herself, for the first time in her adult life.Other than some issues with the paparazzi, life is going pretty well for the newlyweds. They are enjoying their time on the road together. Some nights they perform their song together and of course they both upload photos to their Instagram social media accounts.Jared & Shell have a little bit bigger parts in this book and we see more behind both of them. We see some of the bad and some of the good and a lot of the apprehension. But things are somewhat up in the air for them. They will be getting their own book. Though those probably will be something that I will skip, as these books were all good, but not stand out enough that I want to continue on with the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CI1JQYYKXD9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH6UZE6#wasThisHelpful","R2CI1JQYYKXD9Z","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Cassie (Mitchell Healy #7)By: Jennifer Foor3/5 starsOk, so I may be the exception to the rule in my review of this book. I don’t generally give spoilers, but there will be some at the bottom of the review to explain my rating.Cassie Healy is 22 and has a boyfriend that her parents disapprove of. She still lives at home, even though she works and pays her parents rent, they still feel like they can tell her what to do and who to see, which she absolutely hates.Cassie feels the only way that she can be with her boyfriend, Brant, is if they run away together. So they head to Las Vegas to get out from under her family and to start a new life there. Brant hasn’t exactly been truthful about his new job and their living arrangements. Cassie has a hard time accepting that this is her new life and that Brant has gotten them both into some criminal scheme. She’s ashamed, but she loves Brant and just can’t give up on him yet, plus she’s also too embarrassed to call home & return to her family.Cassie has issues accepting her new reality. Unfortunately, in order to deal with this, she seeks the help of drugs. Cassie ends up changing into a person she never thought she’d be, doing things that would be unacceptable to her if she was clean & sober.Her life changes when FBI Agent Logan Campbell enters the picture. At first she doesn’t believe that it’s for the better, but with time spent off drugs, she realizes that some changes are for the best. She still feels like she can’t face her parents because of the things she said to her mother and by being completely wrong about her boyfriend when her family was right.**Spoilers**I felt that some of this book process was rushed for Jennifer Foor. I loved the Mitchell series and have just been so-so about the Mitchell-Healy series, but I love the characters & I will follow this series. But there were quite a few grammar mistakes (a few are generally to be expected) and there were storyline mistakes. For example, one of the characters would do something and then a few pages later, they would just start doing what they had previously just finished. Then there were huge jumps in time after Cassie was rescued by Logan. There was one day that was shown at his house and then in the next paragraph, it was three weeks later and they were leaving on a cross country car trip. Then there was a reminiscing about things they did or that happened while living at his house. There were too many moments that were just told, almost as an afterthought to make something in the present standout, instead of shown. The last is a personal preference: They ended their little whirlwind at 91% so I didn’t get the love feeling when they made up. Then the book skips to 6 months later & ended. I like to see the time after a couple makes up, to actually be in a relationship and see them working it out. Especially after the huge split comes so late in the book, I just didn’t feel their relationship.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R352P20R8WHA3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016RIRI8K#wasThisHelpful","R352P20R8WHA3A","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rockin’ Country series box setBy: Laramie Briscoe3/5 starsThis box set only includes book 1 Only the Beginning, book 1.5 One Day at a Time & book 2 The Price of Love. The third book, Full Circle, must be bought separately. This is not a full box set, which is why I rated this 3 stars when I rated the individual books 4 stars. I don't know if authors do this to make more money or to drum up new readers before the final book. But IMO, a box set, means a final, finished product.This series focuses on Hannah “Harmony” Stewart and Garrett “Reaper” Thompson. Both are famous musicians in their respective musical genres. Hannah is a solo country music artist and Garrett is the lead singer of the rock band Black Friday.They work together to figure out how to make a relationship work while they are both busy producing albums and touring and how to deal with the paparazzi drumming up false stories about either and both of them. They have to deal with jealous exes and record companies. They have to deal with being based in California & Nashville and being separated by the physical distance of not only their homes & recording studios, but also while on tour.But when a couple is committed to each other, they’ll do anything to make it all work out. The final book, Full Circle is the last in Garrett & Harmony’s story, but there is more coming from the side characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6AGDSIBBH9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W0MRI9C#wasThisHelpful","R1M6AGDSIBBH9I","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Price of Love (Rockin’ Love #2)By: Laramie Briscoe4/5 starsWhen Hannah & Garrett got married they didn’t leave behind Harmony & Reaper, their onstage personas. They still have separate obligations to their record companies and what their futures will entail. They aren’t ready for the physical separation that will occur when they have to both get back to work, but that time is near.They are both recording new albums and of course a new album means a new tour. But Hannah has never exercised the clause in her contract that allows her to take some time off. But now, Hannah is ready for a break and even more so since she is a newlywed.They are both under pressure from their record companies about their sound & songs for their new albums. There is more than a little friction from Hannah’s record company about a certain song they want her to duet on with another country artist. Of course there are the paparazzi and trying to spin pictures and news stories, which of course bothers both of them.This book centers around the length of time that Hannah is touring and a countdown until they can be together again. There were some fights they had and disagreements that sometimes seemed a little forced, like the author was trying to force a confrontation. I did find Hannah a little whiny at times during this book as well. We do get a bigger look into Jared & Shell’s relationship as well.I bought and read this book as part of the Rockin’ Country box set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HU8OROUNOIDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MY5VZ5S#wasThisHelpful","R3HU8OROUNOIDC","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

She’s one of the most popular country music stars with all the fame that comes with it. She lives in the public eye through her tours, all the promotions and her social media.

"Dead of Eve (Trilogy of Eve #1)By: Pam Godwin5/5 starsI’ve been a fan of Pam Godwin’s for a couple years, when I first read her second book, Beneath the Burn and was hooked. Dead of Eve was her debut novel, but not my usual reading genre, in the apocalyptic/paranormal/sci-fi romance. I finally read it and it absolutely DOES NOT read like a debut novel. This book was well-thought out, plotted and executed meticulously.The book starts out in the middle of an outbreak of some sort that has caused countless deaths and that transforms humans into a new type of species called aphids. Aphids are humans that were bitten or contracted the virus and turn into bug/insect/human hybrids that have lost all their human qualities like being able to think or feel but still walk upright. They are kind of like zombies, but not. I almost see them like the alien on the movie Alien Vs. Predator.Evie is our heroine and is the last human woman alive, at least that she or her husband Joel know of. Joel has trained Evie in hand-to-hand combat, weaponry and survival. They have lost their children to the virus and have been focused on survival ever since. But they eventually have to leave the safe haven of their home because of the aphids. This sets them on a course that will change their lives forever.As it turns out, there is a phenomenon with Evie and why she is the only woman to have not contracted the virus and has appears to have some “extra” abilities when it comes to fighting off the aphids. Not only does Evie have to watch out for and protect herself from aphids, but also human men. Some of those men are desperate to have a woman since there are none. Some also don’t trust her because she is a woman and women were originally the ones to carry the virus & then bite & infect men. She does take time to heal and meets a few trustworthy people along her road.Her travels are driven by gut instinct and visions of her dead children. While she is reluctant to follow them, they have never steered her wrong. She picks up guardians along the way who believe in her, trust her and want to be there with and for her, who are willing to lay down their lives to protect her.There are sad, happy, devastating, funny and sexy times in this book. It is hard to slip this book into just one genre. It’s post-apocalyptic, paranormal, sci-fi, horror and romance. Some may think it odd to put this in the romance category, but there is lust, romance & love. Thankfully this book didn’t end on a cliffhanger, though it easily could have, but leaves you at a resting moment & wanting more of this story. The sequel, Blood of Eve, will be released 10/29/2015, with the third book slated for late 2016/early 2017.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R326PKET8NWK20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009V3V2X6#wasThisHelpful","R326PKET8NWK20","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Home Free (Heaven Hill #8)By: Laramie Briscoe3/5 starsCharity grew up as the stripper’s daughter and thus, was always looked down upon in not only high school, but their entire town. There was no way for her to live that down when everyone wanted to hold it against her and throw it in her face. In order to make something of herself, she had to leave town, go to college and make a successful life. It broke her heart leaving Drew, her high school sweetheart, at home, but it was at his insistence that she left Kentucky to go to college. She became an attorney in North Carolina and has been working ever since.Drew became a member of the Heaven Hill Motorcycle Club and a mechanic so that he could work at his dad’s/the club’s auto shop, Walker’s Wheels. It broke his heart and left him devastated, but he knew that it was best for Charity to leave and go make something of herself that way she could rise above just being the stripper’s daughter. It was hard for him to do it, but he would do anything for Charity that was in her best interest.But when Charity got the call from Meredith Blackfoot to come home because she was needed, Charity came home immediately. She opened her own practice and her best friend Mandy, also Drew’s twin sister, who is a paralegal, came to work for her. Charity is helping Meredith with pro-bono legal work at the women’s shelter, CRISIS. Of course, Drew finds out when he stops by to drop off for Mandy. When Drew & Charity see each other, it’s like no time has passed and they strike up a conversation and set up a time to get together.Charity & Drew have a couple disagreements, but nothing else will get in their way. There is some drama with the CRISIS center that involves several of the club members, Charity & Mandy and some of the clients at CRISIS. But other than that, the club doesn’t play much of a role.While this book was well-written, it just missed the mark. It fell flat. We didn’t learn about much of anything that happened or went on during the 10 years that Charity was gone. I think that it would have worked out better to see some of those years, so that we got a sense of how sad they were instead of just being told about it. Also, there were no discussions between Drew and Charity about what happened, how they changed and grew and how they stayed the same. There was none of that; they just jumped back into the deep end. They had 2 stupid little arguments that were ridiculous and felt like forced conflict. Also, the club didn’t play any real role in this book, just some small protection work and detective work. I was really looking forward to this book, but it fell flat. I am intrigued by Mandy’s book, and hopefully there will be more to it than just 10 years of missed feelings & no real tension to the book.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11E10H1U5O6YV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016E3CS74#wasThisHelpful","R11E10H1U5O6YV","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rest & Trust (Night Horde SoCal #5)By: Susan Fanetti5/5 starsSherlock is the intelligence officer for the Night Horde SoCal who isn’t like all the other guys in the club. He’s not been the most physical or intimidating guy, definitely not part of the muscle of the. He’s the brains. With his hacking ability and ability to check things out, verify & search backgrounds of people, he is invaluable to the club. He’s always been somewhat quiet, more of a thinker and not just all about partying, though he does his fair share of that. He’s has a steady friends-with-benefits, who is a single mother, but who also keeps Sherlock on the outside.Sadie is a recovering, high-functioning addict with almost a year clean and sober. She’s not a junkie, because she always held herself to the highest standard possible so that no one knew what was actually happening in her life. She went to school, got the grades, graduated, got a good, high paying job and no one knew that she was high on Oxy or Heroin the entire time. Until one day, she had a very public meltdown at work. Now her job is different, she goes to meetings, has a sponsor and is working at getting involved in things, just to keep herself busy.They meet when Sadie needs rescued and Sherlock just happens to be there & bails her out of trouble. Then he feels responsible for her & helps take care of her. But they both feel for each other and are intrigued by the possibilities even with the 13 year age gap. They have similar interests in gaming & computers which Sherlock has never found in a woman or even close friends. Bart is the only one who understands his computer “geek-dom” but Bart has a family to spend his free time with.We also get to some of the Missouri Night Horde in this book, which always makes me happy & giddy. We saw Badger, Showdown, Nolan, & Dom. Also during this book’s timeline, both Isaac & Len are released from prison, but are on parole, so they don’t make appearances at either rally. I don’t know if we’ll see any of the Missouri Night Horde in the next book, but I hope so!I absolutely love Fanetti’s writing style and ability. I’ve never been disappointed, and I’ve read all 19 of her books. She can pull emotions from me and shock me, but also leave me with a feeling of being able to move forward. I was really sad learning that this is the second to the last book in this series. I’m still hoping that there will be more books for the entire Night Horde family in spinoffs for Nolan, Havoc’s adopted son, & maybe Dom in Signal Bend. I like to see how the kids of my several of my all-time favorite characters are growing and maturing & their lives. Even though it is nearing the end, it sure doesn’t feel like it should be, but I have no doubt that Susan Fanetti will blow it out of the water.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E0GR7JMYJKGB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014GPTGFY#wasThisHelpful","R1E0GR7JMYJKGB","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bound by Temptation (Born in the Blood Mafia #4)By: Cora Reilly4/5 starsLiliana Scuderi watched both of her sisters be married off for political reasons to brothers in the New York mafia, so she hopes that she can marry for love. She has been infatuated with Aria’s bodyguard, Romero, since the first day she met him. That hasn’t changed and she really feels like she possibly loves him. But she knows that her father will take some convincing to allow her to marry “just a soldier.” However, she refuses to give up hope.Romero has always put his duty to the famiglia first and has never wavered. He’s ignored Lily’s flirtatious behavior for years and has never wavered. But as Lily has grown older and matured into a woman, he can’t deny her beauty or her spirit. They become closer than ever and have even crossed a few lines. He wants to be with Lily also, but it’ll take Aria and Luca speaking to the girls’ father to allow Romero & Lily to marry.But when they find out that Lily’s father has arranged a marriage with a man more than twice her age, their hearts are broken and most all of their hope is lost. Once a marriage is arranged, if the arrangement is cancelled, the cancelling party loses face and respect for backing out. No amount of pleading convinces her father to back out of the marriage.Aria and Gianna both want to rescue Lily from this arranged marriage, as does Romero, forcibly if necessary, but that will cause a war between the Chicago & New York mafias. And while Aria and Gianna are more than willing to take that chance, Romero doesn’t know if he can break his vow to Luca & the mafia. Lily also doesn’t want to cause war because that will put her sisters & their husbands, Romero & possibly her younger brother in danger. They all have to make the decision of whether or not love is worth risking a war.There were several grammatical errors, and then there were also errors with word usage. For example, a capo in the Italian mafia is a captain, not a boss. The boss is called boss or the Don. Finally, the author did get the Italian word famiglia instead of the Spanish word familia.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXDNQL9DA4LO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1517455510#wasThisHelpful","RXDNQL9DA4LO4","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bound by Hatred (Born in the Blood Mafia #3)By: Cora Reilly3/5 starsWe first met Gianna Scuderi and Matteo Vitiello in book one, when their older siblings were engaged & later married. We also found out in that book that they were engaged, though we didn’t learn of Matteo’s reasoning until this book. During book 2, we learned that Gianna had run away while visiting Aria in New York and that both families were pissed and that Matteo would hunt her down. This book does go back and show several of those scenes from Gianna and Matteo’s POVs. This was the first book in the series that had dual POV & I really liked that.Matteo was bound and determined to find Gianna and marry her, even though she had run away, been found with another man, lost her reputation as a virtuous woman and her value as a bride. Matteo thought that he could possibly work Gianna out of his system, but he found that to be false, as he kept only wanting her more. But he also couldn’t trust Gianna not to run again and had to take preventative measures.Luca treated Gianna pretty bad, but he lost face as the boss and in his ability to control his area. He was also upset with Aria because she helped her sister and in doing so, betrayed him. This caused them tension and I also think that’s probably why Aria wasn’t able to stick up for Gianna as much as we thought she probably would.This book could have been so much more. I was looking forward to reading Gianna’s book, but this one just missed the mark for me. Gianna was strong enough willed to run away from the mafia in search of a life of her own and for the chance to find and marry for love. That was a great concept, but personally, I didn’t feel like Matteo & Gianna had built a connection by the end of the book.There were several grammatical errors, and then there were also errors with word usage. For example, a capo in the Italian mafia is a captain, not a boss. The boss is called boss or the Don. Also, in Italian, it’s famiglia because Spanish is familia. There were also some small & some big storyline inconsistencies. Some of the inconsistencies could have just been when the author forgot to write the in between/descriptive paragraphs or sentences.*Spoilers*I think it would have helped had Matteo told Gianna the real reason that he asked his dad to arrange their marriage. Gianna may have shown a little thankfulness & gratitude when she found out that Matteo saved her from a worse fate. Also, clear at 84-87%, Gianna was still debating about leaving Matteo & actually did take some steps to run away from him, even after she admitted to herself that she was in love with him. Seriously at that point, Matteo deserved someone who would fight for him as hard as he fought for her.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHXWMPI5PBIAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYEDH2M#wasThisHelpful","RHXWMPI5PBIAD","A12CZBKBM4OZMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A12CZBKBM4OZMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bound by Duty (Born in the Blood Mafia #2)By: Cora Reilly5/5 starsDante Cavallaro is the Boss of the Chicago Outfit mafia, who lost his wife to cancer about 4 years ago. However, he was left without an heir and it is expected of him to remarry & have a son who can take over the mafia when he retires or dies. But Dante truly loved his first wife and hasn’t gotten over her death, but knows that he looks weak in the eyes of his men for not remarrying and is now willing to at least do that much. He has the choice of any woman he wants, but has to take his position into consideration of who would be an acceptable choice for the new head of the family.Valentina is also a widow with no children. She was married to Antonio, her childhood friend, for years. But their marriage was a sham, a cover-up, a beard. Antonio was gay and if that had ever been found out, men in the mafia would have killed him for it. So Valentina agreed to marry him, in order to protect him. She had naively thought that perhaps they could make their relationship into a real one, that she could have kids, a marriage & a life with Antonio. But they never consummated their marriage; and when Antonio died she was still of a marriageable age. Although her virginity will raise questions with her new husband, secrets can’t hurt a dead man.As the Boss, Dante truly had his choice of any woman to marry, because most all parents want their daughter to be married to the Boss, giving them an elevation of status within the mafia. Many people can’t figure why 36 year old Dante chose an older (24 year old!) widow, instead of an 18 year old virgin. Even Valentina isn’t sure why she was chosen, but she will do her duty & marry Dante.Dante is known to be cold in all his business dealings and with the men under him in the mafia. Valentina hopes that he won’t be that way towards her and that she can finally have a true marriage with all the marital benefits. But she’s in for shock and confusion on her second wedding night that ends up being unconsummated, yet again. Valentina begins to think that it is something that is just wrong with her.There were some grammatical errors, and then there were also errors with words. For example, a capo in the Italian mafia is a captain, not a boss. The boss is called boss or the Don.

"Bound by Honor (Born in Blood Mafia #1)By: Cora Reilly5/5 starsDaughters born into the mob are married off to other mob men in a way to strengthen political alliances or to move up one’s family position within the organization and sometimes, they marry as part of a peace agreement. The boys are given free rein on pre-marital sex while girls are forced to remain pure & chaste, generally achieved by constant bodyguards, attending private girls’ school, not being allowed to be alone in a man’s company and having very few freedoms. Girls who aren’t virgins on their wedding nights can be cause for major problems. For some of the men, the only worth their daughters have is to be arranged into an advantageous marriage, since sons are the only ones who can join the mob & take over for their fathers. Women also know that their husband will most likely keep mistresses for most of their lives.When a truce was needed between the Chicago mob and the New York mob, Aria Scuderi becomes engaged to Luca “The Vice” Vitiello when she is just 15, in order to secure peace between the two mob families. Shortly after her 18th birthday, she is wed & immediately moves to New York City with her new husband. Though she is fearful, Aria knows that she has to do her duty to keep the Chicago mob safe, thus saving the lives of her siblings. One piece of advice that she was given, in order to survive her marriage with no familial support system, was to make Luca fall in love with her. For if he loved her, he would desire her, he may not take a mistress, he would be more apt to take her advice and would want to protect her out of love & devotion instead of “just because she’s his wife.” In short, a reciprocated love would make the arranged marriage more bearable to her.Though Luca is greatly feared and a killer, there is a tenderness that is bestowed solely for Aria. He waited for 3 years to have her and after seeing the woman she has become, he wants her. But he’s not used to the reserved woman that Aria is. Luca is used to the easy come, easy go floozies and regular women that he sleeps with. He realizes that he needs to ease his young wife into the completely foreign sexual world. He also comes to realize that his feelings run deeper for her than he ever imagined and that he may be falling for his wife.Just because the two Italian mobs from Chicago & New York City have a truce doesn’t mean that they free from trouble. The Russian Bratva is still a huge problem for both families and their troubles are far from over.There were some grammatical errors, and then there were also errors with words. For example, a capo in the Italian mafia is a captain, not a boss. The boss is called boss or the Don.

"Even with the few problems it has, Splatoon is an extremely fun online multiplayer game. With ""weapons"" to cater to a variety of playing styles, no gamer will feel alienated, and it lacks pervasive violence, making it one of the few shooters that can be enjoyed even by young kids. The graphics are beautiful and high-def, the music is fun, and the character design is cheeky and clever. I've played this game every day since purchase, and still enjoy it, partially because Nintendo keeps adding new content and events called ""Splatfest"" where you choose a side (Dogs V. Cats, Waterslides V. Coasters) and duke it out with the other team.Downsides: no local online multiplayer mode (I'd like to go online with my husband instead of having to take turns), and the two-player ""dojo"" mode is not fun. This is not a 1v1 game, and that mode feels slapped on just so they could write ""local two-player mode"" on the box. There also is no option (yet) to create teams for online play (you can play with friends, but it's randomized so they might be on the other team), I suppose because Nintendo wants to hypothetically prevent organized teams from pubstomping random teams and ruining the fun for everyone. Another thing lacking in this game that every other team-based shooter has is microphones, though I know Nintendo is hardcore against mics because we have to protect little Timmy and all... but a solution would be to have mics automatically disabled and only accessible through parental settings. Ultimately, the downsides don't really make me dislike this game. It's so fun, I can overlook them, and I do know, in theory, why Nintendo doesn't do mics or teams... they don't want folks getting too crazy or competitive and ruin the game for their target demographic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFDCYWG2SDFD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWFCV32#wasThisHelpful","R2EFDCYWG2SDFD","A2XTA7MOZBINNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTA7MOZBINNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This printer worked beautifully for about a year, and then the printheads would no longer dock properly in the service station where the waste ink pads etc go. I took it to a shop and found out that there is something wrong with the service station sensors and that I would have to replace the entire thing, totaling around $300. Even if I replace that part, because the printheads haven't been docked properly for about a month, I'd have to replace them as well, since they're dried up and unuseable. Because this printer is barely out of warranty, there is NOTHING Epson will do for me, despite the fact that the reason the printer fouled up in the first place was due to a manufacturing error that didn't come to light until now. I loved this printer...LOVED it, but I just can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars repairing something that I can replace for less money.

"I've cast in resin before, and this is about the most economical and least stinky resin you can get. Keep in mind that even after 24 hours, your pieces will be hardened enough to demold, but still relatively soft and tacky. You'll think you've done something wrong, but this stuff just takes FOREVER to cure. 72 hours, I've found is the best wait time for a full cure. If you're an impatient type, this might not be the resin for you, but you can't beat the price. I've found by adding slightly more hardener than resin (maybe a few big drops worth), I can get my pieces to cure a tich faster (but not much faster). However, your mileage may vary. If you're going to mess up your measurements, definitely DO NOT use more resin than hardener or your pieces will never cure. This resin is pretty thin, so if you're wanting to put a big fat dome on your pieces when you're done, I recommend a thicker type. ICE resin is better for doming but it's more expensive. BUT, you could get ICE resin just for doming and save money by doing your casting with this and your doming with ICE. This stuff mixes fine with inks, pigments, and I've even mixed it with glow in the dark powder and made cool glowing charms. It takes to sanding well, and if you manage to keep the dust out of your workspace, is crystal clear. Overall, it's a great value.One caveat: Just because it's low odor does not mean you shouldn't still have a well-ventilated workspace. I've once gave myself a headache with this stuff because there isn't a terrible stink reminding me to open the window, so keep that in mind when working with it.

"I mixed this powder with some easycast acrylic and made some super cool glowing cellphone charms for my little sister's birthday. Keep in mind that this powder does not dissolve, so it will turn the acrylic white (you can also add color inks to give it a pastel cast, instead of plain white). If you want to make a piece with glitter or found objects or stickers or whatever, do your first layer with clear acrylic and add your objects. Wait until it's tacky but not completely set, then mix another batch of acrylic with your glow powder and pigments or whatever you like and pour it over the partially set lower layer. This way you still see your glitter and stuff on the front of the piece but the charm will still glow. The powder is very very fine and does not make the acrylic feel crusty or chunky to work with. It also glows very bright!

"I have loved every Animal Crossing iteration and this game is no exception. If you want a fast-paced, challenging game, this game is not for you. The game works in (basically) real time. Shops close at night and open in the morning. There are many things to do in the game which will occupy just about anyone with any interest. I enjoy collecting rare items and landscaping, but my husband is a fan of fishing til he drops. Though kids might not initially want to share their game cartridge with siblings, parents should note that all the AC games work better when the villagers team up to conquer challenges like filling the museum with every type of fish or fossil or insect. Initially I was skeptical of the fact that instead of starting from the bottom up, you start out in the game as the ""mayor"". However, the game mechanics are essentially the same and aside from having the authority to enact ordinances and place public works projects, you still start out as a ""nobody"" in the game with a tiny house and no money or items. The public works projects are a great new feature which allow the player to further customize their town beyond what was possible in earlier AC games. The graphics and character designs have been changed slightly (improved, in my opinion), giving villagers a more realistically human body shape, and giving female villagers the option of not wearing dresses all the time, which I found annoying in earlier games, since even ""boy"" shirts would turn into dresses on a girl character. Different kinds of shoes can be purchased along with socks, which is also a new feature, since in earlier games your character wore the same shoes all the time (though you could customize the color in CF). My favorite new feature, if I had to choose, would be the QR code clothing and pattern feature allowing artsy players to design and share their designs for clothes, ground pattern tiles, and wallpapers, etc. with other gamers. A wealth of QRs can be found online, so even the most un-artistic player can find things to suit them.Gripes:1. There is no option to be nonwhite in this game, and the only way for people of color to get a character that looks something like them is to stand in the sun on the island to get a ""tan"" or to customize their character with a Mii mask. Because this game has such a diverse following, it would behoove the developers to allow players to customize their skin color if they are nonwhite.2. This one is a gimmie, as I have this issue with every AC title, but moreso in this title as there are many non-reorderable items in the game: Players need more storage space for all the non-reorderable items they inevitably accumulate.3. The town map really ought to be a bit bigger. It was too big in City Folk, which led to lots of wasted areas, so I understand the decision to pare down. However, with the addition of the public works project feature, space becomes a precious resource in this game.4. You can't control where new villagers put their houses. A new villager could potentially plop their house in the middle of your hybrid flower mural of Princess Peach (I'm looking at you, Daisy) or right in the middle of a ""road"". This headache can be avoided by knowing when villagers are supposed to move in and doing something called plot resetting (google it), but, as this is technically a game cheat, game purists may not want to do this and just end up taking villagers as they come, even if they park their home in the middle of the park or your precious landscaping.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BMXB8S37J11B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0053BCML6#wasThisHelpful","R1BMXB8S37J11B","A2XTA7MOZBINNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTA7MOZBINNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I had previously been able to control my acne with my diet, but nothing was helping these recent breakouts. I started taking this supplement, and my breakouts immediately disappeared.

"I was really excited about my new Wacom 5, but I was not excited about the gritty, draggy, toothy feel it had when drawing. I was also concerned about wearing the surface down too quickly since I am not able to replace the surface myself with this model. This cover makes the surface extremely smooth to work on, so if that's what you want (I did) go for it. It should prevent expensive nib wear and help you get more life out of the drawing surface (I use mine 5+ hours a day every day). If you're on the fence because this is a 3rd party product, don't be. It's not terrible pricey, and it does the job. It also seems very heavy and durable. I doubt I'll have to replace it anytime soon.

"As a kid, my mom made me drink a weird milkshake in the morning that had a bitter and terrible-tasting form of brewer's yeast in it (among other things). I was loathe as an adult to try tasting it again. I'm glad I went with Lewis Labs yeast. It's completely delicious in most of the foods I make, as it imparts a mellow, cheesy, salty flavor to anything it's added to.

"When I feel like slaying bosses or solving puzzles, this game has me covered. When I feel like looking at some pretty scenery, fishing, playing minigames, riding Epona around, and playing in chill sandbox mode, this game still has me covered. I've beaten it 4 or 5 times, and still love going back for the great visuals and effects and to find all the little random details that I might have overlooked (and there are tons of details). It's a little rough around the edges with motion control, but as far as atmosphere, story, and beauty goes, it's a great value and you won't be disappointed. Some of the levels can be quite stressful and challenging the first go round, and I recommend turning the brightness/contrast up a little on your TV so you can actually see, since much of the gameplay features lovely and atmospheric but hard-on-the-eyes darkness.

"After my intuos 4 finally gave up the ghost after 4 years due to the USB connectors coming loose (I have since had the USB cable soldered directly to the circuit board so it would be useable/resellable) I decided to upgrade to the Intuos 5 touch. Since I am bad at estimating sizes and the medium and large were the same price, I went ahead and went with the larger tablet. It is very large, and very substantially made (heavy) and while it has taken some getting used to in terms of heft, I feel I made a good decision. I use my tablet for illustration work, and I've been able to enjoy a freer range of motion with a larger active area and consequently less hand strain and arm strain. This tablet is a far cry from the large intuos 4, which, while being somewhat dimensionally comparable, was more lightly built and, in my opinion, had a more flimsy handfeel. It appears that the junky USB port construction has been remedied in the 5, and since bluetooth is now an option, one can forgo cables entirely and free up valuable desk space (and avoid connector damage). I purchased the wireless kit with the tablet, and only need to leave it plugged in at night to charge. Sometimes I can get a couple days out of it if I'm not working the entire day. All these features coupled with the multi-touch capability, which I confess I am still getting used to, make this tablet a solid, practical, and function-rich product. I'm very happy with it, and have only had good experiences with Wacom products in the past with the exception of the issues I had with the USB connectors on the Intuos 4 (though those issues were late in the life of the product). I'm very pleased with my tablet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GEAB12IDUWQI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0076HMDRI#wasThisHelpful","R2GEAB12IDUWQI","A2XTA7MOZBINNY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2XTA7MOZBINNY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was expecting a typical gritty serial-killer novel but got something completely different. The author weaves a skillful tapestryof characters, from IRA members to German police officers to Russian sleepers, many of whom go back and forth between three European countries. The possible/main reason for Peter Bennett's hatred of women didnt seem completely plausible to me, but I could overlook it.  If I'd had a better idea of the plot lines and circumstances I probably would have passed on this one, but am glad I didnt. A good, solid story with most of the loose ends tied up at the end.

"A well-done fictionalization of the 1962 Hanratty case, in which the accused was convicted and hanged. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because for me, it dragged on a bit, and because the author chose to phonetically transcribe some characters' regional dialects.I would have preferred it if the dialect was indicated and it was left to the reader to imagine their speech, as I sometimes had difficulty understanding the dialogue.

"I have owned a knockoff of the popular FURminator deshedding tool for years.  Although I thought that it was doing a pretty good job, my cat would not put up for it for very long.  I would not use this tool regularly enough to make much of a difference because my cat simply did not allow me to comb her with this tool for long.  I decided to try this product based on its high reviews and hoped that my cat would like it a little more.  Now whenever my cat jumps up to be pet, I simply will put this glove on and she seems to like being pet even more.  I stroke the mitt into her back and sides as if I were petting her normally and this tool picks up and incredible amount of fur with great efficiency.  My cat purrs while I groom her.  So far I have had this mitt for a week using it daily and it has picked up considerable amounts of hair every time I have used it; hair that is no longer in the air and on my clothes.  I stop using the glove at the first sign my cat gives me that she has had enough and will then usually give her some loving without the glove on.  I have learned that stroking the area near the tail too hard upsets my cat.  The first time I used it I was careful to present it as naturally as possible so as not to spook her with it.  All cats are different, but If your cat tolerates it, this tool removes more hair more efficiently, with the least amount of stress to the animal of any deshedding product I have tried.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6E5JSAOPYAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002USK6X6#wasThisHelpful","RU6E5JSAOPYAR","A1M0M3TOS6CD1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0M3TOS6CD1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It fits the scope snugly and securely.

"The craftsmanship of this box is great.  It makes me wonder why bamboo is not a more popular building material.  The individual cut pieces fit together so nicely.  As the product description states; ""it [bamboo] holds the promise of a sustainable, cost effective, and ecologically responsible alternative to the widespread clear cutting of our old growth forests.""  For all intents and purposes this box feels and looks like wood if you had never seen bamboo before.  I bought this box to store Himalayan sea salt which i purchased along with this order.  The only thing I question is how this box will keep the moisture out.  It is less than airtight, but the top is on a pivot and ""locks"" with a magnet.  It does have a bit of an oil smell to it, but with a drop of dish soap and a good soak, it lessened the smell.  It is not a concern for me.  After a short time the box will just smell like salt anyway.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NHWUBYSYR0BZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PBHGHG#wasThisHelpful","R2NHWUBYSYR0BZ","A1M0M3TOS6CD1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0M3TOS6CD1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mission Belt is simply the best ""ratchet style"" belt available.  They are truly incredible.  Mission Belt's customer service is outstanding.  In fact, their customer service is the best of any company I have been a customer of...ever.  Before ordering the belt, I emailed them with a question regarding sizing.  It seems as if I am in a bit of a middle ground of waist size.  I wear a consistent size 32"" across the board.  Based on this, I was recommended a small-sized belt, but once I received my belt and tried it on, it was just an inch or two too small for me.  Again, I messaged them and once again received a nearly immediate response.  They immediately sent me a medium-sized belt before I even began the process of sending back the small-sized belt.  I was offered a full refund on shipping.  I received the new medium sized belt in a few days and it fit perfectly.  As an added bonus, they sent me a newer model black belt.  It was very similar, but with a few minor upgrades.  From what I could immediately tell, the ratcheting is much smoother.  Mission Belt and I exchanged a few more emails to ensure that I was pleased with my purchase.Prior to ordering this belt, I had ordered three of the Erik Blaire brand ratchet belts in different colors.  While this company also has great customer service from my experience and similar buckles, the belt strap is really what sets these belts apart.  Mission Belts are dyed leather, as opposed to the Erik Blaire belts which are painted on patterns.  This painting resulted in my belts ""cracking"" over just a couple of months.  The Mission Belts look like leather, feel like leather...and yes even smell like leather.  Some models are even labeled ""yeah...its leather.""  I cannot say the same for their competitor.  I do not want to trash the Erik Blaire Belts, because I initially did fall in love with them and their customer service was also very good from my experience, but they are simply not as nice as these.  I recommend these for yourself or as a gift.  I absolutely guarantee that NO ONE would be disappointed with one of these belts.  Oh and one final thing, they even donate a portion of every belt sale to charity to feed the hungry.  Great belt, great companyThese belts are awesome.  Just order one now.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RECZ0E044WOKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0099W59ME#wasThisHelpful","RECZ0E044WOKB","A1M0M3TOS6CD1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0M3TOS6CD1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These tripods are truly an amazing accessory for your digital camera.  I have bought the non-magnetic version for myself, not realizing that this one was available.  I use it all the time.  It is small enough that you can bring it anywhere with you.  I bought this one as a Christmas gift for a world traveler that takes lots of pictures.  Frankly, I couldn't say that there has really been a time where I actually could have used the magnetic tripod feet, but had I known it existed, I surely would have bought it for myself.Using a tripod obviously makes for better photographs, but its impractical to carry a full sized tripod around.  This solves that problem and then some.  Being able to wrap this tripod around just about anything or stick it to something metalic can make for some amazing shot angles.  I think that this is a great gift idea for a camera enthusiast.  I'd be willing to bet they had never seen such a device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 2, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R2SO20PAAZNJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038YWLCA#wasThisHelpful","R1R2SO20PAAZNJ","A1M0M3TOS6CD1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0M3TOS6CD1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Out of the four ink cartridges that came with my HP8500A printer, as expected the black cartridge ran out of ink first, but the yellow was not far behind.  Instead of ordering all four cartridges all at once, I decided to order only yellow and black replacement cartridges.  At this point, the red and blue cartridges were still at about half full.  These cartridges are ""XL"" size and claim to carry twice the ink as the cartridges that came with the printer.

"When debating what size of these to buy, I decided that the 10L size was simply too big for me.  Instead I bought the 6L size as well as a 2L Dromelite bag.  After buying these dromedary bags, I also purchased the MSR shower kit and MSR hydration kit.  I own a camelbak and bought the hydration kit for comparison.  I have not used it yet, but I have used the 6L dromedary bag with the MSR shower kit and it works great.  These bags are clearly heavy duty and have not leaked on me.  I know that MSR stands by their products, so if a leak were to spring up they would replace it for free.  Frankly, I now think that there is no other way to carry large amounts of water.  I will say that they do have the ""garden hose taste"" that another reviewer speaks of, but it the taste does fade away after multiple uses.  If you've ever lugged gallon water jugs out with you, buy one of these bags immediately.  They make for the perfect base for all of your mobile water needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3BN3397IU9D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FIU2TG#wasThisHelpful","R3J3BN3397IU9D","A1M0M3TOS6CD1A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1M0M3TOS6CD1A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 1:42 MinsMy only real concern when purchasing this product was how strong the water flow could possibly be and how quickly the water will drain.  I own many MSR products and was not worried about quality issues.  All I can really say is that the water flows out with surprising force, exceeding my expectations.  I have my kit paired with a 6L dromedary bag and am pretty sure that 2 people would be able to take a quick shower on one fill, although I have not used this in the field yet.  The 10L bag would surely be better for two people to take a shower, but I find it to just be too big for the average single person.  I also own a 2L lightweight dromedary bag and the MSR hydration kit.

"I always have two anchors on my 23' boat; the main anchor up front attached to the boats on-board anchor winch and a low cost anchor for deploying in rocky bottoms where retrieval could be an issue.  I lost my cheap anchor a few weeks ago and was going to go to the marina for a replacement, but it was near the end of the day and I did not want to pay marina prices for a cheap anchor.  As I do more and more often these days, I looked right to Amazon.  I thought to myself; is an anchor really something you can just order online...what about the shipping?  Well, Amazon has you covered.  This is a prime eligible item.  Frankly, I don't even know why I questioned Amazon, they will ship just about anything in a timely manner.  When it comes down to it, an anchor isn't even that heavy.  I received this anchor in two days in a slim box packed with packing paper.  This anchor is cheaper feeling than the anchor I just lost and the welds look a bit sloppy, but it will get the job done.  It is what I wanted; a cheap anchor that I don't care if I lose.

"I recently bought a 16x20 unframed 3D picture for $10 at...7-11 of all places.  I simply could not resist.  I looked to Amazon to find a nice affordable frame.  There are other choices, but none reviewed as consistently well as Craig Frames.  My main concern when buying this frame was the shipping aspect.  I knew it would take a little while to arrive and was hoping that it would not arrive broken.  The frame arrived at my house within a week, but surely took a bit longer as I ordered the day before Thanksgiving.  The frame arrived packed very securely and the face is some kind of clear poly-carbonate, not glass, so having a broken frame arrive on your doorstep does not seem to be much of an issue here.  I am not going to say that the frame quite exceeded my expectations, but for the price I am extremely happy with it.  It looks simple, yet very nice up on the wall.  I ordered the standard black frame.This frame comes with all the necessary mounting hardware...you put it together yourself.  If you have never done this before, it may initially seem like a bit of a difficult task.  This could be helped if they would included mounting instructions in the box.  The instructions, however can easily be found at the Craigs Frame's website at [...]The screws are self driving, but a phillip's head drill bit will make doing this a snap.

It is a spork with teeth that are too small to make for a decent fork and a depression that only makes for a half decent spoon.  The bottle opener just works OK. The Carabiner clip is made of plastic.  I replaced the plastic clips with metal Nite Ize S biners; a simple enough fix costing a few dollars.  These are just not the home run the 5 star reviews would suggest.  Nonetheless, other than the plastic clip, the quality is solid enough, albeit stamped metal.  I bought two of these.

"I must admit that I've never been much of a flip flop person. I have had my previous pair of flip flops for 3-4 years and had not worn another pair until receiving theses.  While my previous pair was of similar quality, I did not ever imagine just how much a flip flop's design could affect how they stick to your feet while walking.  The heal is cushioned and raised to make for less ""flipping and flopping"" while walking.  They are lightweight and simply stick to my feet better than any other pair I've owned.

"Don't let the little blue ""stone"" on top fool you into thinking that this is some kind of beautiful tamper.  Its alright looking, but i could do without it.

"I purchased the McNett Gear Aid Tent Repair Kit at a local store at around the same time I purchased this kit.  If I were to have only one of these kits on a short camping trip, I would prefer to have the Gear Aid kit because it has the added benefit of being able to repair a tents poles and zippers, while still being able to sew/fix the same types of things.  From a minimalist backpacking perspective, I'd rather have this kit because it is more survival oriented.  Here are the main things that sets these two kits apartBoth kits have duct tape, a patch to sew, and all the basic items to be able to sew.The Gear Aid kit contains, but is not limited to an odor eliminating packet, seam cutter, elastic cord, seam glue, tent zipper and pole repair.The Survival Sewing and repair kit contains, but is not limited to a razor blade, utility cord, plastic ties, kevlar thread, brass wire and 4 nails.While there is some redundancy, these kits make perfect compliments to each other.

"I like to use the Banana Boat spray on sunscreen for convenience, but like to apply rub in sunscreen to my face and more exposed areas.  In the past I have had problems with sunscreen running into my eyes to the point that it often kept me from using it anywhere near my eyes.  I applied this liberally over my face on a very hot day at the beach and had no problems with sunscreen causing my eyes to tear.  I trust the Banana Boat name to protect me from the sun and expect waterproof claims to be accurate, so my main concern is how the sunscreen absorbs and if it runs into my eyes.

"This product seems like a great idea, you're getting the equivalent of a dozen+ tubes of caulk gun type adhesive in a trigger pull canister. Easier on your fingers, less space, and faster to apply. Unfortunately, none of this works in reality.The trigger mechanism is very finicky, you easily go from no flow to spraying like a firehose, it cannot be controlled for proper application.The nozzle design is very poor and easily blows off the can, shooting excess foam everywhere, which is very difficult to clean up. It will be on your fingers for days and days.This really isn't anything more than the typical ""great stuff"" expanding foam, that is about how it applies, just in a smaller bead. It still puffs up, then settles down, but equally as sticky and messy when it gets where you do not want it.I've noticed the product before and decided to try it while the cans were on clearance for $5 at home depot.They are dumping cases and cases of them at this price, presumably because none of the real contractors and construction guys bought into the gimmick. Stick to regular tube based adhesives, it is much cleaner to apply even if they take up more space and have to be put on with a caulking gun.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQII7GCLA2XVZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HLSCWHI#wasThisHelpful","RQII7GCLA2XVZ","A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Limited applications - designated OTA channels only.I had purchased this in hopes of getting an alternate video feed on my dish system.This is a digital only tuner, it has no analog capabilities. It also will only pick up stations that are within the dish guide, meaning stations that dish expects to be there and allows.My hope had been to use an rf modulator to output feeds from my security system recorders to then be able to view the cameras on each tv in the house, rather than having to rely on additional wiring or other more complicated options. I understand that all broadcasts these days are digital only, but it would have been very simple for them to build an analog ntsc tuner function into this at well, giving a lot of extra flexibility for applications such as mine or distributing dvd, etc through the home.Rather than simply  the install that way, I'm now instead using a hdmi matrix solution, and have instead been able to scale back my dish system. Now I'm paying dish far less money each month for fewer receivers and sharing the remaining ones between my tvs. If they could have built a better quality and more robust tuner device, I'd have happily paid for those extra boxes in each room.

"Disclosure: I received echo as part of the original trial group as a prime member for a discounted (half) price.The echo is sleek and has surprisingly great sound for the small size.Pairing it with your phone and network was very simple.Tip: If you have a ""hidden"" wifi network (ssid is not broadcast) like mine is, for security purposes, you will need to temporarily make your network visible to connect your echo, at which point you can hide it again and it will remain connected.I'm happy to say I have had no wifi problems or other common network glitches and have never had to reboot the echos, it just works.I put it in the master bath as it is one of the few rooms that doesn't have a whole house music system, and was very pleased when they came out with native pandora support rather than having to stream pandora via airplay.The voice recognition is a bit spotty at times, depending on your volume and distance from the echo. Placing it in/near a corner helps with both the audio quality out of the echo as well as helps Alexa to recognize you better. While there are fun little things you can do with it, just like with Siri (what's the weather, whats the traffic, playing simon says, etc), the best is yet to come. There is so much potential with having a good quality network device that can reasonably pick up your voice commands anywhere in the room. As of now there is some basic developer integration starting to work with home automation controls such as the philips hue lights - that is worthless for a truly automated home system, but once they can get it properly integrated with ISY, Crestron, and AMX, the sky is the limit.There is also potential to start networking multiple echos together, which will be a big competitor for the Sonos systems. If the cost comes down a bit, even to $100, I'd be placing many of these throughout the home just for voice control of lighting, a/v equipment, climate control and security, etc.  Ideally it would be great to see some additional echo mini devices developed that had just a microphone and a small speaker that could piggyback off a central echo processor to let you expand control around the home where you may not need a full speaker.Amazon: Please work with ISY ( http://amzn.to/1LbljqB )to develop native support for the ISY-994 platform. You also have great potential to take a cue from the Denon Heos speaker systems and make an echo with at least analog or preferably digital (optical) outputs that can feed into a whole home system or audio/video receiver.  Add an IR blaster component and you could be telling Alexa to turn on your amp and play pandora through your stereo system.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1698VRRK786E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R1698VRRK786E","A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I won't bother going into the features as they are widely published and reviewed.I'll state my perspective as a custom home theater installer instead: while the included remote works well, and the voice feature is cool, the fire tv is a huge pain for anyone with more than a basic living room tv setup.  Any home theater setup or even just a well designed home that has a centralized media closet will have trouble with a fire tv, because they overlooked the most basic of functions and failed to include an infrared remote control option.  If there were published developer details for IP control, or an IR command input port, serial port, etc, this system could be easily integrated into a home automation system. Without that function or the ability to use discrete remote commands, options are limited. There is a USB ir receiver dongle on the market, but the programming is overly complex to make it work, and it simply should not be necessary.  Anyone buying one of these who wants to have it incorporated into an automation system should expect to spend several times the cost of the actual firetv on install costs from your local home theater installer, because of the additional equipment and programming that will be necessary. Even if you just want to keep your install simple and use a basic logitech harmony or other programmable remote, you're still stuck either cobbling together a workaround option with added equipment and manual programming, or having to use 2 remotes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38E6A6MO1U8M1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R38E6A6MO1U8M1","A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ""upgraded"" to this after getting tired of my vonage bill creeping up month after month. The intent was for a cheap home phone service for times when I didn't want to use cell minutes, preferred to be able to use speaker phone, and for emergencies (911). I didn't need to pay nearly $40 a month for such limited use, so I picked up the obi and configured it, with several glitches along the way, to use ring.to.  Ring.to is completely free, unlimited calls, long distance, etc.  You will need to pay about $12 a year for 911 support, which is required, and well worth the minimal cost for peace of mind (you cannot use ring.to without a 911 account through a different provider).  Call quality is not as clear as what I had with vonage, it is a bit crackly/static at times, but passable, no worse than many cell connections.Configuration is not for everyone though, it took a lot of trial and error, both with account (ringto and obi) settings, as well as hardware adjustment of both the device and home router.  TIP: If you are having issues with not getting incoming calls, or if calls drop after 30 seconds to 2 minutes, go into you router setup and disable the SIP ALG (also known as RTSP ALG on some some routers), or you can assign a DMZ port to the obi if needed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P9U2179OZPKA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BUV7C9A#wasThisHelpful","R1P9U2179OZPKA","A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While it really isn't a major concern, for people (family members) who learn how to use these switches, but aren't the ones who actually programmed them or know exactly what everything is, they tend to press and hold paddles to dim or ramp up devices. When they see that full bar, they assume it is dimmabe. and can end up holding a switch too long waiting for some action to take place, and can instead inadvertently alter programming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GHP3SJ57L6A0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008HUWWOC#wasThisHelpful","R2GHP3SJ57L6A0","A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3R1ZDOMKYA5BW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of course, Northern Exposure without Rob Morrow is like Gone With the Wind without Clark Gable and they made a major error in replacing him with a happily married couple.

"I don't understand how anybody could write such an unlikable heroine and still sell books.  Well, I bought the whole series before discovering how much I despise Faith.  She absolutely personifies everything I despise.  Hung up on THINGS, has to have big name brand clothes, only the best of foods, etc.  She gives what we call in the south ""stuck up"" a whole new meaning.  The husband is hardly ever mentioned which is a good thing I guess since he is a minister.  Not a very bright one apparently since he married Faith based on sex appeal for sure because she certainly has no good qualities and is less suited to be a minister's wife than I am.  Some of these books that don't feature Faith as much are pretty good mysteries.  One thing about Faith which is refreshing.

There is one area on my back that I can't reach to put on lotion.  I can hold this can up and spray down on my back one time and by the time I finish putting on my regular lotion my back is dry.

"Again, this author seems to drag in way too many people, all of whom seem to be related in some way and usually also related to Vida.  Her character got OLD and TIRESOME  a long time ago as she got to be more and more of a total jackass.  She has so much ATTITUDE that I don't know why anybody puts up with her much less lets her boss them around when she is the employee.  She is out of touch with reality where the worthless Roger is concerned but somehow manages to blame everybody else for his behavior.  I sort of keep hoping that Roger will take an ax to grandma thus showing her what he is really like.  As Emma and Milo have grown closer to the point of being engaged their behavior to each other seems to show less respect.  Milo borders on verbal abuse many times in front of other people.  Is this the small town not very intelligent man's way of showing off in front of his friends.  I hate it.  I hate the fact that they seem to bicker all the time.  They may think it's foreplay but it just sounds rude and mean most of the time.  As with most of her mysteries by the time it is finally resolved you have pretty much forgotten what happened and who the suspects were as she has dragged in so much useless information about uninteresting people.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IID4EJTFTUST/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345535340#wasThisHelpful","R1IID4EJTFTUST","A3J9LLWHZH15HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J9LLWHZH15HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have been more careful with the one I have but I want to always have one extra on hand in case the one I have stops working in the middle of the summer.

"This is a pretty good movie of it's type.  I've seen better and I've certainly seen worse.  It got sort of bogged down in whether or not the husband was a criminal or an FBI informant turned rogue.  Some of it was never explained.  Like how did the FBI ""know where he was all along""?  But, the heroine, though not a terrific actress, is adequate.  It was never explained how she continued to live in the huge gorgeous home when she was ""broke"".  I didn't understand why, when she finally found her son, she didn't just grab him and run back to her car but that wouldn't have fit with the last scenes, the big reveal so to speak.  The film continued to hold my interest and I enjoyed it.  I wished the detective hero would cut his hair instead of messing with it all the time but that is just a personal dislike.

"I didn't like the fact that the author dragged in a character who was really only known to people who have read several books before this one.  It just reeked of ""who the heck can I drag in now to be the guilty party"" and arrange all the facts so that they sort of fit for him as the murderer.  Made very little sense.  It was a surprise ending only in that the reader can't believe what she is reading.  I find Emma's brother's preaching about her relationship with Milo to be ridiculous.  He never said anything about the long drawn out affair with the overrated Tom who was married and stayed that way.  For one thing, it's none of her brother's business who Emma marries.  The very idea of expecting Milo to get an annulment which would make his children bastards is ludicrous.  Can another ""wrong"" make a right?  And, in what universe would his ex wife agree to it.  So, she is setting up another ""no win"" situation for Emma with a man who is still tied too tightly to his ex wife and his children.  I find Milo's continuing reference to his ex wife as Mulehide to be nothing less than revolting.  She apparently had enough to put up with in him when they were married, she is the mother of his children and deserves more respect especially now when she and the daughter are right there hanging around his neck again.  Of course, I've always found Milo to be one of the dullest characters I've ever read about.  But, Emma is worse so maybe they deserve each other, to go on bickering and griping at each other all the time with the explanation that ""they had a bad day"" but still groping each other and falling into bed at every opportunity which is apparently the only place they can agree on anything.  I'm continuing to read this series only in the hope that the horrible Roger will finally get what he deserves or that Vida will finally get a clue about him and actually admit what a little creep he has always been.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10O87H69DGZUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345502604#wasThisHelpful","R10O87H69DGZUA","A3J9LLWHZH15HG","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3J9LLWHZH15HG?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Just what I needed.  Heavy-duty, disposable gloves for my bicycle greasy chain and mucky tires, car maintenance, and many of the dirty or skin-irritant uses, e.g. bathroom chemicals.  Much thicker than the nitrile and vinyl disposable gloves I had used.Though designed for single-use, Gloveworks are easier to peel off than my thin vinyl and nitrile ones, which often tear when peeling off.  If I wish to reuse; Gloveworks can be carefully removed and then reused (being mindful of the dirt, of course).Non-disposable thicker gloves fit a bit loose, and fingers can't dig in or press hard enough into the cleaning surface.  And, user's feel of the surface and grasp of small items are greatly diminished  Thin gloves sometimes tear, but moreso, because I fear the tearing, I apply less cleaning pressure.Gloveworks feels stronger than the thin gloves, and its grip while wet was terrific while I cleaned the bathroom basin and toilet.  Because I feared tear less, I pressed harder.  This changes my cleaning--more power, feel more protected and unfortunately, a bit more carelessness to chemicals--though it protects better, it still might break.Fits me like a glove, should.11-15-15  Perfect for bicycle tire repairs.

"I use disposable gloves when applying glues, cleaning bicycles, wiping floors, cleaning really dirty areas, and for minor car maintenance and inspection.  Past Walgreens vinyl gloves frequently tore during bicycle and auto maintenance.  Learned while trying these nitriles that Ammex has a wide variety of disposable gloves, including an industrial version of Ammex latex gloves for about the same price, and likely better for my uses.As compared to my vinyl gloves, these Ammex nitriles are more comfortable and feels stronger yet more elastic as well.  Nitriles did not tear  for wiping an entire small bathroom using paper towels and scrubbing pad.  And gloves’ texturing provided better grip, including in wet conditions.These gloves are better than Walgreens vinyl gloves, but am planning to try Ammex’s industrial latex gloves, for still better performance.

"Remember Plato’s allegory of the cave?  Puppet-shadow shows on dimly lit walls to mislead the cave dwellers?  A truth-seeker climbs out of the cave, sees truthful sunlight, and returns to decry the myths of the puppet shadows.  This allegory applies to business myths too!This book is about shining light on the puppet shows of modern, romantic entrepreneurial myths.  You know how it goes— have an epiphony (sp) moment, web enable idea, everyone else will see its value and adopt it, and then, like Instagram or Whatsapp, be acquired, and become an instant billionaire.  Work four years, change the world, and retire to the tropics.  'And who are the modern puppet-shadow-masters?  Writers of entrepreneurial books.  And the cave dwellers?  Mostly a millennial herd instinct.  For example, books on entrepreneurial leadership praise virtues such as patience, good people skills, communications skills, etc.  Author myth-busts this.  He points out the younger Bill Gates was impatient and difficult to work for, and had Gates taken the time to transform his character to acquire conventional business leadership skills, Gates wouldn’t have time to have built Microsoft.  Pop go the mythical doctrines in thousands of books on how to become a successful entrepreneur.Though author acknowledges there are rare talented young entrepreneurs, as Zuckerberg, Gates, who are youthful Alexander the Greats, book advises that most entrepreneurs will instead experience a roller coaster ride, usually with a downward spiral.The author’s recommendation—climb the arduous path out of the dark cave, this path being one of traditional methods of business development.  The light at the end of the cave tunnel is business acumen and success.The book’s title really should have been about myth busting.  The other entrepreneurial how-to books tell readers the steps it takes to become a leader.  This book tells the flaws of these steps.  It's a great book, so as to analyze the other books properly.In another word, this book encourages one to climb out of the cave, but doesn’t really tell how to climb out very well.  Its message for climbing--trust your gut instincts-- is about the same message as to tell a rock climber to trust your feet.  But it does a terrific job on busting the flaws of the other-books'-business-shadow-puppet-theaters myths.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S29DI5S5EX7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=159918575X#wasThisHelpful","R1S29DI5S5EX7N","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is written mostly for those entirely new to Windows environment.  My question is, is this book also useful for experienced users of Windows 7 or 8?I love Visual series of graphical explanation books.  I tend to skim Visual books to find out what topics are within, and then use it as a quick reference, whenever I want to accomplish something I’m unfamiliar with.  Windows 10 introduced a lot of new usability features, and skimming this picture books is still a lot faster than reading books or even watching online videos.  Overall—worth the $25 retail price for providing introductory explanations.However, Windows 10 is designed to constantly change to updated features, and I would imagine in six months, many features will have changed.  For example, Microsoft’s staff advised me that Gmail’s contacts are not synching properly with Microsoft People.  Such synchronization update  isn’t noted in the chapter on Windows 10 People.

"Having a moderately deviated septum, I had tried 8 nasal dilators.  Moderately deviated is sufficient to unnaturally shut nostril Frequently, even when uncongested.  Moderately is not severely deviated, but more than common minor deviated septum.  Physicians have a scale for measuring degree of deviation.  Most dilators, including ones for snoring, can be used during daytime, though wearer would be unsightly.  The sports ones, as Rhinomed, have a tight nasal septum clamp, ensuring the dilator stays even during sports.My objective is to occasionally open more my left nostril, enabling nasal fluids to drain, and thus prevent congestion and sinusitis.  It is inappropriate to use dilators continually.  The basic idea is to use dilators occasionally, to prevent congestion and enable nose’s cilia hair to remain healthy enough to do their job of removing mucus. Nasal strips worked the best for nighttime.For daytime, Rhinomed and a soft nasal cone worked best.  The nasal cone fitted loosely and would fall out at times, be particularly unattractive, and was unsuitable for sports, but the nasal cone was far more comfortable than Rhinomed, and only one cone was needed.  Rhinomed uses a septum clip (clamp) to fasten it to nose, but this clip’s pressure hurt.  Over time, my mind could ignore this hurt, but then slight headaches began.  Pressure hurts so much--it's not going to fall out of the nose during athletics.My opinion is that one’s natural body is designed to excel, nostrils open up naturally during sports, and nasal dilators are more likely a detriment.  Instead, learn how to breathe better. However, if have moderate or extreme deviated septum or extreme allergies, Rhinomed can help in sports.  Don’t buy the marketing hype that dilators are suitable for all deviated septums.  Only a small percentage of deviated septums are severe enough to cause breathing difficulties.  Most people have minor deviated septums.  Also, try Grossan's Nasal irrigator before trying this.  One reason nostril may not be sufficiently opening or is congested is because nasal cilia isn't efficient.  By using nasal irrigation to restore a healthy cilia and thereby nose, nostrils will open up naturally better, without having to resort to dilators.Overall a 3 star, because this is one of my favorite daytime dilator, but hurts.10/14/15  If user has a collapsed nasal valves, this might work better still.  There are self-diagnostics tests online that can determine whether one has collapsed nasal valves.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P2MTERSSE1VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W6XIT20#wasThisHelpful","R3P2MTERSSE1VP","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I’m Using a Dean electric guitar, a Fender amp with built-in tuner, and a $12 D’Arddio clip-on tuner.  How does this $50 Polytune tuner cost-justify?Polytune has two modes—single-note and polyphonic.

That is, Polytune’s tone-indicator bounces around initially, before settling down, whereas D’Arddio and Fender’s tone-indicators are stable throughout.  As a result, for a single string tuning, D’Arddio and Fender are slightly faster.In the polyphonic mode, Polytune uses one red LED above for sharp and one red LED below for flat to measure each of simultaneously struck 6 strings.  These red LEDs’ light intensity measures how severely the string is off-tune.  By gauging LEDs’ intensity for 6 strings, player can quickly determine which string is severely off-tune, and tune it.Polyphonic can be productive particularly in live, solo performances.  First, no need to first power the amp, as Polytune uses proprietary sensing method.  Second, when playing solo, one can strum all strings without amplification and see that only one string is far greater off-tune than other, then tune that string.  Saves some time.One of my Polytune’s G string’s sensors is sporadic in polyphonic mode.Overall, does save time—so a five star, if not too pricey for the buyer.  Drops to 3 star due to G string sensor defect.9/19-- I've contacted TCelectronic tech support.  Confusing website that caused me to lose 20 frustrating minutes.9/20-- other than the G string problem, this Polytune mode is far faster.  This would be a 5 star except for the defect.9/22--TC Electronic support responded after weekend and gave an intelligent answer, which I'll try out.  +1 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OU6LP646OKFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZU4G0ZK#wasThisHelpful","R3OU6LP646OKFE","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This review is written for those accustomed to older-generation or single-large-inner-sack daypacks (with possibly several outer pockets), and are unaware of features of modern multi-inner-compartments daypacks.This Thule daypack’s inner large sack is divided into two.  One compartment includes 3 small-items-storage compartments, for better organization.  The second compartment is padded so as to hold and protect a laptop and tablet.  Daypack’s shell is made of water-resistant material, and the second compartment’s access zipper is further rain-protected.  The stored laptop and tablet will survive a drizzle, possibly a brief rainfall, and possibly a drop.Thule’s outer shell has two side, open-top elastic pockets, and a middle, adjustable size, open-top pocket.  These are useful for water bottles, and other larger items that can be easily-reached. Additionally the outer has a middle 5” x 7.5” x 1.5” (max) zippered container constructed of a firm-flexible-plastic.  This container is designed for carrying fragiles such as eyelasses, earbuds, and other miniature electronics.  Thule’s ad describes this container as “Crushproof”, meaning the plastic will bounce back after crushing—realistically, the fragiles will be crushed.Appearance--looks great!  Good also for bicycling, it was lightweight, and sufficiently small for easier balance.  25 year warranty and looks durable as well.The tech bag feature I’m still looking for is “shrinking-capable”, to meet changing plane baggage regulations.

"My prior setup consisted of an older Epson all-in-one printer with single, multi-color cartridge, HP personal B&W laserjet, and Epson precision scanner .  What I hated about my prior all-in-one were:  one color of inkjet's cartridge would run out before other colors--requiring entire cartridge replacement, scanning was cumbersome requiring individual pages’ babysitting feeding, and small and cryptic LED menu display.  I also used the HP B&W laserjet because even while all-in-one was printing mostly in black, one of its multi-color cartridge's coloring would soon quickly run out, and replacement cartridges are expensive (particularly when one factors in purchasing transaction time and re-installation time).  And using 3 devices took up extra storage space.This Epson ET-4500 ink tanks filled easily.  Is this network-shareable printer also easy to set up?  Unfortunately, the scanner portion did not sync with its cloud storage, necessitating a tech support call.  Epson’s support was available at 9:15PM, Central Time!  And the tech support person solved this, though it took 45 minutes.  Apparently, a rare problem.  I’m impressed with Epson’s tech support hours.  Afterwards, scanner worked well--without baby sitting during multipage feeds.  The scanned images were automatically forwarded from the cloud to my email.As for printing quality, for B&W my HP Laserjet’s resolution is slightly sharper.  Epson's coloring is muted on plain paper.  Nevertheless, having plentiful and inexpensive color made a difference in my printing life--things I never printed before in color are now in better explanatory color. I don't do photo quality printing, so will try high quality inkjet paper later.As for speed, personal HP connected via USB is significantly faster on the First page only of each of the Word files I sent.  The Epson has a 5 to 10 second pause before printing first page, but afterwards it is faster than my personal HP printer.  It's unclear to me as to whether the delay is due to the Bluetooth vs. USB, or the inkjet vs. laserjet.ET-4500’s LED display menu is far larger and more intuitive than my prior Epson All-in-One.  One network connection problem occurred, but I simply rebooted the Epson to restore.5 stars because this ET-4500 solves what I previously hated about inkjets listed above and has inexpensive color printing.  Multipage automated scanning worked, inks can be changed individually rather than buying an entire cartridge, LED easier to understand, saves space.Basically, if user is willing to accept muted color with economical inking—excellent choice.  If want only B&W—other printers print crisper.11/13/15-- having used this nearly three months of light usage-- nearly flawless operations.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R103M49FVS1EY4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01122JEHE#wasThisHelpful","R103M49FVS1EY4","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a funny book.  It’s about how to increase market share, using very-brief, case-studies of large corporations, and deriving 8 growth precepts. About 80% of content feels like these case studies are authors’ customers or prospective customers, and authors are overly effusive with praise.I’ve read about 140 pages, skimmed remainder, and learned little.  The 8 precepts are business ideas the reader likely already read before—in summary, Innovate, Build Customer Advocates, Welcome Customers’ Criticisms, Aesthetic Appearances Matter, Transform Employees, Ramp Up Relationships, Take Giant Leaps, and Handle Schisms in Relationships.Guess you already knew about these precepts too?  One can simply read these precepts’ explanations (which constitute 5% of the book), and understand 85% of the book.  The 140 pages I read has ZERO teaching on how Time Limitations affect creating branding experiences, and it is these time limitations that is challenging to accomplish branding effects for not-wealthy companies.Can a reader really benefit from learning in the mini-case studies, which constitute 80% of this book?  First consider authors’ biased interpretation of what the entrepreneur did.  Then, consider, that the entrepreneur’s temperament, thought processes, and circumstances are likely very different from the reader’s.  For example, Armand Hammer of Occidental Oil had an effusively praise biography book.  His ex-public relations agent then wrote “Dr. Hammer and Mr. Hyde, the Dark Side of Power:  the Real Armand Hammer.” Rocket feels like the first, unrealistic biography case studies.Book’s first case study is of Lee Wexner of Victoria Secret, and its precept is-- “Don’t Ask Your Customers What They Want (Because They Don’t Know Till You Show Them)”.  Reader probably have already heard this precept from stories about Steve Jobs and Henry Ford.  80% of this chapter simply praises Lee Wexner’s ingenuity and business savvy.  But will becoming aware these Wexner’s  traits transfer his skills to you?  Unclear.Most branding experts I’ve met tend to redefine terminology to fit other business disciplines under an umbrella of branding, and authors, as B2C branding experts, here do similarly.  For example, Wexler’s ingenuity in “somewhat franchising” international operations is written as financial high returns of his branding prowess.  Huh?  How did the meaning of branding suddenly encroach into financial structuring of franchising, as to mean same?  And aren’t many international operations structured similar to “somewhat franchising”—where is Wexler’s praised branding genius?  Similarly, endless praise and redefined terminology for the several case studies I read.This book is mostly suitable for very large companies only.  The principles are suitable for any company, but book doesn’t tell how unwealthy companies can create the Time and Money to then implement these—which is more valuable information.And the “take aways” and other advice given—these are mostly platitudes you’ve already heard before.  Additionally, the action steps and even the precepts are lightweight.  60% excessive praise, 30% reinforcement of commonly-known business principles, 10% I learned something new.Reader’s time is probably spent better reading something else.  But if you want sugary reinforcement of precepts you already know, the writing style of this book is excellent.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DGLBEYT1GFFZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1259585425#wasThisHelpful","R3DGLBEYT1GFFZ","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you’re looking for a commercial vacuum cleaner that is powerful, quiet, simple to operate, stores vertically compactly, looks professional, has inexpensive replacement bags, and HEPA capabilities, this fits the bill.  Even my elderly housewife-occupation mom thinks highly of this vacuum cleaner.Office environments are usually less cluttered than residential, and if this vacuum performs in my cluttered, dust-mite-infested-carpet apartment, it will excel in less-cluttered offices.  My current daily carpet vacuuming regimen to reduce dust mites allergens is such a drag.  How does Hoover upright compare to my other vacuums?My Kenmore HEPA upright vacuum is noisy, not that powerful, and didn’t resolve my allergies that well; not in the same class as this Hoover (but then Kenmore had cost slightly less).  My Electrolux HEPA canister vacuum had the highest rated consumer reports ratings, at the time of its purchase, and cost more and overall performs excellently.  I additionally used several HEPA robotics vacuum cleaners, including Roomba, LG, and otherOne weakness with canister vacuum was the dragging-it-around process.  The vacuum head is at one location and it was inconvenient having to drag the canister around, dodging the cluttered obstructions.  Weaknesses with the robotics vacuum included the amount of environment setup time (moving the furniture around), the robotics vacuum still needed monitoring time, and its small dust bin necessitated constant bin cleaning.For open space vacuuming, which constitute 95% of vacuuming, this Hoover is faster and more enjoyable.  Not only is the Hoover light in weight, but also its wheels are higher quality than my Kenmore’s.  Additionally, I believe Hoover’s underside brushes help propel the vacuum and does not resist much when pulled backwards.  The result is very lightweight feel, smooth operations, and speed.  Most importantly, because Hoover is powerful, I don’t need to repeatedly vacuum same spot over and over.In the remaining 5% of vacuuming surface, both the robotics and the canister were better.  The robotics could operate with clearance of about 4 inches, and the canister’s head, about 2 inches.  Hoover’s arm can be lowered so that it works with a height clearance of about 11 inches high.  This means, the canister and robotics would work better under sofas, beds, kitchen cabinets space, etc., where the Hoover cannot reach.  Also, the canister came with 4 vacuum suction heads, for better reach.As for HEPA efficiency, even with the highly rated Electrolux, I still noticed some vacuum dust blow out.  With the robotics, I set up the environment (which takes time), and don’t walk into the room until 30 minutes later.  But robotics required monitoring, so I was still exposed to some dust blow out, whenever I went into the room being vacuumed.  I doubt that the Hoover’s HEPA protection will be as good as these, but my initial impression is that its overall HEPA dust protection is very good.Hoover’s HEPA replacement bags are also far less costly than the robotics replacement dust bin filters and Electrolux bags’.Overall, Hoover is superior for 95% of the environment, but because it lacks different size vacuum heads and has a higher height clearance requirement, Hoover can’t do the other 5%.  But 95% may be good enough for commercial environments, and then bring in a canister every 10th time or so.Even my elderly, slightly disabled mom likes this.  5 star for commercial.  5 star for 95% of residential as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZJQW7VHHTVID/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DSSNNGE#wasThisHelpful","RZJQW7VHHTVID","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I’m looking for, in addition to securing guitar tightly, is rapid exchange of guitar straps--to move a strap with lock from one guitar to another rapidly, and to rapidly change straps on a single guitar.Each of the two Superlocks in this set consists of a large-button for the strap, washer, a small-button with screw to be drilled into the guitar.To exchange straps, one uses fingernails, or easier a hex wrench, to remove the large button hugging the first strap; then push in 2nd strap and screw back in the large button.  This is nearly the same speed of exchange as changing a strap on a guitar without strap locks.However, it appears one cannot purchase separately the small screw-in-guitar buttons, such that a single strap with a large button can be attached to several guitars' small buttons.  The strap change process here would be very quick-- maybe under 15 seconds.  And it should be cheap-- one large-small button set is $15, each extra small-button, is for perhaps, $4.  Total cost for 2 extra small buttons and one set would be $23.  Instead, it is necessary to purchase 3 separate button sets, each for $15-- $45 instead of $23.If all you’re planning to use one strap for one guitar, this is a 5 star.

"Below is a comparison between this Hohner and a Fender dreadnought guitar that cost twice as much.The Fender does sound slightly better, but was frustrating for a beginner.  Fender came with strings gauge and height that hurt my fingertips, so paid extra $50 for luthier to replace and lower strings.  But strings separation remained tight, cramping my B7 chord.  Each time I contacted Fender or its dealers regarding warranty coverage on strings separation distance, I got a run-around.This Hohner looks like a computer-machine-precision-cut instrument--a mechanical rather than craftsman look.  Still looks great!  My fingertips hurt far less with the Hohner.  Strings height was ideal for me straight of the box.  Strings tension and height makes a BIG difference for the beginner players' fingertips and desire to practice.Haven't had to thoroughly test Hohner's electronics yet.  Some preliminary thoughts-- Hohner's microphone and preamp has an equalizer, which makes a big difference on my acoustic-amp-modeling feature of my electric guitar-amp.Considering that the Fender cost more than twice as much and yet still required adjustments, I am very happy with the Hohner, which additionally came with a decent bag.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OCBS5MSSF3VD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGAP5AU#wasThisHelpful","R1OCBS5MSSF3VD","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product needs far more explanatory information for the western consumer.  Just what exactly does the box’s benefit labeling “supports cognitive function and brain health” mean?It’s troublesome and difficult to isolate the body effects of a nutraceutical as this.  Here’s my experience.  When I first ate these, I developed excessive saliva, and a slight upset stomach.  Coincidence?  Maybe it was something else new I ate?  Acid reflux?  When used again, the excessive saliva and acid reflux recurred, so my guess is likely due to these capsules.Researching WebMD, I learned two of its three active ingredients are known to cause an upset stomach.  And its product box labeling fine-print labeling suggests eating these “preferably” with meals.I did experience a calming effect—a more serene mind that enables me to think more clearly, as one might expect from a nutraceutical designed for the head chakra.  But, simultaneously, I felt lethargic.  Serene, but less motivation to be active.

"This review is written for those new to microphone varieties.  I had learned about microphones while recording singing—and there are many types of microphones, with genre names such as handheld dynamic, studio hanging condensers, electret condensers (found in lapel-worn and other tiny mics).  A mic that records more challenging singing well will excel at speech recordings.From a technology perspective, it is very difficult to capture actual sound.  So, except for enormously expensive mics, mics add coloring to recordings (and aural aesthetics then are affected by the coloring).  Room acoustic conditions are also difficult to control.  My past electret condensers and low end mics sounded bad, and past mic-receiving-recording software were cumbersome.  Sennheiser proved capable and easy on speech recordings.This Sennnheiser's installation and usability is nearly truly plug and play, straight from the packing box to recording on my iPad2.  One of its two included software, Apogee MetaRecorder, wasn’t found at the Appstore, but was readily available at Apogee’s website.  Nearly frustration free installation and setup.This mic with iPad Air 2 and Metarecorder record-then-plays my singing better than it actually is.  How so?  Removed bass undertones and has algorithm that smooth out the tenor sounds.  A rougher vocal sound becomes almost smooth and good enough to add to a music recording tract.Did it capture subtleties in vocal tones?  Yes and no.  Human speech comprehension occurs more in the tenor range.  In telephony technology, this is known as the intelligible part of speech.  Sennheiser captured this intelligible tenor and its subtleties very well, but did not capture the bass undertones.  For example, in its recording of my electric guitar, the guitar’s bass strings (5th and 6th strings) diminished in volume significantly, as compared to 1st through 4th strings.The bass part of the voice is important for building excitement, motivation, undertones, and other things, but it usually isn’t valuable for recreating intelligible speech wording.  For intelligible speech and tenor portions of singing, this Sennheiser delivered crisp, clear, smooth recordings.  To give a further idea, based on inferred quality reflected by higher pricing….  For intelligible-tenor-speech, as good as my high-end $200 street price dynamic mic, not as good as a low-end $500 large diaphragm condenser mic.  Far superior to the terrible electret condenser mics found in $75 digital voice recorders or most dynamic mics under $100 street price.Also comes with a tiny wind screen for windy conditions.The second included software, Apogee Maestro, appears to be a limited version of the Apogee Maestro, as described on Apogee’s website.  Its limited features include volume control and capabilities reducing hiss, rumble, and overload.  No other equalizer-mixer functions.

"I wanted to try aromatherapy to see if it helps with sinus problems and initially thought this smelled like lavender soap.  Yuck.  But, I kept it near the desk and occasionally took a whiff.  Cool!  This is somewhat addictive for a compulsive person.  Why eat an extra cookie when I’m bored?  Whiff of this lavender as a distraction instead.  Lavender smell is reputed to be soothing, and it does slightly calm my hyperactivity.  But I doubt it helps with my sinus problems.  What I really need is a spicy lavender mix to open up my nostrils, spice up my sinuses, and calm me down simultaneously. :)  Please email notify me when such is invented.  :)However, if you’re looking for a soothing aromatherapy smell, take it from a hyperactive Attention Deficit Disorder as me—this works.

"Let’s compare to my prior hard plastic spatula with metal stem.  Yes, only a metal stem, as its plastic handle became unglued, hardly a problem likely to occur this unibody DII spatula.My favorite pan has 3 inch tall, sides, at about a 55 degrees steep angle.  I can bend DII’s spatula and its handle’s angle to this 55 degrees angle, such that DII spatula moves around the pan perfectly.  And whereas, I thought a hard plastic spatula would pick up the food better, I found DII’s soft silicon smoothly goes under foods and provides minor adhesion to ensure the food stays spatula on while moving the food from pan to dish.  Less worry about dropping a rolling hot dog from a hard plastic spatula.Also, Dii Silicon soft handles feel much better than any of the hard-surface handles of my other cookware.  Though this comparison isn’t really fair, because this Dii is new and my prior spatula is old, still in many ways Dii is easily superior.And my prior wooden spoon that slightly scrapes pan’s non-stick surfaces—it doesn’t take the dishwasher well.  Dii’s spoon is easily washable.For approximately $5 per cookware utensil, I like these because they are bendable, easily pick up foods with some adhesion, and feels softer to hold and more heat resistant too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZCK5WAGJQ7JZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKQT09K#wasThisHelpful","R1ZCK5WAGJQ7JZ","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is an easy to read book on business leadership and management principles, and authors claim these three-- Priorities, Who, and Relationships—constitute core principles of a successful company.  Book explains the principles’ essentials, and reader is then asked to complete a 30 questions survey, deriving a Power score which reflects the quality of business organization.Of course, the real world is more complicated than answers to 30 survey questions.  But the authors do make a good point in that these 30 questions are valuable and that their results can be used to derive a single Power score which is easy to understand.  (Though seems I read in the Economist there was also a similar single number finance metric that became a major cause of the financial meltdown due to overuse).Some companies will drink this Koolaid (principles) and run faster than Bugs Bunny.  But then, to compare fairly, might diligently practicing others' leadership management principles also speed success?Priorities have to be set for businesses, Work assigned to the correct working member, Relationship maintained for the working members-- that's basically what this book says.

"Very clever design.  Having the user supply the bucket significantly saved this product’s shipping, packaging, and storage costs.I only occasionally need a wet/dry vacuum, and wouldn’t spend over $60 for one.  This unit is under $35!  Within 10 days of its arrival, a 2 gallon container in my refrigerator leaked, leaving puddles in refrig and on floor.  My prior solution would have been sponge and a bucket.  Using this wet vac was three to five times faster and less annoying as well!  Next, to tackle my parents’ garage—vacuum will be small, but I don’t clean garages but once every 3 years.Excellent as a low price, wet-dry vacuum, with limitations in power, short suction tube, and only a 90 days warranty.  Yet, nearly a perfect solution for occasional users--low price, saves space, valuable occasionally.User’s guide recommends specific buckets, but I couldn’t find any of the recommended buckets at Lowe’s.

"Versatype’s marketing literatures claims it operates in 4 modes; I think it’s actually 5 modes. 1. Typing mode is comparable to a laptop computer.  If you’ve ever used a netbook laptop, it’s similar.  2. The reading mode is holding with one hand and tapping with other hand’s finger, similar to iPad’s normal usage, except that the Versatype-iPad combination is, of course, much heavier.  3. Viewing/stand mode is a V angled view of the screen, with the keyboard acting as base to support the angled screen.  4. Protection mode means Versatype is performing as a strong protection cover (4 feet drop protection!)  These four modes are described in its marketing literatures.My claimed fifth useful mode is a rotated screen viewing mode, as shown in this review’s photo.  For example, a support consultant and I were talking across a bar table at the Apple Store.  I could rotate the screen diagonal to the keyboard resting on the table.  Both of us can then more easily see the screen, while I’m typing.  This rotation is very useful when multiple people are working together.  Works well upto 25 degrees diagonally—beyond that some of keys are blocked off.I’ve used numerous tablet covers.  This Targus-iPad combination does all ergonomics my prior pad covers did, is tough-cover protection, has a keyboard for laptop usage, and rotates for even better shared viewing.Downside—heavier than other covers.I didn’t use Apple tablets much because they’re slower in usage than Windows PCs.

"The book, the Yeast Connection written by a MD, describes how antibiotics killed good bacteria in the gastro-intestinal tract, resulting in damaged gastro-intestinal flora, causing illnesses.  These Therabreath’s probotics for the mouth claims to restore damaged bacterial flora in the mouth, resulting in healthier teeth, gums, ear, nose, and throat; and claims improves bad breath, respiratory problems (colds,flus), sore throat, ear ache, etc.At about $1.45 each tablet, these are expensive probiotics.  Will it do as it claims?  Other than improving bad breath, Therabreath’s brief 8 days per month treatment seems too short for users to determine its effectiveness for the longer time cycles of above illnesses.  And at $1.45 each tablet, each tablet is more expensive than a yogurt cup, which has far more good bacteria, though possibly not same type.Did it work for me?  I didn’t fall ill or develop bad breath while taking this—so no news might be good preventative news here.  Insufficient value for me to buy these regularly, except when after antibiotics treatment.  During antibiotics treatment, I eat yogurt after antibiotic pills and add these during and after antibiotics, for two months.  Therabreath recommends to eat these starting 2 weeks after antibiotics use.  But I’m hoping these bacteria live long enough to prevent possible yeast issues.  And after antibiotics, I would use yogurt and these for perhaps a couple of months afterwards.Therabreath came packaged in a box sealed with messy plain tape strip, and tablets are unmarked.  Perfect product for tampering?  Service is very good—company quickly answered my questions and sent another package.Overall, expensive probiotic probably useful after antibiotics usage.  4 stars.7-19-15  Restarting Therabreath 3 weeks after extensive antibiotics.

"Usually, aligning a single picture onto a wall is already troublesome.  Yet, it’s easy to rearrange multiples of these tiles.  For example, I initially set 3 tiles vertically staggered—staggering 3 looked awful.  Easy to solve—remove tile’s adhesive to the wall, which comes right off without any damage to the wall, and rearrange!  This 3 piece tile set comes with only 4 adhesive strips—I recommend purchasing far more for best trial and error artistic placements.Less than 40 tile designs are available for purchase.  Has 2 specialty designs—a height riser for tile’s 3D effects and a blank version for attaching custom photos and artwork.The instructions advises using alcohol to prep-clean the wall.

Also, there were no warnings that the tiles contained medium strengths magnets, which may possibly damage magnetic media.  Inadequate instructions.Overall—these tiles’ advantage is that they are easy to rearrange without renailing and creating additional wall holes.

"This book’s final (10th) chapter has Brooks’s historical analysis of American character-values evolution, from about 1930 to 2014.  This history is useful to modern living and is the best I’ve read of this type, so this book deserves a 5 star.  I recommend skipping all prior chapters.Chapter 1 is Brooks’s opinions serving as an introduction.  Three fifths of chapters 2 through 6 are biographies focusing on character changes influenced by social conditions, moral language evolution, and children upbringing.  Brooks’s biographical writings are based on others’ writings, and I’m always suspicious of biographers who have never met the subject person, and in this case, there’s a further filtering of another author.The other two fifths of chapters 2 through 6 are David Brook’s commentaries using these biographies to elucidate some moral judgment he has on modern lifestyles.  Many are insightful, but I found it difficult to figure out what social and moral framework Brooks was coming from.  That is, Brooks would comment about some subject matter, but I found it difficult to figure out how he judged it that way--which principles or philosophical approach was he taking?Having been puzzled enough from chapters 1 to 6, I skipped chapters 7 to 9, and read 10, the final chapter.  Here, Brooks summarizes how Americans evolved starting in 1930s from a “realism tradition” that views a person as deeply flawed and inherently sinful--“crooked wood”—such that the person should strive to constantly improve his or her flaws.  To then evolve to currently a “romantic tradition” (Me-centric society, where a person regards his inner self as divine), meritocratic materialistic success (at disregard of inner well-being), and a third trait (difficult to find again this word in text, because I felt chapter 10’s subtitles needed re-editing)This book is written with the incorrect assumptions that readers are speed readers willing to uncritically and rapidly read first 9 chapters to arrive at Brooks’ valuable conclusions in chapter 10.

"If private viewing is an important issue, then this is a capable screen protector with several limitations.  I have an Asus 15.6” touchscreen laptop-tablet, which can function either as an enormous tablet or a laptop, by flipping its screen 360 degrees.Installing Belkin was easy.  When the screen is in landscape position, sideways viewing is completely darkened, and vertical viewing is partially darkened.  For examples, with a large spreadsheet, document, PowerPoint, or movie in landscape positioned viewing, viewing from sides is significantly reduced .Here are some of the screen protector’s limitations:1. If I turn my laptop-tablet to profile view, the profile view’s horizontal sides are only partially darkened.2. Belkin's plastic adheres to the Asus glass creating many bubbles (similar to how water looks when squeezed between glass panes).  These bubbles are noticeable on white screen coloring, and less on other colors .3. Belkin's thickness causes a slit when Asus’s two halves close, allowing for small particles to fall into Asus's keyboard.Belkin has excellent clarity and comes with extra corner suction adhesives for easy re-installation.  I wasn’t able to test how many times these adhesives can be reused.For someone who regularly needs this privacy, Belkin is a 5 star.  If the Belkin happens to allow a laptop's halves to close tightly, this would be a 5 star.  If halves can’t close tightly, 4 stars.  For a laptop-tablet, this is a 3 star due to no privacy in profile view.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MQT3FA2WL3U0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R7R1CLU#wasThisHelpful","R1MQT3FA2WL3U0","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a $400 street price Fender dreadnought using very light weight gauge strings, all of which sound disappointing.The easiest way to install is when replacing strings.  But, if strings are attached, I recommend first reviewing the installation video found at Planet Wave's website.  Installation of O-Port when strings are attached was easy.  Three of my bridge pins were on so tight that a puller couldn't pull these off.  Still, the O-Port fit through while with 3 strings attached.Sound produced is a lot brighter.  Finger picking w O-Port was definitely a brighter feel sound.  Chords using finger nails strumming--perhaps a more rounded sound, but lack character.  Chords using pick--sounds very good.  O-Port misses a slight amount of natural character in the sound (complexity in the sound).

"This review is solely for ATT Uverse users, which (according to ATT) requires use of its freely supplied ATT router-modem.  Other ISPs, as Comcast, allows differing router and modems, so I would imagine Nighthawk perform better.  My question are: as Nighthawk has to interface with the Uverse modem, what kinds of configuration, incompatibility, and support issues might result, as ATT doesn't support Nighthawk?  How much faster is Nighthawk over ATT's modem-router?  What are the benefits and downsides of using Nighthawk over ATT's-supplied modem-router, in a large apartment?  This review is unconcerned with distance issues, a major reason most people acquire Nighthawk.  My review concerns are speed, dependability, and health.Nighthawk router is easy to install and fast on my AT&T Uverse 18mbps with Pace router-modem.  AT&T supplied and requires use of its Pace router-modem.  I attached Nighthawk to Pace's Ethernet port, to utilize Pace's modem.  Expected an installation nightmare since AT&T doesn't support Nighthawk, and Netgear also didn't provide good answers.  But following Nighthawk's easy instructions, amazingly, the Nighthawk worked straight out of the box!  I love computing equipment without headaches!Testing using speedtest.net, Nighthawk slowed to 9 mbps download, half of connected Pace modem's 18mbps.  But the Overall Speed of Nighthawk is significantly faster than Pace or using Clear (my prior ISP service).  I don't exactly know the technical details, but Youtube videos (including HD ones) and other web accesses are running much faster on Nighthawk than on Pace.  My guess is that the bottleneck was solved by the faster Nighthawk wifi connection.Also, I love Nighthawk's administrator's control panels.  Easy to understand--for once, I can do some complicated router settings myself.Nighthawk has some downsides:1. The attached Pace router-modem still emits a wifi signal and Nighthawk issues a 2.5ghz and a 5 ghz signal;  my body is now bathed by three wifi signals instead of one.2. Minor technical issues that appear to be resolvable with Netgear's tech support (which I haven't even needed to use)2a. My computer more frequently dropped the Internet signal, for reasons I don't understand.2b. Microsoft Office One Drive doesn't understand some portions of the web certificate in this Pace-Nighthawk attachment.3. A physical connection might work better in my single user environment.  90% of my computing usage is on a single desktop computer, and the remaining 10%--tablets and smartphones-- can go through the slower Pace.  Netgear's Ethernet Powerline 500 adapter, which connects from wall plugs, costs an average of $25.  My calculations suggest upto 3 Powerline users can be a more cost effective solution than a Nighthawk.  Beyond 3, it would be more expensive using Powerline 500s and there will be far more wireless devices in connection such that Nighthawk becomes more cost effective.In summary, Nighthawk is significantly faster than ATT Uverse's supplied Pace router-modem, Nighthawk installation is easy, and its administration module is easy to operate.  Negatives include Nighthawk's two unwanted wifi signals and a possibly superior solution with  Powerline 500 coupled-Pace for under 3 users.  4 stars for 3 or less active users on Uverse.  5 stars for more than 3 users on Uverse.  5 stars on ISPs that allow users to select and would need to buy modems and routers (whereas with Uverse, a free Pace is included).12-29-14  I've decided Nighthawk's extra wifi signals and Pace's singular wifi signal were just excessive for an apartment, and instead Ethernet cabled my Pace for my primary computer and disabled Nighthawk.  There may be some complicated way of turning off Pace's wifi signal to use the Netgear, but I would want the entire wireless transmission of any kind from Pace to be turned off. 4 stars for potential health reasons for anyone who has to sit or sleep nearby both routers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y5X5RN9NZC1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MRVJY5C#wasThisHelpful","R2Y5X5RN9NZC1T","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately, my primary phone is Windows 8.1 Nokia.  The Nokia Bluetooth pairing went smoothly, but without the Dolby app, the sound is only crisp and lacking in bass and fullness.  Kindle Fire also lacks the Pulse-Dolby app.My secondary phone, Kyocera Hydro Vibe, a modern Android, loaded the Dolby app, but wouldn't pair using Bluetooth or NFC.  My older Android Samsung SPH-L300 phone also wouldn't pair.

"This product has many capabilities.  Technically, WD My Passport (aka WDP) can be described as a multiuser file server, multi-media server, and wifi server, all in one handheld size unit.  Just 10 years ago, companies would hire a technician full time to provide these server capabilities.  Because WDP is a server, its primary usefulness is serve multiple Distant devices with services such as multi-user video streaming and other digital media transfer methods.In cases of individual-use, I view WDP as impractical for most individuals with an Internet connected PC.  Because:  1. Individual-use online cloud storage is free or inexpensive and getting faster constantly and also because 2. faster transfer is achieved from USB cable than from wifi.  Technically capable individuals can find use for WDP, but there are easier, inexpensive solutions available for most of us.  For examples, some have used this device together with a tablet for viewing movies.  Technically, it'll work, but practically, a small laptop (nowadays under $200) costs less total and be far more capable.  And some have used it for backup, and again, technically, it'll kind of work.  But WDP backs up only certain type of files and is likely far less capable than cloud based backup services, which would also cost a lot less.  (I guess if one has a lot of pirated movies and didn't want to be scrutinized by a cloud based storage, this will be practical.)If without Internet access, the WDP can create a wifi and centralized storage for mobile devices.  Still and video photographers with many mobile-originated files come to mind as finding WDP's SD card input and wifi accessibility useful.As a group-sharing device, I see the device as, instead, Practical. It can:  1. Serve as a video server streaming for upto 4 concurrent videos--four family members can watch 4 different videos.  2. Family photo albums can be posted at a single wifi accessible storage.  3. If a speaker wanted upto 8 people to look at something on their mobile devices, all 8 can access WDP, without Internet, e.g. on a field trip.  By group-sharing, I also mean multiple DISTANT devices.  If an individual lives in an apartment, impractical.  If single individual lives in 2 story house, some advantages over carrying a wired portable hard disk.WDP also can act as an Internet hotspot and a backup media server.  For example, using online automated backup, e.g. Carbonite, might be easier for a single individual, but a family of four might find using WDP's backup services to be more cost effective.Somethings WDP does not do well.  I did not find a Kindle app.  Lacks an iTunes server, which means audio files will be more difficult to share. My Windows 8's File History backup software did not recognize WDP as a backup storage device.Pluses:1. Price is right.  Based on photography magazine professional reviewers, this unit costs significantly less than comparable products.  (11/2014)2. Has SD card, faster Wifi, fast USB 3.0 inputs and retrieval methods.3. Has security measures for group use.4. Includes data backup software to backup other computers media files.5. An inexpensive multi-media server.As a single user, I find other solutions easier and more intuitive than WDP.  For multi-user applications, WDP is packed with value.  A four stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1718CXGDT4VLI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M9B3XZM#wasThisHelpful","R1718CXGDT4VLI","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I once rented a decorated, furnished home from an ex-friend, and later learned she had expected its artistic duck-art bath mat would be decorative and never be used :).Grund's modern zig zag design mat looks great in my current plebian light blue, large tiled bathroom.  Not as cushy as my ex-friend's tightly woven duck mat; not as cushy as thick carpeting; nearly as cushy as a low piled carpeting with foam underneath--far more cushy than most bath mats.  The zig zag design can really draw attention away from plain tiles' and floor's blandness.Grund claims its mat's colors and anti-skid characteristics won't fade after hundreds of washes.  Most rugs in new condition work very well when new. Are Grund's long-term claim's believable?  Grund's base's surface is built tougher and of a different weave than bathroom mats I've seen, enabling for better long-term anti-skid and cushioning. Reviewers of other Grund mats have noted its colors last for years.  Being the world's largest manufacturer of bath mats, Grund's claims are likely to be more scrutinized and believable.And, my ex-friend's ducky mat was so thick that moisture would evaporate slowly.  Grund claims its polyacrylic fabric dries faster, reducing potential mold problems.So, if price isn't a concern, and you like this mat's design, it's a 5 star, because of its claims in durability of anti-skid, color stays, and soft-cushy comfort.  It's pricey though; if I was to personally buy this, I would rate it a 4 star due to high price.To my ex-friend and ex-landlord--this would have kept our friendship and your rent payments longer than your artistic ducky mat :).12-2014  Don't run a Roomba vacume over this.

"According to several orthopedic surgeons (including professors) and a chiropractor I've spoken with:  joint pains are caused by numerous factors, including osteoarthritis.  Glucosamine-chondroitin treats only a percentage of the osteoarthritis sufferers.  How does one determine whether it does?  Try some, according to a medical professor.These physicians also say that Move Free's third ingredient, hyaluronic acid, must be injected into to the joint.  Noticeably, Move Joint's website claims that an unreferenced clinical study shows hyaluronic acid can be ingested.  Move Free's final ""active"" ingredient, ""Uniflex"" is just a bioflavonoid.  It's unclear whether Move Free is more effective than any other glucosamine-chondroitin combination.Does Move Free provide drug interaction information?  When I inquired regarding antiacid and a second common drug, Move Free's customer service replied with ""ask your doctor"".I dislike advertising misrepresentation, so will take off stars based on that:1. Broadening treatment claims by wording product is effective for many joint pains, instead of accurately saying glucosamine-chondroitin is useful for osteoarthritis--  -1 star.2. Weak supporting evidence for hyaluronic acid and Uniflex -1 star.3. Did not answer questions on drug interferences.  -1 star.Move Free is a try-it-and-see nutraceutical.

"I'd like to review Primula first as a normal infuser and second as a flavored-water maker.  Primula is potentially a great 5 star product, but it could use superior and multiple infusion cores (the cylindrical unit holding the fruits).  Still, Primula produced great tasting flavored water and is effective in reducing my sugar or diet soda intakes.First, as a normal infuser....  For a party or for very large families, it is one of the best designed consumer products I've experienced.  Features include:. A party-size liquid dispenser holding 2 gallons.  Most large dispensers tend to be wide; this is narrow and long.  Food and drinks at parties tend to be served in a linear line, and its narrowness takes up less space.. Dispenser and all accessories can be stored compactly using 5"" width, 13"" depth, and 16"" height.. Fits and dispenses well inside the refrigerator as well as outside.. The base stand lifts the tap so that tall glasses will fit underneath easily.. Convenient chilling using coolant cores.. Convenient internal stirrerOverall, a well designed, large capacity infuser, yet compact in space requirement.Secondly, from the perspective of making tasty flavored water, instead of the infused water above:I'm a bit addicted to sodas and sugary flavored waters, but dislike sparkling waters with just a tint of flavoring.  I wish to create a healthier, custom drink without the excessive refined sugars of sodas and sugar waters, less sugary and less costly than juices, and with natural ingredients.Primula differs from the other infusers I've seen in that its infusion core can use a ""muddler""--a small fruit-masher.  The infusion core has a porous screen to keep the ""muddled"" pulp and seeds within the screen.  1.5 gallons can top its porous screen --- making 1.5 gallons the minimal efficient volume for flavor infusion.I muddle-mashed soft fruits inside the infusion core.  Juices flowed out and subsequent water infusion drains pulp juices.  By using lots of fruit, a healthy, strong-flavored juicy drink (tasting like Sobe) without using any added sugar, can result.  For example, the infusion core can mash about 2/3 of a pineapple, and 1.5 gallons will then fully cover the infuser's porous screen.  Tastes OK--a bit diluted, not that great.  Using a second infusion core and an entire pineapple would have likely resulted in 1.5 gallons with more flavor.  3 cups of raspberry did an OK diluted job on 1.5 gallons; but if a second infusion core was used with 5 to 6 cups of raspberries--results would have tasted better.In addition to not coming with enough infusion cores, the infusion core doesn't appear durable for long-term strong grinding using a muddler.  And, once the fruit is pulverized, water has trouble infusing through.If you plan to make less than 1.5 gallons regularly, Primula has a 2.7 quart version.  If you're planning to make flavored water in bulk and store, please check how well fresh fruits' antioxidants might store.Overall, if you're wanting a standard infused drink, this large Primula is excellently designed--5 star.  If you want a stronger flavored drink, order several infusion cores (not yet available).  4 stars overall, because I happen to like stronger flavored drinks.11/24/14  Update.  I may not have cleaned the infusion element well, because mold is growing on its membrane.  This mold is difficult to remove.  I'll contact manufacturer to find out what to do.11/29/14  Manufacturer told me soak in warm water and scrub the membrane.  I tried this the first time, but it didn't remove all the mold.  Will contact manufacturer again.12/1/14  Always use a bottle brush to clean the infusion core.  Doesn't seem to damage it, and prevents mold.  Not well explained in the instructions.11/29/14  The membrane apparently can take hard scrubbing from a bottle brush.  Removed the mold I could see.  I feel though that Primula's instructions should have Highlighted how to remove the mold.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R338UI9EE4K1J1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LK0D9L6#wasThisHelpful","R338UI9EE4K1J1","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Power Tools can easily last 10 years.  Traditionally, power tools are sold at hardware stores, who can rapidly diagnose problems, sometimes fix,  usually rapidly exchange, and offer some tips.  Who helps Amazon buyers in diagnosis, returns, and service problems?  Does one have to pay shipping costs of $25 to $50 to return a tool under warranty or in need of post-warranty repairs?These DeWalt tools are truly a pleasure to use.  Well balanced, has features such as automatic LED lighting, feels sturdy, made of a plastic that claims can help reduce electrical shock (if one happens to hit a live wire, power), feels precision-made.  As an analogy, using common flashlights, DeWalt's powerful flashlight, at 20 volt, was even useful for me as a small searchlight.  DeWalt also manufacturers drill bits and accessories, so it's easy to buy add-ons.  For amateur tool users, as I, these features and easy-to-purchase accessories really help my user experience.  Using DeWalt magnetic drill tips (sold separately) and the well balanced drill, my amateurish drilling of wood screws nailed these straight on!Is the kit a true savings?  Adding up Amazon prices for the kit's individual components--$510 to $525--so, the kit at $400 (11/2014) is approximately a 25% savings.  Good deal, but not a steal.  During holiday buying season, I noticed the price dropped dramatically.My DeWalt arrived DOA.  Was the battery, charger, or drill bad?  DeWalt does not directly provide weekend telephone tech support, and its website's black coloring is difficult to read and content disorganized.  On Monday, instead of helping me diagnose, DeWalt's telephone support sent me to visit their Houston factory service center.  I had to drive 60 minutes to learn what malfunctioned, but DeWalt's local staff quickly diagnosed and immediately replaced the charger.  The local staff explained they can also repair and even rebuild certain tools.  I guess if an Amazon customer went in at not-busy times, they can also offer tips on how to use.DeWalt online and telephone service communications methods are not quite ready for online customers.  DeWalt's confusing website also listed a nearby service center that no longer serviced DeWalts.Had the battery charger or weekend telephone support worked, DeWalt would have received a 5 star because these tools are professional quality tools at a good price.  But, the battery charger was defective, weekend service was lacking, website was confusing, and I had to drive 60 minutes to resolve the defective battery charger.  So, a 3 star.

"Peltor Tactical 100 fits a bit snug around my head, but brand new, it is well centered around ears, has comfortable surround-ears cushioning, and the headband also has cushioning.  My regular non-electronic Peltor Optime 105 is 30db reduction, instead of the 22db with Tactical, and Optime has pillow-soft surround-ears cushioning, making Optime far more comfortable.  Thinner surround-ears cushioning as in Tactical's, tend to wear out fast, but by then, wearer might become accustomed to the snug fit, and Tactical should still work well.Tactical folds up very nicely--truly compact, about size of a very large grapefruit.  And Tactical cuts shocking gun blasts while enabling for clear speech hearing.  The speech hearing volume is adjustable in loudness, and can even slightly amplify.  Lots of hiss at higher volumes, but might this also be a use of pink noise sounds?It's not troublesome to take off the Optime to hear well, so Optime would be a good lower cost solution.  What is difficult to reinsert are foam earplugs, because they should be rolled and then inserted.

"I see this Noco kit as mostly a wilderness outdoorsman, third world traveler, or emergencies product.  If one needs to carry more than 3 to 5 typical 10,000 mAH USB charge battery packs or needs to charge a 12V or 6V large battery, and can transport multiple 12.5 "" x 6.5"" solar panels, then this Noco kit is a good solution.  Useful for camping for several days, going to countries without electricity, and supplying post-hurricane or earthquake electricity.This 9 Watt power kit consisting of a Noco solar panel, a regulator-connector, and a battery-flashlight costs $157 (Amazon 10/2014), which is over 3 times the cost of current battery packs (10,000 mAH) plus one good $50 outdoorsman flashlight, and is also more bulky.  As most prospective users of this product probably already have a good flashlight, make that 5 times the cost of current battery packs.  Is it cost justified?First, the solar panel, which is the kit's essential product differentiator.  Panel is 12"" inches by 6"", folded up,  but more importantly, is less than 15 degrees bendable lengthwise and temperature resistant.  This bend is sufficient for inside a backpack, provided it is not stuffed.  Panel has many handles to secure onto the side of a backpack.I talked with Noco's excellent tech support, who said he personally tested the product 3 days in the snow and that the solar panel is also designed for the desert.  So, Noco can tolerate most temperatures.I didn't find out how rain proof the panel is, maybe someone else can find out?

However, its lithium ion battery lifespan is best only at moderate temperatures.Lastly, a regulator connector for USB connections.  Noco can also use optional other voltage connectors, enabling 12V and 6V outputs.Here, for example, is an ideal user.  Someone in the wilderness for many days, with a GPS and smartphone, a 6 or 12V electric motor (perhaps for car or boat battery), and USB and 12v connectors.  A serious mountain  climber.  On an island without electricity.  A solar power enthusiast who has a place to set the solar panel protected from the rain and from theft.Easy to use.  Tech support was very fast and professional.  The battery power switch needs to be turned off when charging (power LED off), and this is not stated in the manual.Other than the ideal type user and emergencies such as hurricanes, I believe there are superior solutions for the money for most people.  4 stars for the right users.  2 stars for most potential users.  5 stars for excellent tech support that was fast, and Noco appears to be strong enough of a company to stand behind its products well.  Overall, a 4 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXRKD0G0PKSNH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H36XXE4#wasThisHelpful","RXRKD0G0PKSNH","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a pre-release copy of this book for review.  At the time, there were 8 reviews, and this book averaged 3.5 stars, which is awful for a pre-release book.  Yet, the author has not sent a small army of boosters, as many other authors do, to boost this book's star ranking.  This says a lot about author's excellent integrity.This is a book on strategic marketing, usually of new products.  Its lessons will save a lot of heartache, money, and time.  I'm an inventive type who learned many of these lessons through the school of hard-knocks, wish had read this book earlier in my career, and learned still more valuable tips here.The book essentially says that the creative spirit who develops in-depth insights as to customers' needs and buying behaviors and designs products or service ideas, then must have these ideas subjected to rigorous economics analysis, asking questions on how to implement such ideas.  The impractical ideas need to be quickly discarded, so as to focus on the great ideas.As this sounds obvious, so why would a company hire an outside consultant for this?  Why?  Because it requires the creative to first view the problem differently and come up with several solutions, with these different views.  Then, the economics analysis, which are more methodical and described in this book, are applied on these ideas to determine which are practical and great.And, then there are the unicorns--the illusionary lovely horse that is wonderful to ponder on, and in real life, frequently carefully fed (use up resources).  This book gives guidelines on how to get rid of these unicorns, projects that probably are illusionary ROIs.At the time I'm reading this (10/2014), most of the reviewers state that the book is difficult to read.  That its language is somewhat convoluted.  I'd say instead the book is more intricately written, with the author describing many insights for each step of the above design-economic-analysis steps.  One can read this book and say its repetitive, or one can read this book and say it's filled with nuances on how to effectively apply the rules, which is my view.  Could be edited to be clearer though.I seem to recall 90% of new products fail.  The author here gives a few hard-won strategic marketing views of why this is so, so that success rates will be significantly higher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2WNHJ2CHFSD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804138737#wasThisHelpful","R2V2WNHJ2CHFSD","A9GIGJUB98JNR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9GIGJUB98JNR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I think these are a good product, better than other probiotics I've used except for one brand. The pearl delivery system is a smart one, and the company seems to care about quality. It concerns me a little that they are not refrigerated, because most quality probiotics seem to be. I can't say that I felt any difference after two weeks of taking them, but I was just getting off antibiotics and that may have affected things. The pearls are easy to swallow and not too large.

"This is a perfect scale. It's small enough to tuck away easily in the office, but large enough to accommodate most small and medium packages. It comes with a wall plug and can also run just off four AAA batteries. Since I'm using it in a home office and not a large shipping department, I just run it off the batteries. I've been using it for a month or so and haven't needed to change batteries yet. The scale has a range of 0.1 ounces to 110 pounds. I'm attaching a photo of a large copper mug holding pens sitting on the scale to give you an idea of how big it is.It measures in pounds ounces grams and kilograms. I've checked its gram and ounce weights against a very sensitive jewelry scale and it's very accurate. The digital read out has bright, crisp, large blue text and is very easy to read. Switching between pounds and kilograms is a matter of pressing a single button, unlike some scales which make it rather difficult to switch. The build quality seems excellent. In fact, it looks and feels like a much more expensive scale. The only thing I wish they would change is the sticker on the top of the scale, which tells you to remove the packing cardboard but then refuses to come off without solvent. You can see that in my photos too. However, that's a minor quibble that doesn't really affect my opinion of an excellent scale.If you're looking for a shipping scale that small enough to fit gracefully into the home office and can handle a wide range of weights, I wholeheartedly recommend this one.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

"I've tried several brands of tape now, and this is hands-down the best and most usable. The others adhered too fiercely to my skin and would actually remove the very top layer of skin, leaving me with red wavy marks all over my arm that made it look like I'd ironed myself. This brand stays on just fine, but doesn't have the painful and bizarre looking removal process. It's soft and flexible and easy to tape with.

"I was excited to try these, because I'm a jeweler and would be thrilled to find something I can recommend to clients who for various reasons may not want to be able to resize their too - large rings. I tested them out on a number of my rings, and unfortunately they did not really live up to expectations.The main problem is strength and durability. If you are using this on an expensive ring or one with sentimental value, and that ring is too loose, and the ring magic band fails… You can see how it's very easy to lose the ring. These bands are very thin, and one broke on me within a week. Not only are you risking losing your ring, but it would get expensive buying a new package of these every week.My other problem with these mainly pertains to fine jewelry. Such jewelry is all about the appearance of fine detail. While the ring sizing bands are very thin and inconspicuous, they do show especially on rings with very narrow bands. For casual wear that's fine, but it doesn't really go with an expensive ring.I gave these three stars rather than the lower readings that some other reviewers chose because I can see these being useful in one very specific situation. If you're getting engaged, and aren't completely certain of your fiancé's ring size, you could get a package of these to have in your back pocket in case the ring you present is not a perfect fit. These would make a good stopgap until you can get into the jeweler and have the ring resized.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

"These are very comfortable headphones, with good sound. I'm comparing these to standard earbuds, the kind that are smaller and don't have the little internal hooks for your ears. These are far, far superior. While standard earbuds are constantly coming loose from my ears, or hurting them if I try to use larger tips, these stay in comfortably. I was immediately impressed by the sound the first time I used them.The sound is better than any of the standard earbuds I've used. Maybe that's because they are slightly larger? The sound is rich, full, and sounds good at both low and high volumes. I was able to pair this with my Samsung tablet and my LG Smart phone. I was able to pair them with my laptop, but the driver failed to install. As this was just a test and I didn't plan to use them with my laptop, I didn't do the work of trying to track down a driver online. Just be aware that there may be issues with some Windows operating systems. They worked flawlessly with android.I like the sporty black and lime green color scheme. The flat noodle cable connecting the earbuds doesn't get tangled as easily as standard earbud cables do. Volume controls are easy to use, and well song switching controls are not intuitive, the small manual that comes with these explains clearly in comprehensible English what to do.Overall, I'm very impressed with these and they are my new favorite headphones.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

I use magnesium oil as a very effective deodorant, a couple of sprays under each arm keep me stink free.

"Very nice hamper with an intelligent design. I was concerned that the frame might be flimsy and bend, but it's actually set up something like a tent. It comes with four flexible rods to be inserted in each corner. The lightweight, rigid metal frame at the top is not connected to those rods, so it holds its shape but has nothing to break. The hamper itself is generously sized and holds more than it looks like it would. The construction seems sturdy, and the colors look nice with most modern home decor. My bathroom is not brown or tan, but I have oil-rubbed brass fixtures as well as a redwood bench in there and the hamper ties in very well to those colors without clashing with the more dominant color scheme.

They have an enticing sweetness without being heavy, they're easy on the teeth, and the 4oz bag has lasted me a lot longer than I would have thought. Each pinch takes a while to enjoy and chew so it discourages you from eating a ton at once. A nice healthy way to respond to a candy craving.

"This was my first time using Xylitol, but I'm a long-time liquid Stevia user so I was interested to compare the two natural non-sugar sweeteners. My test product was lemon iced tea, which I hot brew and can often consume a half-gallon a day of. I usually use stevia as a sweetener; stevia has a sort of aftertaste to it which the lemon masks, so out of curiosity I added the Xylitol and tasted it before adding lemon. It was a little disheartening to find out how much I had to use to get it mildly sweet; I tasted the crystals straight out of the bag and they aren't that concentrated in their sweetness - less so than sugar I think. I ended up using 10 tablespoons (yes, tablespoons) of this birch Xylitol to sweeten it, and I was going for mild sweet, not ""southern sweet tea sweet.""There wasn't any funny undertone or aftertaste that I could detect; it doesn't taste exactly like sugar, but it doesn't taste like something else either. It's a cool, light sweetness and leaves your tongue feeling cool. In other words, great for cold drinks. A huge appeal for me is the dental benefit; I have bad teeth, and drink tea constantly, so having that be beneficial would be lovely. Stevia (what I usually use) isn't sugar and doesn't cause decay, but Xylitol has the edge through helping avert it. The granules are clean-looking, distinct, and dissolve readily in liquid. I looked around on amazon and this product looks to be one of the best, because it's made in the USA, it's birch xylitol, and is non-GMO (some Xylitol is made from GMO corn). The only drawback, and it is rather a large one, is the fact that you have to use so much given that the stuff isn't cheap. I would suggest as large a bag as you can.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review.

"This is wonderfully fresh, clean-smelling coconut oil. Some of the cheaper mainstream brands like Trader Joes have a duller, more muddied scent. I wanted to inhale this right out of the jar when I opened it! The flavor is mild coconut, clean and pure tasting. Absolutely a quality product. The HUGE jar is fantastic for the pantry, and while this is absolutely gourmet cooking quality coconut oil, it's wonderful for your skin as well. One of my favorite things about cooking with coconut oil is that when I get some on my fingers, or need to wipe out the measuring spoon, it can go straight on my skin! No waste and you get soft skin to boot. I'll mention that as a skin oil it absorbs readily and doesn't leave a greasy film.My favorite thing to do with coconut oil is fry stuff. The flavor is amazingly complimentary to fried foods; in particular perogies, potatoes, peppers, and onions are all heavenly when fried in coconut oil. When making tacos, heat up some coconut oil in a skillet and fry fresh tortillas for a few seconds, then serve. Luscious! Coconut oil is incredible for frying, and it's supposedly a ""good"" fat, so it feels a lot better to use than butter or other oils.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

"I've been waffling on how much I like or don't like this. The conclusion is that if you have to sit in a chair a lot, this is a very useful gizmo for using part of the time. Basically when my back is sore from spending so much time sitting in one position, the pillow forces me into a different position that's more comfortable for a while. If I start out the day using the pillow, my back starts getting sore and I get more comfortable by removing it. So basically it doesn't eliminate the discomfort that comes from sitting in an office chair for hours, but it's very useful in providing a change of position. The quality of the pillow is excellent, the quality of the strap that comes with it not so much. It's made of thin nylon and not very firmly attached to the pillow, and it's already separating a bit after a few weeks of use. None the less, the overall quality is great.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review.

"This is the perfect little work light! You have to understand when ordering that it is small, and that it will ship from China. But it arrived very quickly, and is delightful. It's got a long enough power cord that you aren't limited to your computer's USB port. If you have a USB charger/hub, you can plug it in to that and use wall power. The click on/off switch works great. Most importantly, this little guy is *bright* for it's size. I use it to light a chest of drawers under my work table. I have it mounted to the underside of the table, and it illuminates any drawer I pull open. Would be a great reading light too. And finally, because it's USB and draws very little power, you can run it off a USB power bank if you need to and have a bright, portable area strip light. The build quality is better on this than on other LED strip lights I've used. Overall I think it's a fantastic value and you get more than you pay for.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review.

"This is a very unique towel - it has a few drawbacks, but it's also got some advantages over anything else. Somehow, it manages to go beyond just evaporative cooling. When I removed it from the package, when it was dry to the touch, it was also *cool* to the touch. I followed the instructions to wet it initially in warm water, and chilled it in the fridge. Wow was it ever a nice feeling in the 99-degree sun! Here are the plusses and minuses I've noted:GOOD* Somehow they've done what no other towel I've tried has done and boosted it beyond what I feel from normal evaporative cooling. It simply feels colder than anything else* Stays wet and cold for a *very* long time* Soft on the skinBAD* Dries stiff as a board. When you let it dry, be sure that's the shape you want it to remain in for storage.* When wet, the material it's made from is a little tender. It's a foamy cloth, and bits of the ""foamy"" are already missing after I've used it about 5 times. Be more careful of it than you would cloth. * Because it's not a porous material, I find that after a while it actually starts trapping heat against my skin after it builds up. This seems fixable by removing the towel and flapping it around in the air a bit to cool it off, or running it under cool water.Still a five-star product despite the disadvantages because it does what it's supposed to, and does so amazingly well. Throw it in the fridge before use and you'll be in heaven.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review.

"I gauge cooling towels against regular towels, which are pretty good for cooling without having to buy a specialized product. Well, this is better than a terry cloth towel for a number of reasons:* Thin, lightweight, and kinda stylish, it can easily be mistaken for a scarf.* It's more breathable than terry cloth, so it doesn't build up heat and hold it against your body* Easier to wet down than terry cloth* Feels cool instantly* Doesn't smell after it dries* Dries fastThe only advantage regular towels have (besides the fact that you already own one) is that they stay wet longer. But that contributes to bacterial growth that makes them smell, so.....if you're out in the heat much, I'd say this is a very worthy purchase.

"These are wonderful. It feels odd giving a rave review to what appears to be a very generic dishtowel, but hear me out. When I first pulled these out, they seemed to be on the thin side, and they looked like I'd find them in a low-budget institutional kitchen. I wasn't even sure they'd be very absorbent. Well, I got proven wrong by a package of dish cloths (boy is that ever a blow to the self-esteem!). These are wonderfully absorbent, dry quickly, and prove themselves to be very high quality in use. It's one of those simple things that if done well, doesn't need to be flashy ....it just needs to work really well. These work really well.

"Odd but very good and unique flashlight! It's a side light or standard flashlight depending on which button you press, and the side light makes a great reading light. I've always been reluctant to go the ""rechargeable"" route on flashlights because I don't want to deal with them going dead and not being able to pop new batteries in. Well, this light comes with a spare rechargeable battery *and* an adapter for using regular AAA batteries with it. Problem solved. The flashlight has one of the best ""zooms"" I've used; it goes from so narrow you see the outline of the LED chip to super-broad.It's a mid-size light; not something small enough to pocket but not large enough to use as a defensive weapon. I think of it as a hybrid LED lantern/flashlight. The construction feels a little tinny but it's solid metal. Plenty of modes including red and flashing signal light. I don't think it's waterproof; I could be wrong but it doesn't seem like it, and I don't see any written indication that it's waterproof. Not something you'd want to use as a tactical light or backwoods backpacking, but a great all-round household and car-carry light. The side-light is fantastic as a lantern; I'd use it tent camping.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review. This does NOT mean this is a fake review.

"Pillows are very important to me, but I've had little success getting perfect ones. This = perfect. I've tried the cooling memory foam pillow from Costco ....forces my head into odd angles. Tried one of those bamboo-covered shredded memory foam pillows and could never get comfortable on it. I've had some nice conventional pillows, but they go flat right away. My favorite pillow to date has been a Pillow Pet! This is a simple concept, very well executed. It is loosely filled with shreds of fill. Because it's loose inside, you can lump it up however you like. Sleeping on your back, side, reading in bed ....all require different things from a pillow, and My Pillow adapts to them all. This is absolutely the best pillow I've ever used and will be replacing all others. It's super-comfy, well made, and doesn't have any chemical odor. The clincher is that it's made in the US - not something I demand but certainly a plus.

There's even a filter as you pour it out just in case anything slipped by the primary screen. It's a pleasure to use and brews a single, largish cup of coffee. It was easy to wash out after use. I am actually not a huge coffee drinker (tea fanatic here), but I've been wanting a simple way to brew the occasional cup. I'm not going to buy or use a coffee maker, my tea brewers just don't work, and pouring grounds into a Finum filter made a pretty awful cup of coffee.

"I can't believe I didn't know about geraniol bug sprays until recently. A nice-smelling, non-toxic spray is sort of the holy grail, and it finally exists.  The bottle holds a fairly substantial 4oz without taking up too much room in your pack; a little goes a long way because it's very liquid and you can spread it on your skin.The active ingredient, geraniol, is a constituent of rose, citronella, and palmarosa essential oils, and also occurs in small quantities in geranium, lemon, and many other essential oils. The University of Florida developed and tested alternatives to pesticides for 17 years, and geraniol is what emerged at the head of the pack as a safe, effective insect repellant. It works against mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, fire ants, fleas, gnats, ticks, and no-see-ums. This spray is very strong-smelling, and I think it smells wonderful; like a rose/citronella perfume blend. I don't find I have to cover all my skin with it to keep bugs at bay; it's strong enough that just a cursory application works. However, it does evaporate or wear off rather fast, so I had to re-apply it while working outdoors.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

"I'm a jeweler, and I have several scales, but this one is by far the best. It's not actually easy to get a scale that has all the specialized weights used by jewelers: carat, troy ounce, grain, and pennyweight are needed a lot more often than grams or standard ounces. Well, this scale has all of them. It was easy to calibrate, and weighs a tiny 3mm faceted gemstone (0.135ct) just as easily as 17 grams of gem rough. The read-out is easy to see and it's small enough not to take up too much room in your workspace.Tare is easily established, and batteries, calibration weights, and tweezers are included in a nice carrying case. It takes AAA batteries, which is kind of a nice feature because a lot of scales use harder to find ""button"" batteries. This is going to be my go-to scale from now on and I highly recommend it to fellow fine jewelers. Please note that if you are looking for something to weigh strands of beads, they probably won't fit; this is more the gems, precious metals, and gem rough sort of scale.As a product tester I received this free or virtually so for evaluation and review.

"We were in a coastal town near the docks a couple of days ago. Extreme fire danger, half the state's on fire, smoke so thick you can't drive with the windows down without your eyes stinging ....and I looked over and there was fire spreading through the grass. Bushes a few feet away, cars on the other side of the bushes, a narrow street and then a hillside covered with houses. Two guys were trying to stomp it out and failing to contain it, I ran over with my drink to dump on it and asked if they'd called 911 yet. ""Why'd we do something like that?"" was the genius of the year reply. The leading edge of the fire made me stop stomping and RUN a couple of times, and that was when my mom in the car reminded me we had this fire extinguisher. I grabbed it, asked her to call 911, then ran along the leading edge of the fire (did I mention it was windy too?) with this.It stopped the fire in its tracks everywhere along the perimeter that I was able to spray it, and with the grass burnt already behind the fire that meant it was effectively out everywhere I could spray it. Unfortunately the extinguisher ran out really fast, leaving 2/3 or so of the fire uncontained, but I'd stopped the leading edge that was spreading too fast, driven by the wind, for it to be stopped by anything but an extinguisher or a hose. It was still touch and go with lots of stomping and three bottles of water a lovely bypasser threw us, but we got it out. The fire department arrived and soaked everything that was still smoldering.While this alone was not enough to contain the fire, I am 100% certain it was the deciding factor. It absolutely would not have been contained without the fire department if I hadn't had this and used it, and the fire would have been large and destructive by the time they arrived. I'm converted to ALWAYS carrying a fire extinguisher in the car now (I actually bought this after my former car caught fire driving down the road ...having realized firsthand that your car can just burst into flames). Actually, I'm carrying two from now on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3STL8ZREXLF6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00002ND64#wasThisHelpful","R3STL8ZREXLF6A","AONPH5OJ07EMP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AONPH5OJ07EMP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hair bits tend to fly in every direction when you use a shaver, and the little vacuum built into this one can't catch it all.  I'd guesstimate it catches about 80-90% though.  The receptacle isn't that large, and if you're trimming like four weeks of growth, you'll have to empty it a couple of times, particularly because the suction of the little fan deteriorates as hair builds up in the chamber.  Hair surprisingly stays in when held upside down with vacuum still on.  Razor cuts very cleanly with no tugging, make sure you keep it oiled.

I don't know why it doesn't simply activate while the lid is up, that engineering is not difficult.  Instead you have to press a button in the back and then it stays on for 7 hours if you don't click it off again.  I guess they figure 7 hours is likely how much night is left?  But people are lazy and won't click it off, which drains the batteries.And then you have to change the batteries which for some reason requires you to remove the entire seat.

"Overall these are okay, but I think I prefer the kind that comes in a roll.  The size of these pre-cut rectangles wasn't appropriate length or width for any shelf or drawer of my fridge, so you end up needing to join two cuts together, which is sloppy and prone to rolling/folding when you slide items in.  The fold creases will come out if you soak them and dry.

"Really well done miniature Avengers set.  Quite surprised at the number of points of articulation, they are very movable and pose-able.

"For a plastic low end paint sprayer, the PaintWIZ PW25000 does a really nice job.  Even if you've used a sprayer before I'd still suggest a few things before you get started:1. If you need to dilute per instructions, under-dilute first and see how it sprays; you can always dilute more, but you can't un-dilute easily.  Every model,unit, and paint varies in how it's going to come out.  I was surprised in the difference between a year-old can and a new can of the same paint.2. Once you get the dilution ratio set, mix up as much as you think you need for the job.  This way the ratio will be consistent for the whole job, and you won't be spending time mixing while your project is drying unevenly.3. Test out the sprayer on scrap first, get used to how it sprays horizontal vs vertical and with different flow rate before you attack your actual job.4. Really make sure you clean it out with detail when you're done.  Anything left in the spray apparatus to dry and cake on will make a huge negative impact the next time around.5.  Be very generous when taping off edges.  I usually tape newspaper or drop cloth to the trim instead of just the strip of tape.  Even if you're used to the spread of the spray, you may not be 100% careful and droplets can wander.  It's notoriously difficult to get paint off a popcorn ceiling or match the dirty white.  I've also killed off a portion of a shrub outside by getting too much paint on it when doing a fence.  Drop cloths, dead wind, and a face mask are your friends.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24JAFRL3YSYQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AOH5TM#wasThisHelpful","R24JAFRL3YSYQB","ANTGGAQYPSWHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANTGGAQYPSWHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The odor difference may be noticeable for you if your current insole is more absorbent than the rubbery stuff these are made of.  (The chemical smell that these originally had, for me, faded after a few days wearing).

"This is a clean professional looking planner.  The bigger size fits together better if you're carrying textbooks, the smaller planners always seemed to get crushed.

"LG G series are great phones.  I've had the 2, 3, and 4 now.  The G3 is a big upgrade over the G2, particularly in processor performance and both screen image and glass qualities.  The G4 isn't as much of an upgrade overall, except for one particular feature, and that's the cameras.  The main camera megapixels on the G3 are more than sufficient, but taking the same picture with both the G3 and the G4 shows that the G3 has more small artifacts, particularly in low light.  The G4 camera manual settings are also a huge plus, particularly when one of the G3 annoyances is an overbright flash, which among many other settings can be adjusted on the G4.  The front camera is an extraordinary upgrade over the G3, which was pitiful, but this may only be important to you if you're big into selfies.Other than the cameras though, you won't notice much performance difference if you settle for the G3.  There may not really be a need to settle for the G3, however, as almost right upon release there have been penny deals with contract for the G4.

Even doing the overlap and slice through both layers method doesn't provide an exact lineup because the film is still shifting slightly.-You need a seriously dust free environment.  I had some almost microscopic width dog hair that was apparently floating around which leave a noticeable bump if they get under the film, and good luck getting a thin hair off a sticky film.-The felt squeegee is great, but no matter how meticulous you are with the laying of the film and the pushing out of bubbles, you will still see texture up close.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG0HY6LHAMBDU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9M4X7I#wasThisHelpful","RG0HY6LHAMBDU","ANTGGAQYPSWHF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ANTGGAQYPSWHF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The features of PowerDVD 15 are pretty overwhelming.  I needed something to play bluray discs on Windows 8.1, I guess since the bluray format is proprietary Microsoft didn't want to pay to license it by default.  I tried the free VLC program but didn't find it as polished or user-friendly.  The direct YouTube thing seems like a weird feature when you can just open a browser.  I enjoy being able to bookmark spots for later reference and picking up where I leave off.  You need the Ultra version to get 3D support, though I've never been huge on 3D, I like it even less on the smaller screen.  Ultra will also play ISO files if you backup your discs to your home media server.Whatever upscaling of DVDs it does is fantastic, I'm not getting any blurring or pixelation, though your mileage may vary depending on your viewing device - I mainly use a fast refresh monitor for movies.  Plus there's support for 4K if decide to upgrade my monitor in the future.  5.1 surround seems to work well.I've heard older versions of PowerDVD were resource hogs, but I don't experience any of this.  It feels rather lightweight and the fans don't hit full speed when I'm watching movies.  You need to go at least with the Pro version for bluray, and the extra premium paid for Ultra seems worth it to me if you're already resigned to paying that much for Pro.

"I've been a sci-fi addict since my high-school years. (1950) I read all of the books, the pulp fiction, listened to Buck Roger's on the radio, as each new book, magazine, or movie came out, I had to see/read them. I've collected all of the films first on VHS, then on DVD, and finally on 3D BD. This addiction never slowed.""Lucy"" has to be milestone in science fiction. Beside being an exciting adventure story, terrific stunts, well filmed, superb editing, and excellent sound and scoring, it's a movie I'll watch a couple more times before I break out a fresh film. I've only seen it on DVD, but i would have loved to see it on the big screen. The science is accurate, the story, fascinating, with a convincing performance by Scarlett Johansson. Lucy will stand along with Capt. Kirk as a memorable character.

"This DOES get rid of pet stains but by doing so you will be replacing the smell with a VERY strong, almost suffocatingly strong, clean odor.

"Great trimmer. Very powerful. I got the 4AH battery model. It's unlikely that you will need the 6AH battery unless you have a ginormous lawn. I have 1/3 of an acre lot trim, with 5 mature large trees, a large shed, whole lot chain link fenced in, as well as going around the house. After doing all of that at full speed (there is low and high speed) I still have enough battery to do it again the next time. I charge the battery after every two trimmings.Another thing nice about this trimmer is its balance. At first I was bothered by how long it was but once you get used to it you realize that it's very well balanced. It's also built incredibly well.One problem I seem to be having, and thus minus 1 star, is that sometimes when I set the trimmer on low speed it seems to go at high speed anyways. So that's kind of weird but since it still gets the job done I want it to get down, I'm not to bothered. Highly recommend this trimmer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLLKM95LT3RPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF02A5O#wasThisHelpful","RLLKM95LT3RPV","ASCBJEPXTOU0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASCBJEPXTOU0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered two Frigidaire dehumidifiers before returning them and replacing them with this one. The new Frigidaire dehumidifiers suck air from the back and blow out the side. They also don't have a built in hose attachment. You have to attach an adapter (which could easily be lost) so that you can use a hose. The other thing was that the hose attachment was also on the side! You had to have the dehumidifier a foot and a half away from the wall which looks stupid if using in a finished basement.Now, this dehumidifier is great. This is what I expect from a dehumidifier. Sucks into the front and blows out the top. Perfect. I put it right up against my wall. The hose attachment is on the back so I could run a line through my wall. The filter is also great, you press it and it pops up and you rinse it and put it back. There is one thing that is annoying. If you do use it with the bucket instead of the hose, sometimes the water will drip AFTER you remove the bucket. The way to avoid this is to wait a few minutes after its full for it to completely drain into the bucket. Then this wont happen. No big deal though. The bucket also has a nice handle and if it ever breaks it is replaceable because it can be detached. The fan can be a little loud but they all are and this one is about average.Overall this is a great dehumidifer and works well. Honeywell makes great products and I haven't ever had a problem with their stuff.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NRX1407REJJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QUWPF6G#wasThisHelpful","R3NRX1407REJJ1","ASCBJEPXTOU0V","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ASCBJEPXTOU0V?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got this lamp at a furniture store called home makers. The item was 129 dollars at the time which was kind of steep but it is definitely a nice lamp. You DO have to put it together yourself. This isn't very difficult. It's very sturdy and heavy if you put it together properly. At first I thought the light sockets were wiggly but then I found that there was a screw at the bottom of each socket to tighten them onto the base and that fixed that. There is NO dimmer unlike what it says on Amazon. I had already known this since it was on display when I bought it. It does have a switch that changes It to have 1 or 2 or all bulbs on at the same time. So this is pretty nice.

"This book made me incredibly sad. My grandfather and my mother both died with Alzheimer's. My grandfather was a 'mean' Alzheimer's patient, very angry as he started losing his artistic abilities. He took his anger out on my mother unfortunately, and this was back in the 80's, and my mother did not understand that what grandpa was doing and saying was from the disease impacting his amygdala, which is the emotional part of the brain. My mom was a very sweet Alzheimer's patient, but it was hard to see her dwindle away to nothing.This book brought this all back up for me. I'm sure it touches the lives of other people who are dealing with this as well. And always, at the back of your mind, you worry that eventually the disease will possibly take your mind, or the mind of your loved ones still living.Genova tackles this topic from the person who is undergoing the loss of her mind, and the impact it has on her family. I thought the movie was quite good, but as usual, I feel the book encompassed more than could be done in the movie. Genova did a great job with the little things that people start forgetting, not just the usual keys and phones, but going blank when you know that you have the knowledge in your brain, but you simply cannot reach and grabbed that knowledge.I actually went into Neuroscience because of my grandfather's experience. I was lucky enough to work in both a lab on Alzheimer's and a Lab on HIV encephalitis. It opened my eyes to both the frustration that comes with trying to find something to work on these brain disorders from the point of view of the researchers, and having my mom go through Alzheimer's experiencing the frustration of not finding anything to help her personally (the medications are basically useless as of now). Because of my personal involvement in different sides of this story, I really appreciate Genova's writing of this book.I found the saddest part of the book to be the leaving of Alice's husband, because he couldn't bear to watch her deterioration. In my family, we don't do that. My grandmother took care of my grandfather until he ended up in the hospital where he died. She persisted through times of him getting up over and over in the night to bathe, because he thought he hadn't done it that day. And my father took such good care of my mother, taking her with him places to the point he neglected to take care of his own health and suffered a stroke. My father and mother died a month apart from each other...my mom was lost without him. So even though this is fiction, the fact the husband left to pursue his own opportunities struck me as extremely selfish...An excellent book...just very sad.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JVFFF9TTWCZK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NLKXK2#wasThisHelpful","R2JVFFF9TTWCZK","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was a good read for medical history, but was not on the same level as other medical histories that I've read. It stalled in a couple of places, and I found that occasionally all the other extraneous information added not related to the story itself, would sometimes be confusing.I had no idea that transfusion was considered back in the 1600's. All it took was one arrogant physician, trying to push the envelope. And if you've been in medical school, you've seen a few of those. In this case, dealing with such an unknown (they did not know about the cell markers in blood at that point which would cause clotting reactions if people were given the wrong blood type). It's too bad that Jean-Baptise Denis couldn't see our use of blood today, and see how well his idea saves lives today. Now to be fair, he wasn't the first to try transfusion. That definitely belongs to the British. But he tried hard, in spite of religious and medical objections, to demonstrate the possibilities of transfusions. It boggles the mind to consider that if transfusions had been possible that far back (with continued research), the lives that could have been saved in all the wars.The research for this book probably wasn't easily done. Especially if you had to get rare material in French, from the courts and royal records kept almost 500 years ago. Apparently, the author, Tucker, knows French as well as English, so that explains a lot.This is a great book to read if you want to understand how far back medical research goes, and many of the obstacles that are put in the way of those who do research.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35SLON2G2YO90/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H4X84U#wasThisHelpful","R35SLON2G2YO90","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finished this book a while ago, but forgot to write a review. It's been a while since I read a Jeffrey Deaver book. I like his writing, and the relationship between Rhymes and Sachs is one of the more interesting duos in fiction. They are both crippled in different ways, Rhyme from an unfortunate accident which left him a quadriplegic, and Sachs from arthritis. They are both very intense people.In this current novel, someone is setting 'booby traps' using the city's electrical grid. This is making for some very horrifying situations in which innocent people are getting fried in a variety of ways. Lincoln Rhymes and Sachs have to figure out whether this is an act of a disgruntled employee or a terroristic group first, while they try to find the physical evidence that will tell them how to get the guy or guys.As other reviewers have said, I get the feeling that Deaver is tired of his two protagonists, and so much of the writing seems repetitive and old. HIs writing is excellent as readers have come to expect from Deaver, but maybe he should do something new and different and get away from these protagonists, even if they are the source of his income!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CGK1VF7UNMBO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003BHM854#wasThisHelpful","R3CGK1VF7UNMBO","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't been made this mad reading a book in a long, long time. I have been interested in bioethics since medical school. And I've always been worried about certain situations in which people that are often disenfranchised find themselves. I am especially talking about people with disabilities and the elderly. I am Deaf, so this area is of particular interest to me. I also have family members who died with Alzheimer's.I had heard and read about some of the problems that occurred down in New Orleans...but I had been wanting to read about specific instances of 'bad behavior' on the part of members of the medical profession. This book confirmed what I had heard/read. That doctors (and nurses) took it upon themselves to determine who was worthy of life. In this case, in this hospital...those lives were the elderly patients who were not even patients of the doctor who did the killing, and specifically, one patient who was obese. Sheri Fink did an incredible job of research, making sure that she didn't just tell one side of the story. She tries very hard to be fair to everyone, which is difficult in a book like this. She tries to leave it up to the reader as to how they feel about what happened at Memorial Hospital, and decide who is at fault.Believe me, there is  plenty of fault to go around. Whether it is the doctors who did not come forward and say 'You just can't do this', the corporation who decided to save money rather than update things like generators which would go under water with flooding, or the government, whose inadequate handling of the disaster made things very bad in the hospitals. But ultimately, the decision to 'euthanize' specific patients because it was too 'hard' to get them out of the hospital laid upon the doctors and the nurses that helped them. This all boils down to whose life is worthy of life. These medical personnel for whatever reason (it is really hard to determine what their reasoning for dealing with these patients that way) made an extremely bad decision. The ethicists said so, the other doctors said so, expert coroners said so. No one has the right to say when someone dies, and in this world where it is becoming all too prevalent to devalue people, my fear is that this type of situation is spreading. As Fink said, in Europe countries such as Belgium are already putting people to death, some of whom have very little wrong with them. Why, because some deem it easier to use resources for those who are 'worth more' to society.Anyone who is interested in bioethics needs to read this book. Especially those in medicine. Those in governmental positions who need to prepare prior to disasters, such as in places like San Francisco and Miami, who are hanging on the precipice of a disaster. What are they planning to do when an earthquake, or a tsunami hits. Have they prepared, or are they going to have these same things happen in their cities?","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RD18XE4CZD2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4BA3GO#wasThisHelpful","R1RD18XE4CZD2Y","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Warning. This is not an easy book to read. But it is a great book nevertheless. I enjoy science biographies where you actually need to have your phone with you in order to look things up. I've read other books about Feynman's work, but not a biography about his life. So this filled in a lot of blanks for me. But this wasn't a simple biography. Gleick took it upon himself to explain much of what Feynman was known for in physics, hence the need for dictionary, and Wikipedia, and other physic sources to be able to follow the book. What I liked about this biography besides the physics lessons, is that even though many works about Feynman discuss his humorous and intelligent sides, they don't discuss his problems in life, some of which he made. Everyone makes mistakes, and Feynman did too. I was surprised by how much original work Feynman did, but didn't rush to publish...so others were able to get ahead of him in several fields. That speaks a little to humility or insecurity on his part, which in science where it is publish or perish is kind of odd. Of course, odd would certainly describe Feynman, but for the most part it is a good odd. It did seem to me that his inability to obey the rules of polite society in the 50's and 60's ended up hurting him, more than it hurt others (though the women he 'used' may have disagreed).Like many in science, Feynman questioned everything. This can be both good and bad. It's great for getting new ideas in science, but when a person questions everything, that usually includes his self and his place in the world. It did sound like Feynman found some stability with his family later in his life. Even genius' need to connect with someone.A very good biography about a great man...even if he was fallible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L994ODUYI4RI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LRPQIO#wasThisHelpful","R2L994ODUYI4RI","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's been a while since I read a book on AIDS. I saw this book when I was getting other books on infectious disease, and put it aside for future reading. I had read ""And the Band Played On"" about 20 years ago, when I started working in a Lab on HIV. I knew so much had been found out concerning AIDS and where it came from. But much of this book was a surprise to me. I always felt that we didn't know the whole story about when AIDS actually started to infect the human race. The research that has been done in monkeys and apes, to determine the relationship between SIV which is simian immunodeficiency virus and HIV. Quammen provides a lot of background into what had previously been known and talked about. When I teach microbiology to my students I want to impress upon them the importance of knowing where these diseases come from. So many of the emerging diseases today are zoonoses, meaning they come from animals. Human invasion into habitats that used to rarely be seen by humans is introducing new viruses that some animals could live with, and others that were killers, no matter what the species.Quammen does a good job with the science. He obviously has a lot of practice in both the research and the writing. This book was incredibly interesting and definitely filled in gaps in my knowledge. I would recommend that readers be a bit familiar with AIDS before tackling this book. It assumes that the readers have a background in AIDS.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X4U4EF8N7SPX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWTPH68#wasThisHelpful","R1X4U4EF8N7SPX","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoy for the most part writing by Alan Russell. I've read several of his books now, and he always has great plots in his mysteries. This was another good mystery, but was a very convoluted plot. It isn't always very clear what was happening, because the chapters would jump around quite a bit, using several third person voices. I don't mind this type of writing when you have a few people's voices...but when it goes to more than three voices, it tends to get a bit confusing at times, especially if you cannot see the tie-in between all these people. To tell you the truth, I got a little lost in this book a couple of times.The protagonist is a member of the paparazzo, a successful one, who unfortunately caused an accident that killed two very important celebrities. This accident weighs on Wells, the paparazzo, and leads him to rethink his career for a couple of years. Just when he gets back to taking photographs of celebrities again, two things occur that seem unrelated at first. He is approached by the CIA who uses knowledge of his accident to make him do jobs for them. Then on one of said 'jobs' he see a major actress attempt suicide, and he gets involved, and saves her life. Then everything starts unraveling with relentless force, and other people around both him and the actress are murdered. Wells needs to find out who is actually behind these deaths, and prevent his own death and the death of the actress with whom he has developed a relationship.One of the other problems I had with this book is a personal preference of mine. This book had a lot of salty language, more than any of Russell's books that I have read up til now. Lots of 'F' bombs. A couple I don't bother with. If the book has such language every few words, I don't finish the book. This wasn't like that, but it was more than I usually read. I know. Very prim of me. But I learned a long time ago that I don't really want that type of stuff crowding my mind, and those who speak like that have limited intelligence and language abilities. Because of my view on this, I will be a little loathe to get one of Russell's books again. I will try another one of his mysteries but if the language is like this, I probably won't read any more of his books. Which is too bad because he really is a good plotter.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LX7P0MH65ZVH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NVOJY3G#wasThisHelpful","R2LX7P0MH65ZVH","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow...two great books in a month! I didn't think I'd find another book comparable to The Emperor of All Maladies for a while. But I got very lucky and read Kean's book on the brain, and hit paydirt.I have 2 degrees in Neuroscience, and of course, read many, many textbooks while getting my degrees. I can honestly say that I don't think anyone has made this information on how the brain works, and the various things that can and do go wrong, as accessible as Kean has made it.Kean takes complicated information and he doesn't 'dumb' it down, he just presents it in an easily understood format, and with a significant amount of humor. He actually confirms my thinking that most textbooks are written for the peer group of the author, rather than to make concepts accessible to students. The book starts with cells and works up to the different lobes of the brain, and then continues on to the brain as a whole. In each section, Kean includes stories of people who undergo brain disorders, explaining how and why the brain is responding to trauma in this manner. Unlike in other textbooks or material that I've read concerning individuals with brain disorders, Kean doesn't deal with just the disorder, he deals with the person behind the disorder. One of the best sections in the book was on Phineas Gage, who accidentally blasted a tamping rod through his brain, in such a way that he caused damage to his emotional brain. Kean included more information on what happened to Gage than any other book I have read. Most other material simply repeats that this man went from being nice to being nasty, and Kean makes it clear that this simply isn't true. Gage managed to live another 12 years after his accident and for most of that time, was a working member of society.Kean deals with one of the biggest questions in neuroscience...that of where the physical presence of the brain ends, and where our 'mind' or consciousness and ego begin. With each little snippet of information, and studying people with brain disorders, we gain a little more insight into what makes each of us an individual. Writing such as Kean is doing on science topics make it so that everyone can know and understand the importance of the brain. Hopefully, when someone picks up a newspaper with information about the newest research in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, they will be more likely to understand what is being discussed thanks to Kean's book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDFLU7VI28NC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GG0GIXQ#wasThisHelpful","RKDFLU7VI28NC","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am going to say right upfront, this book is not written in the same great manner in which The Emperor of All Maladies was done. Bynum did a worthwhile presentation of tuberculosis. There was some history in it, some cases, a lot of medical information, just like there is in 'Maladies'. But it is presented way too dryly. And the author did not become intimately involved in her topic, which is what Mukherjee who wrote 'Maladies' did. He had a personal relationship with his cancer patients and it came across in his writing. There is no emotional involvement with this disease by the author, merely a recitation of facts that make up tuberculosis as an ailment.I'm not saying the book is not readable. Most of it was. At the end I was a little bored because it felt like the recitation of facts of how TB and AIDS are being handled today was worse than the other chapters prior to the final ones. And the thing is, I would have liked to read more personal histories about HIV/AIDS and TB, because I worked in an HIV lab for several years, and I'm from San Francisco.I think if people are going to write histories of diseases, they need to become a bit emotionally involved in their topic. Why are you writing this book? Merely to fill a gap in current knowledge? That's fine if you are writing to doctors and other medical personnel.

"I enjoyed this book on poisons. I read it for several reasons, one being that I teach microbiology, and often talk about bacterial and viral poisons, and I wanted more background. Unfortunately, like other reviewers have remarked, the book was not as consistent as it should have been. Lots of diverse stories, but they were all over the place...not in some type of logical order. This would have been a problem that a good publisher/editor could have corrected. The information and stories given captured the imagination, but with something like this that has a science background in it, you really need to have a good outline which puts everything in correct order. I definitely would have liked there to be a lot more science background on several of the topics. I love mixing history with science, as I find it to make things more interesting, and there was some of this going on in this book, but not enough to placate me.If a reader simply wants a lighter book for reading on poisons, this is fine. It doesn't require a vast intellect, and as many have previously stated, it's interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2988QZK82CE8T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IPKPUW#wasThisHelpful","R2988QZK82CE8T","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is now one of my all-time favorite books (not just medical books) that I have ever read. Dr. Mukherjee may be a cancer physician, but I really hope he continues to write, as his prose is such a beautiful thing, and his ability to explain scientific concepts in such a way as to make them totally accessible to the lay public. It's been so long since I read anything in the same class as this book. I had an absolutely awful time putting it down, even when I had classes to teach and grading to do. Usually I read several books at the same time, but this time, I read this book all the way through without bothering to look at anything else.Why did I pick this up? I've been teaching microbiology to nurses, and I knew that viruses often lead to cancer. I really wanted a better understanding of the science of how viruses can lead to cancer. I also had friends of my mom and dad who died with cancer back in the 1970's, especially breast cancer...and I wanted to know what, if anything has changed. I remember the declaration of the War on Cancer when I was a teenager, and it seems like we know significantly more thanks to genetics, but it also seems as if cancer has never given up holding the best 'hand'.Dr. Mukherjee did an incredibly job of intertwining the history of cancer with the ongoing story. Without the background half of what he explained would not have made such 'neat' sense. And the stories of his individual patients and those of other doctors, helps the reader remember the humanity behind this saga. I get the feeling Mukherjee is a great and caring doctor as well. And given the amount of death that must be seen in this field, it must be hard to keep that humanity without becoming cynical.I'm keeping this book...and will probably read it again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11NS72YESQ2OP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003UYUP58#wasThisHelpful","R11NS72YESQ2OP","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Part of the reason I got the first book by Anne Perry is I had read a few of these years ago. I knew from previous experience that Perry wrote fairly decent mysteries, that were relatively clean because they happened in the far past. I have always loved good characterizations in my fictions. Perry does a more than adequate job in both characterizations and in doing the research to make the past come alive. I tend to want to read books in correct order that author's write them in because it helps you to learn about the characters as she/he meant you to learn about them.Perry's mysteries are not greatly complicated. This first one dealt with the meeting of inspector Pitt and Charlotte, who are the two protagonists in these stories. In spite of meeting due to a local series of murders, these two people are attracted to one another. Eventually the series of murders involves her own sister. This tragedy brings these two closer together, and Charlotte feels the need to get involved in solving her sister's murder. This puts her at high risk, and that of course, concerns Pitt.These are good books for light reading.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0C02YSONJEB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052ZEI60#wasThisHelpful","R3O0C02YSONJEB","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a big lover of mysteries and series that bring out a new book every Christmas. For one thing, it is hardly very Christmas to talk about murders. I like Russell's writing. He has a good sense of humor which you rarely see. This was a sweet story really. Nick Pappas, kind of a bad mood cop, who is in trouble with his place of work for some reason. In the meantime, he is asked by a friend to help with a problem in his mall. Apparently some robbers/thugs have been attacking shoppers on their way out of the mall. So they come up with the brainy idea of having Pappas serve as the mall Santa, to see if they can spy out who the culprits are.Pappas slowly gains some uninvited friends in the people he is hanging out with in the mall. He also learns to quit moping about his own problems, and learns what really counts. Not a deep book, but a quick and fun read, with lots of characterization and lots of humor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RBH2WSG55SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FRKPXZA#wasThisHelpful","R37RBH2WSG55SA","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finished this book over a week ago, but wanted to have time to write a decent review. I've read some of Dugoni's legal procedurals and mysteries. So when I had this non-fiction account of an environmental legal case, I had no problems immediately clicking to get the book. It proved itself worthy of reading. I have read some other real cases of environmental pollution, and I teach environmental science and health occasionally. So this book was up my alley for several reasons. This case is about a man really, not a corporation or a company. Even though the guy set himself up as a corporation for a variety of reasons, it was really just him, and whoever he could pay to work for him. He was/is (since he is still alive I take it) was everything you don't want in a boss. Everything in his 'businesses' were for profit alone. He made no attempt to protect his workers, and he would close one business only to open another under a different name, in order to avoid responsibility. He declared bankruptcy several times, and this was his idea of doing business.What basically happened is this man sent unprotected workers into a tank that was full of cyanide, which is deadly. Since the book is about the investigation by various entities including the government. This was one of the first cases to go to court and be successfully sued for endangering the lives of the workers. The writing in this book was great, kept me on my toes until the very end, because it seemed as if the owner of the business with these dangerous tanks was going to get away with what boils down to attempted murder. I was thrilled that this guy ended up in prison for much longer than he thought he was going to get, but unfortunately due to his financial shenanigans, he has yet to pay the person he hurt the most (who was very badly hurt by the cyanide), any money. I feel bad for the injured young man and his family, because I'm sure they could use the money.Great and quick book to read...","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QFMQ9V7GP6RB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PUN7GNQ#wasThisHelpful","R2QFMQ9V7GP6RB","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hadn't read a Charles Todd book for a while, and was in need of some 'light' reading. So I picked this one up. I always enjoy these books for the most part, but at Amazon.com before I bought the book, I saw a reader comment that the presence of Hamish in Detective Ian Rutledge's life is getting old. To an extent I agree with that reviewer, but not to the point where I don't think the book is worth reading. This plot device that Todd (mother and son writers) uses is actually quite unique in modern fiction, even if Shakespeare used it a bit. Now given, Todd is no Shakespeare, but I've read many books with significantly less characterization and less sensible plotting. Those two parts in novels are very important, at least to me. So I am more than willing to give these books a little leeway. People do not often totally overcome a mental illness (PTSD) in their lives...and back then in World War 1, there was little that could be done concerning what was called then 'shell-shock'. Therapy as it is known today was just beginning to be used, and there was little in the way of medication. So that ghost, Hamish, might be around for a while. Maybe once in a while they might make things a little less dark?Rutledge does manage to meet a new woman, someone who a bit clairvoyant. She recognizes his problems from the war, but does not delve into his private problems at first Rutledge seems to have a stalker, who at first is simply mysterious. But later the stalking becomes dangerous to life, and he has to figure out both an attempted murder of a police officer, as well as deal with this new private problem...","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14LVYUC20DFMA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SEG444#wasThisHelpful","R14LVYUC20DFMA","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Alan Russell's psychological thrillers. Most of his writings are very well done with great characters in the books This book was no different. This was rather a dark read, about the son of a serial murderer. I didn't read the synopsis well before I grabbed this book. I had read some of Russell's other books and enjoyed them quite a lot. This book was definitely a little bit more 'deep' as well as dark, than some of his other books. This is due to the topic. Years ago, I got on a bit of a true crime kick, trying to understand the psychological underpinnings of serial murderers. Luckily it didn't last long. I didn't want to spend any more time on those type of people...it was a more of a curiosity thing on my part. But coming into this book which was fictional, it was obvious that Russell did some research on both how these criminals work, their psychology, and also into those people who may write about serial murderers. (Most of the books I read about serial murderers were from FBI profilers.)This book was rough for me to get through. It had a great premise...about what happens to the families that are left behind from a serial murderer. Many of them do have families, and like most people, I never stopped to think about those people.This book had two protagonists, the writer of the book about the original Shame serial killer, and his son, who had to deal with his fallout after he was put to death. The writer was the one person who survived Shame, and literally lived to tell the tale. But though Shame is dead, another group of women are being killed the same way as Shame had done, and they are being made to look like the son is the main suspect. The son asks for the writer's help in proving he is not the killer, and both of them end up in the sights of the murderer.This is a really good story. The language was rougher than I usually like my fiction, but then I'm probably a rarity as concerns this...","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHX88BUR6HCK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BU6W2Q#wasThisHelpful","RHX88BUR6HCK7","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I finished reading this one a while ago, but I forgot to write a review for it. I used to get Discover Magazine. I think my parents bought it for me for a while as a gift. I enjoyed it immensely but I try not to put more 'paper' around the house for me to have to throw out. Anyway, the first articles I would always read Vital Signs. I teach nurses and pre-med students so these articles were a pull for me. But the writing and the compassion in these articles by active medical personnel make for outstanding reads. I really enjoy learning about uncommon or unusual medical cases. So I was thrilled to see that they had put these into a book format. I had missed not reading these on a monthly basis. Any person can learn a lot about medicine and the profession. Oftentimes, people jumped to judgement, even doctors do that. See a horse, and not recognize the 'zebra' in front of their face. My students are required to do case studies anyway, and this book is loaded with great ones, that make them think a bit.

"When I was in med school for neuroscience, I took some classes on public health. That class started my love of case studies. Books like this one, are very good at teaching using case studies. Besides that, the stories are just plain fascinating. Meador has written other books that I enjoyed very much, so I knew I would enjoy his discussions of medical cases that were not the obvious. It helps that he is not only a physician, but finds the cases of others interesting as well. He writes in an intelligent way. And these books make it so clear, that physicians and nurses need to listen to their patients. It's easy to dismiss what people may say about their own health, but that often causes problems with their care. I had a good doctor who took the time to listen to his patients. When in medical school I saw too many physicians-to-be who thought all they had to do was use the technology available to them, without listening to their patients. And what happens if someday, we lose our power grids due to natural or manmade disaster? Will these guys be able to diagnose their patients then?This is an art that with all the technology we are quickly losing. Can doctors look at nail beds and eyes, and see the signs that are there for them to see?

"This book took me a while to get through. Not because the writing was bad. On the contrary, considering the sheer amount of military information that Tuchman had to deliver about the first month of World War I, the book was immensely readable. For some reason I'm fascinated by the fiasco that was WWI. I've been reading a variety of books from different viewpoints concerning the war. It isn't just the battles that I am interested in. I'm interested in the characters and personalities of the men (and some women) who led the world into this war, and those who led the armies.Tuchman's ability to paint pictures with words was significantly more helpful than the photographs were. I think one of the things that Tuchman made clear, was how old all the men were who were leading at this point. I think that was a huge part of the problem. These men were still stuck in the 19th century, with the old ways of doing battle. Technology advancements had brought in cars, planes, huge cannon like Big Bertha, and machine guns that mowed through men, like slicing soft cheese with a knife. These changes made the concepts of throwing massive numbers of men into battle with little or no protection not just archaic, but monstrous. Yet the old men from Germany, France, and England cared nothing for men as individuals...but only for national honor as they perceived it. This is what made this war so absolutely Ludacris.Tuchman gave a lot of information about these men, and what made them tick. She provided so much from personal letters from these men, as well as later information written or supplied by these men. A dry recitation of the battles would not have sufficed. Tuchman's ability to weave the stories of that month beginning WWI into a cohesive whole, that leaves the reader with more understanding about the 'whys' as well as the 'where' and the 'who'.I know there are flaws in this book that was written fifty years ago. That's going to happen when more information comes out over the years. And though some readers/researchers were bad-mouthing Tuchman about her slant concerning miscalculation driving the war, to an extent it was true. She was writing about the first month of the war, not what started the whole thing. Anyone who has read a lot of books about WWI knows about Sarajevo. Maybe Tuchman should have made it clearer that she assumed the readers entering into her book already knew about some of the factors that led up to the war. Sarajevo was certainly one, but it was merely the excuse for the whole thing, and there are other factors as or more important than Sarajevo.In any group of books that concentrate on a single topic, there are books that are so important to read to increase the understanding of the topic, that they cannot be overlooked. Tuchman's book on WWI is one of these. It is also one of the most enjoyable histories that I've read in a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13VLSC40VCXLX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TXZS8A#wasThisHelpful","R13VLSC40VCXLX","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a great book on the Middle ages. Starr did his research for this one, and it showed in the book. I'm sure murder and mayhem happened quite a bit during medieval times. Death was more taken for granted, and less than a shock than it often is now. Between plagues, accidents, lack of food or health care...life was usually short and hard. It's amazing that lives were still lived, children were born, people were most definitely closer to the God, and even art was accomplished. I think if most of us were thrust back in that time period, we die from discouragement and desperation.The history in this tale actually made up a significant part of the reason I gave this four stars. I love history with anything. I use history in all my science classes to make the science more applicable and memorable. Good history in a mystery like this keeps my attention. I appreciate the research the author does. A young man who is not the inheritor of his father's estate, Hugh de Singleton, decides to become a surgeon. He starts his practice in Oxford, but comes to the attention of a local lord, who asks him to become involved when the skeleton of a woman is found in the castle's cess pit. First thing, is to find out who is missing from where. In a day, when forensics has not even been thought of yet, Hugh must use his powers of observation and deduction to figure out what ends up being not just one murder, but several.This is a highly enjoyable, and 'safe' book. What I mean by safe, is there isn't bad language in this book, or a lot of sex. I personally don't enjoy either of those in books all the time. If there is too much of either, I'm liable to put the book away. If that makes me a prude, so be it. I just choose not to clog up my mind with unnecessary crap.If that's your preference this looks like the series for you. Like I said, great history, good mystery makes for a fun mix.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CHS9UO8SB98V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPUM58S#wasThisHelpful","R2CHS9UO8SB98V","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was such a sweet story. When I was growing up, and dealing with bullies because I was Deaf and going to a public school, I'd go to the library and load up on books. Many times they were fairy tales, myths, and fantasy. I've never lost that love of being taken by a book and dropped into another existence. This book did just that. The story of two sisters who are dealing with changes in their lives is something that many sisters go through, with simply growing up. In this case, one sister is becoming a beautiful mermaid, and if she doesn't reach the ocean in time, she will die.In the process of taking her sister to the ocean, the other sister, Clara, travels with her 'pretend brother'. They have numerous adventures involving a traveling circus, and striving to keep Maren, the mermaid, alive. I love their pet dragon, who seems to be a dog with wings. He's very loyal, and comes to the rescue when they need him to.The narrative nature of this story was a bit awkward, but the story and the characters made up for it.

"Been reading more novels that are obviously for teenagers thanks to some of the books like The Hunger Games, which have proven so popular. This book had a great premise...a young girl finds out from her grandmother (who she has just met) that she has inherited the ability to travel in time. Her grandmother also has this ability. This girl, Kate, has already had inklings that something is different in her life, because she is seeing changes, and running into people at times when she seems to be having 'flashes' of insights. Not quite dreams, but before her grandmother explains them, Kate doesn't know what is going on. Eventually, one of the changes is Kate's mother and father disappear in the world she currently inhabits, due to changes being made in the past.Something happened to Kate and her family way back in the 1800s around the time of the World Fair in Chicago, that her grandmother wants Kate to go back and change what happened to save their family. But the Chicago Fair turned out to be dangerous for a lot of women due to the presence of a real man, named Holmes, turned a hotel into a serial murderer's playground.Good ideas, right. The problem is with the author. This was one of the most irregular books I've read for a while. There was almost no explanation before the author plunged us into Kate's strange world. The writing was uneven, and like one reviewer said, there was too much dialogue and not enough background or characterization. The Hunger Games were extremely well-written books. This book was not.I know she is writing for teens, but even teens should be exposed to the absolute best writing. Adolescents do not get enough of a good education in anything, including writing. So when they go to read these very popular teen fantasies, which I want them to do (I'm a professor), I want them to have the very best. I'm sure some teens will enjoy this book anyway. But the characterization was weak (I never got a picture in my mind of any of the characters), and the plot was jerky, and the dialogue was often annoying...I will not continue to read any of the other books from this series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJBTFREN7FS2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CQC9O16#wasThisHelpful","RJBTFREN7FS2Q","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Russell is a new author for me. I read one of his later books, and decided to dive in and get this first book about Michael Gideon, and his great dog, Sirius (love the name for the dog). I have always had a very close relationship with my dogs, and I love reading about the relationship that exists between these two. I know that most cops who do K-9 work are unusually close to their animals, The need for not only respect but also trust is paramount to keeping both partners safe. Just recently in Pittsburgh, where I live, a beloved canine put himself at risk to keep his partner safe, and he paid for it with his life. Pittsburgh was devastated...not just his officer. Because of his death, special vests were bought to protect these beloved dogs.I love the way Russell writes. The books read too fast for me...I want them to keep going. Fire engulfs Michael's life. It not only burns him physically, but it also haunts his dreams. He cannot seem to leave behind the horrific incident where Michael caught a serial killer, but almost lost his partner, Sirius, in the process. When Michael finally comes back to work, he is placed in a special situation by the head of the police. He is to take on cases that require a different take. Even Michael isn't quite sure what he is supposed to be doing. But he gets a couple of cases that require finesse and a lot of heart, one concerning a baby who is left to die, and another where a young man is found on a running trail hanging from a crucifix. Michael and Sirius need to find the truth behind these cases, while still dealing with their own ongoing problems.An immensely readable book. I am looking forward to more books from this author!

"This turned out to be a very sweet book. My mother used to read Catherine Hyde's books, I think, so I was familiar with her name. The premise of the book almost floored me at the beginning, because her protagonist, August is taking the summer to travel in his RV with his dead son's ashes. The RV breaks down, and the man who is fixing his RV asks August to take his sons for the summer, out of the blue. The mechanic, Wes, is going into jail for 3 months, and needs someone to take his boys because he has no one else.As a mother, the thought of sending your kids with an unknown man is asking for trouble, and no one in their right mind would ask a stranger that! It took me a little while to get into the book, to even accept that anyone in this world would even consider that. Any good parent that is. But Wes obviously isn't the best parent, or he wouldn't be going to jail for another DUI.Once the story gets going, it is an incredible story of loss and gain, of learning to care about others, and of growing up and growing wiser. Hyde is a good writer. Her prose is straight-forward and honest. It's hard to remember sometimes that there are good people in the world, who try to do the right things...sometimes for the wrong reasons, but then it turns out to be right anyway.

"I've seen that other reviewers had good things to say about this book, which is part of the reason I was incredibly disappointed in it. I enjoy a good historical novel occasionally. One reviewer compared the book to Caleb Carr's historical mysteries which I adored, and then to Eric Larson's histories which are not fiction...This author does not compare well to either of them. The language and the writing of this book did not compare well. He isn't of a sufficient literary bent or has the background needed for the excellent writing in the previous two authors. But I could have swallowed writing that was not the best, if the story and the characters were decent. I actually had to make myself finish the book, which for me is rare. I've read some on Nellie Bly and Emma Lazarus and I went to refresh some of my historical knowledge of these two. I'm sure the author did his research for this story. But it felt contrived, which historical fiction can do if not done right. But the biggest problem I had with the entire book was giving our current morals in 2015 to something that occurred in 1880s-1890s. I am not nave enough to believe that lesbians did not exist then, nor that there were not loose morals in the Victorian era. But, to have all the characters act the way we do currently is not in keeping with that strait-laced society. They were private back then, much more than we are now. And women did not flaunt differences as much as they do now.This is not a 'bad' book, and I'm sure some readers will enjoy it. But it played fast and loose with the time period and the mores of that time period, and for that reason I did not enjoy it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KH37UGN3FRJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7Q04GI#wasThisHelpful","R1KH37UGN3FRJM","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was very tempted to give this book 4 stars, instead of 5 like I did, mainly because of the 'stridency' of the author. I do not disagree with the author's point of view. In fact, as a rubella baby from the 1950's who managed to get measles, mumps, and other infectious diseases during the '60s which are not seen any more thanks to vaccines, and as a professor who teaches nurses and pre-med students, I have my own reasons for being horrified that the U.S. and other civilized countries are losing their 'herd immunity' due to people not vaccinating their children.I immediately knew how strongly the author felt concerning anti-vaccinators and the fake scientists who were spreading junk and bad science about the vaccines. The Title of the book, and some of the information concerning the book, did make it obvious what the book was going to be about, but the author was almost rabid in his opinions. I totally understood his impatience with these people who have ears, 'but do not hear' as the scriptures say. Normally, I try to avoid books that enter into a discussion that seems one-sided, but I wanted to read a book on this topic that provided all the necessary research, that Mr. Mnookin did. The amount of research that he included in this book from all areas involved in this current health crisis was phenomenal. I appreciated that he did all of the research and provided where that information came from. I'm planning on looking into some of the research farther.I get so frustrated sometimes with people who choose not to get their children vaccinated. I understand the worry that parents go through concerning autism. I had three children, and I got them all vaccinated because I didn't want them to go through what I did due to these diseases. I have 6 grandchildren, and I also have a nephew that is high-functioning Asperger's. But the doctors who started this, Wakefield and others, were not doing correct experimental and objective science. They went into their 'studies' already decided on their hypothesis, and you just don't do that. I worked in labs on Alzheimer's and HIV for 6 years. You do not decide what you are going to find in your work prior to doing the experiments. You certainly do not allow money to influence your findings, and this is what these doctors did. Wakefield and company should be ashamed of themselves, because of their greed, children throughout the world continue to die needlessly.Mnookin did express compassion for the parents of those children suffering from autism. I feel for them too. My sister's son is great, we love him a lot, and he's smart and a good kid. But his parents struggled all of his childhood to get him adequate medical care, and social learning. And we all worry about him. So I can't imagine what other parents are going through with children who are much worse off than my nephew. I understand the need parents have to find someone or something to blame for this autism crisis. But too many of them are being blind to the truth, and some of them are putting their children at increased risk of invasive medical care just to somehow prove their point. You do not put a child through a medical procedure such as drawing spinal fluid needlessly. I've been through that...it's extremely painful, and you only do it as an adult if you are trying to rule out something like cancer. I certainly would never put a child through it if you can avoid it.I'm Deaf due to rubella. We've gotten so far away from these diseases, that current parents have no idea what kind of damage they caused. I also have numerous autoimmune diseases from undergoing exposure to these viruses 'naturally'. I read inn Mnookin's book that parents and some doctors say natural exposure to measles, mumps and rubella is better than the vaccines. Are they nuts? I want to tell these people to talk to me and other rubella babies that have been through so much due to natural exposure to these diseases. Believe me, if they listened to me they wouldn't be in such a hurry to expose their kids!This is a necessary addition to the writings on the state of vaccination in the world. Hopefully, more people will read it and do the right thing by their children. Their kids will thank them for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQQE7W3DZLWOE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0043RSJTK#wasThisHelpful","RQQE7W3DZLWOE","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually finished reading this book quite a while ago. I just forgot to write a review. I really enjoy Dugoni's legal thrillers. He's an excellent writer, and I only gave him four stars instead of five because I preferred one of his other books to this one. David Sloane, a top-notch attorney, is recovering from the loss of his wife. In the midst of his work on previous cases, he comes across a very smart, attractive defending attorney who was against him on one of those cases. She quickly becomes involved in his life, almost too quickly. Then Sloane finds out that this woman is being targeted for her work in bringing down a drug trafficker who managed to kill her daughter. When a trafficker is found murdered, she becomes a suspect, and asks Sloane to represent her in court.Sloane seems to be a bit oblivious to this woman's agenda, but the people who work for him and even his step-son are growing wise to possible problems in the case, and in this woman's involvement in Sloane's life. Sloane is forced to separate his personal life from the case, and look at what is really going on before it is too late.Great summer read, very smart, with lots of intelligence.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H5M9OLP5JY8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PR8FSM0#wasThisHelpful","R3H5M9OLP5JY8V","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a really poignant book, about a family that is falling apart. It's a legal thriller, and the author obviously knows what he is talking about. A 14-year old is found murdered, and at first, there seems to be no suspects. But then the police zone in on the son of the prosecutor who went to the same school as the victim. The victim apparently bullied the prosecutor's son, and the case seems to be circumstantial at first, but more disturbing information comes out as the case goes on.This book brings up several important topics. How would we handle it if family member's are charged with a crime? Can we be supportive and face reality, or will we be blind to possibilities?The ending I wasn't really prepared for. And I don't want to wreck other readers enjoyment of this book by telling any more than I already have. Needless to say, this was a very smart book that makes you stop and think about our justice system, and about what we know about our family members.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OTCUTWK8YMVW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050DIWFC#wasThisHelpful","R2OTCUTWK8YMVW","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ugh...I hate it when I am recommended books, and they turn out to be huge disappointments. First off, from the reviews that I read, I thought this was a mystery. I guess it will remain a mystery to me, because I got through 2/3rds of the book and deleted it from my Kindle. I absolutely hate books that are supposed to be one thing, and turn out to be really another genre. This tried to be a mystery and a romance, and it was boring the heck out of me about 1/4 of the way through. It wasn't particularly well-written. Then to top it off it decided to veer into a topic that I avoid at all costs. It started to be about child molestation.No thanks. I don't need to waste my mind or my time with that type of crap. I usually read about 4 books at a time. Three of them were nonfictions, biographies, or science...and I read fiction for enjoyment. That topic doesn't constitute enjoyment (or shouldn't), and certainly didn't provide anything I could learn from. I know this stuff exists, but I don't need to fill my mind with such things as that...nobody does.Definitely will not be reading her again! And will be a bit more careful about the 'reviews' in the future...","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF5EI4E8KQSOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LTBWMJ6#wasThisHelpful","RF5EI4E8KQSOW","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh boy...I love Ransom Riggs' books. They are so incredibly unusual. The cleverness of his plots and his pictures (black and white ones with a mystery about how he got or made them!)...just when you think that someone cannot come up with a totally different plot, someone like ransom comes along. Even though the protagonists in this story are children, the book is not for children. I'm sure that teenagers enjoy this book, but the writing is actually geared towards adults. Bring in a topic like World War II (which the children go back between earlier times and 1940), and most children and teens will be unfamiliar with this time period. I read all kinds of books, and when these books come up recommended to me, it's less teen-related, than it is fantasy.This second book by Riggs is just as well-written as his first book. Jacob, an American boy is helping the 'peculiar' children flee from the hollowgasts (monsters) and the wights (who are Peculiars that have changed to bad beings). Each of the children have a special ability, that makes them  peculiar. But in this book, Jacob is finding out more about himself as well as the other children. He doesn't want to recognize that he is special in ways as well. He only thinks he is helping the peculiars because they helped his grandfather, and needs to pay back that debt.I don't want to ruin anyone else's read by telling more about the plot line. As other reviewers have said, this book is dark and deep in some places. Somewhat along the lines of Tolkien's books, this book uses the war and the differences of the children to talked about ideas such as discrimination and the importance of being different. So this book should not be read by very young children, and this is a book that can be read and talked about with teens and others about the themes in it, and what they mean.Terrific read, and I'm going to have a hard time waiting for the next book in the series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23TO2J8L7OTA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009Y3ON4I#wasThisHelpful","R23TO2J8L7OTA7","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I went and got this second book from Dugoni, after I read My Sister's Grave. I actually enjoyed this book more than that one even though it was pretty good. Dugoni has a very crisp writing style which goes well with legal thrillers. In this book, his protagonist, David Sloane, is not involved in court. His 16-year stepson is acting out due to his mother's murder, so Sloane decides to take him on a Father-son camping outing with friends. They pick the wrong town to stop in before going to the woods. The son Jake, decides to pull a criminal stunt with the younger boy he is with, and gets them both arrested. This puts them into a system, where the judge quickly puts them into a rehabilitative program for boys, without providing them with lawyers or even a chance to talk to their parents/guardians. The program turns out to be less than rehabilitative, and more a place where boys are abused and used as slave labor. Sloane and his friend, whose son was also convicted in a illegal court situation, are determined to help their boys get out of this place at any means necessary. And since the court and the police are equally determined to retain these boys, this means Sloane must work undercover to prove the authorities in this town are up to no good.Many people will pass this story off as 'fiction', but unfortunately, this did happen in Eastern PA, where judges and lawyers conspired to put both young boys and girls into a private detention facility for kickbacks. These guys were caught and put behind bars for over 20 years, but not until they ruined the lives of many children and teenagers. So in this case, reality became fiction. I'm sure it isn't the first time something like this has happened in the U.S. But I can understand how frightened parents must be for their children when trapped in a situation like, let alone how the kids feel.If you enjoy thrillers, this is definitely a great book. The plot is excellent, and Dugoni does a better job in characterization than many of authors do who write books like this. The characters are more believable and three dimensional, than in many mysteries.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TFL2OLZG7EM6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QFMNCKC#wasThisHelpful","R2TFL2OLZG7EM6","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If I could have given this book another half a star, I would. It's been a while since I've read a mystery/procedural that I could really enjoyed as much as I did this one, Guardians of the Night. It was very refreshing to read a book about a cop whose constant companion is his German Shepherd. So there are actually two protagonists to this story, the cop Detective Michael Gideon, and his police dog, Sirius. They have a closer relationship with each other, than anyone else in Gideon's life. It's interesting to watch the author develop the 'personalities' of both the man and the dog. I thought it was great, because each dog has individual personalities, and the relationship p between a man and his dog are always different.In this book, a 'bum' sees what he perceives as an angel to be killed. Gideon is usually assigned to cases that are not run of the mill, and originally he is skeptical, but after he meets the homeless man...he feels there is more to the story. As he digs, first the homeless man is killed, and then he finds films from the area the 'angel' died in, and they all were filled with static at that specific time period. The farther Gideon digs, the more questions are raised. Someone had a hand in killing this 'angel', and they become irate that Gideon is digging into their business.My biggest complaint of this book, was the author did not totally resolve what the 'angel' was. It actually becomes part of the plot, and I understand that, but it kind of leaves the reader not totally satisfied. But for the most part, I really enjoyed this book. The writing was good, and Gideon and his dog make for a different and enjoyable duo. I will definitely pick up books about this duo in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LAPIFPMA2SXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K2EOOOC#wasThisHelpful","R2LAPIFPMA2SXH","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a terrific biography! I read so much of Twain when I was taking literature the first time I went to college. We also had to read him in high school, but I don't think I appreciated him back then. I would suggest to literature teachers to recommend this biography to students who are studying him, because it really helped to understand his writings. Powers so easily entwined Twain's writings in this book, and all the letters he wrote to so many people really made a huge difference in understanding the man. Twain was a complicated guy. He was funny, irreverent, cynical, and in spite of all this, he was a man who was a wonderful husband. His relationships with other people besides his wife, were less easy to nail down. His daughters worshipped him, he had some good friends that thought the world of him, while he kind of took them for granted. He was absolutely terrible to his brother, who he thought was a wimp. Powers brings all of this information and insight into Twain/Clemens into such a readable whole book, that many times, I was loathe to put the thing down. I actually was grateful to getting sick, so I would have an opportunity to finish the whole book.Powers doesn't gloss over the bad things that Clemens did or said. But he really made it clear through the book how much the author thought and felt for this unusual man. Powers gives so much background that explains why Samuel Clemens was the kind of person he was...I really need to go back and read some of his writings over again, to understand his books from what I know now.Too bad he isn't here now. We could certainly use his humor and his honesty in our politics and our foolish preoccupation with 'celebrities'. Even though he was very much a celebrity in his time, and he enjoyed being one, I think he would make short shrift of our current world, and put many people back in their rightful place!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HDWEGFIMY2UL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NY12I2#wasThisHelpful","R1HDWEGFIMY2UL","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hmmm...I have mixed feelings about this book. I can totally understand why teens love it. I have been reading quite a few books this year that were really for teens. Partly because I remember really good literature from when I was growing up that I read such as L'Engle's Wrinkle in Time, and I first read Lord of the Rings back as a teenager. I really enjoyed other books such as The Book Thief, and I read all of the Hunger Game books. Because I'm Deaf, I prefer to read books first before I see the movie, but my granddaughters wanted to see the movie, so I was actually reading the book at the same time as when I saw the movie. As per usual, I thought the book was slightly better than the movie, although they really took the dialogue right from the book. The book gave more to the imagination than the movie did.So what bothers me about the book? Part of it is the fact that I got a strong feeling the book was actually written with a movie in mind.. Books like the ones I mentioned above, stand well alone...they don't seem to be written for a movie. Even the Hunger Games, which we have all been seeing and hearing about for several years now (and the Harry POtter series), the writing is really good in these books. We will have to see what the future brings, but I think the books I've mentioned will continue to draw readers for years, while this book will not stand the test of time. The writing just isn't there in this book. It is not a great piece of literature. It was written to sell.That's kind of too bad, because the topic is one that should be explored. Children and teens are not supposed to die of cancer. But they do, and their stories should be told. But I don't like tear jerkers usually, I don't choose to read those along with my science, and history, and classics. I would probably recommend the book to teens to read if this is the kind of stuff they like, but it wouldn't be my first choice.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGYXZ4DB2ZJ2Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ZOBNOI#wasThisHelpful","RGYXZ4DB2ZJ2Z","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After seeing the last case of Poirot on PBS, I felt I had to read some of Agatha Christie's books on him. I'd read some of her other mysteries when I was young, but wanted to remind myself of her writing abilities. She was very good at writing clever mysteries. Her language is impeccable, as are her ideas or plots. In this book she introduced one of her most famous protagonists, Mr. Poirot. He is totally unique in English writing, not the usual good-looking man who is solving criminal cases in a hurry. Poirot doesn't hurry. He takes his time, and makes sure that everything is in place so he can nail the criminals responsible. Poirot has his companion, Captain Hastings, who is not quite as smart as he is. But Hastings is his wall that he can bounce his ideas off of.In this mystery, Hastings and Poirot are staying with a friend of Hastings, whose stepmother was just murdered. Poirot starts investigating, using his grey cells to determine who was capable of murdering this woman. Several people staying at Styles are possible culprits including her own stepsons, the wife of one of the son's, a young woman named Cynthia who seemed to be a companion of the older woman, and an unknown doctor who seems entirely too friendly with the wife. This first book starts while World War 1 is still raging, and Christie paints a picture of what life was in England during that period.Now that I've started with this book, and enjoyed her writing again, I think I will be getting more of her works. I love the ambiance of the books.

"I really enjoyed this book. I have a granddaughter a lot like this 17 year old girl, who is trying to make sense of her life. My granddaughter has a mother, but life hasn't been easy for her, like it hasn't been easy for Molly, the 17 year old. We all wish that our kids and grandkids would meet someone like this older woman, Vivian, who in spite of her age, had a similar hard time growing up which Molly could relate to.I knew about orphan trains, and I figured many children experienced horrors or difficult times. I'm sure there were stories such as this one. Both Molly and Vivian are vital protagonists to this story, and their story being entwined was beautiful. I think young people should be introduced to older people because they would be surprised at the stories they have to tell about their lives.My only complaint about this book, was the ending was bit too fast, and wrapped up in too neat a bow. It felt not quite right, even though Vivian is introduced to family members she thought she had lost. Other reviewers mentioned being left with wanting more.

"Collins books involving Katniss, have been a wonderful break from my usual reading of science and history. I enjoy a lot of genres, but these 'young adult' books have been so enjoyable because they were well-written and really made you think. I usually try to read books before I've seen the movies, and most of the time, I find the book is better than the movies. I thank heaven that the movies really have tried to stay true to the book, and also for the great computer skills of the people working on the films, that allow them to make the 'world' that surround Katniss. And they found a great person to play Katniss...I can't see anyone else playing that part.I've been thinking about this book since I finished it. I was talking to my teenage granddaughter about it, and my husband. These books are almost scary because of what I'm seeing about the world and politics in real life. Like Orwell, Collins is describing a world of the future, but some of that future is here, and I find that appalling. I know this book is being read at schools, and I hope that teachers bring up the fact that science fiction like this oftentimes comes true. A good percent of science fiction from people like Jules Verne and HG Wells, have already become 'real' in our lifetime. So books like these act as warnings of what will happen if we are not careful.Definitely worth the read...I read it in two days straight, even with grading finals!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FD4KVQGKXOAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3B6NWU#wasThisHelpful","R2FD4KVQGKXOAI","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though the whole series is great, this book wasn't quite as good as the other two of the series. It served to provide more filler for the story...and introduce us to new people who will be important later on. Katniss is unfortunately pulled back into another Capitol game because President Snow feels she is becoming too powerful, as a face of the discontent of the districts. Katniss tries to do the best she can to calm things down in fear that President Snow will take retribution on the people she cares about. But everything she does makes things worse.We learn more about people close to her in this book, and that is important to the third book. The new Games are just as atrocious as the first ones Katniss is in, but she gains some allies who seem to be intent on rescuing both her and Peeta rather than killing them. She doesn't quite understand why, but they help her to understand how the new Games are working.There is a lot more explaining in this book, and though it is exciting and necessary, it didn't have the drive of the other two books. But it's absolutely necessary to the story.I'm amazed at how close they made the movies to the books. It's certainly a bonus to have computer graphics that can mimic the imagination...","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTMNC0ZJ62EI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003O86FMW#wasThisHelpful","R2QTMNC0ZJ62EI","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a beautiful book. That's two books on WWII that I've read this year that were historical fictions, that brought to life more about the German side of the story. We forget in blaming the Germans for the things that Hitler and his cronies did, that many Germans were simply caught up in a disaster, not of their making. And certainly the children were mislead by the adults, and had no choice in the matter. There were several threads in this story, about a young orphan with remarkable skills in electronics who is forced to perform for his country, despite his inclinations towards being good. He sees both the horror of war, and the brutality...and tries to block it out with his science. He also sees some beauty, in the ocean he eventually is introduced to, and a young blind girl who he meets very shortly.Another thread is about the young blind girl from France, who is forced with her father to leave their home in Paris. He is entrusted with a package from the museum he worked for, and is asked to protect. They flee to a small port in Southern France, where the girl meets an uncle who is damaged from WWI, and who becomes her protector when she loses her father.The stories of the people who surround these two protagonists, is a story seen in times of war...of loss, of redemption, of forgiveness, and of courage and empathy for others. Doerr writes in such a way to draw the stories together as a quilt or collage. HIs use of words is some of the most gorgeous prose I've read in a long time, especially writing about something that is so horrendous as WWII.I hope to read more from this author in the future...if you have the time, read this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15T0HNK8P4O6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DPM7TIG#wasThisHelpful","R15T0HNK8P4O6K","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Excellent book on the battle to conquer strept. We don't think a whole lot about strept now. When our kids get sick with this bug/microbe it usually causes a sore throat. This is what doctors test for. But in my grandmother's time, streptococcus of any kind could kill you. Streptococcus infections caused sepsis, wound infections, and if it traveled from the throat to the heart, it could cause rheumatic fever. I know about this because my grandmother ended up with it.The Germans were the first to find something that would work on streptococcus. Before antibiotics existed sulfa drugs were used. This is the story of the research done by Bayer and other companies in Germany to find something that would prevent the many deaths seen during war time from disease. For the most part, during both the Civil War and World War 1 (and the other small wars in between these years) more men died from disease, including gangrene and wound infections, than died from bullets. So the race was on among all countries including Great Britain, France, and Germany to find something that could cure men of disease, and get them back to the fronts. This of course, was of more concern than civilian deaths. Streptococcus was also known to cause puerperal fever in women who were delivering children. This was another huge concern for many doctors.This race to find a drug that would help prevent infections led to some of the typical fiascos seen in the science community. These men are very competitive, especially when other countries are known to be searching for the same thing. These competitions mean that mistakes will be made, usually someone's feelings will get hurt due to being ignored when awards are given, jealousy runs rampant, etc. All of those things happened here in this story.What's interesting isn't just the research done, and the men involved, but how short the use of sulfa drugs actually was. We still use some sulfa drugs, such as sulfonamide, but it is known that many of the antibiotics we currently use are causing resistance among bacteria. So it might come to the point we will need to use more sulfa drugs again in the future.Interesting story...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SPI42TW7MSWZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JMKR2A#wasThisHelpful","R1SPI42TW7MSWZ","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was another decent mystery/police procedural by Jance. Beaumont is trying to figure out who killed a coach. The man left behind a pregnant wife, but it seems that he is not a perfect husband. Beau hates to think that his wife had something to do with his murder.One thing that separates Jance's books stand separate from many other series, is that the books can stand by themselves outside of the series. If you pick one up from the middle of the series you will still enjoy the book, and find out enough about the characters to have a good idea what type of people they are. I love Jance's character development. That's a major reason why I continue to read this series. Beau has been through a lot as far as personal life is concerned, but he has a great partner (who is constantly nagging him about what he eats), and he also has an inherited lawyer who has turned into a great friend. Jance always puts in more stories of their interaction with one another, as well as with the crime being solved, and it makes the books read very quickly.Good read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J56PHAJYTD4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000JMKO7I#wasThisHelpful","R1J56PHAJYTD4I","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was not what I expected, but it turned out to be a really good book. When I picked it up, I thought it was a book simply on tuberculosis and the spread of the disease, and the eventual cure. This book was about that, to an extent, but it was more on specific scientists involved in working on tuberculosis (Pasteur and Koch), and how scientists worked to find the thing causing tuberculosis. It was also about the mistakes scientists make, when blinded by other things such as ego and greed. This was a great history about the new fields of bacteriology, microbiology, and epidemiology. Even Conan Doyle makes an appearance in this history...people forget that Doyle was a physician first, before he became a well-known writer.I teach microbiology. Of course, both Koch and Pasteur are brought up in all my textbooks for the great work they both did. But I had never read about the competition between the two men, which helped to drive their work, but it also caused Koch to make huge mistakes in his research for a vaccine for tuberculosis. The research was impeccable, and the writing was good for such a dry subject. I'm always looking for more books like this to help make my classes more interesting. A little bit of history with the science, makes it go down easier, and much easier for my students to remember!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AG0L4YT0P8ZT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DGZKXEO#wasThisHelpful","R3AG0L4YT0P8ZT","A23OLHL5RPQKLP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A23OLHL5RPQKLP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The din of spirited discussion during a case study in training is music to my ears. It means the participants are involved, energized and learning on their own while I am only showing them the way.The only problem is getting their attention to wrap up the exercise and dissolve the buzz group. Even though I'm told I sound like John Wayne, pilgrim, sometimes the din of voices become the same as a runaway beer wagon, and regaining control requires several waves and yodels.Enter my imitation, genuine, authentic, certified London Bobby Police Whistle, which I thought would alert my classes that there had been another Jack the Ripper murder and would be poorly received, wasn't.

"I wish I could endorse this product, but as a city employee holding the civil service title of Administrative Staff Analyst, I cannot.The test that I took had topics that this book does not have e.g math and grammar which is likely to comprise approximately 20% of the test.The math is simply grammar school level of percents, fractions and decimals with questions that might require your knowledge of ""please excuse my dear aunt sally."" There will be some questions on quantitative analysis and budget with some percentiles thrown in.As far as grammar goes, any grammar book might help including Strunk and White's, ""The Elements of Style.""This study guide has no information on the in-basket exercise which is sure to perplex the most analytical mind. The in-basket exercise is likely to contain several pages of rules on which a number of questions will be based e.g. John Doe is an associate staff analyst with 265 hours of annual leave and 70 hours of accrued sick leave when he is deployed to Afghanistan in April 2013 and doesn't return until the end of May 2014. According to the rules, he accrued X days of annual leave per month according the rules of deployment, and Y number of sick leave hours per month as a Tier 4 employee. How many of each does he have at the end of June 2014? The distracters are very close and require scrutiny.  I recommend you try reading the question first, then look up the rule pertaining to the question, rather than spending the time reading all the rules before reading the questions, because that will be a time well wasted.This book offers a number of tests that require deduction, comprehension and general knowledge that will be beneficial to anyone taking a test. However, I believe the test-taker will be shocked to learn what the complexity of the questions on the actual test that are not in the book. As another reviewer noted, there is no explanation for what they list as the correct choices.Incidentally, I am currently training participants in a number of topics for the upcoming administrative analyst and staff analyst exams.

"Author Geri McArdle takes us through a 20-step training system model that is divided into 6 parts:1)  the business justification stage (a stage I have sadly never experienced);2) Analysis;3) Design;4) Development;5) Implementation and6) Evaluation.Each stage consists of a series of subsets or sub skills required to complete each stage successfully. In evaluation she focuses on Kirkpatrick's 3rd and 4th level of evaluation which are skill transfer to the workplace and results or return on investment. It ends up with a trainer's toolkit which consists of tips for the enterprising training consultant.Ms. McArdle also provides grids, sample letters, forms and most of all templates for the trainer to complete a lesson plan, the roadmap to conducting the training with some consistency.This book is not all-encompassing but it is certainly thorough, easy to read, and extremely well-organized.Consider this an excellent training resource from soup to nuts.Happy Veterans' Day!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IH69OIWHIYNL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156286470X#wasThisHelpful","R3IH69OIWHIYNL","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Icebreaker, Networker, Team Builder, Task Tension Reducer, Relationship Tension Reducer, Personal Tension Reducer, or Focussing Activity.Studies have shown that capturing anyone's attention at the start of training or a presentation is critical to a trainer's or presenter's success at maintaining learner interest and motivation otherwise the audience will shift to the nearest Lotto winning fantasy for about 30 minutes before checking back in to see what they have missed. Pike and Solem offer 61 energizers to ensure that you maintain audience interest.What I found most appealing about this book is how it is structured. It starts off with a matrix that Pike is particularly fond of using in much of his writing: Icebreaker, Networker, Team Builder, Task Tension Reducer, Relationship Tension Reducer, Personal Tension Reducer, or Focusing Activity. Each page will have the name of the activity,  a box in the top right hand corner for each of these categories, and a check mark next to each if the energizer applies to that goal. They also list the length of the course it is appropriate for e.g. use only for a course that is at least three hours long or a day long, etc. It also lists the materials and procedures for carrying out the exercises.The authors are also mindful of the size of groups (ideally 5 to 7) to maintain maximum interaction between all members including how and when to rotate groups to reduce the influence of dominant members and heighten the participation of more introverted members. Relationship tension reducers will be particularly helpful when participants are not getting along.These activities place a great emphasis on learners being seated in groups rather than individual desks since interaction is paramount for these activities to take place. Many of the activities involve the use of name tents. No name tents and you can skip a number of pages.Books of such a limited ""genre"" usually come at a steep price compared to, say, non-fiction or biographies. so full price can be steep and disappointing to the experienced trainer, but worth the price many times over the training neophyte who has no mentor for the labyrinthine interactions of a training workshop.Just make sure you don't forget the name tents and make sure people are sitting in groups.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGPWBMV4I7PA1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0787953032#wasThisHelpful","RGPWBMV4I7PA1","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is perhaps the most complete and comprehensive book any trainer will ever find on how to go about writing training programs since authors Dick and Carey wrote theirs more than 30 years ago . It contains charts and templates to guide the writer through the process. What the book doesn't provide is how to structure a lesson plan, and what Ms. Barbazette describes as conditions to learning outcomes or performance objectives, I see as criteria. Two, she lists a number of tasks in the Affective Domain of Learning (changing learners' attitudes)  that I find would be difficult if not impossible to measure.

"One reviewer wrote that the book had a big font and the information found in the book could be found in an evening of googling, so I decided to buy it, and as I suspected I cannot substantiate his claims. With 25 years of training experience in all phases of ISD, this book is a treasure trove of information for me, and I have a M.S. in Training and Learning Technology.It is not entertaining but it is not meant to be. Ms. Barbazette's writing style is analytical but informative. Every event in facilitation is broken down and examined in detail with templates to enhance recall, intuition, and learning e.g. do you know when to conduct role play, how to conduct role play, or the variations of role play you can employ, or why you would use them? Did you know there were five types of case studies, because I didn't. (I assumed there were only three). Whether it's instructional strategies, asking and answering questions, how to facilitate vs. instruct or train, determining your facilitation style, the author provides you with a thorough understanding of each. The book comes with a CD that has the templates that you can add to your thumb drive. The book is complete with a glossary, index and bibliography.I take issue with only one thing in the book where Ms. Barbazette describes conditions of an objective as quantity, quality, sequence of actions, and speed (or time limitation). I treat these as criteria of an objective and would add accuracy as another possible criterion. The conditions or circumstances in which an objective is supposed to be achieved would be the resources such as equipment or tools,  given or denied. In some conditions noise, temperature, or weather would also be considered conditions e.g. flying under instrument flight rules.The training I love to conduct the most is Train-the-Trainer training, and there are a host of ideas I plan to use from this book for our topic in Facilitation Skills. (Of course full credit will be given to the author), just as I noticed that she acknowledges the contributions from others in her book.Whether you are a neophyte, journeyman or highly experienced in training, this book is a worthy reference.Any one chapter is a bargain.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GD4O71CWCYUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0787975249#wasThisHelpful","R3GD4O71CWCYUA","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We remember the first things we see and hear, the most repetitious, the most novel, and the last things we hear or see. This is obviously about the last things we remember, and it is just as important as the others so that it isn't forgotten in days, weeks or months when the training over.There are also four types of closers which the book illustrates for us: review, action planning, celebrations and motivations. Each closer has a box in the upper right hand corner that tells you with a check mark which one or more of the four applies. Each closer is at least one page and tells you the source of the closer, the objective, what class length for which it is appropriate, the appropriate group size, time needed, equipment needed and directions how to use it called process.The 50 closers are not all different. A few are built upon others which I understand but find mildly annoying. The one I like the least is ""sayings."" These are platitudes of inspiration, which I find lacking in inspiration. However, I plan on using a number of these the next time I conduct a two-week Train-the-Trainer program which I will also carry into retirement--my own version, of course.The book is also full of advice which I found most helpful e.g. the longer the training the longer should be the closing, and that reaction sheets should be passed out to the learners much earlier than at the end when people are usually ready to leave. They are less likely to make a concerted effort to provide meaningful feedback.This book was co-authored by Lynn Solem whom I never heard of before and Bob Pike whom I know of very well. (I will certainly recognize Solem's name from now on).The book should be helpful to trainers on any level.

"Marketing is the art of getting people to buy what they don't need and make them think they do..Author David Zinczenko offers his readers a thorough examination of thousands of items found in supermarkets that are configured to dazzle the senses, mislead the shopper with false advertising, and make you buy more than you came in for. He even tells when is the best time to shop--evenings in mid week when the supermarket is less crowded, which translates to when you likely to be able to get in and out without being stuck and buy more of what you don't need.The book is divided into nine chapters: Anatomy of Supermarket, Your Save-Money Shopping Guide, The Produce Section, The Meat & Fish Counters, The Refrigerator Section, The Pantry Aisles, The Snacks and Sweets Aisle, The Freezer Section, and Drink This, not That. It also has a appetizing index that will lead you to the product, if not the brand you are looking for. Each page shows several brand name products on both sides of the page. Eat This is on the left, and Not This is on the right. There are cartoon balloons for each product explaining why you should eat it or leave it out of your basket. It's the top three ingredients that customers have to pay attention to because that is what the products contain the most of.Speaking of baskets, the supermarket has heaped upon us a number of smaller baskets knowing that the shopper is less likely to check the products he or she buys and more likely to add items that would never have been considered. Even putting produce first means the supermarket knows the consumer will spend more time which translates to spending more money in their establishment. Author, David Zinczenko recommends customers peruse that aisle last.The author pays particular attention to saturated fats, sugar, sodium, protein, and anything that is difficult to pronounce or sounds like Latin, so while Campbell's Select Harvest Healthy Request Chicken with Whole Grain Pasta might sound like a healthy request, it is only Campbell's requesting that you buy it. It has 410 milligrams of sodium and only 1% fiber coming from the whole grain pasta.If there's one thing you need to put in your food basket when you go shopping this book is a must.Buy this and digest every word.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHK4H0UZX6L8M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605298387#wasThisHelpful","RHK4H0UZX6L8M","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"To people outside training the 4C's can sound like oceans, diseases, or the Hi-C sugary drink, but to us the 4 C's is what the author Sharon Bowman claims we should use to ensure our learners actually learn from their training while making it interactive and exciting.Connections is the first ""C"" and it contains 15 opening activities that connect learners to the topic.(This is critical as it has been shown that we remember the first and last things more than anything else in between).In her second ""C"" concepts, she cites 20 strategies ""to engage and involve learners"" during the, and I won't say it, I won't--l-e-c-t-u-r-e. These strategies emphasize learner feedback and activity that is anything but sitting still or remaining silent. Ms. Bowman believes that if you must lecture, it should be kept to 15 minutes tops, and then making the learners active.Her third ""C"" is what separates training from education.

Ms. Bowman realizes as any training specialist does that without practice you only have a seminar, and that practice that is not aimed at accomplishing learner outcomes (objectives) is equally worthless. Here she offers 15 strategies for learners to practice and review what they have learned.The fourth ""C"" is conclusions and these include 15 strategies for participants to lead in their summaries, evaluations, and celebration activities.Training from the back of the room is just that--you might lead the training, but you make the training participant-centered. Making the learners active is what makes them learn.This book is practical, well-written and will have a high impact in any classroom, and I have seen the results having just trained a number of law enforcement officers to become instructors using these principles.  They are highly motivated and intent on using their new found skills in their classrooms.I recommend that you use these strategies in yours.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36TC67Q7Q2XVV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0787996629#wasThisHelpful","R36TC67Q7Q2XVV","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I did not know Sharon Bowman so I did not recognize her when she and I stood near the head of a very long line of trainers lined up according to our training experience, at Training Magazine's seminar in Orlando last year. After reading this book and her ""Using Brain Science"" book, I realized how much our experiences diverged and how much I still had to learn. Because of her books my learning curve went vertical.Ms. Bowman presents a number of activities to be used before training, during training, during breaks, as closing activities and for action plans. There are several variations to each activity to keep the learner attentive, interested, and most of all--learning. These strategies push the senses by making participants walk, making them talk, and making them write. What I found particularly useful and neglected by many trainers and instructors in my experience is to repeat the questions or exercises to ensure the learning sticks. Before this I never stood still but I realized that I had to make sure the learners didn't sit still.Recently, I revamped our Train-the-Trainer course by abandoning the ADDIE format of presenting topics and focusing on practice after each topic. I am still getting complimentary e-mails from participants who want to return for more. I will go into overdrive using even more of them this week from a workbook I created for internal use. Ms. Bowman knows we will use these exercises and only asks that we give credit to her. Her name and book titles are mentioned prominently as resources.If you want to improve your training skill, buy this book. Be a guide on the side rather than a sage on stage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1RSIKTMDEHY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0787974420#wasThisHelpful","RA1RSIKTMDEHY","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have nothing but admiration for a man who is an amateur writer who does not back down from a challenge to writing a series of humorous essays made all the more novel because English is his second language. (Pardon me! The good doctor would inform me that it was his fourth language having grown up in Romania, moved to Israel, then to France to study medicine, and finally finishing his odyssey in Long Island.Being an anesthesiologist, he feels he doesn't get the recognition that he should get. No wonder, he's the one that passes the gas (in a medical sort of way.) As a result, no one remembers who he is. I think it should be a tipping situation, myself. So, he has resorted to writing two books, one with an excellent plot, and this one which lists his pet peeves of being recognized as Mrs. Neuschat's husband, lawn mowers going off all the time, and realtors dissembling about ocean views. (They're much better in the winter time, I'm sure).Look at the picture of the good doctor on his Amazon page, and you see an infectious smile and outlook on life that shows how deftly he can turn his complaints about things beyond his control into humorous little stories that made me laugh out loud. It also speaks to his intelligence and fluency despite the accent that must be impossible to pin down demographically.The only things Joe left out is people handing you your change with the coins sitting on top of the bills. Can't you give them to me separately as people used to do? Am I supposed to wrap them up in a ball and stuff them in my pocket? Nor did he mention the people who hand you your change as though they are giving you a present. Hey, it's money you owe me; it's not a gift! He didn't mention the tip jar that businesses put out even though you're getting up to get your order, and they didn't even bring it to your table.

"Sometimes your enemy comes at you as a friend. The same is true with propaganda coming to you masquerading as journalism. Fox Nation, the Internet arm of Rupert Murdoch's vast news empire, provides the readers with a daily dose of propaganda in the guise of news.Author Mark Howard catalogues dozens of Fox Nation headlines showing in detail how Fox Nation blatantly lies to their readership, even citing sources that contradict their own headlines. One of my favorites is ""NBC-WSJ poll: On economy Romney Opens Up Lead Over Obama."" Even though Obama was in fact leading in 14 categories, even leading in fighting for fairness and strengthening the middle class, Fox Nation gave the impression that Romney was leading in overall economic improvement when he was only leading in ""ideas for improving the economy by 6%. (We all know how that turned out)!Perhaps the most blatant of all was ""Poll: Americans Not Buying Buffett Rule."" In case you don't know, Warren Buffet has advocated for increased taxes on the wealthy. Fox Nation's claim here was that the public rejected it.  The poll they cited was from Fox News which found that ""more voters think raising taxes on wealthy Americans will help rather than hurt the economy."" In other words, the results of the poll actually refuted Fox Nation's headline!Thanks to authors like Mr. Howard, he keeps Fox Nation honest. (?) Make that he keeps their dishonesty in the spotlight. He continues monitoring Fox Nation with his website which I will mention in the comments section. This is a short book but well worth the time to read.

"Politician is a dirty word in American English, and the unfolding story of what went on in Benghazi Libya on the night of September 11, 2012 brought the word to a new nadir in our language.After four Americans were killed that night including a U.S. Ambassador, the first time an American ambassador was slain in a number of years, the Republicans saw their opportunity to politicize to influence the upcoming national election that November. Although Mitt Romney and Barack Obama had agreed to halt personal attacks, this was irresistible for the Romney campaign who immediately charged that the president was weak on foreign policy and had made a statement that was tantamount to an apology for prior U.S. actions. This incorrect statement would come to back to haunt him in a debate with President Obama.Darrel Issa led the Republicans with charges of his own barely after convening an investigation with his oversight committee. Issa, a congressman who was often thought of as a man born out of wedlock started making accusations of presidential neglect, ambivalence and stonewalling. He began leaking information that intimated the administration had lied and was negligent. Issa would be severely embarrassed when a Democrat released the entire report which showed Issa had lied and his investigation had turned up nothing.The Fox News network, which claims to be fair and balanced and states 'we report you decide,"" went into high gear accusing the administration of being soft on terrorism and uninterested in finding out who were the culprits of the attack. Greta van Sustern, Sean Hannity, Steven Doocy, Brian Kilmeade and other Fox hosts interviewed a number of right wing nuts giving them full rein to their baseless suspicions and paranoia. Their attacks were enough to destroy the nomination of Susan Rice as the next Secretary of State, but it did nothing to hurt the re-election of Barack Obama.That left the Republicans with Plan B: go after Hillary Clinton, the odds-on front runner as the Democrats Party's nominee for President in 2016, and go after Hillary they did. Scheduled to appear before Congress, Secretary Clinton literally stumbled and received a bad concussion that turned into a blood clot behind her ear. The press, led by Fox of course, claimed that Ms. Clinton faked her fall to avoid the spotlight of a congressional investigation. The Secretary of State held her own.Resistant to public apathy the Republicans continued with Plans C and D, or accusations of a stand down order for military relief that never existed. Those with little to no knowledge of military operations or logistics insisted that a rescue operation could have been mounted despite sworn expert testimony to the contrary. Plan D was the critical cables that Republicans charged the now ex-Secretary of State knew an attack was imminent (she did not) and that requests for security upgrades were denied or ignored. This too was proven false. Even charges that whistleblowers were muzzled, that witnesses had not been interrogated, and our dead were left behind were proven false.What author David Brock showed here was the hypocrisy of Democrats and Republicans who stood together after the attack on 9/11 in New York and the Pentagon had morphed into a chasm of bitter political rivalry after Benghazi. He eloquently reveals what lengths politicians will resort to, to bear false witness against their neighbor. It is also said that New York is tough town, but Washington D. C. is a mean town, and Benghazi showed just how cruel and vicious politics can be to gain and maintain power.At this writing an article in the New York Times confirms what most of us suspected and Republicans denied. The attack was not well-planned or coordinated by al-Qaeda. It was a spontaneous reaction to a DVD that insulted the Islamic religion that went viral and inflamed the Muslim world. It was just as Susan Rice had said.Benghazi was and is a Republican hoax in search of a scandal..","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EWBJ3P870Q23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FZ6HWPA#wasThisHelpful","R3EWBJ3P870Q23","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a not so novel idea but a very helpful one unless you're the kind of citizen who enjoys reading entire federal bills after they are signed into law. I am not one of them and Ciaro Health Resources is betting that you aren't one of them either.These are quality, plastic-coated playing cards that offer information about Obamacare in four areas that correspond with the four suits: The spades give us the facts of Obamacare; the hearts are the patients' rights and protections; the clubs come under improving quality health care; the diamonds cover increasing access and lowering costs. In all four areas there is additional information about medicare, women's health, role of the IRS, young Americans, small businesses, the individual mandate, and much more.Each card has a cartoon that covers roughly the top third of the page. A subtitle in bold immediately follows, and that is followed by an easy-to-understand explanation of Obamacare e.g. The Ace of Spades reads in bold: Obamacare does NOT mean government taking over healthcare. It is followed by a short sentence and three bulleted items. It is like this on each card, even the Jokers, which describe the goals and where to call. There is also a blank playing card that has the all important phone numbers for: Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP), Early Retiree Reinsurance Program Center, and a Help Center for everyone else.The font looks like Universe or Calibri which are easier to read than Times Roman. It also shows me that a lot of thought went into the creation of this product.Even if you don't play cards, this deck provides useful information offering more than the average American probably knows and dispels the myths about Obamacare which have been widely reported and unfortunately widely trusted.It is information that is literally at your fingertips.Merry Christmas!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WEXK6REL8X14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0988622009#wasThisHelpful","R2WEXK6REL8X14","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At least I was busy putting up the houses that would go around the base of the Christmas tree when this movie provided ample noise background which was better than quiet--I suppose.The movie is based on the much better book, as is usually the case. The film is bland, formula-ridden, with mediocre acting and miscasting that characterized this boring and unusually long film. I was saved by the frequent commercials showing Santa trying to get me to buy a Chevrolet. William Holden played the real-life Lt. Col. Frederick who later became a major-general in the army before retiring. The real life guy looked younger than Holden, was skinny with a pencil-thin mustache. Cliff Roberston played an Irish Canadian with a brooding air and an unconvincing brogue. Vince Edwards should have stuck to playing Dr. Ben Casey. Claude Aiken and Richard Jaekel are the usual suspects called upon to military roles.By formula ridden I mean every major character is paired up with someone they initially despise and end up becoming friends. One of each pair always dies by the end of the film. There also seems to be more Thompson submachine guns in this brigade then in the entire European Theater. They all seem to be capable of shooting from the hip and each Thompson has an endless supply of bullets without changing magazines. ""Give'em hell!"" ""Let's go!"" ""Come on!"" are thrilling, novel parts of the script too. Naturally,  the Germans have to lose every hand-to-hand combat encounter.Now for the mistakes which annoy me no end in military movies. It's kind of like watching someone's napkin sitting precariously on someone's knee wondering if they will find it before it falls to the floor. The Devil's Brigade was made up of a contingent from the U.S. Army, most ""volunteers"" from various stockades around the country, and a Canadian contingent which sent their very best. So during their ""pass in review"" we see the American flag, the Union Jack and Brigade's flag. Whoah! Rewind! The Union Jack? The Canadian flag at the time had a Union Jack in the upper left corner flanked by blue field with a crest on the blue, eh?. Where was that flag, eh? How can you build expensive sets and not pay for the right flag, eh?This deserves two buckets of coal.Now it's back to the Snow Village under the tree and the figurines.

"Perhaps I was born in the wrong era. I love 40's music and my favorite is Vera Lynn, especially ""We'll Meet Again."" Her voice resonates. It has range. It's strong and beautiful. No matter which song you listen to, you can't help but be enthralled with the voice of a woman who was still giving concerts in Amsterdam in 1985 at the age of 78. The Dutch still love her. (That's right-still). Dame Vera Lynn is still alive at age 97.Her songs were perhaps the most poignant during World War II. ""We'll Meet Again"" suggests the joy and tragedy of war as the words imply that the the serviceman will return to the joy and romance of true love or that true love will only be renewed in the afterlife if he didn't return. Her voice adds to the hope that the end of war brings, and the despair of it ending with loss and grief. Choruses are a frequent part of her songs. Choruses, especially in wartime, convey a sense of community, even if the songs are individual and romantic ""from the time you say good-bye.""Unfortunately, I don't think this is the VERY best of this artist. ""I'll Be Seeing You"" is not on this album, nor is ""Lili Marlene,"" which was popular with the German as well as British troops. Nevertheless many more songs on this album are sure to relieve some stress and add some melancholy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN2WGFJ90Q4JP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HRFOBY#wasThisHelpful","RN2WGFJ90Q4JP","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Bill of Rights in the Modern State"" grabs you just by the titles of some of the chapters: ""A Threat to Liberty,"" ""Free Speech Now,"" or the ""Politics of Distrust."" Edited by Geoffrey R. Stone, Richard A. Epstein and Cass Sunstein, they have selected many essays that explore our bill of rights in depth I never thought possible. Here's an example from the chapter ""Women's Wrongs"":""Christianity has been a primary--in many women's lives the primary--force in shaping our acceptance of abuse. The central image of Christ on the cross as the savious of the world communicates the message that suffering is redemptive. If the best person who every lived gave his life for others, then, to be of value we should likewise sacrifice ourselves. Any sense that we have a right to care for our own needs is in conflict with being a faithful follower of Jesus. Our suiffering for others will save the world.""Is it any wonder that women were not allowed to claim self-defense if they killed their abusive husbands when they were not in physical danger at the moment they did? Is it any wonder that women are still seeking to be treated as equal citizens under the law?The authors often cite Supreme Court cases analyzing their conclusions and their precedents as they also examine social reality, religious principles, legal foundations and how they have meshed or morphed into our perceptions and legal processes.This is not light reading. It is also a reference book that might be pulled off the shelf many times over the years. Mine is already inundated with different color tabs and extensive highlighting of passages.

"The ""Creative Training Techniques Handbook"" is one of the very best books on delivering effective training there is on the market.The author emphasizes that adults must be handled with kid gloves, which means that the instructor or training specialist must respect their opinions, attitudes and previous learning experiences that may run contrary to what is being taught.  Actually taught is a bad word.Pike also believes that the training specialist's job is one of facilitation. He calls it instructor-led participant-centered training. This is a common belief in training that people have the intuition to arrive at a solution or develop their knowledge on their own with only guidance and by keeping them involved.By involved the author means keep them writing, keep them creating, and keep them visualizing right down to drawing pictures. This means that lecture never gets more than 15 minutes before participants are engaged in some kind of learning exercise, and exercises are characterized by what he calls C. P. R. which means keeping the content relevant, allowing for adequate participation, and finding ways to review and reinforce key points.His book covers every imaginable event involved in the training experience. This version covers recent training developments such as webinars and eLearning.  Bob even covers such things as the opaque projector, which for the most part was last used during the Eisenhower Administration and still requires a team of mules to move one. He even covers how to use a slide carousel (Kodak made the last one in 2004), and how to apply more than one film on overhead projectors. Actually, he offers too many essentials to be named here, but suffice it to say that anyone embarking on a career in training or simply having been assigned to facilitate training would do well to read this book and make it as important an item as their wallet.Bob Pike is one of the most recognizable names in training. He can charm the socks off professional training specialists (who can be a very tough audience). He dazzles a room full of them, and is particularly impressive showing them how to increase their memory skills in one 15 minute exercise.I have 25 years of training experience and I am already treating this book as a training bible.Turn to the Book of Bob.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HOOF9KMCVZN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0874257239#wasThisHelpful","R22HOOF9KMCVZN","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Book of Steak is for the man who won't settle for anything less than some form of dead animal on his plate. The paragon of animal is the sacred cow that made the supreme sacrifice for my dining pleasure. It is for the man whose mouth waters at the words dry rub and fiery horseradish sauce or red wine marinade.The book starts out telling you about buying, freezing and storing, and organic vs. grass fed. It then shows you a cow's profile and where the cuts are. Cooking times follow telling you how long from rare to the (Gawd awful) well done. Then comes the prize, the chapters in cuts: front cuts, rear cuts, steaks for two, and sauces and sides. Each page contained therein give you the ingredients on the left, along with prep time, cook time, and how many it feeds. The instructions never exceed more than five steps. The right side of the page is finished product in all its glory, sometimes with other pictures on top showing the stages of preparation. Almost all photos are juicy rare or medium rare.

"Just as the king declared that Mozart had too many notes in his music, many cookbooks have too many ingredients, require too many exotic cookware or utensils, herbs and spices I've never heard of, or things I don't do like flambé or sauté.  Cookbooks are complicated. The U.S. Constitution isn't complicated. A five-event, four-stroke horizontally opposed engine isn't complicated. A cookbook is complicated to starve by, or enough to send you running to Thai Tanic's Bang-Bang Chicken House.The Ultimate 4 Ingredient Cookbook never requires more than four ingredients. It tells you what to do with little dots to the left of each bit of instruction. (I like that. It helps me keep my place). And whether it's for breakfast, lunch, dinner, salad, sandwiches, bread, beverages, soup, appetizers or desserts, there's never more than four ingredients except for the index, but who cares? You're not going to prepare index.For the indifferent cook, the man who cooks indifferently, or for the cook whose guests suggest pizza or Chinese every time you threaten to cook for them, this is the book. It's for the man who doesn't feel like making a lot of food, dirtying a lot of dishes, and for the man who has absolutely no pride in his cooking. I'm guilty on all counts.Next is the orange-sauced spare ribs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZBN5MV7X4QGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931294372#wasThisHelpful","R1ZBN5MV7X4QGY","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Men, are you tired of cooking the same old crap, night after night, the same drippy vegetables, that same dried-out chicken, that overcooked beef or fish? Are you tired of trying to pick up things only to get home to find that you forgot a missing ingredient? Are you tired of cookbooks that tell you to use a shallot of this, or a kale of that when you don't even know what a shallot means or what a kale is? You throw up your hands and put the book back on the shelf only to collect dust again. Well, not with this little baby.This book could have been subtitled ""for the biggest bachelor dummy of them all."" (I think it was written just for me). Each page shows you the products you will need. Do you need beans or pineapple? It will show you the can of Goya and DelMonte and tell you the size. Don't know what a shoulder steak looks like? No problem. It shows you a picture of a shoulder steak. The contents list easy to prepare, easy to find ingredients by beef, chicken, pork, fish, beans, noodles, veggies, fruit and beer. That's right, you can even make BBQ Beer Ribs or even Mexi Can Pie. Now how can you top that?You can make exotic dishes in a flash. Buy a 6oz. can of Dole Pineapple juice concentrate, 2, 5oz. cans of Dole Pineapple chunks drained and one boneless pork loin (3lbs.), follow the instructions and you've made Pineapple Party Pork for yourself. It will tell you how many it serves, how many calories, grams of fat, carbs, fiber and sodium. There's 99 other recipes that don't require a lot of reading or ingredients. It's just you, a man and his stove/oven.But you must keep this in your car. Keep it in the glove compartment ready for action the next time you pull into your local supermarket. Keep it right above that other book you don't read--the owner's manual. This is a man's man recipe book.

"Okay, I'm crazy--crazy about training. I'm just crazy enough to have packed this into my carry-on for my vacation to Las Vegas, and to have read it in my hotel room sipping overpriced coffee. The book is actually one of the best on training I have read. Why? It's one of the more thorough ones that encompasses most of the stages of training that the actual training specialist will experience.Those stages go by the acronym, A.D.D.I.E. for analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. Saul Carliner, the author, goes into detail of the first three which really constitute 90% of a training project. He adds important remedies to common stumbling blocks such as how to get cooperation from the sponsor, the subject matter expert, and more importantly how to go about identifying the performance discrepancy. The author also uses this space to expound upon adult learning theory, which is critical to getting learner ""buy-in."" (We don't teach people as much as facilitate their learning).The design and development phases usually intimidate those who have to write them. I've observed it many times. The author provides checklists to help the instructional designer avoid getting swamped in the project. He was even more thorough in going through the do's and dont's of creating visuals and manuals that support the instruction. In fact, this is the best information I have seen anywhere.While there are four levels of evaluation, the author covers three--reaction, learning and work transfer, mainly because most of us never get to practice step 4--measuring results e.g. fewer accidents, more customers, less spoilage, etc.I was quite impressed with this work. In his 10 chapters, the author identified several problems and bumps training specialists face and how to deal with them. Few other books I am aware of do. He has asides, such as 39 Basic Rules and another called ""Think About This"" that contain important little gems, and, well, rules that should never be broken. Questions followed each chapter to reinforce learning and additional sources are provided in the back.He wrote this for A.S.T.D, which is the American Society for Training and Development (even though he's Canadian, eh?)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HK2TRYVDGQXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1562863487#wasThisHelpful","R2HK2TRYVDGQXX","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here are 400 brilliant color photographs spanning 19 chapters of varying themes. Chapter titles such as Methods of Thinking, Building our Country Through Diligence and Frugality, and Serving the People point to a highly regulated life from birth to death. The posters show one person, a family or community of them or in the hundreds, smiling or with expressions of steely resolve. Either expression portrays confidence, love of country, communism, or Mao whose image appears apparitional and dominates the cover as the embodiment of a people's spirit.Red is the predominant color and strangely, many of the figures look surprisingly, almost western. Exceptionally few characters are depicted wearing eye glasses as if it is a sign of moral or physical weakness. Most certainly everyone is handsome, gorgeous or downright cute even in middle age or elderly characters. No one looks anything less than benign but never homely. Judging from the book, the Chinese are easily the healthiest and most beautiful people on earth with their square jaws, strong features and dazzling smiles who want to hunt down the imperialist aggression of the United States and the running dogs who follow them, er, us.What is revealing is how a culture sees itself or itself as an ideal.  Mao Zedong appears messianic, and all the people are happy following their duty to advance communism from the non-privacy of their homes to throughout the world.The book is a heavy tome of high quality paper, several hundred mils thick, and is written with English, German, and French text and translations. It is a book that should be seen, as much as read, several times to gain some insight into a culture that is thousands of years old and was conquered and ravaged for centuries. Communism in that country appears to be an outcome of both and a determination that the last invasion of their country would be the last one.These are pictures of a waking giant.Thank you, Helmut.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6CM73AWRC6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3836531089#wasThisHelpful","RS6CM73AWRC6A","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the early evening hours of April 19, 1988, a 28 year old investment banker named Trisha Meili was jogging in Central Park when she was attacked and brutally raped. Several suspects were brought in for questioning who described their activities that night as ""wilding,"" slang for making mischief in the form of assault, robbery and general hooliganism in the park. With the young woman in a coma and not expected to live, the five Hispanic and black youths were quickly rounded up by a Police Department that was under pressure to find the hoodlums and bring the case to justice.Adding fuel to the fire was Donald Trump, never missing a moment for self-promotion, put out full page ads in the major New York newspapers calling for a reinstituted death penalty. Former Mayor Ed Koch helped contaminate the jury pool by saying in front of the camera ""we have to call them suspects"" implying that it was a nicety applied to the guilty. Even the mainstream media jumped on the bandwagon publishing the names and the addresses of the suspects, even those that were under-age. Minority newspapers retaliated outraging white New Yorkers by publishing the name of the victim.  The pictures of the guilt- and shame-ridden faces revealed their guilt to everyone white. It was a D.W. Griffiths nightmare-- the evil black men were raping ""our white women,"" just as portrayed in the movie that glorified the Ku Klux Klan a hundred years earlier.Interrogated hour after hour, each suspect was worn down from the coaxing and cajoling, finally admitting to the crime or implicating someone with them in the belief that they could go home if they just confessed. The parents, as ignorant of the judicial process as their offspring, encouraged them to confess. To their surprise indictments followed, but that was only part of the nightmare. One parent hired a divorce and real estate lawyer to defend her son. One of the defendant's lawyers slept threw some of the testimony.  And while judges in criminal cases are generally chosen by the name falling out of a tumbler, a judge was assigned to the case, a judge who had the reputation for siding with prosecutors. Couple all these phenomena with the power of confessions, the fate of the defendants was sealed even though the D.A. had no physical evidence that put any of them at the scene of the crime.Fate, career and relationships often turn on coincidences, and sometimes justice does too. It is clear that the five would have served out their entire sentences because they were unwilling to admit to any parole board that they committed the crime. But one of the five saw Matias Reyes, another inmate in prison. Reyes sensing trouble from their previous meetings on Rikers Island was surprised when he held out his hand to Reyes in friendship.Now for the confession that really mattered. Touched by the offer of friendship, Reyes confessed to the crime, and gave New York City detectives details that weren't released to the public. The real coup d' grace was that his D.N.A was a perfect match to that found on the victim. A timeline search by reporters discovered that the Central Park Five could not have been in the same place as the jogger who followed a routine workout and route schedule.The five were set free and tell their story here. Ken Burns once again demonstrates his talent for documentaries that is sobering, shameful, enlightening.  You feel the deep sense of loss that each felt at the injustice that robbed them of years of their lives. As one said, by this time in his life, he should have been married, had kids, and living in his own home. He wonders where to go to get his life back. And while any one of us will deny that our search for justice was racist, one woman who was interviewed asked: ""Would anyone have noticed if it was a black woman who was raped in Harlem?""This is powerful and disturbing.Update:Several personalities come in for a roasting which includes conservative pundit, author and lawyer, Ann Coulter who claimed in her book, ""Demonic,"" that liberals are only interested in the rule of law when it comes to protecting criminals. Coulter, of course, uses the Central Park Five as her example. Coulter wailed and gnashed the following in a column: ""Consider only the odds of a false confession leading to a conviction. If the judge believes a confession is not an expression of free will, the confession will be thrown out. If the jury believes a confession is not an expression of free will, the confession will be thrown out. If an appeals court finds the confession was not voluntary, it will be thrown out. If the police fail to read the suspect his Miranda rights, the confession will be thrown out. If the defendant lyingly [sic] claims he was not read his Miranda rights and gets some appeals court to believe him, the confession will be thrown out. If the police question a juvenile outside the presence of his parents, the confession will be thrown out.""Not so fast, Goldilocks!1) There are plenty of examples of people making false confessions and being convicted.2) Confessions are a powerful influence with juries. In many cases juries will ignore or dismiss evidence that contradicts the confession. This jury did with the exception of one who held out until he was browbeaten into changing his verdict.3) Coulter ignores that Reyes' DNA was a perfect match with semen found on the jogger.4) As one blogger wrote the Police videotaped the confessions, not the questions.5) The Police treated this almost as a murder, having homicide detectives investigate the case instead of sex crimes detectives.6) The Police discovered the DNA several years before and did nothing about it.Donald Trump tweeted ""What were the Central Park Five doing in the park?"" There are two possibilities: a) they had no business being in the park because they're black and Hispanic, which makes perfect sense if one thinks like a racist, or b) it was none of Trump's  business. He deleted his tweet shortly after. It looks like the Donald wanted to be thought of as a ""b"" rather than as a first class ""A.""Matias Reyes went on to rape more women and even killed one in the time of the arrest of the Central Park Five and their incarceration.Mayor Bloomberg refuses to settle a lawsuit brought by the Central Park Five. Could it be if the city did, they would or could be sued by the families of Matias' other rape victims?","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NECTBPPVD5F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZMFG48#wasThisHelpful","R2NECTBPPVD5F9","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was this one or another one in rose gold that sold for $52,000 that was guaranteed to the year 2400. But I soon realized that I might not be around for another three centuries, and even if I was, the watch maker might not be or wearing watches might not be in vogue or even necessary. I decided to go with the lesser expensive Citizen Men's CA0313-07E Sport Eco-Drive Chronograph Watch and never looked back. Actually, all I had to do was see this watch in the case and the decision was made before the lady allowed me to try it on.It's smart looking. Rose gold gives a beautiful finish to a watch that is versatile enough for black tie or shorts and sandals. There are four black screws at each corner that add a nice contrast to the gold case and the black face. The very dark brown leather band is thick and likely to last longer after water immersion than my last Citizen Eco-Drive leather band did. The clasp is also in rose gold with the word ""Citizen"" engraved in it.The Eco-Drive feature means this one will probably not end up in my drawer as other watches have whose batteries have died. The Eco-Drive recharges automatically when it is exposed to any light, indoor as well as outdoor. It would have to be in the dark for 6 months before it would stop working. A resumption of light would get the hands moving again.A chronograph is also a must for me. This has a stop watch feature and will continue for one hour--usually all I need. While I wish the watch had a rotating bevel, the beauty of the watch more than compensates for what it lacks.A watch is a matter of personal taste, so take a close look at this watch enlarged and decide for yourself.If you're like me, you might even just watch your watch for awhile.Update:I bumped this review from five stars to two stars.The band wore out within a year and the stem fell off. What is worse is Citizens' service. I sent the watch to them for repair in March. Now it's June, and they claim they only sent it out yesterday Apparently they didn't have the band in stock and it appears it came from overseas (by canoe).When I spoke to Jack, from customer service last week, he told me he would call me the next day. He didn't.Oh yes, it cost me $120.00 for the repair.

"""Thiagi's 100 Favorite Games"" provides exercises or icebreakers that can be used in a variety of training topics from communication skills to even workplace violence. There is no expensive or cumbersome equipment involved. Most exercises require little more than flip chart or ordinary paper. So how important are these ""games"" for use in training?Most studies show that the first few minutes of a speech, presentation or training are critical in capturing and maintaining an audience's attention, otherwise known as breaking the ice. Failing to do so mean the audience's attention spans might not rally for another 30 minutes. By then, the purpose or relevance is lost on most people whose minds are now engaged in what to do with a winning Lotto ticket. Interactive training is critical for learning--'to be a guide on the side rather than a sage onstage.""Some have resorted to games and gimmicks to capture attention which for the most part works. However, many perceptive participants have also been aware of this ""ploy"" and arrive late knowing they have missed nothing more than a game. That makes it critical that the trainer is able to capture attention and make it meaningful and relevant to the training and not personally embarrassing. (I read where one trainer who asked everyone to stand on their chairs. The woman who wrote the article was the only one who did it)!The author, ""Thiagi,"" as he is called, because no one can remember or spell his given name Sivasailam Thiagarajan has been around training for decades. He has written 40 books on training, articles for training publications, and is frequently quoted. His amiable, Ghandi-like, appearance belies a wry, rapier wit that appeals to the toughest audience of all--other trainers.  I have been one of those audience members when he demonstrated with a $10 bill how far people will go once invested in a bad decision. My favorite was how to create leadership training in one day with no preparation at all.Its human nature to get stale through routine, to use what once worked long after it lost its originality.

"""Lincoln"" seems to be a slow start but rapidly picks up momentum of a man trying to end the bloodshed of a Civil War and add a 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution before the South surrenders and is readmitted to the Union. Does President Lincoln negotiate their surrender now, saving countless lives, but also guaranteeing that a represented South will surely kill any chances of the passage of the amendment, an amendment that abolishes slavery? What President Abraham Lincoln doesn't know is that he is in a race against time because this film takes place in the last few months of his life.In order to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, the president must get the votes. We witness horse-trading, deceit and intrigues at its finest or ugliest, to get the two thirds majority required for the next step in the process.Daniel-Day Louis is in the title role and wins an Oscar for his performance. He offers us the same high voice that Abraham Lincoln was reported to have. He frequently reverts to his folksy charm during serious or heated discussions with a story or anecdote. He is an adoring father to both his sons, but especially the younger Tad who in real life had a cleft palate that was so bad his food had to be specially prepared so he could chew it.Steven Spielberg gave us many more superb performances from Sally Field as the bi-polar Mary Todd Lincoln, the 16th president's wife. Often seen but still under-rated David Strathairn plays his politically-savvy Secretary of State William Seward. Bruce McGill plays Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, and has one of the most memorable lines in the film: ""No, you, you're not going to tell another story,"" as he stalks off out of earshot of a Lincoln yarn. This ensemble cast continued with Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, a staunch abolitionist from Pennsylvania. Hal Holbrook plays a Republican politico who tries to end the war.What you get from Steven Spielberg's direction is attention to detail, right down to the White House wallpaper. You also get extra, perhaps too much extra. Critics say that the film's ending would have been better if we just saw Lincoln walking down the hall, on his way to Ford's Theater. If that had been it, we wouldn't have seen Todd Lincoln scream when a man announces to the audience that the president was shot. The final scene of revisiting Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address added little to the film.Still, you get the two most important events that make a great story, a taut, intelligent script delivered by unparalleled acting.P.S. This movie is history which always drives me to find more, and my focus was on Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones' character), representative from Pennsylvania.  He was living with his black housekeeper for a number of years. He adopted her sons, and offered her a choice of $5,000 in one lump sum, or $500 a year for ten years in his Will. When he died his body was placed in the Capitol Rotunda where he had a black honor guard. 40,000 mourners came to pay their respects; 20,000 were black. He chose to be buried in a cemetery that would not discriminate against the souls buried there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PNITRL2NJL8O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009AMANBA#wasThisHelpful","R3PNITRL2NJL8O","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"In the world of business many mistakes, miscalculations and failures, training is seen as the problem and the solution, but author and training consultant Jean Barbizette demonstrates in clear, straightforward language the need for a sound needs assessment to avoid the pitfalls of going off in the wrong direction that will cost time, money, and productivity. Training is a solution, not a problem unless it is misused. She insists that a needs assessment must consist of three steps: gathering information, analyzing information, and creating a training plan. That means basic questions of who, what, why, where, when and how must be answered in seven analytical processes:Performance analysis: what are they doing wrong and identifying the most cost/effective solutionFeasibility analysis: essentially is it worth it--why should the training be doneNeeds vs. wants analysis: perhaps the greatest pitfall of all--why should the training be doneGoal analysis: what specific behavioral improvement is requiredJob/task analysis: what is the best way to do a task and how to break down a task into its partsTarget population: analysis who must be trained andContextual analysis: when and how to deliver the trainingWhile these analyses might seem daunting to the training neophyte, there are a number of templates that will guide the person through each process. I found a simple four-box matrix of Will/Won't Do's, Can/Can't Do's as a means of instructing others in when training is and isn't appropriate, to be most helpful.

"In an ever shrinking global village language is crossing out borders with ever greater frequency. Being able to say Volkswagen or Wiener Schnitzel does not qualify as being able to speak ""a little German."" You must be able to speak in sentences and be able to say more than ""I have a red pencil box"" or ""I would like a second helping please."" ""German in 10 Minutes a Day"" will help you do that but I can pretty much guarantee 10 minutes a day will not be sufficient. Learning a language will take incessant practice and a fierce lack of shame in making big mistakes. This book provides you the tools for practice and the means to communicate in two of the four German cases--nominative and accusative. If John F. Kennedy had this, he would have said, Ich bin Berliner, instead of Ich bin ein Berliner.Pictures are coupled with words that are spelled in German and offer a phonetic pronunciation. The definite article accompanies each word, which is important as the German article can change with each noun and in each case. The author often combines English with German to enable understanding although this can be misleading as German syntax differs from English greatly e.g. Sie haben just finished your abendessen und Sie möchten die Rechnung. (You just finished your dinner and you would like the bill). In fact, I would not have asked for the bill this way, but would have simply said ""Zahlen bitte!"" once I had the waiter's attention. As far as syntax goes, the reader would do well to remember the wise words of Mark Twain who was asked why he didn't leave the German-speaking play if it was so bad. He said he stayed to the end so he could hear the verb. So if you wanted to say, May I have small change, you wouldn't say, Darf ich habe kleingeld? You would say, ""May I small change have,"" or ""Darf ich kleingeld haben?""There is a useful dictionary but parents are eltern, not akzent which means accent. American is described only as one American male (Der Amerikaner) with no provision made for an American woman (die Amerikanerin), American women (die Amerikanerinnen) or Americans in the plural (die Amerikaner). Nevertheless, the dictionary is useful with the corresponding pronunciation tips that remain pretty good. Flash cards with German on one side and their English translation are helpful. There are also sticky labels for furniture around your home or to annoy other family members but at least they will soon associate spiegel with mirror and kühlschrank mit refrigerator. Add Google Translate to ensure you pronounciation is correct.What I found most helpful, besides the dictionary was the list of items on the menu. After all, you always want to know what you're eating or what you ordered. Unfortunately, it still doesn't tell me how to order ""eggs over easy,"" und ""spiegelei über einfach"" just doesn't work.Your electronic notebook, I-pad or smartphone might be able to translate for you, but it can never replace you being able to instantly answer in German ""What truck?"" or translate ""Look out!"" into German. It will be too late in all instances.Fünf Sterne!P.S. The beauty of the German language is that it shares so many words with English: auto-car, baby-baby, sofa-couch, lampe-lamp, glas-glass, kaffee;-coffee, usw-etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF58KOWO4UZ3A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0944502202#wasThisHelpful","RF58KOWO4UZ3A","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Barnes & Noble Bargain Book Shelf scored again when this book made itself visible. It is divided into four chapters of 100 words each: 1)Words Every High School Freshman Should Know 2) Words Every High School Graduate Should Know, 3) Words Almost Everyone Confuses & Misuses, and 4) Every Word Lover Should Know.I breezed through the first two chapters in 180 pages fairly quickly, disappointed and grateful I didn't find any words there for which I was unfamiliar. The third chapter was a bit more interesting as it explained the differences between affect and effect, fewer and less, complement and compliment. I was still grateful as a sense of competition grew with each passing page. I wanted desperately to find this book to be worthless and feel cheated, that I had totally wasted my money. But then, like a barely audible susuration words began to appear that I didn't know and that I couldn't even pronounce--syzygy. Sesquipedalian appeared, then sangfroid and schwa. I even read what schwa meant and still didn't understand it, and these were only the ones that started with the letter ""s!"" Learning about ulage became a visceral vicissitude. At least I knew laconic and nudnick.But there were no words like teluric or limned. There was no holodomor, eleemosynary or munificent, words I had learned a hundred times and forgotten an equal number of times. Where were Pathos, Ethos, Athos, and D'Artangnon?For making me happy that I knew most of the words, I give this book four stars.

"I bought the Haggar expandable waistband straight fit in khakis for four reasons: 1) they are 100% cotton so they breathe, 2) they require little maintenance, easy to iron with a permanent crease, 3) they can work with a navy sportscoat or just plain casual wear, and 4) the expandable waistband in case you find yourself in an all-you-can-eat lobsterfest.Once you find a pair that doesn't go under your shoes, without a tight inseam, don't wrinkle up across the same, won't be four inches above the ankles after washing, you end up with a superior pair of pants that should last years without fraying at the pockets or the bottom of the legs.Just make sure you know your size and how they fit before you buy here because there's nothing worse than ordering them, trying them on, finding they don't fit, and sending them back.I heartily recommend buying Haggar pants.

"I believe it's better to have fewer clothes of high quality than more of lesser quality. You can definitely feel the difference when you run your fingers across this soft, 100% cotton fabric that feels even softer than a more expensive Ralph Lauren polo. I  bought several: light blue, red, cream, tangerine, black and yellow. These shirts wash well without bleeding and the shrinkage is minimal. I also prefer the banded sleeves, and the sleeve length which doesn't quite reach my elbows--a small annoyance I usually have tailored away with other brands. There is a discrete sized polo player on a horse that is the trademark of Ralph Lauren. (I wish I had these when I played polo before Old Flossie and Buttercup died within months of each other). I expect these shirts to serve me well in my new sport, the most  noble game of golf, or for casual wear in most summer social occasions, for several years.The Amazon price is several dollars lower than the $75.00 I paid for each at Macy's, but I had the benefit of being able to feel the material I was buying that you will not have in this venue.I anticipate looking great on the golf course as I slice and hook my way through 18 holes, or just getting the cart stuck in the swamp.

"In 75 chapters that read like three- to four-page essays, author Jerry Weissman manages to cover the gamut of the presentation from structure, voice and body language (even what to do with your hands), handling questions, how to answer them, producing PowerPoint slides, and many more topics and nuances of making a presentation.I was particularly intrigued with his chapters on PowerPoint slide creation and integration. PowerPoint was supposed to succeed the flip chart and the overhead projector, and it has. With all its bells and whistles, it was supposed to make the presentation better, as if a better car will make a better driver.  Only one must always believe in the power of a human intervention to make it worse.I was most impressed that Mr. Weissman eschewed the use of Times Roman font in favor of Helvetica because of its clean lines and lack of seraphs. (It's the standard font used for NYC subways trains so the commuter can make a more rapid identification).  He is against wrap around text and too many lines on a slide. Of real interest was his suggestion that the presenter stand to the left of the projected image (left from the audience viewpoint) with images on the slide to the right of the text. He asserts that audiences are more comfortable with this since we read left to right. He notes that John Stewart, the comedian and political pundit deliberately sets his photo images to the left of him (again as viewed from the audience) which is uncomfortable for the viewer who must start from the right and go back to the left only to read right again. Since Stewart's comedy is political and personal, it is exactly what he wants to achieve.While that is almost imperceptible, the rest of what the author professes isn't. It isn't rocket science, but many people ignore their intuition of what is good and bad, what works and doesn't, what is right and wrong and continue to make mind-numbing, irritating, underwhelming presentations that make audience after audience want to flap a napkin, or worse, resort to violence. Oh well. It's what keeps Mr. Weissman writing books and it helps keep me in my job.There are literally dozens of helpful hints that will improve the reader's presentations skills even if developed one or two at a time. Buy the book, read the book, and learn from the book.Do it for your audience because I might be a part of your audience, and I'd rather pay attention to a good presentation than poking Talking Tom on my cell phone under the tablecloth.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FVNBFV3J8TDM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0133121070#wasThisHelpful","R2FVNBFV3J8TDM","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That should be a warning to not buy this movie or even rent it. In fact, don't waste your time even if you can see if for free.Husband is separated from wife. Husband gets weekend with children where the younger daughter spots a box her daddy buys for her at a yard sale. There is an ominous warning from a bandaged person in the window beyond who watches the purchase. The girl figures a way to open the box, and soon there is a voice that starts talking to the girl, who in turn, starts acting strangely. Daddy doesn't understand and mommy thinks daddy is abusing their little girl. In desperation, daddy takes the box, which incidentally had Hebraic writing carved in it, and takes it to the Hassidim Community in Brooklyn for answers and solutions.Taking it into a temple, the other religious men in their shtreimel and rekels gasp and step back as if Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is daddy, has just released the Bubonic Plague. The grand rebbi says he cannot help him. He pronounces it an evil box used to constrain some evil spirit that was evil in humanhood, and it will kill his daughter. But the son waiting outside says it is his obligation as a Jew to help, and the two drive back upstate to get the evil spirit that is taking over daddy's little girl. A Jewish exorcism begins.With daughter sounding odd, rolling eyeballs, levitating, snd smacking mom and dad around a room in the basement of a hospital where the lights go on and off like some kind of light show at Studio 54, our Hassidic hero in shawl and yalmulka is bowing repeatedly saying some kind of exorcism ritual to take that evil soul out of the man's daughter. Ahhh-beeeee-zoooo, he yells continually.The Possession might possess you in an evil sort of way. It might make you want to put this director and script writer into a little box--for eternity.

"One hopes for a return of a great story when they make a sequel. It doesn't happen here.All the actors are back except for the rich husband who is now breaking up with Bryan Miles' (Liam Neeson) ex-wife, played by Famke Janssen. Miles suggests she and the daughter played by Maggie Grace join him in Istanbul after his little security gig is over. Of course, neither of them learned their lesson about staying home the first time and they surprise daddy in Istanbul so this plot can continue.Sure enough they are followed, chased, fight and are captured i.e. Liam and Famke are caught by the family and extended family of the evil pandering, slave-trading, corrupt no-goodniks from Tripolie (pron. Tri-pool-ya), Albania who he killed in Paris in the first film. They manage to find out who he was by beating the French cop, and then by paying off someone in Tirana to find out where he was. As luck would have it, just over the border.With a secret cell phone, Neeson manages to call his daughter who is hiding in the hotel from her would-be captors. She refuses to save herself and bravely states: ""I can do this, Dad.""A 10th grader could have written a better story which held no surprises, hokey dialogue and implausible scenes like Liam talking to his daughter on his cell phone while he has a gun on someone and they have guns on him and his ex. They just stand there! Even the Krav Maga and Hapkido scenes were hard to follow and that 50 caliber machine gun would have split that car down the middle faster than a buzz saw.You might ask several questions, as I did. How did someone in Tirana know that Bryan Miles would be in Istanbul? How did his captors not find the mini-cell phone? Why were their captors leaving them there tied up, to marinate? How come his ex-wife didn't scream at him at the end for asking her to join him in Turkey? How come this director wasn't traded to the Albanians for some future player to be named later?This movie needs massive resuscitation. Only Liam's acting skill and his ability to portray a loving tender father and ex-husband while schizophrenically opening a severe can of whupas give this film a faint heartbeat.My advice is to stay away from Taken 2 or you will be had.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IM64517E2U3G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0067EKYAY#wasThisHelpful","R1IM64517E2U3G","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had two reservations about this movie. One was the acting of Ben Affleck after I had seen him in ""Changing Lanes"" and two, ""based on true events,"" which essentially means they used a real story to make their own story.The ""story"" starts out with the American Embassy being overrun by a mob in 1979. Six diplomats escape and hide in the Canadian Embassy while talking heads in the State Department at Foggy Bottom try to figure a way to extract them. Enter Ben Affleck as Tony Mendez, a CIA agent, who hatches a scheme to go into Iran under the guise of a Canadian crew looking for locations to shoot a sci-fi film. It has to be realistic so he seeks out a costume and make-up designer played by John Goodman with whom Mendez had a real life friendship. They manage to enlist the aid of a Hollywood producer played by Allan Arkin. They also need press, so they throw a party for their movie, Argo. It gets written up in Variety.Armed with magazine articles, cartoons, phony biographies, business cards and a fake Canadian passport, he spirits his way into Iran and to the Canadian ambassador's residence. We see photos of citizens not true to the revolution being hung from crane equipment and in other modes of terminated wellness conditions. This is to build the suspense along with the one diplomat who doesn't like the idea and he gives the audience the impression of the one who will blow it if anyone does.Using a VW microbus they scout the streets of Tehran in their roles. They drive their way slowly through a march in the streets and past the screams of citizens who all seem to have had aspirins with ""Cafe Loco"" chasers of the strongest bean. When they get to the airport, all airport staff from customs inspectors to local revolutionary enforcers licensed to kill, seem to be in suspicion lock-down mode, as if they can sniff out any American behind a Canadian passport. The drama heightens here, and the whole airport scene is what is created ""based on true events."" I suspect it is the same when the American government decided to nix the operation which will practically guarantee the capture of her citizens and blow the operation in progress.One reviewer describes the adverse Canadian reaction to this picture, which places them in a minor role when they had a much more pivotal one.  He describes the Canadian ambassador appearing as nothing more than an innkeeper. Actually it appeared as a very nice Bed n' Breakfast-Lunch-and-Dinner, eh?The good news was that Affleck's acting seems to have matured. He creates a taut and gripping film thanks to his direction, cast and license that ""it's based on true events."" John Goodman's performance is subtle where Allan Arkin is better at being prickly--""Argo (blank) yourself!"" he says. It became the challenge and password of the film. The beginning of the film provides an essential ""docu-background"" of historical events that led to seizure of the embassy.You argo see it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13SCBG0UBQERU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AHTYGRW#wasThisHelpful","R13SCBG0UBQERU","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Game Change"" is not a political cliff hangar if you followed the presidential campaign of 2008 and followed Sarah Palin to the present. What makes it a cliffhanger is that this person could have been a heartbeat away from the presidency, a candidate so ignorant that she could have answered the question without qualm, is she smarter than a 5th grader.The movie begins with Steven Schmidt being asked a question on ""60 Minutes"" by Anderson Cooper, and he goes back in time when John McCain, who is running dead last in the primary, asks him to be his senior campaign strategist. We see McCain, played by Ed Harris, magically capture the Republican Party's nomination for president but well behind Obama in the polls. As his team observes, Obama is a celebrity and they decide they need the same to close the gap with Senator Obama. But who can match his charisma? They find Sarah Palin (played by Julianne Moore) and select her after only five days of vetting. She seems to have everything necessary to appeal to the conservative base, plus she is beautiful and has charisma. And can she ever speak? She dazzles the conventioneers and the campaign team when she steps out on stage and adlibs about a hockey mom being a pit bull only with lipstick.The drama begins when the campaign manager Steve Schmidt, played by Woody Harrelson discovers that her knowledge of world affairs is less than he expected. Her answer to a question from him about relations with the British gives him concern. Harrelson's reaction is almost imperceptible. His eyes narrow slightly like the driver who notices the tiny crack in his windshield and wonders how soon it will take to spread across the rest of the glass. How far does her ignorance extend? When will the press find out?The crack certainly widens as Sarah takes copious notes she cannot remember, like the squirrel that hides nuts but can't remember where he hid them. Her foreign policy education begins with information a first year history student would know. She begins to withdraw after being inundated with information and the absence of family. It explodes with the Couric interview and the recriminations against her and from her.The script portrays John McCain as a man who refuses to take the low road of negative politics, a man who wanted a campaign he could be proud of. The high point of his character is shown again when he takes the microphone from a woman who refers to Obama as an Arab. His only concession to his team is to release the story of Bill Ayers, a former terrorist. This they hand off to Palin who asks the crowds, ""Who is Obama?"" The frenzied throng calls Obama a terrorist, a Muslim, and a foreigner. When McCain asks the same question, we see his facial expression tighten when he gets the same answer. It is clearly not what he wanted to appeal to in the crowd---the hate, the racism, the hostility.As the campaign progresses Palin begin to insist on having things her own way and blame others for her shortcomings. Even the campaign manager finally tells McCain he can no longer control her, that she has gone rogue.What this story revealed was how easy it is to stir a crowd to a frenzy of hate and hostility. Sarah Palin appealed to a crowd that included hate mongers. It reminded me that this country could and can turn the stars and stripes into the jackboot of the swastika, that the greatest threat to our democracy will be the cloaked in the flag of patriotic appeal, and Sarah had the appeal just as surely as Hitler did in Germany.The performances of every actor were powerful. (Pay extra attention to the facial expressions). The screenplay and direction was equally top notch. The talents of all added to the drama and suspense even though we knew the outcome. This is high drama, even for politics.Stay to the end for Steven Schmidt's answer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SCOUBRFSRMEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007KAUZY4#wasThisHelpful","R2SCOUBRFSRMEC","A9L6L5H9BPEBO","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A9L6L5H9BPEBO?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My oldest daughter, who is eight years old, expressed interest in learning Latin, and I have been going along with it.  We picked up a copy of Getting Started With Latin, and we’ve been doing some exercises over the summer.  And then we received the opportunity to read Diary of a Wimpy in Latin.  My daughter loves the Wimpy Kid books.  She has read all of them multiple times, and we even met author Jeff Kinney at a book signing last year.The first book in the series has been translated into Latin by Msgr. Daniel B. Gallagher, who works in the Vatican Office of Latin Letters.It’s essentially the same story.  Greg- Gregorius in translation- is about to start middle school, and his journal details his trials and tribulations.  He’s a middle child, his family embarrasses him, and he’s fairly unremarkable at school.  He is, however, very funny, and his stories are hilarious- especially since his machinations end up being his undoing.  It’s refreshing to see that he is usually not particularly bothered by these setbacks; he’s not afraid to laugh at himself.  From the curse of the “Tactus Casei” (cheese touch) to older brother Rodericus’ band “Subligar Infantile Spurkatum” (Loded Diaper), middle school has never been funnier.The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is immensely popular with children, and this was a perfect choice for a new Latin translation.  There have been Latin translations of modern children’s books for years: The Cat in the Hat, Winnie the Pooh, and even Harry Potter.  But Wimpy Kid differs from the others because it offers Latin translation in easily manageable chunks, and the series is still wildly popular and easy for students to relate to.Now, my Latin experience is minimal at best- a year at prep school and then a semester in college before I decided that I loved the Classics, but it was not the major for me.  My daughter’s experience is even less than mine because she’s eight years old and we are meandering through our textbook.  But as soon as she found out about my review opportunity, she grabbed her English copy and started translating.“Oh,” she said “ ‘Puellae foetent’ must mean ‘Girls stink’!”  And she was so excited at being able to “figure it out”.I would recommend Diary of a Wimpy Kid Latin Edition. Much of the Latin is beyond our current abilities, but this gives us a goal to work towards.  This book is also good reading practice to become more familiar with pronunciation and vocabulary.  I would recommend this book to anyone studying Latin.  It’s a wonderful resource, and I’m very grateful that we had the opportunity to try it out.We received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22ZWI9DG74H6Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419719475#wasThisHelpful","R22ZWI9DG74H6Y","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been enjoying historical romance novels for almost 15 years.  I got started at the end of college, and immediately fell in love with stories set during the Regency period.Viscount’s Wager, written by Ava March was my first experience with a m/m romance, but hey, it’s set during the Regency and has two heroes.  What’s not to like?Anthony and Gabriel first connect with each other at a house party as teenagers.  Seven years later, they meet again.  Both men are at completely different places in their lives- Anthony has inherited a viscounty, and Gabriel has been recently widowed.  They reconnect in London, and Anthony, who prefers city life to country life, offers to show Gabriel around London.  Anthony is also hoping to explore the possibility of a relationship with Gabriel, based on a brief encounter they shared at the house party all those years ago.Gabriel knew that he wasn’t interested in women when he got married, and while he grieved when she passed away after a brief illness, he also felt unburdened.  This makes him feel guilty.  He also feels guilty about his fledgling relationship with Anthony, and tries to stay away, but he can’t because they have amazing chemistry together.Each man has a big secret- Anthony’ secret was unexpected.  The reader knows that Gabriel has a gambling problem, but Anthony does not.  They both react empathetically to the other’s problem, showing both compassion and openness.It’s important to remember that homosexuality was a crime at the time, so it is a great personal risk for them to pursue a relationship.  The sex scenes were really well written, with each man initially expecting something different from their lovemaking, but it’s interesting to see how this changes over the course of the book.I would absolutely recommend Viscount’s Wager.  As I mentioned, this was my first experience with both Ava March and with the m/m Regency genre.  I’m not sure what I was expecting, but I was so happy with the amount of detail and consideration for the era that went into the story.  I was also very pleased to find out that two of the couples featured in this book have their own books.  I will definitely be adding them to my reading list!I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSGFGBARPAKQB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XQVDZ98#wasThisHelpful","RSGFGBARPAKQB","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This frustrates her, because she was in the middle of solving two very important mysteries.  As soon as Araminta arrives at Gargoyle Hall, she finds herself in the middle of an even bigger mystery.  The students have been frightened away by a monster, so it is up to our intrepid detective to figure out where the monster came from and why it is causing such a ruckus.This was a very funny book.  Sometimes children’s humor relies too heavily on insults and misfortune, but Angie Sage demonstrates that wry humor can be just as funny.  Sage’s Araminta is just delightful, and reminds me of Clementine and Ramona.  Araminta is clever, and she is a loyal friend.  She embodies so many positive qualities, and although she is opinionated, she is not outright rude.I would absolutely recommend Gargoyle Hall.  It manages to be scary in a fun and campy way, without being truly terrifying.  This book is perfect for children in the early years of elementary school.  My oldest daughter just finished second grade, and she also enjoyed reading Gargoyle Hall.  We will definitely be going to the library to look for more Araminta Spookie books!I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EY69HX5W253R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1619636263#wasThisHelpful","R3EY69HX5W253R","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the interest of full disclosure, I received an ARC of this book from the author in exchange for an honest and fair review.I first discovered Rhys Bowen’s Royal Spyness series during an Audible sale last year.  It was absolutely love at first sight.  In a matter of months, I read and/or listened to all 8 books in the series- and the novella Masked Ball at Broxley Manor.Needless to say, when I received the opportunity to read an advanced copy of Malice at the Palace, I was ridiculously excited to read about Georgie’s latest escapades.  The story picks up a couple of months after the events in Queen of Hearts.  Georgie has returned from her trip to California, and barely has any time to settle down before she receives a request from Queen Mary: her youngest son, George (not the one who became King George VI- that son was called Bertie before he became the king) is getting married, and it would be wonderful if Georgie would help George’s fiancée adjust to life in England.Georgie agrees to help because one does not say no to the Queen of England, and also because she does not enjoy the company of her brother’s wife.  It pleases Georgie to no end to return to Rannoch House and announce that she is moving to Kensington Palace to help Princess Marina with the wedding.Things get awkward quickly when a body turns up at the palace.  Things get even more awkward when the woman is identified as a notorious party girl who was rumored to have been involved with Prince George.  Georgie was asked to downplay Prince George’s notorious reputation, so this discovery is quite alarming.  Once again, our intrepid heroine must step in to solve another case- in between her duties as a royal hostess, of course!I really enjoyed Malice at the Palace.  This is a solid entry in the series.  I wish that there had been some more scenes with Georgie’s sister Fig because she’s the sort of character that makes readers sigh and roll their eyes.  There were some great scenes with Queenie, who is a terrible maid, but a loyal friend to Georgie.  Of course, it wouldn’t be a Royal Spyness book without another appearance from the enigmatic Darcy, who is still madly in love with Georgie.I would absolutely recommend Malice at the Palace.  The books do a wonderful job as standalones, but once you read one Royal Spyness, you’re going to want to read all of them.  Georgie’s charm is infectious.  I would especially recommend the Audible editions- narrator Katherine Kellgren brings the characters to life.  I am always a little sad when the story ends, but I am more eager than ever to find out what happens to Georgie next- do we really have to wait for an entire year?","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHOCVHQR7GR6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQSF61K#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHOCVHQR7GR6","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My three girls love to read, so I was very excited about the prospect of reading Mr. Postmouse’s Rounds to them.  This delightful picture book was written and illustrated by Marianne Dubuc.The premise is simple: the reader is treated to watching Mr. Postmouse make his rounds through the neighborhood, which is a delightful place, with a wide variety of habitats.  Mr. Postmouse delivers to the expected forest animals, but some of his customers live in the ocean, and others live on top of a snowy mountain.  Mr. Postmouse does whatever it takes to make sure that the packages are delivered.Mr. Postmouse does not encounter any adversity along the route, although he is grateful that he doesn’t have to deliver anything to Mr. Snake!This book consists of watching Mr. Postmouse do his job, and the illustrations are what make this book truly extraordinary.  I suppose the comparisons to Richard Scarry are inevitable because they both feature anthropomorphic animals, but Dubuc’s style is her own.  The colors are more muted, and there are so many little details in each of the scenes.  All of the houses are see-through, and what is going on inside the houses is always interesting.  Mr. Bear has a pipe connecting his honey pot to the beehive on the roof.  The penguins have a bathtub full of ice cubes.  My girls especially enjoyed the rather cheeky illustration of the Rabbit family’s bathroom, complete with little rabbit pellets!There are also several cameos from fairytale friends.  These are not stated in the text.  After all, the focus of the book is on following a dedicated public servant.  No, you will only see these fairytale favorites by looking at the illustrations.I would absolutely recommend Mr. Postmouse’s Rounds.  This is a delightful book that will entertain preschoolers through those in the early years of elementary school.  My girls absolutely loved this book, and we will be getting our own copy.  I can also see this as an excellent choice for a gift book.  The book itself is the typical length of a picture book, but it will likely take you much longer to read because of all the time taken to stop and pore over the illustrations!I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189SK7NMLNQPK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MEXLAE#wasThisHelpful","R189SK7NMLNQPK","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My oldest daughter is a huge fan of graphic novels.  She is always looking for new material to read.  We’ve actually run into a problem; many of the graphic novels she wants to read are more suited to a teenage audience and the content is a little too mature for an eight-year-old girl.I was very excited about the opportunity to read March Grand Prix: The Fast and the Furriest because I knew it would be perfect for her.  We aren’t familiar with artist Kean Soo, but I’m sure she will want to seek out his Jellaby books after this.The Fast and the Furriest is broken down into three separate stories, each featuring a rabbit named March Hare whose livelihood involves racing cars.  In the first story, March participates in a race around the town.  In the second story, March assists his sister with a delivery for her bakery business.  In the final story, March participates in a rally race through the desert.One of the things that I really appreciated about The Fast and Furriest is that there is a lesson to be learned in each of the stories.  March is impulsive, and tends not to listen to other people.  Being fast is useful on the racecourse, but not slowing down and listening proves to be March’s undoing.  Over the course of the three stories, March learns to appreciate that everyone has something to offer and that simply being fast is not enough to be successful.These lessons are quite overt, but that seems to be the best approach for the target audience.  Children aren’t necessarily good with subtlety, and by approaching things directly, Soon can have the most impact.  In a way, these three stories are like modern fables- with racecars!The illustrations are phenomenal.  My favorite aspect was the diagrams of the various racecars with all of the parts labeled and the statistics for each vehicle.  My oldest daughter is a big fan of Mario Kart, so she was familiar with choosing handling over acceleration or vice versa.  Soon infuses a sense of playfulness into his illustrations, and this helped make the reading experience fun.I would absolutely recommend March Grand Prix: The Fast and the Furriest.  This collection will appeal to children in elementary school.  My daughter absolutely loved the “cool stories”, and I appreciated that the content is appropriate for all ages.  March is a likeable protagonist, and I hope that we can see more of his racing adventures in the future.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LAVUOGCICM00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623701716#wasThisHelpful","R3LAVUOGCICM00","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I first became acquainted with Jasper John Dooley when I read an ARC of his most recent adventure, Lost and Found.  I’ll be posting my review of that book after it is released on September 1st.  My girls and I enjoyed reading Jasper’s story so much that we looked for some more of his books for the library.Jasper John Dooley: Star of the Week is a children’s book written by Caroline Adderson and illustrated by Ben Clanton.  This is a chapter book, but the language is fairly simple- I’d place it at about a second grade reading level.Jasper is a young boy who goes to elementary school.  As the story begins, he is preparing for his role as Star of the Week in his classroom.  He will get to present something for Show and Tell, and he will get to do a science experiment, and he will even get to bring in a special snack.At school, his Show and Tell is pre-empted by his friend Ori’s new baby.  Jasper is very curious about babies, and wants one of his own, but he doesn’t appreciate being overshadowed.  Things get even worse when the other children are not impressed by his lint collection.Over the course of the week, Jasper learns about the importance of family, friendship, and what is really important in life.  Adderson infuses the story with sweet humor that children and parents can relate to.  There are also lessons to be learned: Jasper experiences setbacks, but he doesn’t give up.I would recommend Jasper John Dooley: Star of the Week.  This would be a good book to read out loud for older preschoolers or kindergartners, and a great read-to-self choice for children in the first couple of years of elementary school.  I also love the way this book features a little boy; there are so many books that have young female protagonists, so it is nice to see a little boy who isn’t necessarily wild or naughty like the boys in other books.  I’ve already told several of my friends with boys my daughters’ age about Jasper, and I’m hoping that this review helps even more people discover Jasper.  We are looking forward to reading more of Jasper’s books soon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PMZEDO4Y504R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1771381191#wasThisHelpful","R1PMZEDO4Y504R","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I had not heard of A Curse of Ash and Iron before I received the opportunity to review it, but I was extremely intrigued by the premise.  This is a young adult novel written by Christine Norris.As the story begins, we are introduced to Ben and Ellie.  Despite the fact that Ben was the son of the cook in a grand home that Ellie lived in, the two were best friends of children.  They were separated rather abruptly when Ellie’s stepmother fired Ben’s mother seven years earlier, but a chance meeting brings them together again.  Ellie tells Ben a wild story about being enchanted by her stepmother and forced to work as a servant in her own home.  Ben is a young man enamored with science and technology, and he finds the idea of magical enchantments to be absurd, but he agrees to help his old friend.  As they explore the nature of the enchantment, they learn that if the curse is not broken by midnight on New Year’s Eve, the effects will become permanent, and Ellie will be bound to her stepmother forever.The story is set in 1876 Philadelphia, and that was one of the aspects that attracted me to this story.  I love novels set in the 19th century, and this book did not disappoint me.  Ben’s love of technology is relevant because the world is on the brink of great discoveries; the telephone is a brand new invention, and talking to someone so far away seems almost magical.  His curiosity proves to be an asset in their quest, as is his knack for tinkering.  The 19th century setting also provides us with a glimpse into the world of debutantes and Society events.A Curse of Ash and Iron is an amazing book.  The addition of spells and enchantments provide a nice contrast to technology.  It seems inconceivable that real magic can exist in the modern world, but appearances can be deceiving.  There were some interesting twists that I did not see coming, but I think it might have been too predictable for the story to end a certain way.I would absolutely recommend A Curse of Ash and Iron.  This is a young adult novel that holds appeal to readers outside its target audience.  This is an interesting version of the classic Cinderella story with an infusion of steampunk.  I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience, and I’m looking forward to reading more from Christine Norris.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38R5WOO0K3BCR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y13JU4Y#wasThisHelpful","R38R5WOO0K3BCR","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the interest of full disclosure, I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review.I read Miss Mabel’s School for Girls almost a month ago, and immediately fell in love with the world of The Network.  Since then, I have gone on to read the second book in the series, Antebellum Awakening.  I have also read The Isadora Interviews, a novella featuring school admission interviews from some of the secondary characters.Mildred’s Resistance is the third book in the series, and it takes place before the events of MMSFG.  Mildred serves as the High Priestess in the series; essentially, she serves as the head of the government.  There are several allusions to an uprising in the past, during which Mildred seized power from a witch name Evelyn.The story begins when Mildred and Evelyn are children.  They both live in poverty, but their friendship helps them cope with the hardships at home.  Evelyn’s life changes forever when she is adopted by the High Priestess after the death of her parents.  With an elevated social status and natural charm, Evelyn grows into a beautiful young witch with great political ambitions.  Her platform is that of Elitism; she believes that it is a waste of resources to educate the lower classes.Mildred’s life takes a different path.  She receives an education at a Network School, and she also embarks on a career in politics.  Mildred does not have the same opportunities as Evelyn, but she finds satisfaction with her positions.  From the very beginning, Mildred advocates for the lower classes, and offers classes to teach castle servants academic skills and basic magic spells.Over the course of the story, Mildred and Evelyn grow apart.  Evelyn has achieved her goals through manipulation and intimidation.  Mildred has achieved hers through hard work and a genuine desire to help people.  As Evelyn’s Elitist movement gains traction, Mildred knows that she cannot allow her former best friend to trample the rights of an entire social class.  But has Evelyn grown too strong to be stopped?I have enjoyed all of the books in The Network series, but Mildred’s Resistance in the best one yet.  I love the way that Katie Cross combines a magical world with political intrigue.  I also found Evelyn and Mildred to be fascinating characters, whose experiences with poverty profoundly affected them both, but in completely different ways.  Evelyn might have controversial opinions regarding socioeconomics, but Cross does not paint her as wholly evil.  She is a shameless manipulator and she is a product of her environment, but she is also being manipulated.  I certainly didn’t agree with her political positions, but it’s easy to feel sorry for her as she becomes blinded by her own ambitions.I would absolutely recommend Mildred’s Resistance.  As I have mentioned, I read this prequel after having read the first two books in the series, and its position as the third book fits nicely with the overall narrative of Bianca’s story and the future of The Network.  I love that so many of the strong characters are female, and I love the way that magic and politics converge in the world of The Network.  I am eagerly awaiting the next entry in the series!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIC70OHMICUNX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BSIG7Y#wasThisHelpful","RIC70OHMICUNX","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had started to hear wonderful things about Serafina and the Black Cloak, so I was very excited about the opportunity to read it.  This middle grade novel was written by Robert Beatty.Serafina lives in the basement of the Biltmore Estate with her father, who works as a mechanic.  No one knows they live there, and no one knows that Serafina even exists.  She is supposed to stay hidden, but she cannot resist sneaking around at night.  Serafina takes pride in her “role” as chief rat catcher, but one night, she sees something utterly terrifying in the vast basement of the estate.  She sees a man in a black cloak chase down a little girl, and make her disappear.Serafina is spotted, and narrowly escapes with her life.  She tells her father about what she has seen, but her father scolds her and tells her that she has been dreaming.  He warns her about the dangers of being spotted- no one knows she exists- and he would be fired if they were discovered living in the basement.As the search for the missing girl intensifies, Serafina knows that what she saw was real, and not just her imagination running wild.  She strikes up a friendship with young Braeden Vanderbilt.  She has never had a friend before, but she has read about them in books.  Working together, the two children are determined to stop the mysterious man in the black cloak before he claims more victims.I loved everything about this book.  Serafina is such a delightful little protagonist; she is strong, and brave, and resourceful.  Her first encounter with the man in the black cloak provide her with not only with the determination to find out who is but also the motivation to find out who she is and why she and her father have to live secretly in the basement.Robert Beatty is a talented author.  His love for the Biltmore estate is reflected on every page; the possibility of ghosts in the historic home has been explored before, but Serafina and the Black Cloak provides us with an original look at terrifying creatures that come out at night.  Suspense builds over the course of the book, and while the mystery might be solved rather quickly by an older reader, but that doesn’t make it any less scary!  There were scenes where I found myself legitimately scared!I would absolutely recommend Serafina and the Black Cloak.  This book is considered a middle grade novel, but it holds appeal for the young adult audience and adult readers as well.  The book might be scary for some readers; I know that my oldest daughter (age 8) would be too frightened.  There is no graphic content; the scariness is mostly atmospheric.  I would compare the scariness level to Auxier’s The Night Gardener.  I will definitely be picking up a copy of this book for our family when it is released.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXFDUIG6KLPRX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY6YXPG#wasThisHelpful","RXFDUIG6KLPRX","AJLNRMQAPCTI9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJLNRMQAPCTI9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this for a discounted price of $5 for test purposes.My car is a 2007 model year and doesn't have Bluetooth or even an auxiliary port. I've always wanted to buy one of these transmitters, but every time I checked GOgroove the price was $45 and I personally never thought it was worth it. Then my spouse recently got a new car, with Bluetooth and Pandora app and all that good stuff. Now I really needed a Bluetooth transmitter in my car, so when I got an offer for DB Power BA-600 I didn't hesitate.This is a very compact device, the outside is coated in non-slippery rubber material, but feels well made and doesn't look cheap. Pairing was really easy on my iPhone 6, all you have to do is plug this in your 12V outlet, turn on Bluetooth on your phone and select BA-600. You can only select between the 3 FM frequencies, 88.1, 97.6 and 107.9. I live in the NYC area and always been skeptical of these products because there are just too many radio stations. I paired it and tried all the three stations, 88.1 was good, 97.6 was terrible and 107.9 worked the best for my location. The clarity was very good and with minimal static, almost inaudible when you play music at a reasonable volume. You press the FM button for 3 seconds to switch to another frequency and then tune your radio to that for changing stations. The other buttons are for play/pause, skip forward and backward, which also acts as volume button when held longer. There is also a USB charger port (which actually worked with my iPhone without giving any errors). It also came with a small aux cable (coiled), but I felt it was too short. There is a small mic on top of the device and voice clarity seems to be fine while making/receiving phone calls. I had to speak somewhat loud, but the person at the other end didn't really complain. The volume of phone conversation through speakers is somewhat lower than music at the same level, but you can easily adjust the main volume on the stereo and that fixes the problem.This is the first Bluetooth FM transmitter I've ever had so can't really compare it with others in terms of quality or performance.I would give it 5 stars for performance, but seeing that there are plenty of cheap choices from $10-20, its probably a 4 star as of now as its priced at $23. I will update the review few months from now on reliability.-- Update -- Oct 2015 --Now that I've used this for more than 2 months, its time to update the review. I found one obvious problem which wasn't very obvious when I got it first. So in a car fitted with Bluetooth from the manufacturer you will get calls even if you're listening to some other source, i.e. you are listening to CD/FM radio and get a call you phone will still ring and you can pick up the call using buttons on your call or system. Obviously not with this one as the system doesn't switch sources automatically. So you can only use this if you always have the source as FM and tuned into one of the frequencies. I guess that's obvious, but I somehow didn't think of it earlier. So if you want to listen to CD then this receiver is basically a charger and actually somewhat of a pain as the phone would've connected to Bluetooth and you have to switch that to speaker/phone using on screen buttons. Not a problem with this device per se, but just that any device with this whole set up will only work like this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13LK7BKK6WJUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0116VMXMY#wasThisHelpful","R13LK7BKK6WJUK","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Received the product free for an unbiased review.These are good earphones and they are very well made with a flat cable and metal housing. The sound quality is great with good bass and clear treble. I however, won't buy these for the price they are selling for, i.e. $45. I had a hard time finding a properly fitting tip and it just wouldn't stay in despite trying the smallest one. The earphones lack volume and playback controls too. My favorite budget earphones are still the Xiaomi Piston 2 (gold) for around $20 (plus they smell like chocolate).

"For the price no complaints, but its 1/2 size too large (wide and long), at least for me. If you're on the fence based on 1/2 sizes order one size down as these are not rigid shoes like work/office shoes and there is plenty of flex and room. E.g. if you normally wear 10 1/2 shoes order 10. I usually wear 10 1/2 and 11 and ordered 11 size to find it too big.

"Got this case a free review unit.The review is for the Armor Case - Mint color. This is an excellent case and my friend has been using it as her main case for more than a month now.

It has held up pretty well and for the price I can certainly recommend it. 5 stars.Update -- Aug 2015 --The mint color is coming off and it looks like its painted over a white surface.

It's the same issue with this one, so I returned this as well. If there is at least 0.8-1.0 mm lip around the edges and not just the 4 corners this is the ideal case for me. I gave 3 stars for Omaker at that price, so that makes this at least a 4 star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY2ASLCO4B653/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WU40RZW#wasThisHelpful","RY2ASLCO4B653","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As most people I'm also a sucker for buying multiple iPhone cases or in the search of that perfect case. Right now I use Zoogue, which offers plenty protection, but the red/pink colored ones get dirty very easily and hence was looking for replacement. This case is one of the highest rated in Amazon. Although a little slippery, its very well made and offers good protection on the sides as the edges are raised by 1 mm on the sides.However, the front lip, apart from the sides, are only raised by 0.2-0.3 mm and I think probably not enough to make you feel secure against all drops. However, if the front lip is raised all around and if the case is non-slippery, this probably is the best case in the market. At $10 I can only give 3 stars.

"There are plenty of reviews of this tool here. I don't think its really worth $6, may be $1. This is really just a thin metal piece with a dome sticker for grip, nothing special and I found this metal very flimsy.Advice for opening iPad (shattered digitizer) -I bought this to pry open an iPad digitizer (glass screen) which was completely cracked and shattered further upon trying to remove it. This tool was basically useless for that purpose since the metal isn't rigid enough and would just bend when I tried to pry it open.

Its smooth, gives a comfortable shave, finish feels good after the shave, nice smell and uses a pea-sized amount for lots of foam. Just be careful notto press the button or actuator too hard as its pressured and a slight press is enough for a decent amount.Nothing more to add really, just an excellent product from Nivea!FYI I use it with electric shavers (for wet use), Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5  and Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet & Dry Shaver.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4ICC7GBPON9M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BIL9HZE#wasThisHelpful","R4ICC7GBPON9M","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was in the market for a sub $50 Bluetooth earphone and took a chance with the Bluedio Q2 earphones. There were no reviews for this when I ordered the product, however there were several good reviews for Bluedio R+ bluetooth over-the-ear headphones. I thought its the same manufacturer and from photos the earphones looked decent so decided to take the plunge.Now to the actual review. I had high hopes on this earphone because Bluedio generally gets 4.0 stars or higher on their products and this was a newly release device for which the technology is fairly matured at this point.Price - 5/5I ordered it for $27.95 with prime shipping. As of Aug/2014 There are two listings for Bluedio Q2, one is sold by Amazon.com for $45.99 and the cheaper is sold by Bluedio but fulfilled by Amazon. So you get prime shipping anyway.Build quality - 4/5This is okay for the price and everything is made in plastic, expected at this price range. The flat cord is tangle free and looks durable, I mean it's a short cable since the earphone is Bluetooth. The packing was great and looked very decent for a product under $30. The product comes with a micro USB charging cable, few white ear tips and a user manual.Design and comfort - 3/5The part where they have the buttons and charger port are slightly heavier to my liking and this actually increases the probability of that earphone to fall out of your ears more. So this basically means if you're doing cardio or aerobic then this might be a problem for you. It also doesn't come with stabilizers or clips unlike some of the in-ear earphones. I wish it had the design where both earbuds are identical and with no attachments on the cord. The micro USB charging port has a plastic cover which is really hard to pull and once I had it out it was hard to push it back inside after charging. The durability of this pull-out cover is also questionable. There are no markings on the buttons, but its relatively straightforward. The big round button is the one you use to pair the device, you keep pressing it for a few seconds and select the earphone from your phone's Bluetooth device list; button on the side is for volume control. To fully charge the battery it takes about 2-3 hours and it lasts around 4 hours once fully charged depending on your use; not spectacular, but not shabby either.Sound Quality - 2/5This was the biggest negative as far as I was concerned. Some of the headphones I own and have reviewed here on Amazon are Audio Technica ATH M50s/M50x, Sony MDR10RBT, Sennheiser HD439 for over-the-ear type headphones and Apple iPhone 5 earphones, Xiaomi Piston 2, JBuds J6M, GOgroove audiOHM HF etc. for in-ear earphones. In terms of sound quality the Bluedio Q2 is closest the Gogroove audioOHM which is has the poorest sound quality among all the ones listed above. To be fair, I guess it sounds okay for the price, but in today's world where there are so many earphones/headphones competing for your money this leaves a lot to be desired. The lows(bass) and mids are may be okay (but not really) and the treble or highs are really bad. This earphone comes with a microphone, used it for a few calls and the mic and sound quality was okay for voice calls.Overall ratings - 3/5While I'm glad that this earphone doesn't cost as much as the highly rated and priced JayBird BlueBuds X Sport or the Plantronics BackBeat which sells for $130-140 it just doesn't live up to my expectations. May be I'm being a little harsh since this is one of the cheapest Bluetooth in-ear earphones you can buy, but still, sound quality to me, is the single most important attribute in a earphone. You can have all the bells and whistles, but the sound has to be good at least. Unfortunately for me, this earphone fails to deliver that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JI2P5AQ5J4DH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LA4PCNU#wasThisHelpful","R2JI2P5AQ5J4DH","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this battery (for Dell Inspiron 1420) at the end of January 2014 and as of end of July it doesn't charge. It shows 0% charge and refuses to charge. However the Dell battery meter shows battery as healthy. I would not expect this $15 battery to last more than a year and its very annoying when you unplug you laptop unknowingly or pull or trip on the cord and everything you're working on is lost. So if you're using the laptop for actual 'work' then spend more and get a proper battery. If this is a beat up old laptop for whatever use (other than important work) then may be take a gamble and you might end up with a decent battery that lasts at least couple of years, unlike mine. In hindsight I should've skipped it.2 stars since it lasted 6 monthsNow that I checked on the item detail page it says there is a 1 year warranty. I'll contact the manufacturer and update the outcome here.== Update Oct/2014 ==When I wrote the review I thought the battery died but it must have been some issue with charger or the port. The battery seems to work fine and after 10 months it still holds charge properly (well at least couple of hours on an old Dell Inspiron laptop) which is more than what I thought it would do.Upgrading it to 4 stars.One word about the warranty. When I thought the battery died I contacted Amazon and they suggested contacting the manufacturer (Tech Rover dot com). I emailed them and they never replied. So reducing 1 star for that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RMHXWMCUGYXS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003E2RRZW#wasThisHelpful","R1RMHXWMCUGYXS","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Finally bought a pair of Bluetooth headphones after reading several reviews and watching the price of a lot of them here on Amazon. Here's my take on the Sony MDR10RBT Bluetooth headphones.These were my criteria for the ideal headphone I was looking for -1) Bluetooth - enough with the cords2) Good sound quality3) Over-ear - a lot of the Bluetooth headphones are on-ear type and I really wanted over-ear headphones which covered ears fully to minimize sound leak so that I can use them on the plane and also while using public transportation4) Noise isolation and no leaks5) Stylish and comfortable6) Supports calls, i.e. have a microphone7) Good battery life i.e. > 10 hours and fast charging8) Works with the regular audio cable in case if the battery dies9) Priced around $150Sound Quality - 3.5/5This is of course subjective and what you're used to. These headphones satisfied all the above criteria, except excellent sound quality. I know people have mentioned it will get better as time goes or after 50 hours of burn-in etc. but the first week I've had this I'm slightly disappointed in the sound quality. My usual headphones are Sennheiser HD 439 and Audio Technica M50s/M50x. To be honest Sony doesn't come close to Audio Technica in terms of sound stage, especially the mids and lows, but its also half the price ($79 for non-BT vs. $169 for M50x). Sennheiser has a decent sound for the price, but is very comfortable and is my everyday beat up headphones. The sound on these Sony headphones aren't bad, its actually really good for listening to music which has predominantly a lot of highs (clear trebles). The mids are somewhat subdued and lows (bass) are not that great. May be a few weeks of usage or burn in will fix it, in that case I will update here after few weeks.Comfort - 5/5; Heat and ears sweating - 3/5This is something I couldn't find in other reviews. A lot has been written about the comfort of these headphones. The first time I put these on I thought these are the most soft, delicate, lightest headphones you can ever buy. The 'pleather' material on headband and on speakers are truly soft and they just press against your ears so softly but firmly enough for a secure fit. These were truly over-ear for me and covered ears fully (medium sized ears). However, I have one minor problem with the material. They seem to get hot rather quickly, at least for me. Any over-ear headphone with leather or pleather pads will have this problem. For reference, Audio Technica makes my ears sweat after 2 hours or so and these headphones only took an hour and I had to just lift them up and put back again. Don't get me wrong, these are super comfortable, more than any headphone I've ever used (barring foam pads), but may be something with the material, it just heats up too quickly for me.Noise isolation - 5/5This headphone fits remarkably well against your ears isolating most of the noise outside and prevents any leakage. I think because of the soft memory foam type of materials used and this actually reminds me of the suction cups. It creates almost like a vacuum when it fits. May be this also is the reason for sweaty ears and material heating up. But anyway, you can use this in any quiet place like library or noisy like planes, trains etc.Battery life - 5/5Lasts really long and at 2 hours of use per day it lasts at least 1 full week. The specification says 17 hours and I think it really delivers. Takes about 3 hours to charge fully. Bluetooth doesn't work while charging and you'll have to use the cable. The red LED indicator is nifty and shows how much charge is left, if it blinks 3 times then battery is full, 2 times half, and 1 time means low. When the battery is about to die the indicator becomes red and when it finally dies it beeps and shuts off.Style and design - 5/5Its actually made of plastics, but looks very stylish and is pretty sturdy. Do not expect aluminium and metal parts, but they actually look like it. There are play, skip up/down and a dedicated volume up/down button. The cable works when there is no battery and once you insert it actually switches off the Bluetooth and buttons. The headphone comes with micro USB charging cable, a 3.5 mm audio cable (can be inserted either way), and a carrying case or pouch.Price - 5/5Bought this for $130 and its a very good price for this!Overall - 4/5Considering everything I can recommend this headphones to anyone, but just do not expect audiophile type sound from $130 headphone. I think I did make that mistake, and it was a disappointment. I will update on the sound quality aspect after a few weeks. In almost every other aspect this is a near perfect headphone. Well done Sony.-- Edit Aug/2014 --The headphones are good for the price; the issue of ear pads getting hot is better since I've found the optimal setting for headbands so that they're not very tightly fitting. I still think the sound quality could've been better.I've also modified the pouch with Velcro Tape so that it stays closed, both the main slot and the smaller inside pocket to store the cables etc. Now the headphones and cables do not fall out and stay secure. Pouch lacks any kind of padding though and won't protect it, its just a carrying case.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7M37LKI69PXT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJISZ8M#wasThisHelpful","R7M37LKI69PXT","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Have had this router since Oct 2013 and have replaced it several times already. Amazon's service was excellent and finally I was tired of sending the product back numerous times. Its possible that I got a defective device, but after more than five replacements I can't believe I'm stuck with a bad unit. In all honesty they all behaved the same and I just couldn't find a difference between any of the units I tried.The problem is that 5 Ghz band has 'very' limited range and excellent speed. The 2.4 Ghz band has poor speed and poor range. Also switching between bands isn't seamless as I experienced from other routers. More often than not you'll have to switch the wifi on and off (on the device) to get the connection working again when you move between zones (or rooms/floors). This is just not acceptable from a $150 router. Connection via the cable is fine, but I reckon most people buy this for the wireless connection and not to just use as a $10 LAN switch.Also kept updating the firmware, tried old firmware, added extender, added huge antennae etc. but to no avail. This remains one of the worst tech products I've ever bought and such a disappointment. Every other router I've used in the past 15 years, from $10-40 has worked better than this. Asus tried to help, but it was always the same old advice, i.e.There are three possible reasons of Bad link quality or bad signal strength:1. Interference by other electronic devices that using same radio frequency2. Wireless signal is blocked by thick wall, metal door, ceiling and other obstacles3. Exceed the effective coverage range of wireless router and access point(AP)However, I wasted several days trying to troubleshoot and after replacing the units multiple times I've to conclude that this router is not for everyone. The sheer number of 1 star reviews is a testament to how bad or unreliable this router is.

"I didn't buy this for the Liftmaster brand remotes for garage door opener. Instead I bought this for a generic gate opener remote which was taking up much space on both our key fobs/key chains. Our remote didn't have any space or opening to insert this clip, so I bought Scotch Exterior Mounting Tape, which is double sided, cut it exactly as the size of the clip and attached it to the remote. The only thing is that the tape is supposed to be permanent, so there might be residue if you try to take it off. Now both our cars have the gate opener on the visor. One less key to carry around and no more juggling through several keys/remote to find it at the gate.

"I bought this to replace the standard bulbs (Philips H7 Standard Headlight Bulb, Pack of 1)I had on my low beams. These are slightly brighter and whiter than the standard fitment, but nothing to write home about. My car has projector headlights and the difference isn't much and I still find these yellow, not perfectly white or blueish, albeit definitely brighter and lighter yellow.According to Philips specifications, life time of this bulb is B3/Tc = 200/400. B3 means time at which 3% of bulbs have failed, i.e. 200 hours and Tc means around 63.2% of bulbs have failed by 400 hours. So if you drive 1 hour on an average per day using the headlight, it should last around 6-7 months or so. The standard bulbs have approximately 750 hours of lifetime, so definitely should last 3-4 times these, i.e couple of years easily. All the 1 star reviews mentioning that this bulb is yellow is true.The difference in price isn't much, $15 for standard vs. $25 for these, but you have to replace them around 3-4 times during the life of a standard bulb and now its $15 vs. $75-100. Save your money and just buy regular bulbs, they last longer and pretty much same visibility too. I went for style over substance and don't make the same mistake.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5NVSPEJON83R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00480J4PU#wasThisHelpful","R5NVSPEJON83R","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I actually bought this to punch a hole on a leather watch strap. The 2mm is perfect for that, cuts with ease and a nice finish. Also used it on a leather belt using the 3.5 and 4 mm punch. Its sharp enough for a nice finish and with some pressure you can easily punch holes.The only negative is that the punch holes are lubricated and the only way to turn or select a different punch is to literally rotate it by holding it and grease/oil (black in color) gets in to your hands and/or the material you're punching into. It's also tight and since its slippery kind of hard to rotate. Be careful if you're punching holes on a white leather or any other light colored material. I would've liked the design such that there is a knob to select the different size punch. Okay, may be that's an overkill for punch pliers!This really is a nifty tool to have in your tool box.

"I bought these as a replacement for Apple EarPods with Remote and Mic (the new ones with iPhone 5/5s) that my spouse has been using. These earphones are widely reviewed and I first came across this on a thread on Head-Fi forum (there is a 100+ page thread on these). Everything they say about this is true.

I bought it from the seller boat2014 with the symbol MI for $22.99 with free 2 day Prime shipping.Sound Quality - 5/5This is the most important aspect of any earphone. The sound is very neutral but at the same time there is enough bass. Lows aren't overly pronounced and some of you bass-heads won't like this, but once you increase the volume you get a very nice, non-muddy tight bass. If you want more bass check out Xiaomi Piston 1.0. Also the highs are a little sharper or crisp than I personally like, but its really fine. I only felt that when I first listened to it and then I couldn't distinguish it. May be my ears were used to sound from the earphones I always used. The mids are amazing and I think for this price you can't really ask for a better sound. I've had this only for a week so depending on whether you believe in burn-in theory or not this could improve over time. The point is, there is not a single earphone at this price which sounds this great. I have had Apple earphones, Skullcandy's, Jlabs J6Ms, GOgroove audiOHM, Sennheiser 300 and Bose IE2 etc. and I have to say this earphone sounds better than all of these listed. I also think the earphones are better suited for music rather than movies or audio-books or podcast.Comfort and Noise Isolation - 4.5/5The box has 3 extra tips and you can find the one that matches your ear. The one on the earphone was medium (2nd biggest) and when I tried the medium from the box I found it too small, so ended up using the one that came with it. The noise isolation is pretty good and there is hardly any leak. You can easily use this in a quiet environment like airplane, public transportation (train or bus) or library etc. The tips are slightly harder than I expected and hence it can come off your ears easier than some soft tips.Build Quality - 4.5/5The housing is made of metal and has a gold finish with three circle engraving. The cable is covered in a braided fabric, similar to shoelaces, and this prevents noise when cable rubs against your body or clothing. It comes with 3 extra tips (total 4 sets). of There is a mic and 3 buttons, for skip/volume-up/down/play/pause etc. Function of the button also depends on the type of OS and app you're using. The mic is not on the left/right cable, but at the junction of the Y cable which is slightly shorter than I would like. So its not easy to distinguish between the left or right piece and cable could've been a little longer. I compared it to a few earphones lying around and this was 2 inches shorter than most. This is one of the minor negatives I could find. There is also a metal clip, but I didn't like it and thought it was too long. The packing and case are made of amazing quality materials and I think its actually an overkill. I wish the manufacturer actually included a small pouch or carry case instead of the high quality packing.Price - 5/5If you find a better quality earphone (with mic) for under $25 please let me know.Will update the review on reliability and performance as I listen to it more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98OI260POGUK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBQ3AGO#wasThisHelpful","R98OI260POGUK","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought the same watch band on eBay for $25 and it included the Breitling style deployment buckle as well. This strap is made of quality materials and is very well made. Looks sturdy and hopefully will last long. It's very thick near the lugs and tapers towards the end. Doesn't look cheap at all. The white contrast stitching is thicker than what it should be, but its still great. I probably wouldn't pay $40, but for $25 it was worth it. I ended up changing the buckle to an Omega style buckle which is also listed under the same seller or you can find it on eBay (you have to punch holes if you want to use it with an Omega style clasp). I used the 22mm strap on a 21mm lug and it fits fine (the end/clasp is 20mm).4 stars.--- Update September 2014 ---Initially I had given 4 stars, but now the material is peeling off. I doubt its real leather because real leather doesn't peel-off the surface.

"This watch is the International version of the very popular Seiko SSC081 (Seiko Men's SSC081 Adventure-Solar Classic Casual Watch is exactly the same). I had seen this watch earlier in Costco for about $180-200 and always liked it, but never bought it. The reviews on Amazon are pretty much 5 stars and there is hardly anything wrong with the watch. I mainly wear automatics and was tired of setting the time and date on them over and over again since the power reserve on most watches don't last more than 2 days (I don't have a watch winder). So long story short, I found this on Smartbargains website for $168 with a $20 coupon and it was a no-brainer for me under $150.A lot of reviews cover the function and settings of this watch so I won't go into too much details that have already been reviewed.Positives first -1) The watch looks awesome (the watch case, bezel and crown all has a gloss finish).2) For the price I couldn't find a better looking and functional watch. It uses Seiko's Cal V172.0AG0 Solar movement.3) Solar charging part is great and I've never had to adjust time since I bought it a month back. I don't wear it everyday, but may be 2-3 days a week. The manual claims 5 hours of charging on a fair weather day in sunlight will fully charge the battery which would then last 6 months! It also mentions that normal office/fluorescent lighting is not enough to fully charge the watch.4) Second hand sweeps like automatics, but it stops after an hour since its function is primarily as a stop watch. Otherwise it stays stationary at the 12 hour. Technical specifications say its a 60-minute stopwatch in 1/5-second increments with split time measurement function.5) The hands and markers has excellent lume and is very bright at night, however it doesn't last all that long.Some negatives -1) Initially I actually liked the honey/caramel/camel/orange/light (whatever brown color) watch band it came with, the band was thick, well made and comes with a polished matte finish tang buckle. However, the strap is very long and this for me was a big negative. I don't have a small wrist by any means, but its still too long and I don't like the way it sits in the loop, especially now that the second loop has become loose. For comparison purposes, this strap is 3/4 inches longer than any other strap I have. Ended up changing the strap to a Breitling style strap Handmade 22mm Genuine Leather Watch Band Strap Alliagtor Style with Deployment Clasp for Breitling with an Omega style buckle 20mm Swiss S/S Deployment Clasp for Omega Seamaster Speedmaster. I bought both of them on eBay for a total of $54 ($25 for the strap and $28 for the buckle).2) The compass is useless, moves around all the time with the slightest of touches.3) Alarm function could've been better, but can be set to ring only once at a designated time within the next 12 hours. It's also feeble unless you use it in a very quiet environment. It also only rings for 20 seconds and to stop you can push any of the buttons.Overall 5 stars for the function, looks and price!Update - 06/30/2014The Hardlex crystal is not very scratch resistant. I already have a small scratch and I can't remember hitting the watch against anything. After reading more about the Hardlex crystal the consensus seems to be that it scratches easier than Sapphire crystal but has better impact resistance.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G092RZS299RW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008VGQM4I#wasThisHelpful","R2G092RZS299RW","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got it for our toddler and the shoe looks nice and fits well. However the shoe is now falling apart after only 1 1/2 months of use. The toe is peeling off and the stitches are coming apart. Read the 1 star and 2 star reviews and you can see the problem is exactly the same for everyone complaining. I would contact the manufacturer and see if I can get an exchange or my money back.A $40 shoe for a kid who weighs less than 30 pounds should last longer than this. 1 star considering how expensive this is.-- Update --After contacting Amazon and Marubeni corp, they made it right for me by sending a replacement pair.

"I bought this from a seller on eBay, not sure if its the same seller as here, but all items here on Amazon and eBay looks exactly the same and more or less at the same price.The buckle is very well made and fits 20 mm end side or the clasp side watch bands. So this is perfect for most of the 22mm lug side watch bands. Measure both ends of the strap before you order it to make sure. The deployment mechanism works exactly as it should and the stainless steel has a polished chrome look (shiny/glossy and not matte finish). It won't really work with watch bands that are the regular tang type with loops (unless you cut loops out). Among all the different type of deployment buckles out there, I like this one the most. It gives the cleanest fit with the remaining length of the band going inside, rather than sticking outside in the loop (and hence no need of loops). This will work with any watch band without the loops. Deployment buckles help prolong the life of your leather strap also.The buckle looks exactly the same as original Omega buckles, bar the logo, which goes for $200-300. Should be 5 stars, but $30 is still a high price for a piece of stainless steel that weighs less than 1 ounce (or 28 grams). So overall 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YGBA6GUGJQNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLYH6L6#wasThisHelpful","R1YGBA6GUGJQNM","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclosure - I received the LifeCHARGE Battery Case as a free sample. I used it on iPhone 5.First the function part. The battery case works very well, exactly as claimed. The case looks good and is well made. The original iPhone 5 battery has 1,440 mAh capacity and this one is 2,300 mAh. So technically about 160% capacity as the iPhone 5 (on a side note it just shows how poor the iPhone batteries are, even the new iPhone 5s is only 1,560 mAh; for comparison purposes Samsung S5 is 2,800 mAh, Nexus 5 is 2,300 mAh). I have to charge the iPhone at least once during the day and this case lasts at least 2 days. The 2-piece sliding case attaches to the lighting port and uses that to charge the iPhone battery and this case in turn is charged via a micro USB port (same as in the new Blackberrys', many Android devices etc.). There is a button on the back of the case with a 4 step indicator. Once you power on the case it starts charging the iPhone battery. You can also switch it off once the desired level of charge is reached. It charges the iPhone battery really fast. The specifications claim 1 hour 30 mins and I found that to be pretty accurate. The battery case itself takes about 3-4 hours for a full charge, but I think mine never ran out completely so it always charged fully in around 2-3 hours. There are plenty of reviews on the charging and battery aspect so I won't get into too many details.Now the form part. This is where I reduced 1 star from the rating (can be 2 if you're very particular). The case is 0.63 inch or 16 mm thick and that's more than twice as thick as the iPhone 5/5s (depth: 0.30 inch or 7.6 mm). Its also 16 mm longer than the phone (or 0.62 inches extra) Once you attach the case the weight also roughly doubles (iPhone 5/5s weight: 3.95 ounces or 112 grams) since the case weighs 3.2 ounces (or 91 grams). So now the end result is that we have a brick that is 16 mm thick and weighing almost half a pound (0.45 pounds or 203 grams), or pretty much the same weight as a Kindle Paperweight or a Logitech Harmony 700 universal remote. You get the idea. Your pocket starts to swell and sag at this point.I understand all battery cases are somewhat in the same size/weight range, so its more of my frustration towards Apple for not including a battery that would last 1 full day or same as any other smartphone in the market nowadays.Summary - I'm kind of getting used to not charging the phone every now and then and not worrying about the phone dying in the middle of something, especially when you're travelling without easy access to chargers. However, its just too bulky and heavy for my personal preferences. I also wouldn't buy it for the full retail price of $79.99, its just not worth it, no cell phone battery is. For me the right price is about $30 (FYI -the Black version is sold by Amazon.com for $39.99). Probably it explains why there is only 1 verified purchaser among the 45 or so reviews so far. If you are a heavy user, travels a lot and don't mind the weight or bulk then buy this.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NC2DJM28LLX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3EPXNC#wasThisHelpful","R1NC2DJM28LLX6","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm writing this review almost two years after I bought this laptop. Bought this HP laptop from Staples for $450 on a deal from Slickdeals. This would be the first time I'm buying an HP laptop, I've owned Sony Vaio, Toshiba, Apple Macbook Pro, Dell Inspiron etc. till then (and even now). All the above said laptops have lasted more than 4-7 years. Granted, some of them I've had to replace the battery, certain keys, charger etc. but all of them worked without any component just dying.HP Pavilion DM4-2191US is lightweight, looks good and came with a fingerprint reader. It only has 1 slot for RAM so if you're looking to upgrade then you have to replace it with a 8/16 GB stick. I never liked the keyboard and touchpad; both were flimsy and not very well designed and had bad layout. The display was nice even though it was glossy and had a lot of glare. The laptop was fast enough for most home/office work. Battery life was also more than I expected from laptop of this price. Wifi is a disappointment as the wifi card doesn't support the faster 5 GHz N band (only supports the 2.4 GHz).Now to the bad. Right after the first year of ownership the hard drive crashed and I lost all data. I also lost all the software since I had lost the original keys for Office 2010 and  some other cheap software. I tried to recover data from the hard drive but none of the recovery guys were able to get it done. HP doesn't ship any recovery discs with the laptop so you have to pay around $16 to order recovery discs. I ordered a new hard drive ($62) and finally replaced it. In a few months the LCD screen won't work and is just white. The computer works fine when connected to an external display. Now I'm ordering a replacement screen for another $50. I also spent money in tools, cables, enclosures, IDE/SATA connectors etc. while trying to recover the hard drive. Its just poorly made with cheap quality components and I see a lot of failures going by the reviews on HP laptops. I understand that all electronics/components are susceptible to failure.  But the way multiple parts failed and had to be replaced doesn't inspire confidence and I probably will not buy another HP.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZHX2AE0FCF0H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006F1UZYE#wasThisHelpful","R1ZHX2AE0FCF0H","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The old balcony door handle finally gave away and broke where its screwed on. Went to Home Depot and they only had the whole set including lock etc. for $20-25 bucks. Well immediately I tried Amazon app on the phone and found an exact match! $8 bucks and got it in 2 days (with Prime). Also most places had the 6 1/2 inch handles and I wanted a 6 5/8 inch one. Measure your handle before you order one. This one looks sturdy and hopefully will last years.One thing to note is that the new fasteners (screws) were slightly longer than the original ones I had. So DO NOT discard the old ones and keep it handy just in case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CJ6U692YO2EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000I19CPU#wasThisHelpful","R1CJ6U692YO2EC","A352NL60HDSUKU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A352NL60HDSUKU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My son had his first hands on experience with this toy at our State Fair which was visited by the Paw Patrol Tour. They had a tent set up with several Paw Patrol toys and this was by far the most popular toy amongst the children. The best part is that given the extra large size of this thing it can easily be shared by more than one child. It is a generous 27.5 inches long. The photos show it fitting the larger vehicles, which is does, but as an added bonus is also fits the smaller racer cars. When the patroller is closed up it can fit 3 of the larger vehicles or 6 of the racers if they are placed vertically.My disappoint is that it comes with Ryder and not robo pup.

"My daughter loves these shoes. I bought them specifically for the Princess Belle decoration. After a month of regular use the image of Belle is scratching off the gem it was painted on. I'm very disappointed. I find them difficult to get on her feet and my husband really struggles with them. Even with the velcro loosened the resulting hole to stick her foot in is not large enough. I get the majority of her foot in the shoe and then I have her stand up so her weight can force her foot in the rest of the way.At the end of the day, my daughter still loves them. That is what matters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ICG00D0TZ37/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I4VQONE#wasThisHelpful","R37ICG00D0TZ37","A35DJ5UIZVGBP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35DJ5UIZVGBP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As mentioned by others, the frame/legs are flimsy. They are a joke really. It came out of the box misshapen but forcing the copper pit in to the frame rounded it out. They are made out of thin sheet metal.The screen is also not a perfect circle and needs to be forced on to the pit. This can be very annoying mid fire when I need to forcefully pull it off the copper pit and then forcefully snap it back on.The copper bowl came dented but a quick chat with Amazon and I got 20% refunded to me for the damage.Lastly, the weather cover doesn't fit. The elastic opening is just not big enough to fit around the bowl.In case you were curious, this product is made in India.I would not buy this again. The value is not there for the price paid. The copper bowl is nice but everything else is cheaply constructed.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L0DE01S9220Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A6A3VLY#wasThisHelpful","R3L0DE01S9220Y","A35DJ5UIZVGBP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35DJ5UIZVGBP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I received this toy as a baby shower gift and my son is now 13 months. We introduced the toy at 6 months.Pros:- He likes the shapes. They each make a different sound and are different colors.Cons:- Each of the shapes can fit easily into any of the holes, defeating the purpose of being a shape sorter all together.- When you drop the circle ball into the circle hole it falls out of the square hole on the opposite side.- It is bulky and not something you can just throw into a diaper bag. I wouldn't mind this if the toy was useful, but it isn't.Overall this is an overpriced sack that you can stuff different shaped soft balls into. If you are looking for a proper shape sorter you would be better served by the Toysmith Battat Sound Puzzle Box. If you are looking for a soft toy that your young infant will enjoy and possibly learn from, try the Lamaze High-Contrast Discovery Shapes Activity Puzzle & Crib Gallery.

"I got this bottle for my exclusively breastfed 6 month old who was never introduced to a bottle as a young infant. We tried several other bottles and nipples and he would never latch.

"I spent about 15-20 minutes putting the rampway together. My 1 year old immediately started squealing in delight as cars raced down the rampway. I was so excited to see him be happy with his new toy. He loves to push buttons and get a reaction from toys so I read the box to see which parts should react to him. I was sad to find that the stop sign near the red flashing light was not working at all.I called Fisher Price Customer Service and was told that I needed to mail them the top blue ramp and the two cars the rampway comes with. In return they would send me a whole new rampway. Essentially their policy is that I destroy the toy and pay my own money to mail them parts of a toy that was broken out of the box through no fault of my own.This is the email I just got from them:Thank you for contacting Mattel regarding your Lp Wheelies Rampway.  We apologize for any disappointment or concern this may have caused and thank you for bringing this matter to our attention.We have included a United States Postal Service mailing label for the return of your item. You will need to pay the appropriate postage for your package when you take it to the post office.  It is the mailer's responsibility to obtain proof of mailing, as we will not be responsible for any items lost or not received.  To ensure that you receive service in the event that your package is lost in transit, we recommend that you obtain a receipt for postage paid.  Retain this receipt along with any remainder of your product until you receive your replacement product.Please return your Top Blue Ramp Piece And Cars to us within 30 days.  Upon receipt of your returned package, a replacement product will be sent.  This process may take up to 6 weeks.Basically Fisher Price expects me to pay more money for their broken toy and then wait up to 6 weeks for a new toy to arrive. Meanwhile my son is without his new toy that he really enjoys.Thankfully Amazon cares about its customers and I'll be dealing with them directly. They are more than happy to send me a new toy and pay for the shipping both ways. However, I thought other parents out there should be aware of just how little Fisher Price cares about its customers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VSWKPU67T4YS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005C3HOS6#wasThisHelpful","R3VSWKPU67T4YS","A35DJ5UIZVGBP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35DJ5UIZVGBP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was really excited for the Skip Hop Elbow Rest. We currently use the very popular Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue but I don't like how bulky and difficult it is to stow away between baths. This elbow rest seemed to solve all of my problems, it even has a handy loop to hang it up.Out of the package I was excited to see that it has Velcro to keep the side flaps tucked together when not in use. It also has a nice, thick pad to protect parents' elbows.Unfortunately, that is where my excitement ends. I have sliding shower doors and the flaps of the elbow rest aren't long enough to reach over the door tracks and attach to the tub wall. The elbow pad itself is only 16 inches long (6.5 inches shorter than the Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue). For me the elbow rest has two functions. To keep my elbows comfortable and more importantly to protect my son from the shower door tracks if he slips in the tub. This doesn't come close to covering the edge of the tub. I don't expect it to cover the entire tub but 1/3 of it would be nice. On the flip side are a total of 3 suction cups. 1 on the tub side and 2 on the parent side. My sons likes to take apart everything, I doubt that is enough suction cups to keep it securely attached to the tub when a toddler is involved.If I were Skip Hop I would add at least 4 inches to the length, 1 inch to each of the flaps, and more suction cups. Then they would have the perfect elbow rest.I've added photos to the customer images section. Check them out and please let me know if you find them helpful!

I can't explain the odor you experienced but can at least assure you we are chemical free.""Separately, at 11 months old my son is 30.5 inches tall and has been walking for 2 months.

"I have used this net everyday for almost a year and I can tell you it is so much more than a UV/Mosquito net. We leave it attached to the stroller at all times. It was particularly helpful when my son was very young and I was afraid of strangers touching him. We called it our old lady net.As he got older it became helpful for naps in the stroller. The top gray part folds down over the mosquito screen and completely blocks out light.The negative reviewer that states the net is difficult to attach is incorrect. There are no instructions included so I can see how it could be confusing at first. However,  anyone with common sense can figure it out quickly. There is a Velcro attachment around the front wheels and elastic bands that wrap around the side bars. The net is held across the fully extended sun shade with elastic.This net also fits the Britax B-Ready Stroller 2012, Red.I have washed the net several times and it still looks new. The elastic bands that hold the net to the side bars are beginning to stretch out a little from the continued use but given the overall quality and usefulness of the net itself I have no qualms about replacing the elastic at a later date if need be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQS4GWYTGQ46O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050GD2FE#wasThisHelpful","RQS4GWYTGQ46O","A35DJ5UIZVGBP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35DJ5UIZVGBP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't waste your money on this. It barely stays on the B-Ready and the bottom does not attach to anything. When you recline the stroller for baby to take a nap the bottom of the net lays on their feet. It flops around in the slightest of breeze or if you walk fast.Britax makes a much better net for the B-Agile - Britax B-Agile Stroller UV Mosquito Net - I tested it and it fits the B-Ready too!

"I watched this item for several months and hesitated ordering it because of the reviews stating that it was to small for Target shopping carts. In March 2012 I noticed some new colors were available so I decided to give it a try. When I received the box it had a sticker on it that read - ""New & Improved Larger Size."" I brought it to Target and it fit the cart with plenty of room to spare. So far I'm very happy with it.I've posted photos of the box and the cover on a Target shopping cart in the customer photos section.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JG4OFDD3BZCZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002VXO16S#wasThisHelpful","R3JG4OFDD3BZCZ","A35DJ5UIZVGBP6","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A35DJ5UIZVGBP6?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being ""newer"" or ""better"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).Every model does ""at least"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA radios with the 307 firmware release.Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).Getting new UV-5RA units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!BTW, NONE of the ""AA"" or ""AAA"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).So ""if"" you want a ""pretty"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.  Oh, you should see how well that shiny faceplate lights up when a flashlight hits it in the dark, just the thing you don't want for night use.Virtually every guy in our group ends up carrying a standard UV-5R and giving the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ to the wife or kids, since the wife and/or kids rarely care about the other accessories working and they (the wife and kids) tend to like the ""pretty"" radios, but again there is NO INTERNAL difference and NO EXTRA FEATURES in the UV-5RA, -5RAX, or -5RAX+ units (other than a different looking shiny faceplate) vs. the original and still wildly popular UV-5R (which I refer to as the M16 of radios, as all the accessories you match it up with just plain work).Now you know the real background on these radios.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QU2MI2QW4Y0X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E95R1WC#wasThisHelpful","R2QU2MI2QW4Y0X","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being ""newer"" or ""better"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).Every model does ""at least"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RA+, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RA+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RA+ radios with the 307 firmware release.Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing (from some sellers) that you can is simply BOGUS.Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RA+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RA+ units.

"As a buyer of well-over 300 Baofeng radios (and counting) for the group I belong to (not all of which were purchased through Amazon but many were), I'm always amazed at the lengths some sellers go to to hype their products as being ""newer"" or ""better"" than other models, or perhaps (to give them the benefit of the doubt) they just don't know any better.First, the Baofeng UV-5R series (including the original and still extremely popular UV-5R, I'll explain why in a minute) is what is normally referred to by many as a SDR radio (or software defined radio).  While not a true SDR product (you can't use it with your computer to control the radio's functions or scan a wide amount of VHF/UHF frequencies with it), none the less a large chip is programmed on the circuit board built inside each radio.  That chip determines what capability the radio itself can perform.Every UV-5R series radio has the ability to transmit from 136-174 MHz on VHF and from 400-520 MHz on UHF in both narrow-band and wide-band modes (very useful for the occasional FRS or MURS use, which requires narrow-band mode to work correctly).Every model does ""at least"" 4W on VHF/UHF from the factory, but occasionally you'll get a batch that does 4.5W or even 5W out, but the difference between 4W and 5W is minimal at best.  A 4W radio with a better antenna will easily outperform a 5W radio with the standard crappy antenna that Baofeng ships on ALL (including the UV-5RA, -5RAX, and -5RAX+) models.Baofeng DOES NOT program those chips any differently for the UV-5R vs. any other UV-5R series (including the UV-5RAX+).  Version 307 of the firmware (which is the most current release I have in any of my radios) works EXACTLY the same way as previous older releases of firmware at least back to the 295 release (over a year ago), so any claim from a seller that this release provides additional features (at least from a user's perspective) is simply BOGUS, since the firmware inside both radios have the same features.  In fact, my UV-5R radios with the 307 firmware release is EXACTLY the same radio (inside and within the firmware) as my UV-5RAX+ radios with the 307 firmware release.Second, you CANNOT in any way upgrade the firmware (unless you count buying a different radio and it comes with a different firmware release), so again the claim in the listing from some sellers that you can is simply BOGUS.Third, you can believe that two thinner pieces (glued or screwed together on the faceplate of the UV-5RAX+) is somehow stronger than one thicker piece of plastic (on the original UV-5R series) if you like (and maybe it is), but I haven't seen that in real-world use from my own UV-5RAX+ units.  The standard UV-5R units that we use seem to hold up just as well (when dropped in the desert dirt or rolling down a hill) as any other Baofeng radio we own and use.Fourth, and my biggest issue with all of the non-standard UV-5RAX and UV-5RAX+ units, is that NONE of the Baofeng battery accessories (except the little 1800 mAh standard battery) work WITHOUT modification (unless you use a Dremel tool to grind or cut off part of your extended battery that works on the standard UV-5R - but won't work on your UV-5RA, UV-5RAX or UV-5RAX+).Getting new UV-5RAX+ units that don't work with Extended 3800 mAh batteries (without modification) doesn't make my group happy.  That may not bother you, but NONE of the sellers of the non-standard UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, and UV-5RAX+ units ever seem to mention that lack of hardware compatibility in their listings, so buyer beware!BTW, NONE of the ""AA"" or ""AAA"" battery shell packs work on the UV-5RA, UV-5RAX, or UV-5RAX+ units either, so that's 3 different battery accessories (including the 3800 mAh extended battery) that you can't use on these radios without hacking them with a Dremel tool (but they all work without modification on the original UV-5R units).So ""if"" you want a ""pretty"" radio (as my wife calls it), buy one of the various versions of the UV-5RA (or -5RAX, or -5RAX+) with the shiny face plate and live with the fact that you'll be modifying ALL of the battery accessories you buy later in order to get them to work.

"One of the primary ""knocks"" against the UV-5R series of radios (made by the same company - Baofeng) is that their receivers in these little radios are as wide as barn doors.  Sensitive, yes, selective - no way.  Yes I know they can transmit from 136-174 and 400-520 mHz (even though other reviewers aren't aware of this apparently), but up until now selectivity (the ability of the receiver to ignore things that you don't want to hear) has been, well, wanting to say the least.Until now.  The B6 series (when set to narrow-band mode) simply blows away any UV-5R series receiver - period.  One word of caution, however, you'll won't see much difference in the receivers (between the UV-5R series and the B5/B6 series) if both radios are set to wide-band mode (the default setting on both rigs).  When you change both receivers to narrow-band it's like comparing black and white tv to HDTV, you just can't believe the difference.One of my close friends is an EE specializing in RF design.  When we compared the two radios (in wide-band mode) he wasn't too impressed with either of them (to say the least), but when we re-ran the tests with both radios in narrow-band mode he couldn't believe the difference on the B6 and checked his instruments again just to make sure he hadn't made a mistake in the measurements.For most folks considering a radio purchase the narrow-band receive capabilities of this radio will simply be wasted, as many will use it for prepping, scanning, FRS, or GMRS (legal or not), and for those folks (most of which barely understand how to program it let alone what narrow-band is), either radio (UV-5R or B6) is a quantum leap ahead in technology vs. the poor FRS/GMRS bubble-pack radios available in warehouse stores.  For those folks that need a radio that truly can do both Part 90 transmit AND receive, this B6 may just be the low priced unit that they have been looking for.  By the way, the B5 model is the same radio without the built-in LED flashlight, otherwise the units are identical.I own both radios, so let me explain some of the differences of the two different series units so you can decide which one is ""best"" for your needs:Standard Battery Size:1800mAh (UV-5R)  2000mAh (B5/B6)Battery Size / Options Available:3800mAh Extended Battery, AA 6-Cell Pack, AAA 6-Cell Pack, & Car Battery Adapter (UV-5R)NO Battery Options available for the B5/B6 (although the radio is new, so Baofeng may eventually add some options)FM Commercial Radio Receiver Memory Channels:None on the UV-5R (although you can direct enter one FM frequency at a time to listen)16 Memory Channels on the B5/B6 SeriesTotal Programmed Frequency Memories Available for ""Talking"":128 (UV-5R)  99 (B5/B6)Number of available alpha-numberic spaces (to name your displayed frequency):6 (UV-5R)  5 (B5/B6)Colors of radio available:Black, Blue, Camo, Red, Yellow (UV-5R)Black Only (B5/B6)Transmit Frequency Range:136-174 mHz (VHF)400-520 mHz (UHF)Both radios support this.There may other differences I'll discover as I use the B6 longer, if so, I'll revise the review and post them here.In short, if you want the maximum number of options available, you'll love the original UV-5R series.  If you need narrow-band receive capabilities, you'll love the receiver in the B5/B6 series and will (for now at least) have to give up some of the options the UV-5R series folks have already.  My choice was easy, I got both.I can't wait to see what the newest UV-82 series will have (available soon)!Update: 01-23-2014Sadly, the UV-82 series isn't better than a UV-5R when comparing transmit or receive functions (dealers are already giving the same radio different labeling so that they can claim their radio is ""newer"" than the other guy's radio).  It is slightly wider and they finally moved the 0 (zero) on the keypad to the correct location, but it doesn't have more power, or any new features (when comparing a stand UV-5R to a standard UV-82).  Some folks have discovered that the UV-82 is available with 2m and 222MHz (which is true), but that option is also available in the UV-5R (just not on Amazon).  Again, because the case design of the UV-82 is different, none of the battery or power options that work on the UV-5R will even fit a UV-82.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EYMJ3P417P8X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BLPCAZG#wasThisHelpful","R1EYMJ3P417P8X","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

See my Baofeng Extended Battery review for more info).Yes, you can modify (on your own) the Extended Battery so it will fit the UV-5RA (or the other series of UV-5R radios with modified faceplates), but if the ""distributor"" lists the UV-5R (but then switches your order to whatever they have in stock - instead of what they have listed) and then ships (in the same order) a generic clone Extended Battery that isn't the actual Baofeng AND doesn't work/fit with the radio they shipped, why is it your job to modify their items to make them work?In addition, when you (as an Amazon customer) point out their multiple listing errors (shipping a non-Baofeng battery, shipping a less than advertised 3600mAH model (vs. the actual Baofeng 3800mAH model that was advertised on the listing), and shipping an Extended Battery that won't work on the UV-5RA radios that they switched your order to and shipped with them in the same box), they claim that:a) Baofeng doesn't even make an Extended Battery (funny since I own several already with Baofeng Electronics' label on the inside of the case and Baofeng's name imprinted into the back of the plastic battery case), and thatb) if I'm not happy I should pay to ship my order back to them (this is how they treat a customer that ordered multiple radios, extended batteries, and programming cables all at once and paid over $117 in shipping fees)?None of these issues may bother some folks, especially those that either don't care which model of radio they get and/or never plan to get an Extended Battery as an accessory, but I wanted folks to know what customer service issues you may face in dealing with this Baofeng ""distributor"" in KY.","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GPL6FDW28EXQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007UYKG4E#wasThisHelpful","R2GPL6FDW28EXQ","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be advised that a particular seller (that claims to be the actual distributor for Baofeng based in KY) advertises the original UV-5R radio but then ships the UV-5RA instead.

"First, to all of the buyers of the Baofeng radios that are also hams, none of the cheaper Chinese radios (including many that cost far more than the Baofeng UV-5R series of radios) program the same way (from the keypad or from the programming software) as their more expensive Japanese counterparts.  Simply seeing the ""+-"" sign on the Baofeng radio, for example, DOES NOT mean that the radio has automatically programmed the correct offset for the band you are on.  Baofeng radios have to be programmed with both the complete receive frequency AND the transmit frequency to correctly access any repeaters in Channel (memory) Mode.  Since most hams pride themselves on not reading manuals, (if you are a ham) you may have to re-read this paragraph several times.Second, for all of the buyers of the Baofeng radios that think FCC Part 90 acceptance also means that you can have two frequencies 12.5kHz apart (or less) on your two VFO's (and not hear any other noise or interference on the other frequency), you will need to purchase a different radio than the UV-5R.  If you are looking at the UV-5R as a way to reduce expenses but still want a better receiver (and want to stay in the Baofeng radio line), I would suggest either of the Baofeng B5 or the B6 series, which don't cost much more and have a far better receiver.  Some folks feel the UV-82 series has a slightly better receiver, but to me it's simply a repackaged UV-5R radio without many of the accessories available to the UV-5R family (like an extended battery, or a ""AA"" or ""AAA"" shell pack), so although it does fix a few of the UV-5R's shortcomings, it also adds some new ones (IMHO).If you truly want ""more"" features (like more memories, a better receiver, 2 tone/5 tone support, audio scrambling, compandered audio, more power, MotoTrbo digital capability, etc.) take a look at various models within the TYT product family, but be prepared to pay more for those features.Third, understand that the Twin Dual Receive (TDR) function on the UV-5R is NOT the same as having the ability to receive two conversations at the same time.  The radio simply scans back and forth between the two VFO's (think about counting 1001 and 1002 and you get the idea of it's scanning speed), so you may very well miss a short conversation or comment on one VFO from time to time.  If this is totally unacceptable to you, purchase a more expensive radio (or carry two UV-5R radios) as this feature is NOT available (nor can it be re-programmed or hacked into existence) on either the UV-5R or B5/B6 series of radios.Forth, if you insist on buying the cheapest USB programming cable available, expect that you will have issues getting the programming software (either VIP or Chirp) to work properly, since the majority of folks simply either fail to read or follow the detailed instructions on the Yahoo UV-5R forum (on how to overcome the cheap cable issues and/or don't understand how to properly turn off the Windows 7/8 auto update feature on their program drivers for the cable).To avoid this cable issue completely, either purchase the actual Prolific or FTDI Kenwood 2-prong style programming cables or go First Class and get the RT Systems cable/software kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QUOH6RK or search for B00QUOH6RK if Amazon removes that link).  Since Amazon will not allow any outside links to be published, you'll have to search the internet for yourself (or call a local radio dealer).  Buying a real (not cloned or fake) cable and following the instructions on the Yahoo forum will eliminate 99% of the programming issues you hear folks complain about, or upgrade to First Class and get an RT Systems cable and software kit (as they are now available on Amazon).Fifth, the majority of issues you hear about from this brand of radios (and Chinese radios in general) will come from the older hams or engineers, as they will constantly insist that ""they"" should be able to do things with it (using some other method) and will drive themselves crazy trying to figure out why their $60 radio doesn't work like their $300 to $600 dollar Japanese radios from Alinco, Kenwood, Icom, or Yaesu.  Those folks, in turn, bash the radios on various forums or e-commerce sites (primarily because they won't follow directions and/or the radio doesn't work the way they feel it ""should"").Six, understand that if you really know very little about radios in general and you insist on ignoring instructions given to you on various Baofeng forums or user-groups, and you don't even try to read the manual, you will probably (at some point) have an issue with these radios.  It normally won't be the radio's fault, of course, as you won't change the frequency step correctly or will program both the PL tone on encode and decode (thereby blocking the repeater audio from coming through to your receiver), but you'll blame the radio nonetheless.My suggestion at that point is to purchase one that's pre-programmed for you (already setup with the frequencies in your area).  I've sent several folks like that to RF Gear 2 Go in AZ (google them for the contact info) for just that purpose.  They now offer their radio programming service through Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I95HXK8 or search B00I95HXK8).Lastly, all of the UV-5R radio family will transmit and receive from 136-174 MHz on VHF, and from 400-520 MHz on UHF (even if the seller says otherwise), but they only work on analog, not digital.  So if you're looking for a radio to work on frequencies above or below this limit, or use the radio within a digital trunking environment, you'll need to look for another radio, as this one won't work.In addition, occasionally you'll see (or read) about someone that claims to have a mod to allow the radio even more extended frequency coverage - it doesn't work.  The ""mod"" will allow you to enter just about any frequency on the display, but the radio doesn't actually go there.  So you end up with a modified radio, for example, that will show 800 MHz on the display but the limit for transmit and receive is still 520 MHz (on the high end) and 136 MHz (on the low end) within the radio.  The ""mod"" doesn't add AM capability either, so forget trying to listen to aircraft or working CB radio (both of which are also outside the frequency range of the radio as well).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z8I7VNHQYCPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007H4VT7A#wasThisHelpful","R1Z8I7VNHQYCPA","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
