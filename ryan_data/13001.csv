"I actually needed a bit more of a sieve but this fine mesh is close enough for my weird purpose (skimming rapidly breeding baby snails off the surface of the water in an aquarium).

"I'm all about the sauces - I claim to be able to cook but mostly I experiment with Indo-Asian condiments and noodles or vegetables and such.  If my guests like what I came up with I take the credit, otherwise I blame the sauce I snuck in on them.Other reviewers have already pointed out that this is pretty thick - it's not a paste but it's definitely not watery thin, and it's not oily thin either (think of sesame oil or chili oil - it's not like that).  To my taste, both the sweet and spicy elements are right there prominently in your face without a lot of subtlety which suits me just fine.  There is a slight smokiness to the flavor and it has a pretty spicy kick for a finish so there's more to it than just fire and sugar.I love hot stuff and can deal with quite a bit of heat, but I must say this would be a little over the top as the only sauce in, say, a stir fry.  The heat builds as you keep eating and it will get your attention.  (Lest you assume I'm a wimp, I'm the guy who brings his own chili oil/chili paste to the Asian buffet when a group of coworkers go out for lunch.)I marinated some raw shrimp in it before steaming with veggies and sticky rice and that was a perfect use for it.  It's also great as a flavor variation if you like doctoring up ramen noodles as I do sometime.  But my favorite use so far is to add it to pizza - it enhances pretty much any variation.  I was an early adopter of Sriracha sauce for this purpose, 20+ years ago, and I completely burned out on that stuff a long time back.  This has about the same punch but a completely different taste that works with old-school pepperoni and red sauce, chicken and white sauce, olive oil based pizza, veggie, you name it.  Just a bit here and there as an enhancement and you can transform what was an excellent pizza pie into a completely different, but still excellent pizza pie.  A two-fer!One caveat: Gochujang is a Korean staple, not an exotic rarity.  You can buy it in paste form for a lot less and mix up your own version of this sauce with, e.g., sesame oil and soy sauce and a few other odds and ends.  It's a convenience item and if you buy this product you are paying a premium for the convenience.I racked my brain to justify fewer than 5 stars because this is a Vine review of a free product, the presence of which appears to cause some folks all kinds of heartburn.  Apparently the only proper atonement for receiving a review sample at no cost is to despise the product you're reviewing, but I think this stuff is really tasty so...five stars.  Haters gonna hate :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C1ZNGOMMHWJ2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WWNKWKQ#wasThisHelpful","R1C1ZNGOMMHWJ2","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of a Generac iQ2000 6866 portable inverter generator.  I received the generator at no charge in exchange for an honest review of it.  Coincidentally, I've been shopping in this market for at least a couple of years, having previously owned a gigantic, incredibly loud 7KW (13KW starting) monster that was more of a maintenance hassle than it was worth.  I've also tinkered with generator alternatives such as inverters powered by a car battery or by dedicated battery banks.  I'm by no means an expert but am not a complete novice either.This is marketed at a 2000 watt generator.  I consider it a 1600 watt generator because it will power stuff that draws up to 1600 watts when running.  Some items require some extra mojo when they start up (like an air conditioner) so you need a little headroom to allow the item to start up, and then settle back down to its normal wattage draw.  This generator has about 400 watts of headroom.  It will handle something that draws up to 2000 watts momentarily at startup, and then settles back down to no more than 1600 watts.  Generac isn't alone here.  The famous Honda EU2000i is also a 1600 watt generator with 2000 peak watts, and it's marketed as a 2000 watt generator as well.It gets confusing when comparing different pieces of equipment.  I have an inverter that runs off of batteries that's marketed as a 2000 watt inverter.  It actually produces 2000 watts of power continuously, and has approximately 2000 additional watts of headroom.  So it will power multiple devices that have pretty large startup surge demands, yet it's described as a 2000 watt device just like this Generac.The point of all this is to caution you to understand how much power you're going to need to produce to run the goodies you want to run.  My 2000 watt battery-backed inverter will run my refrigerator and my portable air conditioner without complaint.  This Generac 2000 watt inverter generator shut down due to overload when I tried to run the same two appliances.  Don't buy any generator until you understand starting watts vs. running watts and have learned how many starting/running watts are required by the devices you want to run.OK, on to the Generac.  This item is made in the USA and is targeted specifically at the Honda EU2000i, which is legendary for having a long, trouble-free life, being relatively lightweight and being relatively quiet (generators are notoriously noisy).  It arrived well packaged and fully assembled and even came with a bottle of oil.The one page quick start guide doesn't take you very far.  Step 2 is ""fill with oil as indicated in manual"" so you have to stop there and read the manual, which is just as well.Dealing with oil is almost always a messy job that Generac has done a decent job with.  The oil port is very easy to get to and doesn't require any tools other than your fingers to open or close.  There's an angled funnel that screws into the oil port for adding oil and I suppose it could be useful for draining oil as well (see photos).  How much to add is mostly guesswork; I overdid it and had to pour some back out.  If you can see some oil pooling about halfway up the threaded part of the port you're pretty much there.  A small plastic tray is molded into the cabinet to catch small spills or drips which is a thoughtful idea.While you're under the hood you might want to note a couple of other things (see photos).  The air filter cover easy to get to and is secured by one Phillips head screw, just behind what I call the Tube to Nowhere, a clear plastic tube that hangs inside the access door.  I have no idea what it's for and haven't been able to find out yet, but the generator works fine so I've left it hanging.  Just flip it out of the way to get to the air filter.After getting the right amount of oil installed and adding a tank of gas (I used 93 octane with fuel stabilizer already added because that's what I had), I fired it up per the instructions and it started on the first pull.  Weather was fine so it required virtually no time on choke, and we were up and running.  The first thing I noticed was that the engine purred.  I had already watched a video online comparing this Generac to the Honda EU2000i and thought that the Honda sounded smooth, purring like a cat, where the Generac sounded ""valve-y,"" with a more harsh metallic sound.  Not so this one.  Very smooth and, for a generator, so quiet I actually said ""wow.""  (Emphasis on ""for a generator"".)Now the fun part: what can I run with this thing?  My portable AC (about 900 starting watts, 700 running) was no problem.  My fairly recent refrigerator (about 850/600) was no problem.  Both at the same time?  Overload.  Oh well.  The point is that each of them was happy with the power level and the sine wave quality.  The two of them together was a little too much for the Generac, but that's not unexpected.Speaking of which, the true-sine-wave-or-not question came up in the questions section and the answer was sidestepped (pretty clumsily IMHO) by someone who may be been a vendor rep, or maybe not.  So, being a professional jerk, I asked it in a different way and rather than evading the question again, it was just ignored.  I don't have the definitive answer but I can say that the UPS that I use to power my modem, router, printer, desktop and VOIP phone would click like a madman and refuse to charge when I attempted to power it with either my old giant monster generator or my battery-backed inverter.  This Generac makes it as happy as if it were plugged into the grid.  And in fairness, even Honda's marketing refuses to come right out and explicitly claim pure sine wave.  So I'm going to guess it's not pure, but it's close enough to make my stuff happy, which makes me happy.Odds and EndsThere's no 12V or USB or 220V output.Build quality looks and feels very good.  Even the access door is finished with insulation.The gee-whiz displays are actually helpful.  I'm looking out my closed glass door and can easily see the remaining estimated runtime, fuel level and output percentage being used on the generator a goodly ways away on the patio.I'd love to see watts and amps being consumed in realtime; maybe in a later version.The owner's manual talks about spark plug and muffler/spark arrestor maintenance but doesn't show you how to get your hands on them to do the maintenance.  So I called the toll free number on the Quick Start Guide to ask about that and also about the Tube to Nowhere.  10 minutes on hold, then got the encouraging sound of ringing...after about 10 or so rings back to hold, then in about 10 more minutes fast busy (disconnected).  Not a stellar day at the old call center.  So I decided to play around (see photos).The spark plug is underneath that wired thing where you probably think it is anyway - if you give it a good tug it will come off and reveal the plug.You can see the muffler and spark arrestor but it quickly becomes clear that you're not going to get the arrestor out with your fingers.  You have to take off the black trim/grill that covers the rear of the unit using an Allen wrench on the four bolts at the corners.  Then you can have at it with a Phillips.So the only mystery remaining for me is the Tube to Nowhere.  That could stand explaining, as could accessing the spark plug and spark arrestor since they're described as routine mainenance items in the manual.  And there was that call center problem, never a good thing but unfortunately not a very rare thing.If you're considering the higher-end portable inverter generators (Honda, Champion, Yahama) you need to put this guy in the mix.  This is a nice piece of work at a reasonable price point.  If you have any questions please post a comment and I'll try to answer as best I can.Final note: I'd planned to add captions to the photos but it's not clear to me how to do that within the Vine review submission interface.  If I can add captions later I will.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBORZRUF5820/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128KR4EE#wasThisHelpful","RBORZRUF5820","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These things kick hiney.  The noise reduction on an airplane is startling.  They will amp up your music source to ridiculous volume levels if you like.  The controls (particularly the volume control) require no fumbling or feeling around to make sure you hit the right thing.  They sound great whether connected via Bluetooth or wire.  I haven't used them to talk on the phone but I love the feature that cuts off the music source and turns on the mic so you can hear conversation without taking them off, then resume whatever you were listening to.  Battery reserve is great; I traveled from San Francisco through Denver to Raleigh using them pretty much the whole time (including a 3 hr layover in Denver).

"Cheap look and feel.  Muddy (and very little) bass, no sparkle in the highs and the midrange isn't anything to get excited about either.  I'm surprised that HP allowed its name to appear on this product.  I own (or have owned) several 2.1 systems ranging from around $50 to over $300 and I'm telling you that you can do *much* better for this amount of money.  I added one star because the speakers are very small and might be better than nothing for a really, really cramped space.  Take a look at the Arion Legacy AR504LR-BK for roughly the same price.

"This is a review of the Wi-Fi only Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 in the 9.7"" format.  An 8"" version is available that costs about $100 less.  I received the S2 at no charge in exchange for writing an honest review of it.  I'm not going to rehash the dazzling tech features as others have done that better than I ever could.  This is a take mostly about the value proposition.I've been using tablets for a while as entertainment devices going back to the introduction of the Barnes and Noble Nook Color about five years ago, which I rooted immediately after purchase and used as a generic Android tablet.  For the past couple of years I've been happy with my much slimmer and lighter LG G Pad 8.3"" tablet.  The Samsung S2 is ridiculously slim and light with a gorgeous screen and bottomless (for my purposes) memory expansion via a 128GB microSD slot.  Installation/setup was a breeze as I already had a Google account with my LG tablet backed up to it...I just selected the apps I wanted to bring overfrom the LG  to the Samsung and off it went.  If this were just about the tablet I'd state my preference for the 8"" form factor, say ""five stars!"" and quit here.  But as these things have proliferated there's more to it than that.As mentioned, I use tablets as entertainment devices and I don't think I'm unusual in that.  Web surfing, music/video streaming, playing locally-stored audio and video files, email, reading apps, games...general end-user stuff.  Tablets have gotten very good at such things, so good in fact that I've started to wonder why one would spend so much money on the latest and greatest.  Example: the first thing I did when I ordered this beautifully thin and light S2 was to order a faux leather case with a Bluetooth keyboard for it, easily doubling the weight and tripling the thickness.  If you plan to accessorize your tablet, how much of a premium is thin & light worth to you given that you're going to pay even more to add thickness & weight as soon as you get your hands on it?Another consideration is depreciation.  Consumer electronics seem to depreciate even faster than cars.  If you're shopping for a tablet, can you justify the cost of the latest smokin' hot tech vs. the bargains you can find on what was just as hot - and still works just as well - as a year ago?  I just looked on Craigslist and even in my small metro area there are hundreds of hits for ""android tablet"" in the for sale listings.  There's a lot of very nice used hardware out there for the picking and choosing, and for cheap.Is the Samsung S2 a great tablet?  Absolutely!  Would I spend $500 to have one?  Probably not.  I'll enjoy using it in some scenarios, but will probably continue to use my 8"" LG tablet while traveling as it fits those dinky little seat back tray tables better whilst I get to work on my snack and beverage.  Yes, the visuals are bigger and better on the S2 but the point is that they are plenty good enough on the ~2 yr old LG.  And if I lose it in the airport, it's no big deal.  I can pick up another one, or the rough equivalent, for next to nothing.I hate to give less than 5 stars to something as beautifully executed as this, and I won't argue with someone who says it's unfair to mix the used toy market into the equation.  But the quality and capability of these appliances (there, I said it!) has gotten incredibly good such that the former ""wow, check THAT out!"" impact of the latest model is giving way to ""oh look, a tablet.  Is that new?""  I argued with myself over 3 vs. 4 stars and settled on 4 (""I like it"") but a 3 (""it's OK"") is just as accurate from my POV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YFLEWP9LAPR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010OTG0DC#wasThisHelpful","R2YFLEWP9LAPR3","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started watching these when I got a few Season 1 discs from Netflix to share with my elderly aunt at her request.  I was sure I was *much* too sophisticated for such sophomoric stuff, but the more I watched, the more I liked.  This is a surprisingly versatile, remarkably talented ensemble cast, the members of which work very well together.  Yes, it's wholesome (what used to be called ""in good taste"" before good taste became a bad thing) but Billy Gray (""Bud Anderson"") does a terrific smart-*ss who adds an edge the others play off of.  I've become a huge fan of Jane Wyatt (see her Wikipedia biography for some surprises).  I used to think of Robert Young as just ""that Sanka commercial guy"" and had really no exposure to Elinor Donahue or Lauren Chapin before I started watching, but all these people could *act*.  Start at Season 1 if you've not seen this and want a taste - you can get it on Amazon or rent it on Netflix.  It just gets better from there.  Mr. Young apparently pulled the plug after ~7 seasons when they were at the top of their game and everybody wanted more, but he was probably right to let it go then.  You won't regret time or a few bucks spent on this show.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ63TPNRWHFQA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007R5S0YY#wasThisHelpful","RQ63TPNRWHFQA","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Apparently an earlier wired version has been out for a while and it looks like Amazon has put the reviews for different versions in one place.  The BP5 Wireless supports Android as well as iOS, although the box and some of the documents don't advertise that Android is supported.This is an arm cuff with a white plastic pod attached, with no tubes or wires coming from it.  The pod contains the rechargeable battery, the air pump, the Bluetooth radio and the electronic goodies that make all that stuff work.  The only switch is a power button.  You control the device using a free app that you install on your Android or iOS device.There is no power brick included.  You do get a charging cable with a standard USB on one end and a mini (not micro) USB on the end that connects to the cuff.I tested this with an Android phone so I got the Android flavor of the app from the Play Store.  It's called ""iHealth MyVitals.""  When I searched for that, two versions showed up so I read the descriptions and grabbed the latest one, version 2.1.6.  The improvement over the earlier version is said to be ""an auto-log functionality to bring you a better Android experience in the future.""  Nope, didn't mean anything to me either but at least I've got it!The app installed without issues and I paired my phone with the BP5 via Bluetooth with no problems.  The first time I ran the app I was prompted to create an iHealth Cloud account.  Oh, grand, another Cloud.  I was glad to see there was an option to continue using the app as a ""guest"" (without registering) for the purpose of this review.  That said, it's good that multiple users are supported by the software.I'm thinking this device may be all about the Android (or iOS) app since that's how you relate to it.  My relations with it weren't very successful.  I was occasionally able to complete a reading but I seemed to fail to connect via Bluetooth about as often as I succeeded.  As I wrote this paragraph the app has tried and failed to connect several times (although it doesn't announce a failure, it just stops trying).  I shut down my phone and the BP5 completely, brought them back up and experienced the same thing.  I ""forgot"" the BP5 in my phone's Bluetooth settings, re-paired it without problems, then started the app on the phone again - which failed to find the BP5 again.Assuming you can get the BP5 and your phone/tablet/whatever on reliable speaking terms, the iHealth MyVitals app seems to have lots of capabilities in terms of recording a history of your readings and health trends (if you choose to record weight, sleep and physical activities).  Assuming you store data in their Cloud you can access these data from other devices in other places and even share it with others.  I'm pretty sure my primary care doc isn't sitting up late at night on weekends hoping I'll post my weight and BP after finishing that Mucho Grande Burrito platter, but apparently you can make that happen.  The how-to info is under Help in the software, not online, which makes sense.  Instructions will differ for Android vs. iOS, and they'll change with different versions.  Makes no sense to maintain it in multiple places.  Anyway, don't look for app details online; they're not there.The big problem for me is the weight of this thing.  The sleek white pod attached to the side of the cuff has a battery and an air pump and all the electronics inside.  Trying to place it on my arm with my free hand is surprisingly hard to do.  It wants to slide down my arm to my wrist as soon as I position it and then reach for the Velcro closure thingie.  It can be done, but it's a hassle.  When I add that hassle to the intermittent performance I've experienced with Bluetooth connections, I find that my old wrist-attached monitor does the job pretty well without having to schedule a session with it.  I just wrap it around my wrist, hit the go button and in 30 seconds I'm done.The bottom line is that this doesn't work for me.  I can see value in the ability to track metrics other than blood pressure readings, and to be able access those metrics anywhere.  Some folks have to be that religious about such things and this might be a good fit for them, but the software and connection problems I experienced make it too much hassle for me to use routinely.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NN8QRXFV7OTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ANJAKF8#wasThisHelpful","R1NN8QRXFV7OTS","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a review of the Sony SRSX77 portable speaker.  I received it at no cost as an evaluation unit for review.  These are my honest comments written from the POV I take when I've paid for an item.This is a pretty substantial item, comparable in size and weight to a house brick.  There are smaller and lighter competitors out there (see photo showing it next to a Bose Soundlink Mini).  It belts out the tunes with plenty of volume for a bedroom, study or office and yes, it's portable, but its size and weight really suggest a mostly stationary role.  I'm hearing punchy bass, nice mids and sparkly highs.  Heavy bass will rattle stuff on the table with the speaker.  You don't feel it like you would with a subwoofer but you can clearly hear low frequency notes, not just a bit of percussive noise that wants to be that low note if you know what I mean.Sony offers a free app called Song Pal that you can use as a remote control for the speaker on an Android or iOS device.  You use it to select a preset equalization or set your own, control how long the speaker idles before automatically powering down, Google Cast settings and other general operational-type stuff.  Song Pal can also be used as a music player.  I have to admit that I found Song Pal a little tedious in that role and I found it most useful to tweak settings on the speaker.  I used other apps that I'm already familiar with (e.g. Amazon Music, RadioTunes) to play tunes.I told a friend that I was going to review this and he loaned me his Bose Soundlink Mini to compare.  The two don't compete directly (this Sony costs ~64% more than the Bose at this writing).  The Sony is louder, more interface-able, has crazy longer battery life and sounds a lot better to me.  But the Bose is much more portable and would suit me better for use in a product demo or a hotel room, and it sounds awfully good.  This isn't a review of the Bose; I bring it up to make the point that whether the Sony is right for your application depends on how you want to use a device like this.

No color bleeding onto other items in the washer (I generally use cold water), the elastic is holding up perfectly and they are pretty sturdy so far (I have a big dog who sleeps with me and he likes to dig around and make a nest before retiring).

"This is a review for the USB 2.0 version of a Belkin add-on Ethernet port for devices that don't have an Ethernet port built in.  I first bought a device like this a few years ago when I got a Samsung Chromebook and found myself in a hotel that offered both wired and wireless connections, but the wireless was pretty bad - if you were lucky enough to get a connection for more than a few minutes it was painfully slow.  I thought ""no problem, I always carry an Ethernet cord in my bag, I'll connect to the wire"" and then realized that minimalist devices like Chromebooks don't have such ports.  Oops.  Now something like this is one of the must-have accessories in my toy bag.I've migrated from the Chromebook to a HP Stream 14 running Win 8.1.  Like the Chromebook that inspired it, this laptop has a solid state drive, no optical drive and no RJ45 Ethernet port to save space and weight.  This little goodie from Belkin lets me turn one of my USB ports into an Ethernet port so I have an option if there's no wireless, or if the wireless is too sucky to be of any use.In the box: the adapter and a CD containing a setup program, a user manual in PDF format, and a folder for Mac users (presumably the stuff not in that folder is for Windows computers).  No cable is included to connect between the adapter and an Ethernet port; if you're like me you have a drawer full of such things anyway.My little HP Stream has no optical drive so I didn't run the setup.exe and didn't even open the PDF manual.  I just turned off the wireless, plugged the Belkin adapter into a USB port and connected a cable from it to an available port on my router and BANG - I'm connected.  When I did get around to looking at the PDF manual on the CD, I saw a stern warning under the instructions for Windows XP/Vista/7/8:  ""Caution: DO NOT connect the Ethernet adapter to your computer before you install the provided driver.  You will be instructed to do so later.""  I'm happy to report that nothing bad happened despite my connecting the adapter without installing the driver.  I didn't just defer the setup, I never installed it at all and the adapter works great.Why not 5 stars?  Price.  At the writing there's at least one no-name equivalent available on Amazon, also with Prime shipping, for 60% less.  No, we're not talking big bucks and the Belkin is a bit smaller (see photo), but that no-name has been working fine for me for several years now and is plug-and-play just like the Belkin.This is a fine product.  The price could be a little more competitive but it does what it promises and couldn't be easier to use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZSCDYML5QAZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E9655LU#wasThisHelpful","RZSCDYML5QAZH","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These things may have good battery life but I can't use them long enough to find out.  I was impressed by other reviews and bought these and took them on a road (air) trip.  Thankfully I took another pair as backup - the backups sucked but I already knew that, and they didn't suck like these. These won't stay in place on my ears, slip sliding away and requiring constant adjusting to stay in place.  And staying in place is important, because if these are just a bit off-center on either ear the volume goes away.  And there's not much volume.  Not much bass or treble either.  On a recent flight I had to just put them away because I couldn't hear the source material, either from my phone or my tablet, trying to hear recordings from a variety of sources.  Oh yeah, and noise reduction?  What noise reduction?  Well, on the plane somebody in my vicinity definitely farted (it was ghastly) and I didn't hear it, but I'm not sure that counts as noise reduction.There are so many good reviews that I'm thinking I got a defective pair, but I'm remembering what my Mama said: ""don't get too cheap.""

"This is a review for a two-product bundle: one TL-PA4010 adapter (a.k.a. AV500 1 port) and one TL-PA4020 adapter (AV500 2 port).  I think Amazon is mixing reviews for this two-item bundle with reviews of the individual adapters.  Here are the items and bundles I've become aware of:TL-PA4010 = 1 port adapter available singly or in bundlesTL-PA4020 = 2 port adapter available only in bundles as near as I can tellTL-PA4010KIT = a pair of TL-PA4010sTL-PA4020KIT = a pair of TL-PA4020sTL-PA4026KIT = one TL-PA4010 and one TL-PA4020 (this review)Background: I've been using a similar Netgear product for years.  It consists of two devices: one that you plug into the wall and then connect your router to.  It pipes your Internet signal into your household wiring.  I came to call this the transmitter.  The second device plugs into the wall where you want the Internet signal to be available, far from the transmitter.  I call it the receiver and I plug stuff into it...like a computer or TV or DVD player or streaming device (Roku, FireTV).So I thought in terms of a single-purpose transmitter and a single-purpose receiver when I got this TP-Link bundle, and that's how I was thinking when I set these devices up.I plugged the AV500 1-port into wall power near my router and connected a cable from my router's output to the single port on the AV500, thus creating what I call my new transmitter.I plugged the AV500 2-port into wall power in a distant bedroom, thus creating what I call my new receiver.  Then I ran a cable from one of the 2 ports to the input of my FireTV box (substitute Roku or DVD player or TV, whatever you have).  Bingo, I have faster-than-wireless Internet in my distant bedroom connected to my FireTV.  Because this AV500 2-port has another connection available, I can connect a cable from it to another device like, say, a desktop computer as well.  No configuration, no muss, no fuss, it really is as simple as plugging stuff in.As an experiment, I swapped the devices so that the AV500 2-port became the transmitter and the AV500 1-port became the receiver.  Everything still worked, showing that either the single or dual port flavors can perform either function, unlike my older Netgear setup.  That's good to know since it adds flexibility.  Since I have no need for the second port on the transmitting end, I swapped the devices back.Then I decided to take it a bit further and add another receiver in a guest room, and I couldn't figure out what to buy.  Long story short, I bought another TL-PA4010 1 port.  I used it as a receiver in the guest room, connected to another FireTV box, and still using the original TL-PA4010 1-port as the transmitter.  I can now stream from the origihnal TL-PA4010 transmitter to the second TL-PA4010 1-port in my guest room, and to the TL-PA4020 2-port that I'd previously installed in another room.  I streamed Netflix in one room and Prime Video in the other at the same time and the results were great.So a TL-PA4010 can be a transmitter or a receiver.  So why not buy a pair of TL-PA4010s in a cheaper starter kit, instead of the pricier bundle I'm reviewing here?  Here's why you might want a TL-PA4020 with its second port on the receiving end, using my guest room as an example.  That room has a FireTV box connected to my TV's HDMI1 port, and the TL-PA4010 1-port is connected to the FireTV box.  But that room also has a Blu-ray player connected to the TV's HDMI2 port.  When I play a recent vintage Blu-ray DVD, it complained that I'm missing out on additional content because the Blu-ray player isn't connected to the 'net.  And that's a fact.  I have no available port to connect the Blu-ray player to.  That doesn't bother me, but I can see why the convenience of another port could come in handy.  So I would recommend the bundle I'm reviewing.  The small additional cost for that second port on the receiving end is minimal and will be soon forgotten.Now comes the frustrating part.  Suppose you buy this 1-port (as transmitter) + 2-port (as receiver) bundle and want to expand by adding another receiver.  Want just a single port for your new receiver?  Do what I did and buy a single TL-PA4010 (cheap and easily available) and you're done.  Prefer two ports on your receiving end?  Obviously, buy another TL-PA4020 instead of a 4010...but not so fast.  I can only find the TL-PA4020 2-port as part of this bundle or as a two-pack (a pair of 4020s).  Maybe I haven't looked hard enough, but it bugs me to be forced to buy two when I just want one and that looks like the marketing-via-packaging strategy here.Other than that annoyance, these things work great and the fact that either the 1-port or the 2-port can serve as transmitter or receiver is commendably flexible.  Setup is beyond painless.  Performance using cnet's internet speed test is virtually identical to the very satisfactory performance of the Netgear boxes I've been using for some time.  The price is very reasonable.  The power-saving features may save you as much as $0.08 over a hundred years on utility costs (hey, ""green"" BS moves product nowadays even if it is just BS).Sorry if this is more of a sorting-it-out diary than a review; it took me a while to sort it out and I decided to inflict all that on you, dear reader.  I'd recommend this but advise thinking through the config you want to create before buying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DA8GFKF1NNEL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010Q29KRK#wasThisHelpful","R2DA8GFKF1NNEL","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been invaded by Malaysian Trumpet Snails (MTS), apparently piggybacking onto a fancy male guppy from a chain pet store (just a guess).  From reading on the web I came to understand that these guys can be introduced to your tank by new animals or plants you add, and they can survive anything and then reproduce like mad once they get into a hospitable environment.  Apparently all you need is one egg and BANG, you have a colony of MTS.  This trap is clever, but in my tiny tank all it trapped was a guppy or two, even with all the prison bars in place that should have kept them out.  Maybe the trapped guppies chased any MTS visitors away from the bait (the guppies certainly ate it all).  When I removed the trap there was a cluster of MTS underneath as if they had gathered looking longingly at the bait within, and I was able to siphon several dozen of them out of that gathering.  So I guess it worked to that extent, but I don't think that's what the designers had in mind.  I won't flatly say this doesn't work - the design is intelligent and the concept *should* work - but unfortunately it didn't work as hoped for me.  Your experience may be better and I do think it's worth a try in a different situation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T07SQ4RJ0E4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J4UZC32#wasThisHelpful","R1T07SQ4RJ0E4G","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the 3rd iteration of this Arc mouse that I've owned and by far the best yet.  The earlier USB-connected ones were OK, but just OK in terms of usability.  They were worth the less-than-stellar mouse-ing performance because the form factor is so perfectly portable.  This is my first bluetooth one and I was hoping for merely okay usability to match what this replaced (a MSFT Sculpt Comfort BT mouse).  The Sculpt was/is adequate but this thing is much more responsive and sensitive than I would have expected from any BT mouse and blows the bulkier Sculpt away.  This Arc Touch tracks accurately on pretty much anything and tracks through anything (e.g. layers of plastic).

"One star means ""I  hate it,"" two means ""I don't like it.""  Truth be told, I'm afraid of it and I'm going to peg that between 1 and 2 stars.  I wore these to the range today and was so alarmed (fear of ear damage) after firing ~a dozen 9mm rounds that I left the range to go rent some of their plain vanilla house ear cups.  Others were on nearby lanes and I was stunned at how loud things were with these things on when I walked in, even with the amplification completely off.  After firing for a while with the house rental I tried the Peltors on again, this time reversing the earpieces to see if orientation made a difference.  It may have subjectively made a very slight improvement but I still had to leave the range and go back to the house rental after just a few minutes.  My ears were ringing and actually hurt - we're not talking the fit; these  are perfectly comfortable and very tight.  Wearing them frontwards or backwards, with the amplification off or on, I found it not just distracting but painful to be on the range wearing these.To be fair, I wear eyeglasses and wear oversized clear protectors over my glasses (a range requirement).  So there are those items between the cups and my head which could cause some loss of effectiveness, but I've had a similar set of earphones for years with no problems.  There were no problems with the generic, no frills, well-used house rentals either.  For me, these are just not usable.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R311ECQFKMPB7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R311ECQFKMPB7I","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Worx cordless mower that I use in my tiny fenced back yard and it is a wonderful thing.  Light as a feather, zero maintenance, does a surprisingly good job even when I'm less than timely with my mowings and the grass gets a little thick.  I could use it two or three times without recharging.  I made the mistake of leaving the mower on a covered porch with the battery installed during a rainstorm.  The battery got soaked.  Actually, this little box is a container with two batteries and a circuit board and some connective wiring inside and those are the things that got soaked.  After they marinated for a week or so I tried to mow the lawn and the battery was dead.  Not weak, not in need of a charge, not pining for the fjords, dead.  Took it to my local Batteries Plus and the helpful guy opened the container and you could see the corrosion on the circuit board...clearly not a candidate for a rebuild.

"My last car (an Acura TSX wagon) came with no spare tire, ostensibly to save weight and boost Acura's fleet mileage numbers.  Instead, it included a non-branded item almost identical to this with no hint as to the manufacturer - a can of tire sealant goo and a 12V air pump connected to work together.  I had occasion to use it and wow, this is a great concept!  Beats the heck out of changing a tire in the sun or the cold or, well, it beats the heck out of changing a tire.  I sat in the car with the AC blasting while this little gem (OK, the Acura-supplied equivalent) sealed and inflated my punctured tire, and I was off.  This Slime version (including the electric pump) cost roughly half what the Acura goo refill can *alone* cost, so I bought this Slime kit.  Sure enough, I had another puncture and the Slime kit worked exactly like the Acura version.  So I replaced just the goo refill on the Slime kit and it's as good as new.I just traded the Acura (sweet car BTW) on a car that does have a spare tire, but I'm buying another Slime kit for the new car anyway.  It's cheap and if you get a puncture that it can handle you will bless the day you bought it.  Oh yes, I did replace the two Slime(d) tires on the Acura eventually and it was not an issue for new tire installation or the TPMS.  There are some urban legends out there about such products...if you use them your wheels will rot, your tires will dissolve, your sainted Grandma will come back from the grave and curse you...not true.  You may get warts, though.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KV093ZBBC30A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DZFZPG#wasThisHelpful","R1KV093ZBBC30A","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a review of the Fluval U1 filter for the Fluval U1 pump  It's a manufactured sponge, shaped to fit inside the Fluval U1 filter, nothing more or less.  It works great in the U1.  There is no bio media, no charcoal, nothing to see here but a sponge.  (I think the U2 and up models have fancier filtration.)  I use my U1 as a cleaning aid before water changes.  I remove the fishies, immerse the U1 in the tank, plug it in and then blast the substrate with a turkey baster  That blows all kinds of nasty crud out of the substrate and suspends it in the water, where the U1 can suck up the crud.  I keep doing that until the water is reasonably clear.  That may require removing the U1 and rinsing the filter under running water and then putting it back in for another go, especially the first time you do it.Then I do a normal partial water change.When done, I remove the filter, rinse it and set it out to dry.  There's no need to replace it as long as cleans up nicely under running water.Note: if you try this method, the first time you do it you will be entirely grossed out by the amount of crud in your substrate which you probably thought was as pure as the driven snow.  Stay calm and don't try for spotless the first week.  Things will get better as you repeat the technique over timeThe main point to understand is that, at least in my experience, these filters will last a very long time without replacement if you rinse them thoroughly between uses.  They're just sponges.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R283ECZ67BPNYX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001XRTT5Q#wasThisHelpful","R283ECZ67BPNYX","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Somebody is getting rich on this thing and s/he deserves every penny.  I've been using fan-based white noise machines my whole adult life and can't sleep without one.  I've even had to set a TV to a dead station, turn down the brightness and turn up the volume to get a decent all-night hiss going in a hotel to mask other sounds.My first machine came from the Sears Catalogue's sickroom supplies section since the product category didn't really exist back in the 1970s.  I've since tried many nature sound, white noise, brown noise, etc. synthesizers, including looping MP3s of such sounds on a player of one kind or another, and always went back to my fan-in-a-box from Sears or Hammacher-Schlemmer.  But this thing blows the fan box away in every way.  Volume can be much louder or much softer if you like.  I can make it sound exactly like my current fan box if I want to, or something completely different but equally pleasing.  And it's smaller (less than half the size), lighter (although it still feels substantial) and can be powered from different sources...a laptop, a wall socket, one of those portable battery charger doohickeys (a technical term) used for portable electronics when traveling, the USB port on the desk lamp in your hotel room, what have you.If I could add anything it would be internal batteries and bluetooth (or at least a headphone jack), but I'm not complaining.  This is vastly superior to my old faithful fan-in-a-box.  If you're not a user of such things my enthusiasm will seem a little deranged, but if you are a user please trust me - you need one of these even if you don't know it yet.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3M6LK2YX8I7X1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E6D6LQY#wasThisHelpful","R3M6LK2YX8I7X1","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have a big dog with big feet who likes to stand on a door armrest in the back and hang his head out the window.  I had another brand of door panel cover that fit with tabs like the Krunco, but the other brand just wouldn't stay in place more than a few minutes.  As a result, the armrest/door trim in the back seat was taking a lot of abuse.  The Brand X covers finally fell apart so I decided to try another brand and lucked into these.  It has been 3 weeks and NOT ONCE have Buford's big feet managed to pull one of the Krunco covers off of the door.  (I used the tabs for installation.)  If you've soured on door protectors like this because yours won't stay in place, do yourself a favor and give these a shot.  The tabs can be positioned in a couple of ways to fit a variety of cars.  Understand that you're placing a bet here - these may fit your car or not, and they may stay in place in your car with your dog or not (that's a lot of variables).  But in my case these are like night and day.  And the cost of refurbing interior trim for trade-in/lease-turn-in time for any car is going to be substantial - these are way cheap in comparison.  Really happy with these and deliberately waited to review them for several weeks to see if they'd stay put.  So far they have.  Great stuff.  BTW, I have these in a 2012 Acura TSX wagon.  I understand that the TSX is a clone of the Honda Accord so I'd expect similar performance in an Accord.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CXODDV8QC3QP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEB7FPI#wasThisHelpful","R2CXODDV8QC3QP","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't have any of the packaging or leakage problems that others reported.  This came premixed and ready to go and is perfect for my situation - an established lawn (not exactly yard of the month quality but presentable) next to a common area in the neighborhood that is effectively a dandelion and clover farm.  So all those lovely things migrate to my lawn first.  I hosed down a bunch of early dandelion blossoms and yes, in about a day's time they were all clearly dying - not shriveled into husks yet, but clearly not long for this world.  I'll be repeating this from time to time as the spring wears on.  I like the fact that it's premixed and ready for spot treatment because that's what I need in this instance.  Can't speak to how it handles crabgrass as I won that war a few years ago, but it kicks some dandelion and clover hiney and is probably enough to last me all season.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGKB4SY1EPFT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LD2CR0#wasThisHelpful","RGKB4SY1EPFT0","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Oh great...a zoomable photo that hides the model number/manufacturer and all other specifics, but lets you get close-up view of some black plastic housing.  How freaking helpful.  FWIW, I have a Fluval branded replacement pump supposedly for the Spec III and Spec V and I'm thinking this is a non-Fluval-branded version of the same thing.  Whether it is the same or slightly different, know this: use a box cutter, razor blade or similar to remove those suction cups before you install it, *especially* if you are installing in a Fluval Spec V.  If those suction cups are firmly in place in the V, you WILL NOT be able to remove the pump when it fails.  You may have better luck in a Spec III because the pump cavity is bigger.Oh, and you also won't be able to remove the pump if it's still working, but the water supply tube has come away from the pump and needs to be refitted (my situation).  My solution in my Spec V: cut the power cord to the pump while it's place and leave the pump and remaining wire in place.  (Yes, unplugging it first would be a splendid idea.)  Yank the water tube off the pump and attach it to your replacement pump (maybe with a zip tie).  Drop the replacement pump on top of the original (now disabled) pump and connect the spout from the tube to the water outlet.  Now you have a *removable* pump in your Spec aquarium.  It would be really swell if you had this feature from the factory.

"I won't say this is a real looker, but it's not at all unattractive.  It looks a LOT better to my taste than 2.1 systems in this price range with exposed speakers with gaudy trim, fancy lights that pulse or change color, that kind of thing.  It works well as a monitor for my little vinyl-to-MP3 setup with a turntable and a dedicated laptop.OTOH, I have one of those visually ultra-tacky 2.1 systems in the same room.  Its bass is punchier, treble is cleaner and fresher, and the midrange is much more present, and it cost about the same as the Edifier.  But the Edifier is indeed more attractive, sounds perfectly okay in this price range, and the satellite volume/input/output module is really cool (but why no standby or full power switch on it?).Not sorry I bought this but not sure I'd do so again.

I'm hoping to put most of the wear on the inexpensive Sabrent hub which I can easily replace, rather than the one built into my laptop which I can't.  This hub is so small that it can usually stay in place even when transporting the laptop, and the ability to rotate means it can flip up out of the way when I want to open my optical drive.The fact that it turns one port into four comes in handy as well.

"OK, first off, this is a lousy time of year to test and review a garden hose here in central-ish NC.  Winters arent that cold but we get the occasional Arctic blast.  In this case a couple of weeks of wildly erratic weather gave me a chance to take this hose around the block.We had a couple of unseasonably warm days so I used it with my pressure washer to spray out my screened porch.  It never kinked, and I did maneuvers with it that ALWAYS resulted in kinks and nasty expletives.  So theres that.  But dragging the washer around was a chore as usual and I couldnt feel any of the light weight, easier handling benefit promised on the package.  It never fully uncoiled either, but thats to be expected when the high for the day is in the low 50s.I drained the hose but left it lying on the patio overnight, where the temps plummeted to the mid-teens and froze it solid.  After a little warmup the next afternoon the hose was stiff but undamaged.  I coiled it for storage as I would with any hose and found that the stiffness and tendency to hold the coil made this pretty much the chore it usually is.  In this case, though, I could tell that the hose was lighter toward the end of the process (when most of the hose is in your arms rather than on the ground).  So I think there is something to the claims of lightness.I think the problem is that I want a hose that doesnt exist: 100 feet long, three pounds total weight, flaccid as a shoestring, self-deploying and self-storing.  This aint that, but it is a well-made (in the USA), high-quality hose that resisted every attempt I made to make it kink and thats its claim to fame.  It will replace one of those horrible spring-like coil hoses that has tortured me with tangles for the past couple of years.

"I was in Tampa recently for leisure and happened on the Columbia Restaurant in Ybor City, in business since 1905 so they are clearly doing something right.  I had a bowl of the Spanish Bean Soup (a.k.a. Garbanzo Bean Soup) and it brought back memories of a version of that soup that my dad used to make.  There are a bunch of recipes for it on the web and many of them call for one or two packets of this stuff and I have to say, it perks up that soup and pretty much any Latin dish in a noticeable way.  If you like Mexican food, Tex-Mex, Cuban or any of the whole Latin American flavor genre, this is something to have in your cooking arsenal.  Good stuff.  And if you're in the Tampa area, find one of the Columbia locations and grab a Cuban Sandwich and a bowl of Spanish Bean Soup.

"I really like this and the convenience is outstanding, but it's really hard to pay that much for rice, even though sticky (glutinous) rice products are often sold at a premium.  I went through an order of this from Amazon, then spotted a similar Annie Chun variety at Wally World for a lot less and went through a few of them.  Searched on the web and found a number of ridiculously complicated techniques to make sticky rice and they were all way too much work.Finally bought a big bag of plain old white glutinous rice and followed the instructions.  It's just too easy.  Grab a measuring cup and put about a cup of glutinous rice in it.  Cover the rice with water and let it sit on the counter for at least two hours (all day is fine too).  Strain it and dump it into a dish, then steam it for 30 minutes.  That's it.  You don't need a new appliance (although if you don't have an electric steamer you don't know what you're missing).  You don't need exotic culinary implements.  I thought sticky rice was a closely-guarded secret of the ancients but in reality, there ain't nothing to it.I'm not a cheapskate at all but sometimes I look up and say ""I paid WHAT?""  This is one of those things.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DNT1H5AKG405/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GPRNGS#wasThisHelpful","R1DNT1H5AKG405","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Of that one, the Time Warner tech said the MAC ID was already in use on the Time Warner network and we just couldn't go any further.  He sounded competent and straight-up and I had (still have) no reason to think he was wrong.

"The AMZN blurb says ""Controls 2 outlets simultaneously.""  No, it doesn't.  It plugs into your typical two (female) plug wall outlet and occupies both of those outlets, and then you have one outlet on the Hydrofarm available to plug something into that you want to turn on/off with the timer.  I guess you could say it OBSCURES two outlets simultaneously, but it doesn't CONTROL them.  It just hides one of them.No large deal for me.  I use it with the ""6-Grounded Outlet In-Wall Adapter with Resettable Circuit Breaker, White 56575"" that allows me several other connections, and the whole arrangement is pretty compact.  So I have one timed outlet (the Hydrofarm doohickey) which allows a power brick (transformer) for an aquarium light.  I have another outlet for another power brick for my motion detector alarms.  I have two more outlets for my aquarium heater and pump, and I have two left.  Not too shabby.This item fits perfectly into a wall socket if you need only one outlet.  If paired with the item described above (search AMZN for it), you can enjoy one timer outlet and a bunch of power-brick-friendly other outlets.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCEXKA1JUFLJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055F53HK#wasThisHelpful","RCEXKA1JUFLJO","A3JV071KO43Q5X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3JV071KO43Q5X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If I had rated it based on my initial impression of it, I'd have done it an injustice because I didn't realize that to decrease the amount of resistance I just remove bands from it.

One band is light resistance (but still a good workout) and 3 bands is strong resistance+ The bands are very easy to take in and out+ The handle grips are comfortable to use, even for longer workouts+ Comes with exercise guide (with color pictures and full instruction) for recommended exercises to do with it+ Sturdy qualityCons- None foundSuggested improvementI'd have really liked it if it came with a drawstring or zippered bag that it fit in, just for convenient portable storage of it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29PX9IKGW84DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146N7F4A#wasThisHelpful","R29PX9IKGW84DR","A26LD9FQHTM8ZH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26LD9FQHTM8ZH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We chose this gate to use on a door that goes to the outside so that our dog can lay in front of it and watch the yard when she's not able to be out in it.  She's a 15 1/2 year old Lab and she loves watching the activity in the yard.  I prop open the door and keep the gate in so she can do that and it works great.  It's a really nice dog gate, very sturdy and it was simple to install.  I love the extra height on it and that you can keep it open or keep it closed.

"I thought this was a really good book. The story was interesting and the characters well-written and the writing style had substance. When I finished it, the first thing I did was look up what other books the author had written.  I don't always like stories that alternate between the characters in telling it, but it definitely worked in this book. I'm glad that I didn't read some of the reviews before I read the book because I think some tell way too much about the nature of different characters or events that unfold in the book and for me I loved not knowing anything and just seeing where the story went myself. The author did an excellent job of keeping me guessing until the end.

"I really liked this author's The Life We Bury, to the point he was the first author I followed on here, so when I saw his next book was out I was excited to read it and even put it at the top of my reading pile when it came.  But the difference between the two books was day and night for me and I struggled to read this one and finally gave up. The Life We Bury felt fresh and original with characters I was drawn to, the characters in this book felt unoriginal, no real depth to them and like ones I've read about a hundred times before. I was losing interest in the story because of that and then a line a female character gave a male character was so unrealistic and cheesy and it was the point I gave up on the book.

It is strong and stays in place and there are no little prongs that poke into you like on the older metal ones. I didn't see it on the product page, but if I had the option to I'd buy another clip so that I could place one on each end instead of just one in the middle.  That would give even more support, but even just having the one clip works so much better for me than the traditional ones. I didn't think the instructions were that great and to me they seemed to over complicate it and I can see why people might be confused by them. It took me less than a minute of fiddling with it to figure out how to snap it into place, it's very simple.The bandage wrap works well and I prefer the black over the standard color.

"Just adults here racing and we've been having a blast with this racing system, it is a lot of fun!  It's crazy how far technology has come. We've been playing with it for almost two weeks now and I still get that excited feeling thinking about it.I love that there are no lanes and that if you get off the track you can just drive back on and you are back in the race. I appreciate that you can set the experience level (novice, expert, custom) and that game play mode options included a practice mode.  That was helpful at first when learning the controls and how to race.  I like how comfortable the handset is and how easy the controls are to use while racing and that you can choose the amount of laps in a race.  You can also set your language (English, French, Russian, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, Italian and German) and there are 5 sound levels to choose from.  Feels like race day fun when you can set the hazards and things like tire wear to give it added realism.It's a fun way to relax after a long day. We even do a quick 10 lap race to see who is going to do a chore, loser does it.  One of the guys who played it said we should set the track up around the Christmas tree like you do with train tracks as a kid.All you need besides what's in the box is a small cross head screwdriver and 6 AA batteries and 6 AAA batteries and a space big enough to set up the track.

"These are awesome reusable shopping totes. I've tried so many different kinds and brands and these are my favorite.  You can pack a lot of stuff into them and they are so convenient to use!  They fold up flat so they fit compactly in the car and in the grocery cart.  The bottom insert is attached and you fold it down before adding groceries to the bags.  They are high quality bags and very durable.I've used other sets by the same company and my other favorites are the summer set Earthwise Summer Reusable Shopping Bag Totes(4 Pack).  These are what I use for groceries, beach trips, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXBJTCCS3DZXX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WH46ISK#wasThisHelpful","RXBJTCCS3DZXX","A26LD9FQHTM8ZH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A26LD9FQHTM8ZH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are very cute and good for light scrubbing jobs.  I've used it on my coffee cups and non-stick pans and it's done a good job.  They did not come with any care instructions at all so I just guessed and I wash it with my with whites (hot water) and then I air dry it.  It has the little hanger on it and that works well for that.  Because of how cute they were, I haven't used one of the set...I just use it as decoration in the kitchen.  The other one is the one I'm using and washing.  It has held up so far okay.

"I am a huge history buff and recently became intrigued about the Dakota Apartments after it came up during a discussing between myself and some of my friends; I absolutely knew that I had to find out more after someone mentioned a few of the notable residents that lived there - mainly actors that I have always admired since I was very young. I initially bought this book to find out more about the place where some of my favorite celebrities resided in, but I am left more than impressed and intrigued by the rich and deep history that Dakota Apartments has behind it. I have to give a lot of credit towards the author for being able to capture and express such a diverse history into a format that is easy to read and also incredibly insightful at the same time.There's plenty of photos and illustrations that do a great job of complimenting the straightforward, clear writing style that the author uses to express the information. I admire this book because there's a relaxed tone that overlaps the writing, which does an excellent job of keeping the read from feeling `chore-like' without sacrificing the quality of the information and facts that I love to read about.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with The Dakota Scrapbook: Exterior, and it's not hard for me to tell that the information is backed by countless hours of research and well-refined editing, leaving this book in a tier of quality much higher than most others out there. For these reasons, I can't give this book any less than the 5 stars that it deserves. I will definitely be keeping an eye out for more by `The Cardinals'.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R79T32NWIHE34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KCZ75NS#wasThisHelpful","R79T32NWIHE34","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First of all, I feel that I should point out that I have read quite a few friendship/relationship-related books in my time, but I can definitely say that 'The Relationship Triangle' is by far not only one of the most insightful and and educational books on the topic, but also one of the most pleasurable to read due to the relaxed and almost conversational tone that blends perfectly with the writing style. The author has found that perfect medium of keeping the book informative - while also preventing it from feeling like a chore to read; this is something that I can't say for many nonfiction reads that I come across, and it's ultimately a huge part of why I enjoyed this book so much.The author offers some great advice regarding life skills in general for any kind of interpersonal relationships; this isn't a book solely dedicated for relationships between partners - it instead offers great info that can be applied to literally any kind of friendship or relationship and everything is expressed in a concise and straightforward manner and writing style that makes the best use of almost every single page in the book.Overall, I am more than impressed with the content and I know for a fact that I will be applying much of what I have learned essentially in my everyday daily life - what I admire most about this book is that it is full of actual PRACTICAL information that I found could be applied literally right away, I can definitely say that a large majority of the book really struck a chord with me on a personal level and almost the entirety of the read made a lot of sense to me. Although I am left satisfied with the read, I do wish that the book was longer - as I simply think that the author truly has a knack for giving relationship advice. For this reason, I am giving this book 4 stars, but I ultimately still consider The Relationship Triangle more than a worthwhile read, and I will definitely be recommending it to others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HD1GPQI28UKU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K1QZ5FI#wasThisHelpful","R1HD1GPQI28UKU","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The book offers a contemporary twist and perspective to what is easily one of my favorite poems, 'The Hound of Heaven', which I would also say is arguably one of the most classical & 'must-read' type poems to ever exist - and also one that I recommend to many of my literature-loving friends. Although I still prefer the original, I am glad that the author has included the modern adaption - as I think many people should be able to experience the message that Francis Thompson offers to literary world, and the classic version may be quite hard to grasp for some people, especially the younger generation (which was definitely the case for me the first few times I read it, many years ago).Of course, I already am a huge fan of the poem - so I won't base my ultimate verdict about this book on that. Instead I am giving this book 5 stars due to the effort that the authors have made to share the poem to a more contemporary, modern audience and also especially in regards to the professional and clear formatting and illustrations.I hope as many people as possible will get a chance to read through this book because, in my opinion, The Hound of Heaven is a timeless classic that should not be overlooked by anyone for any reason whatsoever. Overall, I give this book a 9/10 - and I will be looking out for more modern adaptions by the authors.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J9MIQM1AY08D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBA6FO4#wasThisHelpful","R2J9MIQM1AY08D","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I began this book completely ignorant to basically everything related to the current state of affairs regarding how veterans are treated by the current administration. I can now thankfully say that ""Something From Eddie"" has really opened my eyes and I feel much more competent in regards to the current condition of the system, and also how veterans are so poorly treated. Eddie's story is not only a powerful and and emotional read, but also an influential one that I can definitely say has left me with a changed perspective.What I admire about this book is that it's extremely professional and sophisticated, yet also easy to understand and read due to the relaxed and conversational tone of the writing style. The author has found that perfect blend of keeping it informative while also preventing it from feeling a 'chore like' read in any way whatsoever.In summary, I am more than happy that I decided to give Something From Eddie a chance, and it has not only left me impressed - but also with an author name to keep an eye on; I will definitely be looking out for more releases by Pam Baker.

"I have read many science-fiction/dystopian related books in my time and I would say that I'm at the point where I can tell very early on whether a book in the genre is going to be a 'hit' or a 'miss' for me personally. With that being said, it literally was only within the first chapter or so when I had realized that I stumbled upon a genuine 'hidden gem' of the kindle - and having just finished the read earlier today, I can definitely say that I am more than satisfied and very glad that I gave it a chance.What I admire about 'Hunters of the Last Dungeon' is the unique blend of influences from different genres that are evident in different scenes throughout the read - there's definitely a prominent sci-fi & fantasy feel throughout the entire book, but there's also parts where the book felt almost like a thriller due to a suspenseful and captivating vibe that stays throughout the book essentially from start to finish; there were many scenes where I found myself guessing what was going to happen next, but the author would throw in a very unexpected twist that would usually be completely the opposite of what I was expecting. I think the unique blend of genres that the author offers in ""Hunters of the Last Dungeon"" is a huge part of what kept this book such an enticing read for me, as I simply couldn't resist finding out how the story was going to play out; I'm trying hard to not throw in any spoilers, but I will say that the ending definitely was executed much differently that what I was expecting!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LDNR78Y8NKHM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KP5P2EY#wasThisHelpful","R1LDNR78Y8NKHM","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""Gas at 1.25 Per Gallon"" is by far not only one of the most insightful and thought-provoking reads that I have come across all year, but also one of the most enjoyable to read due to the author's easy-to-understand, conversational tone that overlaps the writing style - the author has found that perfect medium of keeping the information professional, yet it's still concise and straightforward to the point that it doesn't feel like a 'chore-like' read in any way.. The main aspect of this book that I admire the most is definitely how the author offers a completely unbiased & objective look at the current economic mess - there's no heavy political-party influence, and it's not hard to tell that Bob Rice is truly more than competent and educated on the topics that he chose to incorporate into this book.The even offers some great points of how we can all collectively move forward, and although I was slightly skeptical about the premise at first, I can now definitely say that most of the book is built on a solid foundation of research and it truly makes a lot of sense to me. ""Gas at 1.25 Per Gallon"" has really 'struck a chord' with me on not only a professional, but also a personal level - and for that, I can't give this any less than the 5 stars that it deserves.

"'Wilder Than The Rest; Book Six' is an absolute MUST read for any romance fan out there whom may be looking for a refreshingly different and new read- especially those that love a historically-accurate twist combined with a great blend of Western influence. I would say that Shirleen Davis has essentially mastered the craft, every literary device is pulled off excellently at the right time and the characters are believable and clearly well-thought-out to the point that I found myself thinking about them long after I had initially finished the read.. The style of the writing drew me in at a quick and smooth pace, giving me clues as to what will happen next... Then it would suddenly catch me off-guard with a twist or turn that the author would throw in - there's definitely a huge susepense/thriller element to Shirleen Davis' writing, and it's one of the main reasons of why I admire this author so much.

"The Big Wide Calm is by far one of the best YA/Coming-of-age related reads that I have had the pleasure of reading so far this year (and I am an avid fan of the genre, it's definitely my favorite and it's quite rare to not see a similar kindle ebook in my hands these days).I think I'm at the point where I can tell early on whether a book is going to be a 'hit' or 'miss' for me personally, based on a few simple things that I look out for from the beginning. Thus, I knew within the first few chapters that I had started reading an absolute top quality work, and I was essentially hooked from start to finish. I originally was recommended this book by a friend and although I was slightly skeptical about her praise at first, I now am aware of what all the fuss is about and, ultimately, I consider this more than a worthwhile read.It's not hard to tell that the author has read plenty of YA novels in his time and truly has a passion for the genre, the literary devices are pulled off flawlessly and I think this is the type of read that even the most critical readers out there could appreciate and respect. I'd give The Big Wide Calm a strong 9/10 - there were a few minor parts that could have been elaborated on more, but the overall read is well-refined to such a high standard that I feel this is really a 5 star book in the end.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3967GPGVRNHY3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K6QI0PU#wasThisHelpful","R3967GPGVRNHY3","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I absolutely love it, I finished the book a few hours ago and I am left more than inspired from the author's words; the advice is easy to understand and read due to the relaxed nature of the author's writing style, yet it's incredibly professional and beyond insightful essentially from front to back. I found myself connecting on a personal level to most of what the author says and I knew instantly how the advice can be applied to my own life - the overall content of the book is very relatable and I feel that the author is not only offering information from a professional, objective perspective, but also a personal one - which I think is a huge part of why this book has proven to be so meaningful for me, it's not hard to tell that the writer is truly competent and understands what she has chosen to incorporate into the book. One of the main chapters that really stood out to me is the one about ""A Few Ground Rules"", this was a prominent part of the book for me because I was glad to see that the author, Ariana Alessandro, focuses on an approach that relies staying independent and not undermining oneself for any kind of man out there.Overall, I am more than happy with the book - I do wish that it was longer, but I am still definitely excited to see what else Ariana Alessandro can offer readers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R336WPWHV5R2O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JYZGMUY#wasThisHelpful","R336WPWHV5R2O7","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"With science-fiction being my favorite genre, I have naturally always been a huge fan of any kind of dystopian or apocalyptic scenario in a plot. With that being said, I am confident enough in my reading that I can say I can read and can interpret whether a book is going to be bad, good, or exceptional - all within the first few chapters. I knew early on that Nine Meals was going to be one of those exceptional 'hidden gems' that we, as post-apocalyptic fans are always searching for, and it has gone way above and beyond my initial expectations.The first thing that stood out to me is the pure originality and uniqueness of the plot, setting, and circumstance. The author didn't need to 'borrow' (steal) any archetype or proven mainstream elements to make his story; instead, he crafted a highly admirable book that I am sure even the most critical fans out there will be able to enjoy.

"Absolutely amazing! I started using this with my child a little over a week ago, and I have already noticed some significant results. Usually my son gets bored FAST with most apps that I introduce with him, thankfully, this isn't the case with this one and he seems to be enjoying it more than ever. The layout is very colorful and child-friendly, but the real value lies in how well it teaches - all of the games are very practical and clearly thought-out. For an app developer to make a game that is educational AND fun at the same time is quite a feat, and so this gets 2 thumps up from me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LNX4YHXQC1AV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUUQ172#wasThisHelpful","R2LNX4YHXQC1AV","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I initially became intrigued about this book from the description.. I had no idea that it was going to play out in the way that it did, though! The story starts at a smooth pace that gradually gains momentum as the author introduces some new influential characters and a few twists and turns here and there.. By the time you're in the middle of the book -it's too late ! You're already hooked and there's no looking back. The plot is executed near flawlessly. The overall vibe of the book feels really unique to me, it seems to have a blend of many elements that you would usually find in very different genres. There's definitely a strong paranormal influence, but also some romance and a vibe of suspense that keep it enthralling and exciting all the way until the end. Overall, a great read and I highly would recommend it - I will be suggesting the read to a few close friends of mine ASAP","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHF2EW6DAUCY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IT5ADXC#wasThisHelpful","RHF2EW6DAUCY0","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't have possibly found this book at a better moment in my life. I woke up one day this week and absolutely KNEW that I had to change my lifestyle and body, and Stay Fit for Life is the definition of the perfect resource/tool that is capable of helping me do so. The information is clear and straightforward, and it's all based on proven, time-tested research with a solid foundation behind it.I admire how the author covers both the physical and mental side to losing weight; even the things we consider to not be in our control (for example: genetics effecting how we lose weight) can still be worked around, and Stay Fit for Life offers the right information to do so. I highly recommend this book for anyone that is 100% SERIOUS about improving their health and going out there and making their dream body a reality. If you plan on reading this and set it aside like all of the other diet books (I used to to this exact thing) then don't even bother reading it; Stay Fit for Life is designed for the people who are ready to change and make a difference for once, and I am sure it will help many readers out there.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6G8M63LARHM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DKALIJY#wasThisHelpful","R6G8M63LARHM3","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love this book! Awesome epic fantasy action. Baleron is our hero, and hes cursed, but hes not going to let that stop him from kicking bad guy butt, is he? No!The novel is paced faced, with lots of twists and turns. The writing is tight and atmospheric. The setting is very Lord of the Rings-ish, but without the cutesy elements. No hobbits or bumbling dwarves here. But there are elves, and orc-like bad buys, a Dark Lord whos sweeping the world in shadow.Its dark fantasy and not for people who dont like a little bloodshed and adult situations. But for those that do this is your book. Classic adventure sword and sorcery, with an epic scope, and AN AMAZING DRAGON. Seriously, the best dragon thats come down the pike in a long time.Cant wait to see what happens next!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZMUX1G1R9JOX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I49CR50#wasThisHelpful","R1ZMUX1G1R9JOX","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Trolls be gone! This book is exceedingly well-written and well-plotted, with an amazingly fleshed-out world and terrific characters. The plot is fresh and original.Part One was awesome, and Part Two is even better. Things are really at their direst, the war has heated up, and the main characters are all bouncing off each other nicely. Raugst in particular emerges as a terrific character. He began the story evil, but his love for Niara and her awful sacrifice have made him free of the yoke of the dark powers. He is his own man now, but will he use that freedom to help the good guys or the bad?Meanwhile Giorn is trying to rebound from what happened to him at the end of Part One, trying to heal and rallying supporters to his cause in an effort to oust Raugst. Poor guy! He suffered a lot during Part One, but now is the time for him to kick some ass. Hes such a likeable hero we want him to succeed even though we sense that toppling Raugst at this critical time might be bad. Then again . . .This is where Niara comes in, trying to be a bridge between the two men. She tries to teach Raugst how to be human, and on the side of the light, while trying to make Giorn see that Raugst has changed.During all this, the dark lords armies have driven north and are about to overwhelm the good guys, and when they arrive . . . well, its pretty awesome. Dramatic and tragic, but full of action and adventure. The War of the Moonstone truly is epic fantasy done right, dark and juicy and cool. I heartily recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SOMT9TZQZ4KI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IIXU54C#wasThisHelpful","R1SOMT9TZQZ4KI","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What I really admire about this book is that the information can be applied to a wide variety of businesses, regardless of their size. There's some advice clearly aimed at quite larger companies, yet I, as a small business owner, have gotten more than my money's worth with the entirety of Decoded, and am ultimately left beyond impressed. What I have learned from this book will surely influence many of my future business decisions in a positive way and my only wish is that I would have had this resource available to me many years ago.The book's premise focuses on a different approach than what most are accustomed to; it's an adaptable and flexible one that focuses on keeping up with contemporary changes and taking advantage of great opportunities that newer, data-based technology offers; it may seem slightly daunting at first, but the author does a great job of expressing everything in a straightforward and concise manner that is easy to understand without sacrificing quality. It's not hard to tell that the author (and coauthors) are truly competent when it comes to business management, and I doubt there are many sources out there that are as helpful as Decoded.I found the real life case studies to be great examples of what the Decoded perspective is all about, it helped me understand the concepts in a realistic and practical setting due to the wide variety of companies discussed; there's a reason why certain major companies stand out and continue to be successful and Decoded does a great job of showing how and why they do it.In summary, Decoded is an absolute must read for anyone involved in business - no matter what field a company specializes in, or how big it is, I am sure that it can benefit from Decoded in some form or another. Decoded gets a strong 5 stars from me and I would strongly consider it a ""must read"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJP0JARY3Z429/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EV4ZRYK#wasThisHelpful","RJP0JARY3Z429","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An absolute gem of a book in every sense. I was expecting a sort of ""you get what you pay for"" deal due to the small price, but I am instead left thoroughly impressed by the amount of professionalism and pure advice that Herbal Remedies offers.The author is clearly competent and knowledgeable on the topic and I can tell that it's not re-written, recycled advice (which I seem to be coming across a lot lately). Most of it is definitely new for me and I haven't come across it before, but I have a lot of faith in the book and it seems to be backed by a lot of science. I am not going to exaggerate and say that the info has changed my life drastically, but many of the remedies definitely seem like they could make a difference and I am very excited to start, as the author provides a very strong and convincing premise. I will definitely be checking out more books by Gigi Ann Louis as soon as I have some free time, if they're even half as good as Herbal Remedies, then I am sure I will be more than satisfied.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMWALOOSC3TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9QGR4K#wasThisHelpful","R2LMWALOOSC3TW","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An absolutely top quality book in every aspect of the word. To say that I am left satisfied would be a severe understatement; the content has turned out to be way above and beyond my initial expectations and it has already been proven to be worth the time investment of reading it.I found the tips about self-publishing to be especially helpful, I had suspicions, mainly due to sites such as Amazon, that relying on a publisher (or middle man) would be a waste of time until I had already proven myself; I think the Theresa Ragan case study is a great example of this and a good way to become informed so that traditional publishers can't easily take advantage of the author.Overall, it's a fantastic read and the clear, straightforward writing style does a great job of cutting out all of the filler and instead focusing on the reader in the most efficient way possible.

"It didn't take me very long to find myself hooked right into The Book of Occult, to the point that I found myself reading it whenever I had a chance. It took awhile for me to finish (it's long; a great bonus for me) but having just finished a few hours ago, I am definitely happy that I gave it a chance. The author does a very admirable job of capturing the environment, vibe, and characters and expressing them in a vivid and visually rich manner - the overall read is a smooth and there's rarely any flaws.The Book of Occult has everything that defines a great book, yet with the author's own unique twist that does a great job of keeping fresh and captivating. There seems to be a blend of influences from different genres but definitely a prominent thriller/suspense vibe; this is executed in a great fashion by giving the reader clues as to what is going to happen next, yet always managing to play out differently to keep it captivating.In summary, I am very satisfied and I will definitely be recommending this to some close friends of mine. It may not be for everyone and might be a 'hit or miss' for most people, but if you're like myself and you respect and admire an author that isn't afraid to be different - then I would suggest checking this book out.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R473S0L736NLF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GH3K1NU#wasThisHelpful","R473S0L736NLF","A4IA1Q5W73W06","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4IA1Q5W73W06?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

He absolutely loved it and, even though I never really shared his passion to the extent that he does, I even found myself enjoying the read when I gave it a brief look over and actually ended up reading it before I showed it to him. I really had no idea that something as seemingly simple as an error on a coin could make it worth MUCH more than what it originally was made to represent.It's not hard to tell that the author is truly knowledgeable and competent on the subject and I found the pictures that are incorporated into the book to really help me understand and be able to know how to spot these subtle differences for myself.

"I have always been interested in the paranormal to the point that I can say I have literally read dozens of books on the subject. What originally intrigued me about this book is the emphasis on using photography as as medium to capture paranormal activity; I found this appealing because I haven't came across this before and so it wasn't long after discovering the book when I found myself indulging in it. To say I am happy with my decision to give it a chance would be an understatement.I have read quite a few similar books where the author clearly over-exaggerates and makes up things to try to give the book substance, Marvelous Afterlife is different for me because the author gives it to the reader in a straightforward, no-nonsense manner without a strong bias so that the reader can make up their own conclusions based on the information. I really admire the smooth delivery the writing uses, as it makes the read not only insightful and thought-provoking - but also an ultimately enjoyable and entertaining read.

"I only just started getting interested in astrology a few months ago, but I can definitely say that I have read quite a few books on the subject already. Lisa Lazuli's horoscope book has been the best so far and it has been better than all of the others combined for me personally. What I like about this book is that the information is not only insightful and full of advice, but it is also practical; I feel like it would be good for beginners but I'm sure even the more astrology-competent readers out there could learn quite a lot. The only thing that would have made this perfect for me is if it had a section on health, I came across something similar before and I found it to be a great addition to the book.I especially admire the conversational tone that is used throughout the book to express the content, this makes the read a smooth, enjoyable one, as opposed to feeling 'chore-like' like some others that I have came across prior.

"I love how each story is completely unique and original in it's own right, each author brings something different to the table and it keeps the overall flow of the book fresh and intriguing from start to finish. I loved almost every story but my favorites would definitely have to be The Scoundrel's Wife, Avon Calling!, and Raiden's River - there's something about the author's writing styles that are used to express these stories that sets the tone for the rest of the book in a very positive way. Avon Calling is one of my favorites because its premise is based upon balancing the normal day of a 1930's housewife and mother with her night time adventures as a kick-ass assassin or whatever she is! Great fun and definitely something that I haven't came across before.The only way that this could be improved is if the Kindle version was easier to navigate with by a clickable table of contents, so that it would be easier for me to find certain stories to reread.

"The first thing that stood out to me about this book is the different approach that the book is based on compared to most other business related books.The author focuses on the inevitability of failure that comes with startups at one point or another, and how to move forward while learning from the experience. I feel that this is neglected in most business related books these days, as most authors want to focus on the seemingly easy part of a startup and to avoid telling to reader about the harsh realities that come with it. With this being said, I am glad that the author is not afraid to be straightforward and give it to the reader exactly how it is.

"I received this at a discounted price from the seller for review. And I can truly say that this is the most minimal iPhone 6 case I have ever seen. It looked so tiny when received. It arrived with a soft foam insert in it to hold its shape. I really thought it might not fit on my iPhone. It is a soft ""jelly"" like material and it stretched over the phone easily. After installation it was much better. It adds a soft grip feel and hugs the case tight. It doesn't protrude up past the screen at all so it will not protect the screen when the phone is set face down as in the stock photos. I would have a screen protector on for sure with this case. Even though it is thin and minimal, I find myself liking it. It is unlike any other that I have tested before. It will probably provide little drop protection especially at the corners, it will however keep the back and sides free of scratches. If you often find yourself carrying your phone without a case because you like the feel of the bare phone, you may like the case, and at the same time have a little protection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCSMKX5X1UXLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015C9DRMG#wasThisHelpful","RCSMKX5X1UXLC","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like the Symmetry Series because they are thin, protective and look good too. This is one of my favorite cases for the S6. It is simple, easy to clean and gives me that little extra protection that I know my phone will be ok from accidental drops. The rubber band feels great in hand and also gives a nice about of grip. I actually like it a little better than the MySymmetry Series because it feels slightly different in hand. I guess I could try to make an insert for the back panel that wouldn't slide around. It would be nice if they made a template. Anyways, 5 stars for a clean, elegant and functional design.I do think the price is a bit much even for a new product. $40 (at time of review) is a bit high compared to $15-$25 for the S5 version.

"I am testing this ZAGG Slim Book Case for iPad Mini 2/3 with an iPad Mini 1st generation. It seems to work fine despite the listing not including it as a compatible model.The hard plastic shell case holds the iPad mini securely and has enough of a front lip to lift the screen off a flat surface by about 1/16"". The volume buttons and slide switch are all aligned with the case openings and easy to reach. I have found that once paired with the keyboard, I don't use them anymore, opting instead to use the keyboard's volume buttons. I like the case as a stand alone iPad case. I would however add a screen protector if you don't already have one. This will not only protect the screen but also make it a little more durable to hopefully prevent any scratching or cracking.The shell case is easy to dock to the keyboard. It magnetically aligns and holds securely. It is also easy to remove by lifting one side up and the other will follow. I find that the hinge holds the position of the iPad well. If you try to tilt it back too far you could risk breaking the hinge mechanism or the case around the hinge area. It has been designed to only tilt back about 10 degrees past vertical. I think if you open it too fast you may risk this type of damage. As you tilt the case back it also elevates the rear of the keyboard to put it at a slight angle which is nice for typing.The shell reversed turns the keyboard into a nice stand, I have found it very useful for iPad use in bed or reclining in a chair. Book mode is ok. I prefer to detach the shell case and use the iPad without the keyboard.This really turns the iPad into a cute little laptop in appearance. My kids love it. I find it adorable. It makes them feel so grown up. It doesn't even feel like the iPad anymore.The keyboard feels great. It is a little tight for adult hands but quite useable. It is perfect for smaller hands. It was easy to pair. Just hold down the bluetooth button till the power button beside it starts to blink blue. It should then pop up in your bluetooth device list. I am not sure if the keyboard will last 2 years before needing a charge. I find that hard to believe and I know it hasn't actually been tested yet.So far I am totally impressed with this. It is really a transformation. I like it much better than the other keyboard cases out there. None of which make it look so much like a macbook as this one. I have been using ZAGG products for many years and have always had a good experience with the company. I am going to give this 5 stars. If any problems are encountered in the future I will be sure to update.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQWQRI7HYQX8Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7TQR3S#wasThisHelpful","RQWQRI7HYQX8Z","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I want thank Classic Accessories for sending out a unit for review from their new FadeSafe Line of Covers. I am putting it to the test.I became familiar with Classic Accessories every since I purchased my first grill cover in July of 2012 from them for $31.49. It is from their Veranda Series. Within the first year it turned from a nice beige with dark brown skirting to a faded mauve color. The fabric has never weakened or torn however, as some others have experienced with the Veranda Series. It is still in use today. My cover before that was a Charm Glo brand and it faded from black to gray and did weaken and tear in 1 year.I have been reviewing a lot of covers since then and many of them the Classic Accessories brand. They have been updating and improving their lineup over these past 3 years.The Ravenna Series brought in a UV resistant finish in a new gray color with larger re-inforced handles. I really like the look. It comes with the new colors at a similar price.The Sunbrella Line offers the best and longest life but at a much higher price point. I have several Sunbrella brand fabric awnings going on 5 years and they do last and resist fading. They come at a much higher price.So I am so far impressed with this FadeSafe Series. It has the same rugged and tough feel of the Ravena series, the Raven and Dark Shadow colors are pleasing to look at. The weight and feel of the cover is nice. The wind straps may be needed if you life in a place like Chicago, but I have found that I never need to use them because the weight of the cover keeps itself down. The mesh lined vents let airflow in which is a major concern if not done properly. These seem to be placed well and of the right size. Poor ones let water in and not much air. This creates an environment for mildew and mold, which can be a terrible thing if you have ever had that happen to your grill.I am very pleased initially with the cover. Of course time will tell the true story. I will be updating this review as time progresses. I have it placed on a Weber Genesis and out in the open where it will be exposed directly to sun and rain. It is not under a tree but sap does blow in the wind and I will also check to see how much staining occurs and how well it cleans up. Just from initial impressions I'm going to start out with 5 stars as it looks and feels very nice. This FadeSafe Series is about double the price of the Veranda and Ravenna series, but half that of the Sunbrella. I hope it holds up.... be back in a few months...","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QF3QLSCDWGN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016MNP0BW#wasThisHelpful","R2QF3QLSCDWGN1","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These old Swinglines will last forever and it is good to see that they still make them that way... Yes I do like the fancy red paint and one of my favorite NFL teams franchise on it. Get some good staples and this thing will make quick work of heavy duty stapling jobs. No problem with a 25 page document. It's heavy and durable and built like a tank.

"Infinity 3.0 continues where 1 & 2 left off. Disney, Marvel & now Star Wars. With Episode 7 due out in Movie Theaters soon, the timing is of course perfect. It is really nice to play as characters in settings that may be giving away parts of the movie before it is released. I will be real interested to see how much of it is accurate. Lightsabers are real fun to have in the Infinity World...I wish they could have fit all the game data on this disc so as to not need the older discs. We never use the 1.0 disc. Now that 3.0 is out we will probably never use the 2.0 disc. I just wish it integrated better so that you could go to all the previous playsets from the 3.0 disc.The previous 2 versions were 5 star reviews and I think this on is also.

"The Symmetry Series is one of my favorite for a sleek minimalist case that still provides protection. I like the bumper design as it sticks up above the screen enough but not too much. So setting my phone face down won't endanger it too often. I like to put it screen down if I'm outside and the sun is shining. Keeps it from getting too hot.I also like the feel of the Symmetry's edge band because it feels good in the hand while giving good grip. I have tested some other cases and the edge either felt sharp and too angular or was slippery.I like the button and charge ports on this case because they are large and easy to get too. Small ones make it frustrating to press the buttons. The clear area can get scratched but the inserts also help with making scratches less visible if you do get some. Over time the back will get less clear with micro scratches, but I usually only keep a case for around a year or so anyway.The inserts are my favorite part as I can feel like I have a new case anytime I want by changing them out. I like most of the OtterBox designs, but being able to print my own and with a little craft skills make my own insert is cool. I really can't think of anything that I don't like about the case. It is well made and of quality materials like most OtterBox cases are. Great case.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HXO6ATRVZXWU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X53T4FG#wasThisHelpful","R1HXO6ATRVZXWU","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I get these on subscribe and save for my kids. I keep them in the fridge along with other organic sodas and coconut waters. They usually go for these in the mornings and not everyday but perhaps 2-3 each a week. These are kind of expensive and I am glad that they aren't going too fast, but as far as a favorite drink this is definitely one they haven't gotten tired of even after a year of having it available. It always runs out before the next shipment. It is like a healthier and delicious chocolate milk / chocolate malt drink.

"I install TV's professionally and am always looking for great wall mounts. I wasn't sure what to expect for this $15 one. It seemed too inexpensive to be worthwhile. After being contacted by the seller to receive a free unit for review, I decided that it couldn't hurt. It arrived in 2 days via Prime Shipping and I opened the box. Here is what I found.Contents: wall mounting bracket, 2 TV arms, small bubble level vial, small package of assorted screws.- Screws - Usually with most wall mounts are a huge package of screws of varying sizes. I have hundreds of screws, spacers & washers left over from installs that I keep on reserve in case I need them. Nowadays I end up throwing away so many screws because I have too many. Having a smaller sized package of just the right sizes was refreshing. However, if this is your first TV mounting you may find that the correct screw size for you TV isn't included or already on the back of your TV. That may be frustrating. This mount is rated for 26"" to 55"" TV's. If your TV is larger than 40"" I would check the back of your TV to make sure that it doesn't take the larger diameter screws that are commonly used for these sized TVs. You can still use this mount but you will need those larger screws which can be found at a big box store. Better yet would be to get a mount that includes them. Also if your tv doesn't have a flat surface for the mount then you may need longer screws and spacers to accommodate the depth difference. If so you may need more hardware.-Mounting Brackets - The wall mount and TV brackets are made from thick gauge steel and are very sturdy. I see no problem with them holding up a 55"" TV. Just make sure to measure the hole spacings on the back of your TV. If they are wider than 18"" or more than 16"" vertically apart you will need a larger mount. The 18.5"" wide wall mount gives you the opportunity to land on 2 studs. If you don't and are close to the center of the bracket you can just supplement the single stud with molly or drywall anchors to each side. If the stud is to one side of the bracket you will want to make sure you anchor the other side with molly anchors or better and/or try to angle long 3""-4"" drywall screws into the stud that should just be outside the other side of the mount. Keep the weight of your TV in consideration. This should handle anything up to 60 lbs with no problem. If you hit two studs then the 110 lb weight rating shouldn't be a problem either.- Lock - To lock the TV on the wall bracket, you will first hook the top slots of the arms onto the top flange of the wall bracket. Then you lower the TV's bottom edge down till it sits flat to the wall. At this point you will need a long slender screwdriver. Preferably a philips with at least an 8"" long shaft. This will allow you to go up from the bottom of the TV between it and the wall, to tighten the 2 set screws that lock the bottom of the TV bracket to the bottom flange of the wall mount. The length of the screwdriver needed will depend on the height of your TV. Once these are set you will not be able to lift the bottom edge of the TV up and out away from the wall. This will then keep the TV secure.Conclusion. This is a very useable mount. Don't let the price fool you. It is heavy duty and well made. It sits tight to the wall for a very sleek install. Do take into account that cables, power cords and such may stick out from the back of the TV and may have to be accounted for. I would also preinstall the cables as you will probably not be able to plug them in after mounting. I trust the strength of this mount enough to use it on jobs. It's that sturdy. 5 stars.** Note - It is not a tilting mount if  you are needing that. Hope this review wasn't too confusing and provided a little helpful information. Hope your install turns out great and without too many hitches!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NBNZOPQ7D3VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146Z60KI#wasThisHelpful","R3NBNZOPQ7D3VP","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The most minimal OtterBox case yet, still offers very good protection. I love the way it looks on the phone and how easy it is to carry around. The bumper provides a good edge grip and the clear rear panel and raised opening trim protect the back of the phone very well. It seems a bit pricey and I would think it would be in the mid $20 range. The clear part does scratch so that is something that you have to be careful with.

"Ubervita really came onto my radar with their organic Turmeric Curcumin. I and many others with whom I shared the review bottle with, did find inflammation reduction benefits from day one. I have since purchased and take the Curcumin daily. Its effectiveness is superior to the many other Turmeric products I have take over the years. I specifically recommend Ubervita Turmeric Cucurmin now. Backaches, Muscle and Joint Pains all seem to be reduced by it. Now that I have a sample of the Cranberry, well its 2 for 2.Supplements are most always a subjective experience and hard to review. When you have had a back ache for weeks and taken and done everything under the sun to get relief and then find it with one product, it makes an impression. I find the Cranberry Extract to be the same way. You know when you have a UTI and you know when it's gone. It is a realizable and significant event. There are studies and research and I appreciate and learn from them. Then there is relief and actual experience for yourself. Your own research. This works for me. Here is another very useful and effective Ubervita product for me. It is really a better supplement.There are more active ingredients and in quantity too. They work well together too. Cranberry, Lingonberry, Uva Ursi, Dandelion, Chondroitin Sulfate, D-Mannose, Nattokinase are supplements that I have taken before, but never together in this mix and this easily. Quality ingredients too. The capsules smell very fresh and active.I highly recommend these and am sharing this review bottle with friends and family. Why not try them if you are having painful UTI's? Ubervita has a great customer service team and return policy. What do you have to lose, besides that fear of the restroom? ! I hope they work for you as well as they have for me!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE8J8SXAM34YE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010RN5OKA#wasThisHelpful","RE8J8SXAM34YE","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I reviewed a pair of the Ringside IMF Tech Sparring Gloves and found them to be very nice for $80. What you will find for the extra $30 to upgrade to these  are more details and robustness.- The smell of leather upon opening the bag was evident. It isn't 100% leather but the full exterior shell is. I think it is where it needs to be. It gives a nice solid impact and feel. The stitching is very well done. It is double stitched and durable.- The velcro closure on these is larger and more significant. I really don't see it wearing out or losing holding power. You can also clean velcro and it will regain more holding power. Often threads, fibers or dirt can clog the ""hooks"" and they only need to be combed out.- 2"" thick IMF Tech padding - I like this material. It lasts and holds up to many months of constant compression impact cycles. Less expensive gloves will wear out much quicker resulting in poor protection and hand ergonomics. Combined with the leather shell this gives a great feel when impacting during training.- I like the Quick Dry Oxford Nylon lining. Nothing is worse than smelly gloves and hands. I keep a small fan around that gently blows room air around the openings of the gloves after sessions. It keeps them odor neutral.- Attached thumb for safety. You can cut the strap that connects it if you really want to. I prefer it there.Here is the sizing chart:- 14 oz / M / R for Hand circumference of 7.25"" to 8.5""- 16 oz / L for Hand circumference of 8.25"" to 9.75""- 18 oz / 20 oz / XL for Hand circumference of 9.75"" to 11""These are a worthy upgrade from the Sparring series if you are daily training and need something even more durable and robust. These hold the wrist well, but I find a little more tape around the wrists then getting the velcro tension right makes the feel perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XFW4M0AHLFVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YPI6K4#wasThisHelpful","R2XFW4M0AHLFVP","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a nice entrant into the 2015 lineup of home theater projectors from Epson. I'm giving it five stars because it compares very favorably to the HT1075 Benq 3D projector that I have had as my main unit. LED and 4K are beginning to enter the market and I think the days for these bulb 1080P LCDs are limited, but for now this one has much too offer. It is plenty bright and the picture quality is amazingly good. The brightness does wash out the black levels and the whites also can suffer, with some calibration you can dial this beast in.Right out of the box the details and colors are amazing for animated and CG movies. I compared Penguins of Madagascar the Movie on both units and this Epson 2040 made my long standing sub $1000 favorite the Benq HT1075 look a little flat. The HT1075 seems to have better blacks and an overall better color spectrum, but the reflective shine on the octopus characters really pop on the 2040. You can see so much detail, it almost looks 4K. Hands down the image quality of the 2040 made a huge difference. Everyone preferred it to the HT1075. It made you feel much more in the movie.Then I moved on to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp, and the that is where things got a little weird. The 2040 looked worse. Not necessarily poorer quality, but it changed the look of the movie from a soft matte with vibrant colors to a little more like a Soap Opera on TV. You could see every pimple, wrinkle and blemish on everyones faces. Even the motion of people walking and other movements looked odd too. I went into the menus to see what was happening. There are 4 color modes - Dynamic, Bright Cinema, Natural, Cinema. I switched from Bright Cinema to Cinema. This helped to improve the black and white levels. I then turned on the Auto Iris for when ever it is in Cinema Mode. I chose high speed versus normal. This auto iris feature adjusts brightness on the fly depending on the brightness level of the scene in what you are watching. I found it to be a good feature for movies. The other setting that I found to help with the weirdness was the Image Enhancement Setting > subsetting Detail Enhancement. Default is at 40 if you turn this down, the picture will look more cinematic. I set mine at 20.The split screen feature allows you to project HDMI 1 on the left and HDMI 2 on the right. This feature works great if you need it. Presentations that take full advantage of this can be very compelling! It is easy to set up from the menu system.The focus and zoom rings are very smooth to operate. They also stay put once dialed in.There are many advanced settings available for the 2040 and I wont go into them in this review, but you can tweak and make changes to everything. You can see the 2040s Owners Manual online at Epsons website. I really recommend that you do prior to purchase as you can learn a lot about a product from its Owners Manual.Some things that I do not like:- The Proprietary Epson Quick Cool Down Technology. If I were a presenter on the road I would use this a lot to be able to pack up and go. However in a Home Theater Environment you aught to be able to turn it off so that the fan will give a good cool down and extend bulb life.- No lens shift. Lens shift adjustment allows you to compensate for projector mounting limitations. If you cannot get the projector exactly in-line with the top edge or bottom edge of your screen you can lens shift vertically to compensate for it. With this projector you have to get the mount just right. The BenQ has it.- The remote is small which is great for presentations, but for home theater I would prefer a backlit with bigger buttons on it. When doing calibrations that really helps. - I am seeing some minor motion artifacts around fast moving objects or people in certain scenes with a contrasting background. It looks like a blurry halo around that object.The Epson 2045 is the same as the 2040 except that it adds a wireless network interface so that you can send images to it thru a wireless network and wireless screen mirroring thru a mobile device.Overall this is a fantastic projector and my new favorite sub $1000 one. Sorry BenQ. It has a fantastic clear and bright image that is sure to make most all home movie goers happy. It also has a great feature set that makes it a powerful and functional presentation projector. 5 stars. Hope review was helpful.

"This is really not a bad product at all. It does come rolled up for transportation easy and compactness much like posters and some art. If you can let it relax and flatten out first you may experience better results getting it to stick on the wall.In designing a product like this there must be a balance that 3M is trying to achieve. They make many different adhesives and are know for their quality and expertise in this department. I image that they are trying to get just the perfect balance for good holding power and good removability without wall damage. The sheet is too large for their command stick series which hold great and remove great too. I guess they erred on the side of removability. So...I guess what I would do if I was placing it in a temporary location or testing a location, would be to tape it up using frog or blue masking tape. Then if or when I knew that I liked that spot peel the backing and try to stick it.If you are putting it in a permanent location and want it to stick there well, just use some 3M spray adhesive like 3M 21210 Super 77 Spray Adhesive. You will not have to worry about it lifting then.The tackiness that it comes with is mild to medium in holding power. If your wall is dusty or dirty or if you handle the adhesive and get fingerprint oils and such on it especially at the corners then it will lose its holding power. I would definitely recommend the peel the backing off as you go method of installation.Once up it works fabulously as long as it is on a hard smooth surface. Works great once installed properly. Perhaps 3M should have given better instructions and maybe even sent it out with 2 levels of adhesiveness. Thumbtacks can also make for a quick and dirty approach. Or build a frame around it. Of course you can just buy them framed. 4 stars. Hope this helps a little.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R203K8HHMHTDQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC1D5YM#wasThisHelpful","R203K8HHMHTDQV","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a pretty decent case for the Surface 3 tablet. It protects the back great. If you have or get a screen protector for the front then you covered. I think is actually almost 5 stars. I like the rubber texture on main body of the case. It adds just enough grip and softness. The bendable hinge portion does seem a little like it might eventually break, but I may be wrong and it will last a long time. It works great despite the thinness of it. It is very convenient to use, open and close. I also like the way it looks and the colors. I think 4 stars is about right.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDR2BAV4DM03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013LDVFCY#wasThisHelpful","R3CDR2BAV4DM03","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Sony 55"" 4K Ultra HD XBR55X900C generates mixed feelings. I wall mount TV's as a part of my business and just purchased and installed the XBR55X850C one month ago. The difference between the 850 adn the 900 is significant. If you want the thinnest mounting panel available then this one of the thinnest.It has been specially designed to be a thin set that can wall mount very close to the wall. The U-shaped bracket that it comes with is designed in such a way that it hangs almost exactly like a picture in a frame would. The rear shell has been designed to ventilate heat up and out of the top of lower rear panel section. You will need to deal with the ethernet, fiber optic and component connectors if you use them on the back of the set. They will stick out past the rear case a little and add depth to your install. However if you just use the HDMI jacks on the side of the unit then the rear case can sit flush to the wall. This will give you a total installed depth of only 1-1/2"". Looks wonderful. The power cord is an attached cord that originates if facing the back of the screen at the lower left corner. You can add a recessed receptacle to plug it into or fish it down and out the wall to a lower plug if it is OK to do so where you live. It is 4 feet long. I wish it was 6 feet and detachable.The are some trade-offs that this type of mounting system creates. 1st - you can not tilt the TV. So if your mounting it high and need to tilt down, it won't unless you purchase a 3rd party mount. (which you can, and I did to test this TV). 2nd - The wall bracket is only 8 inches wide which is not wide enough to span 2 studs on 16"" centers or even wide enough to guarantee that it will hit on a single stud at all. The TV is pretty heavy as far as modern 55"" flat panels go weighing in at approx 38.14 lbs. I like them with a little weight to them as the ultra light ones aren't usually good quality. I would make sure to anchor into at least one stud behind the bracket and shoring up the other side with some molly anchors or such. Even better would be to cut out a section of drywall and add a 2x4 cross brace.For those installations that do not require absolute thinness, then I would definitely purchase a wall mount that has a wall bracket at least 16"" or better yet 24"" wide and with tilt if you need it.Here is a model that I often use for a flat mount: Mount-It! MI-305B Premium Low-Profile Fixed TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32 - 60 inch LCD, LED, 4K or Plasma Flat Screen TVs - Super-strength Load Capacity 175 lbs, TV Stays 1 inch from the Wall, Max VESA 750x450 with 6 ft HDMI cableHere is one that tilts: Mount-It! MI-303B Premium Tilting TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32 - 60 inch LCD, LED, or Plasma Flat Screen TV - Super-strength Load Capacity 175 lbs - 15 Degree Tilt Mechanism Up & Down, Max VESA 700x450 with FREE 6 ft HDMI cableIf you use a 3rd party VESA compatible mount, the holes are spaced 12"" apart. Also be sure to install the U-Shaped Bar even if you don't use its wall bracket it came with because it adds rigidity and well as a 3rd vertical screw hole to attach the mounting arms to. If you install mounting arms without it you can actually dent in the rear case at the screw hole. It has to have the U-shaped bar in the channel in order to not collapse it. Trust me on that!This photo is of the U-Bar.So if you are thin critical and prioritize that then this TV will satisfy. If you are a video-phile then you do not want this set yet. I was hoping that Sony was sending these out for Vine review to show that the latest serial #'s had been improved. They have not been completely fixed. There is still light bleed at the corners and edges on black, letterboxed or otherwise dark scenes. I have found that it doesn't bother me at all. It is minimal in my opinion, but it is still there. My Review Unit has a serial number sequence of 50087XX and was manufactured in Sept 2015. The light bleed is not as large an area as the earlier units but still extends a few inches into the screen from the edge.In otherwise normal scenes the picture is fantastic. Out of the box I did have to run a calibration Disc. Like a lot of others, I use Disney's WOW on Blu-ray. Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray]. $17.29. Not the $239 six pack! From the factory it was a bit bright and thus washed out. Once calibrated it looks well, Wonderful. Hopefully Disney will be releasing a 4K version soon.The TV comes with a USB stick with some 4K content on it. I found it fun to see. The video of surfers being filmed from under water was especially interesting! Youtube has the best videos out IMO. Netflix, Vudu and Amazon look good too but not as good.The User Interface and menu system are great. The TV will want to update right out of the box and will not be usable until it does so! Once it enters into system update mode it will take approx 40 mins to complete. Factor that into your installation time.The navigation is pretty good. I would still recommend a Roku 4 or AppleTV or FireTV for ease of daily use.Once setup and dialed in this has been a splendid TV to watch. The aesthetics of it on the wall are great. It looks equally good turned off and just sitting there. The light bleed issue however can be significant. While I don't mind it in my TV routines, I would not want to have installed this in a clients project without allowing them to see and spend some time with the screen first. Bright daylight watching this would probably be fine. Night time movies... I would recommend you see it first before purchase.Hope this helps sort out some of the controversy still surrounding this 55"" 4K TV.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R65GXBHXP4GPP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R45XL64#wasThisHelpful","R65GXBHXP4GPP","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Invicta 21501 Men's Watch is very well built. It feels like a tank. It is heavy and substantial. You could probably hammer in 8 penny nails with it. The band is nicely done with a secure clasp. The face is nicely designed and attractive. The dials are functional albeit small and a bit hard to read, but very usable. The crown turns nice and smooth. I like the look and design. I have given this 4 stars and perhaps it is just my preference, but here is why I ""like it"" but did not choose the ""love it"" rating.I recently reviewed this watch: Lucien Piccard Men's LP-11187-02S Navona Analog Display Quartz Black Watch and it to me is a 5 star product. It sells for $82 vs. $104. It is also has ultra smooth mechanics and feel. From the back case to the front crown the fit and finish are just a bit more refined. I know they are different styles and materials involved. I just wanted to convey what a 5 star is to me. Watches tend to be very subjective, so aesthetics and materials aside, just looking at build quality I think this is a very nice watch for the price and that it is good purchase no, doubt. I like it but you may love it. It is definitely not cheaply made. 4 solid stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW9ELUYSTOKRZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01487Y8RQ#wasThisHelpful","RW9ELUYSTOKRZ","A1LA4K5JF78BER","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1LA4K5JF78BER?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I cannot say enough good about this gate. We don't even have it screwed into the wall -- it's just sitting on its own -- and our large breed dog (a goldendoodle that is already 22 pounds at 12 weeks and in an XL harness) jumps wildly at the gate and it stays upright and contains him. Eventually he might figure out he can push it across our wood laminate floor if he keeps at it long enough and then get out one side but he hasn't done that yet. The door opens and closes easily and it's so flexible that you can make it about any shape you can think up. We don't use it as a circular pen -- we use it to block him into the kitchen and dining area. It has been a Godsend and allowed us to give him so much space when confined as opposed to a crate. He can have the run of the kitchen and dining area and that makes us feel better about leaving him alone. Highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS04RITDV1QBB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003VNKLIY#wasThisHelpful","RS04RITDV1QBB","AOQ2IB802NXAQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOQ2IB802NXAQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My only complaint in that the sticker on the one bowl is so stuck on there I can't get it off.

"I purchased two of these when we sold our home and moved into a new one that needs a complete kitchen remodel that won't be happening immediately. The sellers replaced the range with an ELECTRIC COIL RANGE. I didn't even know they MADE those anymore! I had a beautiful kitchen at my last home complete with a GE Profile Induction Cooktop. I could not go back to cooking on an electric top range -- much less coils! I'd rather have a fire pit and caldron out back! So I ordered two of these and I could not be happier. They are powerful and work about 95% as well as my GE Profile Induction Cooktop did at the old house. The only difference is that they might take just a little longer to boil a large pasta-sized pot of water -- but still much faster than my mom's gas range. These are easy to move around (or store) and that makes life easy. If you need a cooktop for any reason, these are the way to go. Love them. Love the price.

"This is very hard to reach if you're short and I would not recommend it for kids old enough to shower alone. I am unable to put the hand sprayer back up on the hook -- my husband has to do it. It's also very hard to reach the controls on the main shower head and the one to switch between sprayer and main head. I'm five foot one. I realize some of this may be related to how high your shower plumbing is but my guess is that this would be hard for most shorter people. Beyond this, the box came without instructions of any kind. Thankfully it's all pretty self explanatory but it would have made us feel better to know we were doing the install correctly.

"This comforter is AWESOME! We bought one from Company Kids for more money when my 6 year-old was a toddler and this Astra one is MUCH niceer.

"These are HARD AS ROCKS. I could not eat them because they were like eating a handful of gravel. They actually fractured a tooth and now I'm having pain and discomfort. I have to see the dentist in a couple days and probably get a root canal or something. If you have dental work of any kind, or just value your teeth and don't want problems -- stay far away from these. If you want cinnamon sugar pretzels make them yourself with other brands of pretzels by tossing them with melted butter and cinnamon sugar.  Or, go to Auntie Annie's and get a soft one. Everyone in my family found these to be ridiculously hard. I wouldn't even let my 2.5 year-old have one because I feared she would choke. Aside from that, I wasn't even all that thrilled with the flavor. Won't buy again and tossed out the bag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LSVQIL5WB62N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IODYW54#wasThisHelpful","R2LSVQIL5WB62N","AOQ2IB802NXAQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOQ2IB802NXAQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I did have hopes that the stand itself could be attached to the wall but alas it can only be stood up long ways, short ways or laid flat.

Also we used tiny treats and I think larger ones will be easier to see and find.  I still have to say I love it though because over time I think they will catch on.

" 0:52 MinsI've had this skillet pan for a few days now and love it. I've made eggs in it and was worried the eggs would stick down in the bumps but they didn't- they literally slid off. Tonight we had steaks and again- easy peasy and amazing. One thing though- be sure to season it! It's in the directions included so don't overlook that step. One of the cool bonus features is that this skillet comes with protection in the form of a felt pad that sits inside it if you like to stack your pans. They do say this is a scratch resistant pan but the key word is resistant so be safe. I love the non-stick coating pans and this one is 100% PTFE and PFOA Free so that's the best part to non-sticks.

" 0:29 MinsThis watch combines my favorite two things in watches- leather and wood! It has a nice supple leather band that yes, smells like leather, however the black band does have some dye issues because my husbands wrist was discolored after wearing it. I'd suggest some kind of cleaning of the leather or spraying with a sealer. The face of the watch is surrounded by bamboo wood. It's one of the best looks I've seen and looks great with a casual look that I love. The watch is a Quartz which makes it even better. My husband loves these and wants them all.

" 0:41 MinsThe reddish brown color of the bamboo wood looks very nice. While I love the unique look of this watch and band when it isn't on my wrist it seems too overpowering when I wear it. The wood around the face of the watch is oversized which some people love. I think on a larger wrist it would look best. The way the band is off center causes the watch to not sit correctly (or just seems that way). I do think it's a beautiful piece and perfect for the watch collector.

" 0:36 MinsThis is a nicely done santa toliet lid cover. As you can see in the video we tried to see if it would fit on the lid top and also on the inside so when the lid is up Santa would be face forward. It worked but was a bit saggy tht way so we advise the traditional top method. The fabric was nicer then some I've seen although I want to note the pieces- eyes, nose, beard, etc are glued on and not sewn so don't toss in the washer if you want to see Santa come out in intact. Which leads to this- if it gets dirty ahem, by naughty elves that can't aim for example I'd spot wash. In any event it's cute as can be for all Santa lovers.

This weighs as much as 86 lbs and not only can be used for sending packages but also in the kitchen as well.

" 1:07 MinsOhhh, I always wanted to try one of the reflexology walk stones mats for foot massage. Well I kinda knew it would hurt a bit but ouch- standing on plastic ""rocks"" is rough on my sensitive feet, lol. Now I do suspect over time my feet would get used to it but the initial reaction I had was why was I doing this? Well according to reflexology it can help a multitude of things such as your innards- intestines, kidneys, and so on. So that makes it worth the effort. And they do suggest initially starting with no  more than 20 minutes each time, 10 minutes for elderly and children. Once a day or every other day. With ten times as a course of treatment. The mat is a long one with plastic rocks attached but which can be removed or rearranged an feet on one end. It can be rolled up for storage. Walking on it takes a special kind of person or the guts to not give up. So all in all I like it, but don't love it.

"These globe lights remind me like what you would find in a nature themed party or other type of affair. These globe lights are a bit more versatile than your usual string lights.  The cord itself is quite durable and seems like it will last multiple times and the outdoors easily. I personally have put mine in the patio to give it pretty good mood lighting. The light bulbs are not wired in series, so if one bulb fails, the rest of the lights still work. This is not like cheap christmas lights. Even after 5 hours or outdoor use, I was able to touch a bulb and it was only slightly warm. The efficiency of the bulbs are great! The fact that the bulbs are powered by batteries means that placement can be pretty much anywhere and you are not limited by outlets.The included small gift string lights have a very neat design that I think will compliment any festive decoration or christmas tree.

"There are many LED flashlights based on the CREE LEDs, but I would have to say that this is one of the better designs. First off, this flashlight is solidly built with machined aluminum which fits together perfectly. The rubber flushing fits nicely and everything is seated properly. The lense in mounted on a slidable focuser. One thing I've noticed with poorer quality flashlights is that the threads do not properly align sometimes cause striping after some use. There is no problem here!The reflector is a solid piece of metal and is a high surface area reflector. Using the focuser, you can go from a wide flood light to a very narrow long distance beam.Usage is very simple. Turn on the flashlight with a strong clicking depression. Change between the modes with a depression without click. The flashlight remembers the last mode it was in when it was turned off. Very useful as not all flashlights have this feature.In terms of light output it has a uniform field at the widest field. This light is EXTREMELY bright (so much so that the max brightness hurts my eyes when using it in such small quarters). The beam can be narrowed and the intensity much higher. I would likely use this for outdoors for the narrow beam. Please note that I tried to white balanced each picture since my phone does not allow me to control the white balance.The first picture is the flood light, the cone is about 60 degrees and the field is very homogenous. The second pic shows a lower intensity while field in case you need to conserve power.  The third picture shows the very narrow beam which is so bright, it actually hurt my eyes to look at it at this close of a range. It is functional for close up work, but if you want a brighter flood, I suggest getting a flashlight with a wider beam. This is definitely built with outdoor and long range in mind.On of hte best thing about htis flashlight is that it does not rely on any special battery.  A regular AA will power this flashlight nicely. Please note that I was provided a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DPCJBLNJ5VEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016UO5WZW#wasThisHelpful","R3DPCJBLNJ5VEZ","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This router/NAS/charger packs a punch and has a lot of functionality. First let me talk about the design. The router is made mostly of glossy plastic with smooth round edges. There is a USB (for external data source or charging), micro USB (for power), a SD slot, an ethernet port, and a single button. The router can be charged from a AC adapter with a micro USB or from a laptop with the micro USB. Essentially, you can use it anywhere.In terms of usage as a router. Here are the different scenarios for usage:Wifi repeater, convert a wired network into a wireless on, access point for a single MAC address, or sharing data using the USB port (think external drives or thumb drives) or SD card (compatible with iOS/androind/windows)Set up is very easy. Once connected, a captive screen will open or you can open any browser window to open the captive web configuration page (which you can see in my photos). There is a wizard that will help set up your device very quickly (which only needs to be done once). The router supports b/g/n on the 2.4 Ghz spectrum at a max speed of up to 150 mbs (this largely depends on the connecting device of course, mine shows 65 mbs). This isn't extremely fast, but it serves the purpose of streaming music/movies (1080p movies only using 10 mbs max anyways). The data access caps out at 150 mbs among all the devices connected. It is also pretty useful since my laptop only has one USB port to charge this device, it's nice to be able to daisy chain my usb drive, also.Some other benefits of this device are as follows:A) using one device to connect (the RAVPower router), but be able to connect multiple devices buy using it as an access hotspotB) Allow multiple devices to have a library of media or files without having to using up individual device space. I find this VERY useful for road trips and multiple people wanting to watch different things. It's much easier to have a single copy instead of copying over individual files to separate devices.The 3,000 mAh internal battery included allows for use for about 4-5 hours as a router (less if you use the storage) per charge. The device is capable of pass-through charging (aka charge itself and connected devices) and it does not heat up that much. Charging the device only takes about 3.5 hours to get it to max. There is not much heat production when it is charging or discharging, so I know it is pretty efficient. Even with charging itself and charging two tablets, the unit only got slightly warm. This is important since it means efficiency is high and there is not much energy wasted as heat.Idle drain seems to be minimal, but I will have to test it over a longer period of time.The included cable can be used to both charge the router and then flipped to charge your phone or tablet (except for apple products)Overall, a great product which I always bring around with my laptop.

"First off, the camera is an indoor camera which has a few extra features compared to other wireless IP cameras. There is a built in mic and speaker so that you can hear your recordings and also use the camera is video conferencing if needed. It also has motion sensing and can respond appropriately (sending you an email or start recording) or it my activate an external alarm/device (sold separately).Usage is very easy. You can connect to the camera through ethernet using the included Hootoo IP camera software to set up the WIFI connection and change any of the camera settings. Once the wifi connection is set up, you can dis connect the ethernet and place the camera anywhere within range of your router/modem. Please note that this camera uses 802.11b/g which is 2.4 ghz, so be sure to enable your 2.4 ghz band on dual or tri band routers.Connecting to the camera to view the video or control the direction is simple. The QR code on the bottom of the camera contains the UID of the camera so that the camera connection info can be obtained in the intranet or internet. The camera is protected with a username/password so unauthorized access is limited (unless you WANT to stream). There are 3 ways to control the camera, using the PC software, using the free hootoo IP cam (or other various free IP cam apps) on your phone, or using a web interface if you do not have the PC software. Please note that if you want to be able to set up this camera to be accessible through the internet, you will have to properly configure your router (this entails assigning a permanent IP to the camera and enabling port forwarding for the port that you choose for the web interface or video).The video quality is excellent, forgive my video, it does not do the camera justice because of third party encoding problems and bad lighting. The camera has low light LEDS which automatically turn on in the proper setting. There are many uses for this camera, you can stream video of your giant pandas, monitor the weather, use it as a baby monitor, or set it up to catch some ghosts.

"First off, when I felt this backpack and the material, I could immediately notice the thickness of the cloth and the straps.  Everything about this backpack looks and feels like it was meant to last.  For the main function as a laptop bag, it is able to fit my 15 laptop without problems.  The back is cushioned so you won't feel your laptop smacking your back repeatedly.  The leather straps for the pockets actually use a snap button to close (so you don't actually have to undo the buckle to get into them).  there is ample pocket space to carry a variety of items.  Two nice features I like is the leather bottom which is where I find previous backpacks were lacking as the bottom probably takes the most abuse.  The leather wrap for the carrying handle is also nice since I use that handle quite frequently.Overall, excellent backpack with a nice laptop sleeve. Used it to travel, go to the gym, and work. Great number of deep pockets that feel secure and would satisfy  anyone who likes to organize all their things just so. I got lots of compliments on the backpack! 5 stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WLIZ2CUGKSDB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z9NHW9K#wasThisHelpful","R2WLIZ2CUGKSDB","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set comes with two items, so i will try my best to describe them both.First off, the tote bag.  It is hard to tell in the pics, but the tote bag in seriously thick and quite well insulated.  The outside fabric is hardy and the inner aluminum is tough.  the zipper teeth are large and the metal metal handle big enough to easily grasp.  The srap is a thick fabric with a plastic length adjuster.  The attachment points are right over the center of mass, so it makes carrying very easy.  On the bottom edge is a button pocket for the wine tool.The tool is sturdy and is essentially pure steel. Unlike your usual bottle/cork openers that are aluminum or hollow ground, this feels like it is built to LAST. The hinges and springs are all solid metal. Sure it's a little bit hefty, but you can be sure that the durability is almost certain.Functionwise, usage is easy and self explanatory. The curved foil cutter pulls out easily enough and has serrations to cut the bottle foil easily.This type of cork opener relies on lever action. The spiral perpetrator flips out at 90 degrees (there is some hinge that keeps it in place) so that you do not have to find out the hard way that your twisting will be off angle. Once you screw into the cork a certain depth you are ready to use your lever action to pull out the cork. Once unique thing about this cork opener is that it has a two stage counter lever. The way I open my bottles is to screw down until the lip of the glass meets the metal edge of the spring loaded push metal. Once you Iever up the cork from the push metal all the way up, the cork opener lines up perfectly with the second metal piece up to the lip of the bottle.In the end, what this means is that you can quickly screw in the perpetrator and just lift twice in a row without have to screw in the cork opener a second time to find the right level for maximum lever force.Overall, this tool has a very professional look and is VERY solidly built.The complete set would make for an excellent gift or transporting wines to parties/picnics.

"Great device for the on-the-go traveler. This external charger/battery is solidly built and feels quite rugged. The large capacity allows you to charge your device 4-5 times (about 200% for a tablet or 450% for my iphone 5s). The two different ports allows you to have full speed charging tablets or phones (just make sure you have an appropriate USB charging cable if your device uses more than 1 amps).Unfortunately, like the flash memory market, there are many manufacturers that flat out lie on the rated capacities on their devices. If it's too cheap to be true, then it probably is a counterfeit. That's why it's essential that you buy from a trusted manufacturer. Here is a link detailing some unscrupulous counterfeits. http://www.geek.com/news/buyer-beware-unbranded-battery-packs-may-be-full-of-sand-1544064/Having tested out this product out myself, I'm confident that the capacity is correct as advertised.The device is capable of pass-through charging (aka charge itself and connected devices) and it does not heat up that much. Charging the device only takes about 3.5 hours to get it to max. There is not much heat production when it is charging or discharging, so I know it is pretty efficient.The included cables are standard fare, which is fine. Please note you will need your own AC adapter (or you can use your computer to charge).The flashlight is quite bright, on par to a 300-400 lumen LED torch.  The huge battery also allows you to power the flashlight for a long time, too!  There are two mode, solid light and flash depending on what you need.Finally, the solar power function. Many people complain that it is a gimmick and that in real use, it is not useful at all. The way I see it is that if you use this device everyday or every other day, this will function exactly like an external battery (aka the solar function is not a negative, nor does it significantly increase the price). The solar function is actually VERY useful if you camp out for extended periods of time. Or if you are like me, I use this maybe once a week or every other week and I just place this on my window sill and just charge it right before I travel. That way when I don't use it frequently, I can pretty much charge it for free.Also, on a camping trip, this could charge itself during the day and be ready for use as a light at night.  Very convenient!Please note that I was provided a reviews sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAXO0M73O73M4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IC1GJC#wasThisHelpful","RAXO0M73O73M4","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones are perfect for those late night marathons or gaming sessions when you don't want to bother the rest of the family/roomates!First of all, set up is super easy.  You connect the transmitter dongle to the RCA or 3.5mm stereo output on the TV or receiver and then set the audio output to that port.  The dongle automatically pairs with the headset immediately.  The volume controls are on the headset itself, so you don't have to fumble with remote to change the volume.In terms of comfort, the headphones are extremely light.  The tension between the headphones is not that strong either.  This makes it more comfortable, but less secure, so I don't recommend trying to work out with these on.  The range is easily 25 feet even through a wall or two.  I use rechargeable batteries for my set.  They last about 16 hours in the headset and well over 40-50 hours in the transmitter.  This likely depends on the volume level you like of course.Now finally for the sound quality.  This is quite good as long as you don't have a lot of interference at the 2.4 Ghz.  I've tried this at home where there is no interference and everything was crystal clear.  However, at my friend's apart where there are like 10 different wi-fi networks and any number of bluetooth devices, I noticed that there was a lot of background noises.  I know its interference because the same settings at home had no background noises.Overall, if you don't have much congestion in your area, I would highly recommend this!

"The first thing I noticed when I pulled this out of the box was how solid it felt and the weight of it.  This stopper is almost pure metal!  This speaks clearly for the durability of the stopper and I have no doubts that it will last years of abuse and drops.  It has a nice circular brushed metal appearance.  Usage is extremely easy.  Once you slide this onto your bottle, one or two pumps (depending on how much wine is left in the bottle) and the airtight seal is in place.  Wines which I would have normally tossed out after a few days now keep for weeks with no perceptible change in taste.  This really saves on money for when I host parties and gatherings.  Removal of the stopper is just as easy as putting it in.  With a little twisting and wiggling, it is off in a few seconds.One of the things I worried about would be if the silicone/rubber would stain or impart a flavor into the wine as I don't have much space to store my wine upright.  I'm glad to find out that neither was an issue and that even on the side, the stopper does not leak.Overall, a simple device to prolong the life of your wines!

"This compact LED lamp is a great desktop lamp but functions as so much more! First off, the lamp is a sleek and smooth design comprised of glossy plastic. The lighting element can flip in/out 180 degrees and rotate 180 degrees. The base of the lamp can either fold out to be a base or fold back in to align with the stemThe touch sensitive power button cycles between 3 brightness modes and is very responsive. I like the fact that the power button is dimly lit so that you can see it at night or when there is a sudden black out.  The fact that this lamp is battery powered and has a 180 degree neck allows it to function much more than a desk lamp. It also can be used as a flashlight when you need a portable light or during black outs.  By folding the base back into the stem, you can hold this like a light wand or place on the floor/counter and direct the light to where you need it.On the lowest brightness setting, I was able to get a good seven hours on battery power. This works really well if you need a temporary light which isas I just plug it back in after use and use it as a regular desk lamp.  The light temperature is a slightly warmish color which is good at reducing eye strain especially during reading.Please note that I was provided a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C4IU79BATQBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016AEDO5M#wasThisHelpful","R2C4IU79BATQBS","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wow, the first thing I noticed when I pulled this out of the box was how solidly it was made.  The whole device is pure metal which speaks loudly for its durability.  I have no doubt that this will withstand the abuse of multiple drops of crushes.  Usage is very easy, once it is charged, you can turn it on and flip the right side switch to either playback or record.  Once you record something, it can be played back on the built in speaker or using a headphone set.  Plugging the recorder into a computer mounts the recorder as a flashdrive and you can then copy over your recordings or even place music on the recorder.  With music on it, it functions exactly like a regular mp3 player, with a less user friendly experience though.The LCD on the front is easy to read and is backlit, so even during dark lectures, you should be able to see the settings.Now for the most important thing, sound quality.  This recorder has 3 different microphones on the top edge which is very useful if you aim it directly to the sound source.  You can also hold it straight up if you want to capture the surroundings, too.  At the highest quality, everything sounds crystal clear, some some background sounds becoming apparent.  This is not an issue with post processing.  I would prefer to capture everything the first time and edit stuff out than to miss something.The 8GB storage space is quite generous and is more than enough especially if you have a computer handy to transfer and organize recordings as needed.The recorder comes with some accessories.  It has a landline adapter to record landline calls (which I'm sorry I could not test), a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable to record from other devices, and earbuds.  The earbuds are decent quality, so if you want to really appreciate the high quality settings, use a headphone set.Overall, very durable device with a lot of uses.  I personally use mine to record lectures and play them back while I am studying.  I can see this easily be used for nature watching, interviews, or even movie production with the right microphone.

"Don't let the word mini fool you!  This is pretty much close to a full size humidifier that can regulate an entire room or a small apartment!This humidifier sure is nice to look at. It has a sleek modern look that will accentuate any desktop.First off, the whole device is pretty sturdy, only being comprised of two pieces. I like simplicity as it greatly reduces a part failure. The plastic is sturdy enough that I do not fear it will break even from a reasonable fall.The top pops off to reveal the humidifying mechanism. The top portion has a cap that you can remove to fill it with water.  There is a push valve and allows water to slowly drain into the humidifying heater. Anyways, function wise, it is a decent size so it does not take a while to get the humidity up of a room. There is no fear of overheating as the device will shut off if it does not detect any water.  The rate of humidification can be controlled with a twist control.  I like how the output spout can be directed which if you place this close to a wall or on your desk, you can direction where the main stream of mist goes.I found the benefits of humidifiers below:1) Being in the inland areas of California, it is actually closer to desert like conditions rather than sunny beach that everyone pictures. So increasing the humidity has really moistened my nasal passage A LOT. This is especially true at night or the morning when I wake up, I notice my sinuses and oral airways are dry to the point where it is uncomfortable for the first half hour I wake up. Having this humidifier run during the night has eliminated this problem all together.2) My sense of smell is FAR better now that humidity is up. I can really smell my dinner cooking and scents from candles far better when there is more humidity. Most people don't realize that your sense of smell is highly dependent on the ambient humidity. One of the reason why you can smell your shampoo and body wash so well while in the shower.3) My rates of epistaxis (bleeding from the nose) has drastically decreased. This may be a key point that some people will want to buy a humidifier. Dry nasal passages are easily irritated and damaged compared to moistened airways.4) Drastic reduction in dust motes (aka those floaty things you see in bright sun beams). Humidity increases the weight of floating dust which then falls to the ground where you can vacuum them up. This is a great way to clean up the air. As a side effect, allergies are also lest severe since the air is much cleaner.Overall, a very good electronic humidifier. A great side affect of increased humidity is that it removes scent particles in the air and also reduces smells.Please note that I was provided a review sample","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH582D0WBXNTN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035ARUPK#wasThisHelpful","RH582D0WBXNTN","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These sporty wireless headphones are great because they are lightweight, have less length of wires to tangle, and have excellent quality.I love the rubber inserts that shape the wire to go over your ear. This allows the headphones to someone hug your ear for a more secure fit. Also the thick wires and reinforced connections is great as this has been the bane of my earbuds as twists would build up and the earbuds would break at the weak spot between the wire and earbud. The curve is changeable so it can be molded to fit your ear shape. I was able to run vigorously without the device slipping or falling out. I can probably do cartwheels without the device falling out (that is if I could do a cartwheel...)Set up is quite easy. The headphones are charged through a small microusb slot on the wire dongle. Once charged, I was easily about to pair it to my iPhone 5 . The device in minimal, so there a few buttons to control the function of the device to turn on and activate the pairing mode and volume controls for easy adjusting. The device is minimalistic and is barely noticeable during use.The microphone quality is decent with only a little bit increased background noise compared to using my phone.Sound quality is good as there is no bias to any frequency. I prefer a neutral sound so that I can change it using the equalizer in my player rather than to deal with biases.There are multiple ear cushions for whatever shape your ear canals. Also a double flange cushion is included for longer canals. A small microUSB cable is included for charging.

"This is a great little travel pouch which has a lot of neat features.First off, the build of the pouch is great with no loose seams or strings.  The stitching is regular and complete.  The zippers have a small pocket which they tuck into so that they don't snag on anything.The majority of the pouch is made with a soft fabric.  The strap is a very soft elastic band which does not chaff your skin even after a lot of use.  The plastic clasp locks and unlocks quickly and easily.  The portion of the pouch adjacent to the skin is a soft mesh material which not only wicks sweat, but also allows the skin to breath.I've tested the RFID block capabilities by seeing if my cellphone NFC (a subset of RFID) works through the pouch and it was blocked.Also included is a very compact lock with a very sturdy locking mechanism!Don't let the size fool you, this is one tough lock. It is almost completely comprised of metal. The rotating code selector is easy enough to spin around, but has a nice click to each number. Setting/changing your code is very easy with the instructions labeled on the back. The bar is small enough to fit through he holes of pretty much any zipper, so you can probably use this with any luggage piece.

" 4:47 MinsThis Btrek H10 headphones are sleek and absolutely worth the money! First off, this is a supra aural head phones (aka, this sit on your ear rather than larger over the ear heaphones which sit around your ear). Obviously, this means, don't wear earrings while using this. If you are the type that gets ear pain from using these types of headphones, I suggest either using ear phones or over the ear headphones. If you have small ears, these might work as over the ear headphones for you.  With that out of the way, for people who don't mine supra aural heaphones, this is tough to beat.The build quality is fantastic. The ear cushions are very soft and covered with pleather which is great for long sessions as the sweat/oil is not bothersome. The head band also has a nice cushion for the top of your head although I did not find that too important as this device is VERY light. Comfort wise, I've use this in long gaming sessions (3-4 hours) with no discomfort afterwards. Again, this is widely variable how sensitive and the shape of your ears.1) Usage is extremely easy. There is a 3.5 mm stereo in for direct connection (and a provided cable which is a nice touch). Set up requires pressing and holding the powerbutton for 6 seconds (2 just to turn on). The external light flashes red/blue when in pairing mode. The device shows up and pairing is easy (I've done it with my iphone/win 8.1 tablet, and android tablet). Once paired, the process does not need to be repeated and pairing is almost instant once you turn on the headphones. The neat effect is that the heaphones has a built in voice notification when they are turned on/off and paired.All the buttons work as expected in iOS/win 8.1/android and again, this depends in the app you use have the proper functions. I was able to pause/play, skip and back up songs and adjust volume with a click of a button. No set up other than pairing the device was required.A neat feature is that there are voice prompts telling you the status of the headphones such as the volume and when it is paired/attempting to pair.2) Power usage is great. I'm able to charge the headphones using the included micro USB cable in about 3 hours for more than 16 hours of usage (again this depends on your volume of course).3) Range is about 30 feet and can go through walls easily.4) Now the most important aspect, sound quality. First, one of the signs of a cheap bluetooth audio device is the amount of background static. I test this by pairing devices and then MAXING out the volume on the host device and the audio device. If there is any perceptable static, you know you have a poorly made device. I can confidently say there is absolutely no static with these headphones, even when I was pushing the range limit and trying my best to increase background interference (using 2.4 Ghz wifi, mice, etc). In gaming, the audio plays true without any delay. This is a problem on some lower end devices.The spectral range on these headphones is great. I can hear highs/lows on all my music similar to my logitech G930 (which only advantage is that it is 7.1). The bass is good, but I tend not to have very bassy music.  I would say it is more neutral than anything without any bias or muddling of any particular frequency.5) Microphone: this may be the only thing that is not as great as my logitech g930. The microphone is built into the side of the headphone which means there is a further distance from your mouth for it to pic up audio. I would not count this as a negative though as it was clearly a design choice to have these headphones more compact that your usual fold out microphone. What this means in practical use is that the microphone tends to pick up more background noise than your usual stick phone. This is not a huge deal unless you like to type and use the microphone at the same time. People can still hear your clearly, but the typing is noticeable. Again, I think it's a tradeoff for more compactness. If you don't anticipate a lot of microphone using while typing, it will not be a problem for you.Overall, these headphones are top quality, something I would expect from a premium brand. In fact, i would consider on par in terms of quality compared to my Logitech G930 (which is over twice as expensive) minus the surround sound functionality.

" 5:37 MinsFirst off, if you are an avid music listener, you will be using your headphones for long periods of time. So the first thing you need to think about is ergonomics and comfort. Do NOT be fooled, there are no supra aural (or on-ear) headphones that should be realistically considered for extended use due to the fact that on-ear headphones compress and restrict blood flow to your ears and over the long term will inevitably cause ear pain. You MUST have a set that is circumaural (over-the-ear) if you even want to think about using something for more than 2 hours at a time. This Thor-X headphones are over the ear and apply gentle pressure over the skull in a wide diffuse area. Far more comfortable than your typical headphones. The cushions are very soft and gentle (and there are even replacements included as the cushions are usually what takes the brunt of everyday use). The next thing is weight. You can't have a lot of needless metal or electronics in the headset because weight over time means discomfort. This set has metal where it matters the most (the joints/extension) and the outer cups (where the headphones are likely to impact). No more and no less, adequate for what you need without being excessive. Finally, the cushioned headband is soft and gentle to your dome.Sound quality is the next most important factor (first for many of course). You need something that will accurately recreate your audio WITHOUT any frequency bias or muddling of frequencies. You DO NOT want something with ""deep bass"" or something silly like that because you want to hear the true and neutral tone so that you can accurate gauge the equalization and corrections needed to adjust said quality. If you have a faulty measuring device (in the case your headphones and ears), then your product is going to come out faulty and biased. I don't care if you love the bass! You can love the bass in your playback speakers, equalizers, devices or whatever, but if you are going to work with something, you have to work with the original sound first before you start mucking around. These headphones have a very neutral tone with NO frequency bias. I also did not hear rattling in lower frequencies unlike other cheaper headphones.Those are the two most important aspects of studio headphones. Everything else I talk about are my own personal preference and may differ from person to person.--Closed back, I prefer to not be an annoyance to anyone around me, it is also far easier to isolate noises with a closed back of course. Drawback is that if you are hot, you will sweat...--No in set amp. Given the large size of the drivers, impedance is high. Some headphones have built in amps to beef up the current to drive large drivers, but in the end that means more weight and more discomfort. If you are serious about your craft, you will have an external amp and I would prefer the extra amp weight to be on your table rather than on your head. They also have a nice benefit of not being so high in impedance that you can't actually use this in consumer devices though like other studio quality headphones.--Price. This is actually considered cheap for studio quality headphones (especially considering the competition). This is a low-end price for a surprisingly well preforming and comfortable mid-end headphones. In the end, you are getting much value for your buck here.--Extras: on wire-mic with controls.  Not necessary for studio work, but useful when you want to use the same head phones for travel.  The controls allow you to control your device and you are also able to make calls as needed.  Collapsible!  Very important for travel!  Also a carrying case to keep everything safe.Overall, I would say a very good value studio headphones which has comfort and true sound quality as top priorities.

I like simplicity as it greatly reduces a part failure. The plastic is sturdy enough that I do not fear it will break even from a reasonable fall.The top pops off to reveal the inner bowl and diffuser mechanism. This allows you to easily fill the humidifier. In fact, this has the simplest fill instructions ever. No need to avoid ""that hole/opening"" or to measure out a specific amount of water. Anyways, function wise, it is small so it takes a while to get the humidity up of a room, but it will over time. It is much more able to increase the local immediate humidity level rather than homes/rooms. There is no fear of overheating as the device will shut off if it does not detect any water or after 12 hours.I found the benefits of humidifiers below:1) Being in the inland areas of California, it is actually closer to desert like conditions rather than sunny beach that everyone pictures. So increasing the humidity has really moistened my nasal passage A LOT. This is especially true at night or the morning when I wake up, I notice my sinuses and oral airways are dry to the point where it is uncomfortable for the first half hour I wake up. Having this humidifier run during the night has eliminated this problem all together.2) My sense of smell is FAR better now that humidity is up. I can really smell my dinner cooking and scents from candles far better when there is more humidity. Most people don't realize that your sense of smell is highly dependent on the ambient humidity. One of the reason why you can smell your shampoo and body wash so well while in the shower.3) My rates of epistaxis (bleeding from the nose) has drastically decreased. This may be a key point that some people will want to buy a humidifier. Dry nasal passages are easily irritated and damaged compared to moistened airways.4) Drastic reduction in dust motes (aka those floaty things you see in bright sun beams). Humidity increases the weight of floating dust which then falls to the ground where you can vacuum them up. This is a great way to clean up the air. As a side effect, allergies are also lest severe since the air is much cleaner.Overall, a very good electronic humidifier. A great side affect of increased humidity is that it removes scent particles in the air and also reduces smells.Please note that I was provided a review sample","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20CELTXVV4A1Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014R1FMHI#wasThisHelpful","R20CELTXVV4A1Y","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This LED desklamp provides ample lighting while being much more efficient than your typical desklamp.First off, I don't think I can ever return to using fluorescent or incandescent lighting again. Incandescent lights are inefficient. Fluorescent lights are efficient, but have a very cold feeling and limited light spectrum.LED lights are both efficient and have a wide variety of color temperatures which more closely resembles incandescent lights or nature sunlight. I find that the warmish light from this lamp has far less eye strain that fluorescent lights.The base is a matte plastic with touch control.  There is a single button, with no frills.  I prefer it to be simple myself.The range of three brightness is very good and this single lamp can be used for both mood lighting or actual desk work. The stem is very flexible and you can aim the light in any direction. Again, this can be use to light up artwork or be used as a work flood light if needed.The lighting elements are covered with an opaque light diffuser which gives the light a nice smooth flood. You won't see multiple shadows from the multiple LEDs of this lamp.One extra effect of LEDs is that they are instant on so there is no annoying flickering on like fluorescent lights either.The base of the desk lamp has a USB output which is useful for charging your phone or powering another USB device (think desktop humidifier/diffuser).Please note that I was provided a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TVDVG7YAHX78/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01582A6F8#wasThisHelpful","R2TVDVG7YAHX78","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This URpower oil diffuser sure is nice to look at. I can lose myself hours at a time just looking at the colors cycle while the scents of my oils waft in the air.First off, the whole device is pretty sturdy, only being comprised of two pieces. I like simplicity as it greatly reduces a part failure. The plastic is sturdy enough that I do not fear it will break even from a reasonable fall.The buttons at the base are prominent and easily pressable with a mechanical click. The power input is smartly located at the bottom (so that spilling water can't get into it). The base even has a small cutout for the power wire to run through. It's these little design features that makes you feel that everything was though through before releasing a product.Filling the diffuser is very easy. You just pop open the device with a twist and fill up close to the top and drop in a few drops of your oils. In fact, this has the simplest fill instructions ever. No need to avoid ""that hole/opening"" or to measure out a specific amount of water. Anyways, function wise, the light cycles smoothly through multiple colors. The diffusing is very good. I especially like the fact that multiple diffusing time are available. This is VERY useful as you can change how much scent you want using the strength and time. I tend to use a stronger concentration of oils and a short diffuser time setting as I would have to refill the diffuser less frequently. It also helps with humidity control if you are concerned about that.Overall, a very good electronic diffuser. I've used my oils with many different modes of diffusing and in the end, I think an electronic diffuser is the most convenient and the best scent dispersal method. Potpurri is nice, but has a VERY limited range unless you are willing to use a lot of oils and risk have too strong of a scent. Reed sticks rot over time and if you don't make the right strength oil concentration can be hit or miss. Candles with oils always have soot build up (and the risk of fire). In the end, I feel that if you are a fan of great home scents, it behooves you to get an electronic diffuser and your own oils. It also gives you the ability to mix up your own scent concoctions.

"I've had the chance to try out many earphones, headsets, and speakers which are wired or wireless. These wireless earphones have a unique design which makes it perfect for high intensity activities.First off, the design. The earphones have an over the ear design with an adjustable earphone position and angling. I prefer the over-the-ear design as it offsets the weight of the earphones onto your earlobes instead of your ear canal. This means more comfort over the long term. It is also far more secure that just earbuds or inner lobe supports if you are involved in some heavy intensity work outs. The wire is generous in length, but has a cinch so that you can close down on extra wire length if you want to prevent the wires from getting in the way of your workout.  The ear buds are pure metal which speaks volume about the durability.  The wire has a clip so that you can secure any excess wire to your shirt.The quality: I've yet to destroy my hearing from listening to loud concerts, so I'm still able to appreciate a broad frequency range. These earphones do not have a specific frequency bias and would be described more as a neutral tone. I prefer this as you can use an equalizer to achieve the sound you want without having to have different presets that depend on which listening device you use. Some people do prefer a low frequency bassy bias, but I prefer to have my electronics handle that if possible. The earphones can put out a lot of bass if needed when I use my deep bass presets.Pairing is very easy and I was able to pair it with both my iphone and moto X. The call button is simple to use and functions easily on both phones. The function buttons work on all of my devices (win 8.1, iphone, and android). The buttons have been consolidated to minimize the profile of the control hub. A single press changes track and a long press changes audioCalls are on par with the speaker on my iphone 5. Because of the build of the microphone, background noises are more obvious, but people I've talked to say that my voice is clearly audible.A micro USB cable for charging is included. The battery on this device easily lasts 6-7 hours of normal music (~40 percent volume) with occasional bluetooth audio calls. Charging is extremely fast, taking only about 1.5 hours.

"Well, I wear a size 10.5 and these socks fit my feet perfectly. The heel patch actually lines up with my heel unlike the typical medium socks I would get at the department stores.I noticed that some socks are far thicker than other and it is actually recommended to wear shoes a half size larger than usual if you wear thicker socks. These socks are thinner than most and as such you can wear your typical shoes. The stitching is precise and regular and I did not notice any loose seams. There were no extra strings that were loose either. The spandex material makes the socks very flexible and form fitting which is great for active people as I found that pure cotton socks tended to bunch up in my arch over time.The rear edge has extra cushioning so the edge of your shoe does not rough up the back of your foot.One other benefit of the stretchy material is that there was pretty much no shrinking after washing, unlike pure cotton socks. i also prefer socks without conspicuous branding or logos as it seems silly that you want people looking at your socks, but that is just me. The low cut style avoids having the dreaded farmer's tan or how I like to call it white foot disease.The copper really works well as a deodorizer as I tested this after 3-4 hours of hiking and I noticed it is not as stanky as my usual cotton socks.Please note that I was provided a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13QIH1FUINP7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144CYW8K#wasThisHelpful","R13QIH1FUINP7T","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have pretty dry hair which sometimes feels stiff and easily get broken ends. I tried this hair oil and saw and felt results after a single use!First off, I use this after shampooing and massage a dime size amount into my hair/scalp and let it sit while I wash the rest of my body. By the time I rinse it off, it's been sitting in my hair for 5 minutes. There is no need for conditioner if you use this as it functions very well to give your hair body and moisture.The oil is pretty thick which makes it easy to work with to massage and get all of your hair. The scent is a fresh clean smell, but nothing that is too strong.After a single use, I was already feeling much smoother, slicker, and full hair. One of the things i was worried about was if there was going to be any residue from the oil, but this turned out not to be an issue. The effects even last through a couple of days of regular showering. I would say the optimal application schedule would be 5-7 days depending on how much your hair gets wet during the week.Please note that I was provided a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DXI2VS644TJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0144S0JJU#wasThisHelpful","R3DXI2VS644TJB","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 0:16 Mins I think this headlight stands out over the other options because of the zooming functions and the included accessories.First off, the lighting element is deceptively small, but very powerful.

The headband is an elastic cloth which is easily adjustable and is comfortable. The weight of the light and batteries are not too burdensome that sometimes I forget that I'm even wearing it.As for actual usage. The light has multiple brightness levels which can be toggled.

I can get about 4-5 hours in a single battery set at max brightness.The biggest thing about this headlamp is the zooming function. If you want a very wide flood for close quarters like working in the basement or under a car, you can have that. If you want to light up a hiking trail, you can narrow the beam and see quite far.

"This rugged bluetooth speaker from Kedsum is a sleek and rugged speaker with great audio output.The device is solidly built with a textured rubber housing and rounded edges. The buttons are a part of the housing which contributes to the waterproofing.Functionwise, this speaker has simple controls with an on/off switch and multifunctioning. There is no need to manually set it to pair as it is automatically started in this mode. Adding the speaker to your device is very easy (just check bluetooth devices and add it). Once paired, the pairing is automatic subsequently whenever you turn on the speaker. Switching paired devices is easy, you just have to turn off bluetooth or unpair from your device and the speaker will return to pairing mode. The buttons are minimalistic, but have full functionality to change the volume or pause your music. You can also use the connected device to adjust controls of course. Range is easily 30 feet, even with a wall in the way. The voice notifications for pairing and when paired are useful to quickly identify what mode it is in.Battery life is very good. I was able to get 8 hours at about 40% volume. I imagine it would be lower if you were outdoors at higher volumes of course. Charging it back up to full power only takes 3.5 hours (it comes with a micro-USB cable). The port for microUSB charging and 3.5 mm stereo is covered with a rubber piece for waterproofing. This speaker can easily resist splashes, but I would avoid submerging the speaker.Now the most important aspect, audio quality. The driver is about 1 inch in size. This is on par with your typical computer speakers. It is very comparable to a mid range computer speakers. Volume can go up very high. Again, you will not need it that high unless you are using this at an outdoor patio party though.Finally, one thing I always check on my bluetooth enabled devices is background noise when no audio is being sent. Cheap and poor quality speakers tend to have a baseline hissing or white noise. This speaker does now have that issue even at 100% volume. Also, a word of caution if you use this to pair to win 8.1. Windows will show two audio devices when you connect this. DO NOT use the one labeled hands-free. It causes windows to send out a very compressed audio signal and you'll get horrible quality.Please note that I was provided a review sample for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ9DTN7D1XZKT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01515N1E0#wasThisHelpful","RQ9DTN7D1XZKT","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have an older civic 1999 which is definitely not the leading edge of technology at this point. I did replace the radio with a sound system that supports auxiliary input. Anyways, this device is a bluetooth receiver which allows you to play audio/music from your mobile device without having to purchase an expensive bluetooth enabled stereo system. Installation is VERY easy, there is a small base with adhesive that you may attach to any location in your car that will then hold the receiver through magnetic attraction. Once the device is plugged in and the receiver stuck onto the dash (or any other suitable spot using the magnetic base), your phone/device will pair up to it immediately once it has been added.This is a very convenient device as multiple people, or even your passenger can use this device as needed and have both devices paired.The controls are intuitive and the button is large and easy to press. The rotating knob makes adjustments very easy as you do not have to fumble for buttons to control your device. The actual receiver is quite small and inconspicuous.The audio quality is great (which of course depend on your sound system), but I perceive the same quality as before when I plugged my phone directly into the auxiliary port. the included car port charger has a second USB in case you would like to charge your phone also which is another convenience.

"These sporty wireless headphones are great because they are lightweight, have less length of wires to tangle, and have excellent quality. Set up is quite easy. The headphones are charged through a small microusb slot. Once charged (which is quick), I was easily about to pair it to my iPhone 5. The device in minimal, and the buttons are located on a small dongle which is better than controls on the actual earphones as it actually is annoying having to try and press the buttons on the earphones. The device is minimalistic and is barely noticeable during use.  The buttons for volume/track change worked on both operating systems, too. The earphones also come with a rubber insert that helps keep the earphones in your ear lobes. I was able to run vigorously without the device slipping or falling out. I can probably do cartwheels without the device falling out (that is if I could do a cartwheel...)The flat cables are nice as it helps you identify twists quickly.  Unnoticed twists is usually what breaks my earbuds and the flat cables help prevent this.The audio quality is quite good. There was no bias for any frequencies and I did not feel that there was any specific frequencies that felt muddled. Volume range was good and these can even be used for airplane rides.What sets this apart from many similar devices is the aptX support. So I have an HDTV and a receiver (that doesn't support bluetooth) and every once in a while, I will want to game late into the night, but not wake anyone up. As many people have known or have found out. Bluetooth has been decent for voice calls, but for music and gaming, it is actually pretty bad. Music is compressed over bluetooth and prior bluetooth conventions prioritized compression over quality, so music was downgraded. aptX fixes that. However, aptX unfortunately requires more computational power and a side effect of that was that there was a noticable delay of the video an audio syncing. Not too big of a problem for music, but a huge issue for gaming and movies. aptX low latency fixes that. This is the latest in bluetooth audio technology and if you have an audio device that support aptX, do not do yourself a disservice and forgo a transmitter that supports it.The microphone quality is decent with only a little bit increased background noise compared to using my phone.Multiple silicone buds are included to fit you canals.Please note I was provided a review sample.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KGVXW8T2FKWS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016XQZ4KK#wasThisHelpful","R2KGVXW8T2FKWS","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mFi cable from Yellowknife is much more sturdier than your typical wire!First off, the functionality of this wire mirrors the authentic iPhone apple lightning cable (at a fraction of the cost, mind you). Charging, detection, and data transfer are at the same speed for my iPhone 6.What sets this cable apart is the build quality. This cable is mean to LAST. The cable housing is far more tougher and a bit stiffer than the authentic wire. The cable ends are built with a lightweight aluminum that feels like it can be kicked around or scratched without breaking. The wire itself is a thick braided cloth which gives it a lot of strength and resistance to twisting (which is what usually breaks wires in the first place).Anyways, some people will not like the stiffness and thickness of the wire. I actually preferred it because I needed a wire which will run along the floor and likely be stepped on or rolled over with chairs. This wire is probably the sturdiest wire for lightning I've ever seen!Please note that I was provided a sample for review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PHZJ4ZDX3CO7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013SS5T10#wasThisHelpful","R3PHZJ4ZDX3CO7","A6L9KOTK81C0X","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6L9KOTK81C0X?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These colorful magnetic pieces are incredibly fun for my nephew!  Each piece has magnets at the edges which allows them to easily snap together at 90 or 180 degrees with other pieces so you can start building structures immediately!  The magnetic strength is strong enough so tha tyou can build big structures, but not so strong that it is difficult to break them apart from each other.The magnets are small, but they are secured in the plastic so they are not choking hazards.

"My husband and I have both enjoyed previous installments of this series but unfortunately both of us tried reading this one and both of us found it a tedious read. It's the kind of book where it feels like it's nothing but talking and then changing the setting and more talking.That's not to say it's bad but I made the choice to DNF review it rather than keep trying to force ,yield to get into it.

"Even though I consider Rachel Vincent to be one of my auto-buy authors it's been quite a while since I read one of her books. I hadn't even read the blurb when I picked this up to read and it was really, really enjoyable. It took a little while to hit its stride, the first section was pretty slow, but once it gets going it's a hard book to put down. While I saw one of the big secrets coming from a mile away, I don't think readers who don't read a lot of urban fantasy are likely to find it as glaringly obvious.There's a maturity to Vincent's writing in Menagerie that makes it almost good enough to lure lit readers into the genre fiction shelves. What wound up keeping me from being able to rate it with five stars was the really open ending. Some readers love them, even I do most of the time, but this story felt like it had just started. Definitely still worth reading, I just felt like this was a book intended to be a series that was given a non-ending-ending in case it didn't sell well.If you're in the mood for a dark urban fantasy featuring cryptids that's reminiscent of the Rachel Morgan series in many ways I think you'll really enjoy it. I much recommend it!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DWYNW26TIXU7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=077831605X#wasThisHelpful","R2DWYNW26TIXU7","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I work from home and spend at least 8 hours a day in a chair in front of the computer. Which can lead to one very stiff and sore situation with my back, the lower part especially. I wasn't sure I liked the idea of a memory foam seat cushion but I couldn't not try it when I saw the layout. Tailbone support is a big deal and after a few days of use I think that's what I get most from it.Unlike most memory foam products this is impressively cool. I don't get the sweaty backside I assumed was going to be an issue. I also very much find the size agreeable, it should work well with most office chairs. The only caveat for me is that the spandex type material is easily snagged. If you're in a home office, as I am, and have cats expect it to have a shorter life span. My cat has already put two snags in it.Overall, my experience in just one week has been less lower back discomfort, better awareness of my posture, and a general decision to keep using it since it doesn't make me sweaty.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFVGVTR60XNE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011MKXG5W#wasThisHelpful","RFVGVTR60XNE1","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When I bought my home 6+ years ago I quickly realized that the kitchen light had an odd bulb that wasn't going to be easy to replace locally but fortunately it lasted until it randomly just stopped working on night. Rather than drag myself all over town or spend an afternoon calling all the local places that might have had it I figured I'd just queue up with Amazon since I already had something else to order. I was pleased to find the right bulb at what I consider to be a reasonable price considering the last one had made it for at least the 6 years I've been using it.It's easy to install and the only thing I don't like so far is that it is a warmer, yellower light than the previous one. Not a deal breaker, I just wasn't expecting the change from a whiter light considering I ordered the same bulb that was previously in the fixture. Chances are I'll wind up preferring it in the long run. I can't say anything in regards to the bulb's life yet, as I've only had it a few days, but I'll update the review when I feel like it's had significant time to note it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WIWMOX5JF1RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HJBEW2#wasThisHelpful","R1WIWMOX5JF1RD","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While I am loving this desk in general thanks to its layout, I have to admit that I think it has several flaws that are worth noting. First of all, this was a really heavy delivery, my UPS carrier was lucky my spouse was home. Keep that in mind when ordering. Secondly, it's cheap particle board and everything in the package will be covered in fine sawdust. Expect cracks and chips. The major crack in mine wound up hidden once it was put together but I worry the structural integrity of the desk is less due to it.It was generally easy to put together. I'm not very good with tool and putting items together but I did fine and it only took me twice as long as was suggested. The only trouble I had was with the drawer parts not working well. I wound up forced to use a drill to get it together.The usb station is a nice addition but this really isn't built for a tower cpu so there's no way to plug it in without purchasing a longer cord. I also have found the shelf clips remarkably flimsy and I'd recommend replacing them if you want anything heavy like books on your shelves. I was also very disappointed to find that the back side is all unfinished making it necessary to have it against a wall or get clever with paint.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it at the retail price. I don't feel that the quality makes it worth what is being paid. If you can catch a sale and keep in mind the issues I've pointed out, it does have a great layout and overall features. In that way it's made me quite happy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16XSSX8H8ON05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111LELCO#wasThisHelpful","R16XSSX8H8ON05","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While pregnant 6+ years ago I sustained a neck injury in a car accident. During the treatment I received for my injury my amazing chiropractor would end our sessions with 10 minutes of TENS treatment. It takes some getting used to but I was amazed at how much it eased the discomfort I was experiencing.I occasionally still experience soft tissue discomfort, in particular in the neck and shoulder where I was hurt so I'd been in the market for an affordable TENS unit for occasional use at home. This one from Santamedical fits the bill very well. It's effective, very easy to use, and I was pleased with the battery life between charges. The timer is adjustable and automatically shuts off the unit which I like. The 6 modes aren't all comfortable for me but I like that I have options for various uses. Sometimes you just want a different kind of stimulation on a different region of the body. The only thing I dislike about it is the pads themselves could be better, they tend to peel up easily from my skin no matter what I do. But those aren't hard to replace with a better set.Overall, I am very happy with it and feel that if you're looking for an effective and economical TENS unit that's portable and easy to use I would recommend it.Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.

"We've had this for 3 months now and I feel confident leaving a solid review now.

You really have to finagle them until they are both just right and even then they sometimes come undone. Especially if you want to use a plastic liner.

"If you're looking for a really comfortable pair of jeans, these are them. They're very soft and have great stretch. I have a really flat backside and these don't sag, but I'll admit I don't care for the shape of the pockets, they definitely accentuate the flatness. My pelvis is also on the shorter side so I find these sit much closer to my navel than I generally prefer but for those with a more average length there they should fit really well. The overall fit is true to size, unfortunately these gap in the back in spite of the claims they won't... and I have never had a pair of jeans that gap in the back for me!The rinse is quite a bit darker in person than in the picture but it looks like they've finally got the correct one shown. This is my first pair of jeans from Carhartt and it might not wind up being my last. I honestly never thought I'd dig anything Carhartt made and I live in a place where wearing the brand is part of our cultural stereotype but alas I'm starting to see why.

"I am loathe to write a DNF review. I don't write them very often as I hate not finishing a book, especially when I received a reviewers copy. Alas, LEGACY OF KINGS had three things bogging it down for me that ultimately lead to me making the choice to not finish and they were things I felt some readers may also find problematic.Writing in present tense narrative is something I hate and that was the first strike against LOK. One I could have forgiven if it had felt centered around two or fewer characters. Unfortunately, it just kept adding more and more characters until I began struggling to keep them straight. If you're one who is quite familiar with the characters in a historical context you might find this less problematic but for those of us who aren't it's confusing. The final straw was that nothing was happening. Lots and lots of talking. Then more talking. I just couldn't stay motivated to read LOK. I gave it a solid week to sway me and every time I read it just wasn't working.Guessing by the much higher ratings being given I'm betting that for the right reader this is a great book. I may decide to give it another go some day. It just wasn't working for me and for once, I felt confident that it was more about me than the book itself and I owed it to myself to move on to something I was enjoying instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GLMDV06I1DRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373211724#wasThisHelpful","R2GLMDV06I1DRD","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a different story. It's been a while since I was treated to a romance that had a solid dose of Bollywood spice and that's what I wound up enjoying most about THE BOLLYWOOD BRIDE. Ria is one of those onion characters, you just keep peeling layers and seeing more of whom she is. But I honestly never warmed to Vikram and their romance never felt like it was the central plot.While there's a touch of gothic romance underscoring part of Ria's past in good ways I found myself feeling as if Dev was trying to cram too many ideas into this book. Having not read her first book I'm not sure if this is just her style or an issue with this one only.If you're in the mood for something romantic that has a lot going for it beyond the happily ever after check this one out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Y3NDX8I5H4T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1617730157#wasThisHelpful","R12Y3NDX8I5H4T","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It's easy to use and easy to charge (love that it doesn't run on batteries or I'd constantly need to replace them). The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that I'm not completely impressed with the sound quality.

"It hasn't truly hit heater season yet here in Montana but when it hits I'll update this review with more of my thoughts on this heater.First of all, it's beautiful. We mainly need a space heater in our large basement bedroom and while we've had lots of effective space heaters over the years none of them have been as attractive as this one. If having one that doesn't look awful in a space is important to you this is a sturdy and attractive option. Secondly, what I truly love about it is that it's very quiet. If you're hoping to use it at night to keep a room warm (as I will be) it's a very low noise choice. I was also pleased with the length on the cord. My cheaper ones have all tended to have short cords but this one is long enough to keep it at a safe distance from my wall and furniture.Overall, while I haven't been able to use it when it's -10F outside and my basement bedroom is arctic I've found it very nice on the few cooler nights we've had. While it's not an inexpensive heater I think it's well worth the investment in durability, quality, and effectiveness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M6UF5CZWJ3AH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K172JQU#wasThisHelpful","R1M6UF5CZWJ3AH","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With all the early buzz about DUMPLIN' I couldn't help but feel compelled to give it a shot. I've always loved novels where someone who isn't the usual Mary Sue gets to take center stage but Murphy takes it just a step further and produces Willowdean Dickson, one of the most real characters I've had the pleasure of reading in a while. Rather than make the fat girl have a personality without flaws that makes her adventure a matter of size, Murphy created a girl so real and true to life it sometimes hurt.While at times I felt like the story tried to be too many things and jumped all over from themes of romance and friendship and familiar pressure and more, it was still engrossing. Two things killed my ability to rate it just a little bit higher though. The first was that it ended in a way that wasn't satisfying. I know some will be just fine with it but the word abrupt seems fitting to describe it and if those kind of endings bug you as much as they do myself you might find yourself disappointed. The second was that because of the way it ended a lot of parts of the storyline felt unresolved, actually the more I ponder it the more I think there wasn't really any resolution to anything.My grievances aside, there were so many wonderful characters and thoughts from Will within the book. Social issues of many flavors drop up and provoke thought and stimulate emotion. I personally felt grief for Will's aunt Lucy right alongside her. But other issues of class and status, culture and religion, sexuality and ability peppered DUMPLIN' with things I think are universally relatable.If you're looking for an excellent read for a book club that is sure to incite great conversations I very much recommend DUMPLIN'. One of the themes that overall will resonate with most young adult readers and adults alike though, is that we're all many things and sometimes things that seem opposite can be a part of us at the same time. You can be fat and beautiful, bold and insecure, love someone and not be in love with them. Even if you don't wind up loving DUMPLIN', you're sure to come away feeling as if you've had a heartfelt glimpse inside a character who is flawed and perfect all at the same time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GCAVRXORP6H5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062327186#wasThisHelpful","R3GCAVRXORP6H5","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm going to blame the phenomenal graphic novel PRETTY DEADLY for giving me really high expectations when I pick up a western read with a female protagonist. Or maybe I'll blame the cover artist who made VENGEANCE ROAD so dang pretty that I expected too much from it. Either way it was one of those books that started out promising but wound up dragging for chapter after chapter and then gave one way-too-obvious clue as to the climax.My overall disappointment with the story aside, it wasn't bad just not quite as exciting and mysterious as I had anticipated. I love stories where a young woman disguises herself and has a great adventure and Kate was pretty awesome. The Colton brothers were an enjoyable contrast to one another and the way they interacted with Kate both before and after she gets revealed. Not everyone will love the way the writing is done but I love a first person novel that has an accent or dialect that gives it a voice. Additionally, there's an enjoyable set of author's notes about what inspired VR and how she researched the setting and era that I loved.While I found VR wasn't what I thought it had the potential to be I'd still recommend it. As long as you don't go in expecting lots of horseback chases and shoot-outs, and a somewhat lighter western than the True Grit comparison implies I think you'll find it enjoyable. Especially if you like seeing a young woman on the path to revenge.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3WXIFZEMBOVG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544466381#wasThisHelpful","R3WXIFZEMBOVG","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've recently rejoined the workforce after 10 years as a stay-at-home-mom. One of my biggest challenges so far has been that for those 10 years I did all of the cooking and cleaning (etc.) and now that I'm working but still at home meals are a bit more rushed. So when the opportunity to give this Multi-Cooker a try I was totally stoked. I love kitchen gadgetry anyway and the multitude of features here was quite promising.While it's a bit tricky to do more than use it as a rice cooker I think it will be a wonderful tool once I've established some fantastic recipes beyond those included in the book that comes with it. For my first attempt I adapted an oatmeal recipe from the book using Steel Cut (Scotch) Oats, an apple, dried cranberries, and a little bit of honey. I honestly figured it would fail but since Scotch Oats have become a recent family favorite I was quite curious if I could set-it-and-forget-it. To my delight when I got it going around 9PM it worked like a charm. After 20 minutes perfect oatmeal was done. So I let it sit on the Keep Warm setting until the following morning around 7:30AM when we enjoyed a warm and easy breakfast for a change. It was a bit drier and stickier by morning but not unpleasantly so. I was very impressed.Some things I also feel are very worth noting are that it has a handle (which I will love for the occasional dinners we have with friends where I normally haul my slow cooker) and that you need to take into consideration it needs additional time beyond the recipe time to heat up. For example, it took about 10 minutes to warm up for my oatmeal making the time before it was ready closer to 30 minutes. It seems to also remember where it was at if the power goes out. We occasionally have bad storms where our power cuts out so I tested this by unplugging the cooker during my oatmeal's cooking time and it went right back to where it was.Overall, I am really thrilled with it and can't wait to experiment with the many other features it has. It's a bit spendy compared to most slow cookers or rice cookers but I think the combination of features makes it well worth while. It's attractive, versatile, and easy to clean. I'm not sure what more I could have asked for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DH836JXAFOOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W9MTT6S#wasThisHelpful","R2DH836JXAFOOC","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After my daughter had a meltdown while out shoe shopping with my husband I was informed that she had her heart set on Skechers Kids 81896L Skech Appeal Limited Edition Sneaker but at the time they were $50. If you've ever had a child in the preschool and early grades you know that you can buy a pair of shoes and they'll outgrow them overnight. So I was really hesitant to drop the cash on them. So I searched here on Amazon for a similar shoe that was a lot closer to our budget for a pair of sneakers for school and I found this pair of Twinkle Toes. Not only were these $20 less in price, they are far cuter.I honestly completely forgot that Twinkle Toes light up when I showed them to my daughter and asked if she'd prefer them. When they arrived she pretty much spent the next 3 days running because that sets off the lights. I also love that since she's learning to tie her shoes these have flat laces which I find are easier for her to grip and they stay tied for longer. Overall, I think these are a fantastic pair of street shoes that are priced just right for what they are. I'd definitely buy them again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22UBOVMVF9UI3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MBUIE0A#wasThisHelpful","R22UBOVMVF9UI3","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you love alternate history WOLF BY WOLF is an engrossing swap as a young Jewish girl attempts to kill Hitler. But it's also so much more. I don't want to say that there's a strong focus on relationships yet that's really an important piece of what makes this such a good book. Yael's relationships with the people she has lost and those she is competing against play significant roles in who she is and what she is trying to do.While I felt that at times it was slow or that it cut off where more information would have been useful WBW was a really good read and one I think most of the target audience will find enjoyable.

"While I was really impressed that this product did not irritate my sensitive (and highly reactive) skin, I do have a few reasons I wasn't impressed. First of all, no where on the package is a recommended frequency of use mentioned. I had to find that information here on the product page. Secondly, you wash it off after only 2 minutes while most other mud masks sit for 10... could this really just be a 10 minute mask that they tell you to wash off sooner to market it for sensitive skin? It just seemed fishy.Suffering from really awful adult acne that's hormonally driven and made worse by side effects of a medication I take I was hoping for a little relief. But I haven't noticed any difference good or bad in my skin. I made need to use it for a few months to see any change. I do like it in general though as it does leave the skin soft and refreshed without the redness I typically experience with masks touted for acne treatment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE0K0Z4MPP27O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TMRV8Y#wasThisHelpful","RE0K0Z4MPP27O","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kinda wishing I'd given Fluxx a try sooner, what a fantastic game! It's definitely one you've got to have some patience to learn but once you get it going and have a good grasp of the concept it's really fun. Complicated but fun. I would definitely recommend doing a solo double play rundown if you're new so you can see how the flow of game play goes. That worked really well for me.

"If you suffer from stressdon't we all?you've probably tried all kinds of things to help you cope. I know plenty of people who resort to happy hour or binge eating as a way to manage their but that's just not mine. A good book and a cup of herbal tea are always a nice and yoga or a walk in the park can be good too. For me, however, I find that my stress and anxiety tend to peak as soon as I'm trying to go to sleep and I remember everything I didn't get done or need to get done. Not always the perfect time to fill up on liquids or attempt a warrior pose, I'm tired and I want to go to sleep.So I accepted the Ohuhu Ocean Wave Night Light Projector and Music Player for review to see if it was an option that worked for me. It's really cool for other uses since it has so many light settingskids love itbut my goal was something to help me distract myself from a racing mind so I could fall asleep. I am 100% sold! The first time I tried it I think I barely made it 10 minutes before I dozed off. There's just something soothing about the gentle motion of the light and the soft blue color (the light setting I would recommend for those seeking sleep) that works. I love that it shuts off automatically after an hour too so it doesn't run all night long. If you were to pair it with ocean/lake/rain sounds I imagine the effect would be two fold though I chose not to.Overall, I think it's a great soothing or stress relieving item for the price point and since it isn't chemical it's great for small children and those with sensitivities. I do want to point out, however, that there is one light setting that flashes heavily and could be dangerous for those who have seizure disorders so use at your own risk. Other than that I absolutely love it and would recommend it.Note: I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RER26J5OU107N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P8T87FI#wasThisHelpful","RER26J5OU107N","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After hearing a lot of buzz about NAKED I was quite interested in the story of a girl who had been a prostitute going home. It is just as complex as I expected but I genuinely could not say that I liked it. The challenge for me was that aside from Jackson (and even he wasn't well fleshed out enough to be the redeemer for me) most of the characters were deeply unlikable. Not that every character or even protagonist must be a delight, but in a story where one wants to feel something resembling sympathy I found myself constantly scowling at the characters. It's easy to loathe the obvious ones like Anna's abusive father and her former pimp, Luis. But Anna herself was difficult to feel truly sympathetic for. The way she constantly defended Luis was bothersome but the way she would think down about herself for her former role and yet be scoffing about it a moment later like it wasn't a big deal just bothered me. The ultimate challenge though was the whole cartoony villain element. I don't want to spoil anything but I felt like I was watching Scooby-Doo with that subplot.While I wouldn't not recommend NAKED, it's not an easy read. It's the sort of story that makes you think and feel for those who have been trafficked. It had a good ending though, so if you like to see a character rise from something so dark I think it will satisfy you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ADW3PCSDHGWG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1633750078#wasThisHelpful","R3ADW3PCSDHGWG","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've read a lot of wonderful teen fiction from Entangled Teen over the years and even some that just didn't work for me. THE BODY INSTITUTE, however, is one of the most phenomenal reads I've had with the imprint to date. Not only does it touch on themes that could easily skew dystopian such as the government's control over a person's body, it also address issues of what makes a person a person. It felt much longer than it was because it packed so much into one novel.While a romance is a part of the overall story and I found it to be very unique and enjoyable, I was considerably more swept up in the pseudo science used in the world building. If you're looking for a great book club read for teens I think this would make for excellent conversations about the factors that play a role in a person's physical, emotional, and mental well being. I feel like young women in particular would greatly benefit from reading this and discussing it's themes. It could be deemed a little controversial due to the focus on how weight and health revolve around one another but ultimately it is this that makes it interesting.I was quite certain going into TBI that I would like it but I'd not expected to love it and want to tell everyone I know about it. While I can't imagine it every being into one, I think it would be marvelous as a film. It's everything I love in entertainmentromance, action, family, and social issues all wrapped up into one package. If you have a tween or teenage daughter I can't recommend this one enough.

"Holy so-similar-to-my-life-story Batman! Having attended a couple of online book chats before I read WRITTEN ON MY HEART I already knew that the author had drawn from her own personal experiences with homelessness for the story. What I didn't realize is that there would be many small subtle things that were so like my own life that I'd fall in love with this book each painful page at a time. Abusive, controlling stepdad. Check. Homeless. Check. Falling for a guy who is all kinds of right and wrong. Check. I have even worked as a barista. Perhaps it was all the things that I found relatable that made me love WOMH, it isn't every day that I find a heroine whom I so uniquely relate to.What I think most readers will love about it is just how deserving Lane and Ash are of the love they find in one another. They've both had some tough struggles that make them wary of their attraction to one another but good gravy the chemistry between them just jumps off the page! If you like your New Adult reads chock full of painful angst and your characters a little bit broken by circumstance before their happy ending, I think you'll really enjoy the journey Ash and Lane experience. It made me angry, it made my eyes wet (onion chopping ninjas were hiding in my house I swear!), and it reminded me that everyone should be so fortunate to find another person in who makes them feel safe and loved.WOMH is a wonderful romance and one of my favorite romances I've read this year.

"Phew! I had heard that Jackson was going to get crazy darker before he was going to change and dang is that spot on. If you haven't read the previous installments please do not read this review! I can't promise it won't spoil previous events.After the big cliff hanger ending of DEEP DOMINATION I expected things would start moving in a more positive direction between Hannah and Jackson. Boy was I wrong! If you thought things were dark before you are in for the worst kind of shock. Jackson is one hero I would never want on my bad side. He's capable of some pretty heinous behavior that I'd honestly never come back from but this is fiction and it works to show how messed up he is by what he has been through and how desperately both he and Hannah need someone to love them. It was pretty much the only thing I didn't like about this book, I hate it when heroes do something truly awful to the heroine and it is quickly glossed over. When he realizes what a terrible act it was it was really great to finally see the potential he had to be a good guy.This is one of the most out-there plots overall but if you're in the mood for something kind of over-the-top dark, nail-nibblingly suspenseful, that's full of good old-fashioned hardcore smutty goodness you need to get going on the Bought by the Billionaire serial.

"There are a handful of classics that I have a deep soft spot for and anything Alice always catches my eye. I've wanted to read Splintered since before it came out but somehow managed to not get to it until I finally bought an audio copy. I'm actually really glad I did as the narration was very good and I felt more free to just let my mind take over the painting pictures part of reading. If ever there was a classic retelling or reimagining that was more suited to letting the mind wander I don't know what it could be.Howard's reimagining is darkly twisted but not in the usual horror or gothic stylings many writers and artists choose. It's more earthy and surreal and works to delicious effect. I can see why so many people loved it. I loved it. Occasionally it felt a little bit forced, in particular the romantic elements, but knowing there are further installments I feel confident that I'll enjoy seeing where this rabbit hole goes. It's wicked and weird, sexy and sweet.If you've held back from getting to this series like I have I'd certainly recommend giving it that shot.

"Since the Mercy Thomson series of novels first came out I've been a huge fan. I remember the the excitement I felt when I picked up the first book at the store at random and found a map of my hometown inside. I've not been as avid of a fan of the comics but mostly just due to time constraints. I'm glad I took the time to sit down and devour this one though. Garcia did an excellent job of capturing the region while also bringing the characters to vivid life.It's not my favorite Mercy story but it was spooky and impressively not completely predictable. The story hinged much more on Jesse than Mercy which was also a nice change of pace. On a totally gratuitous note... hello crazy hot Zee. lolIf you've enjoyed the other comics/graphic novels I think you'll dig this one too.

"If you're looking for a beautiful, well-made floral head wreath I cannot recommend this stunning piece of Valdler Elegant enough. Each flower is handmade and lovely. They're tightly bunched unlike other low priced options I've found in stores and online. The ribbons are long enough that you have a lot of adjustability for both the crown and the wristband. For my daughter we chose to have her wear the wristband as an anklet to adorable effect but I'd dare say the same could be done for an adult too. Overall this is a striking pair that would be wonderful for a child, teen, or grown woman equally.I have a few ideas for ways I would use this that I wanted to specifically share for this blog post: This would make a fantastic photographer's prop both for portraits and editorial projects. Because it's well made it can handle a lot of adjustment and wear by children! Cosplay, renfaire, and music festivals! The high quality of this piece make it a great choice because it can hold up to all day wear and hot weather and the flowers look more real than many of the other options out there. Weddings and special events. This one is pretty obvious, it's inexpensive so it won't break your budget and if you're crafty you could easily add netting, ribbons, rhinestones, feathers, or other accents to individualize it to your tastes. Perhaps this pink version for the flower girl and the white version for the bride? A dress-up box item. We turned an old dresser into a really great costume closet for our daughter a couple of Christmases ago and filled it with clearanced Halloween costumes. But we've since added nicer pieces (now that she's older and doesn't damage everything) like this and some costume jewelry that make her feel really special when she plays. Perfect for a older child who loves to dressup.Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for this honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UZSU3Y1NKK0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYOEC7K#wasThisHelpful","R2UZSU3Y1NKK0L","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I knew from the first time I saw this cover that this book was gonna be for my almost-6 year old daughter. My kid has a pretty great sense of humor and sure enough she absolutely loves this book. To the point I'm kind of getting sick of having to read it to her. That said, this is one of those fantasticly fun children's books that has such wonderful subtleties that the kids might not notice that as an adult I really appreciated. Like Princess Pinecone being biracial. Or that there were male and female warriors of all colors AND body types. For me those are such important things for my kid to see in an enjoyable story just as much as I want her to love fart jokes as much as I do.If you love gender-neutral stories with princesses and warriors and ponies that fart you (and your kids) will love The Princess and the Pony.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT689DV1RS02W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545637082#wasThisHelpful","RT689DV1RS02W","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having used Zaca's patches for hangovers in the past I thought the chewables would make a great option for workout recovery. With the summer heat and the HIIT workouts I've been doing on occasion I find that sometimes water and a protein filled snack aren't enough. I still feel drained and wind up so fatigued that I have a hard time getting a solid workout the next day.So far I've found that 2 tablets about 20 minutes after I finish followed by some water works well for me. Normally I avoid stevia like the plague because it majorly upsets my stomach and overall digestion but I've found that not only do I not taste it (ugh I hate that sickly sweet taste it has) I haven't had the tummy trouble. They even taste good and not weird or medicine like as many of them do.If you're looking for an easy to carry recovery option for your gym bag I would definitely recommend checking them out. I honestly haven't had a drink in a long time so I can't say if these work as well as the patches for a hangover but I think they'd be even better based on how they've helped with my hardest workouts.Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YPHZLJULTVQV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAX3D0M#wasThisHelpful","R2YPHZLJULTVQV","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up quite poor. I remember watching my mother slice the moldy parts off of 'government' cheese for sandwiches while things like chips and snack cakes were luxuries I only saw in the lunchboxes of my peers. But if there's one thing growing up mostly in poverty will teach you, it is how to be resourceful and grateful for what you do have... because there is always someone who has much less or does not have the skills to make do with what they do have. With this in mind I was quite eager to see what Brown had put together.GOOD AND CHEAP has a lot of fantastic information about not just how to prepare food, but when and how to buy it to maximize your budget. Whether you're receiving SNAP benefits or just living on a tight budget as a single-income family there are recipes and information here that will help you eat well and even quite healthfully.The one area it doesn't seem to hit on that I felt would have been of great use is food allergies. Having discovered earlier this year that my partner is allergic to wheat, rice, corn, potatoes, tomatoes, and a host of other inexpensive staples I struggled for several months with horrifying grocery bills trying to find ways to avoid allergens while on a very tight budget. I'd have liked to see some budgeting advice for those who are struggling with food allergies or celiac disease because those conditions affect low income families just as much as those of wealth and alternative foods can be costly.Overall, while I feel that some of the recipes and ingredients were still a bit unreasonable to expect someone of limited means to get on board with, GOOD AND CHEAP is still a fantastic general resource for anyone who wants to eat well with limited funds. This would make a terrific gift for young adults new to living on their own.Notes: Review copy received via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DUPRIYJ5Q4G2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0761184996#wasThisHelpful","R1DUPRIYJ5Q4G2","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm still not sure if I like this series or not. I know that's a terrible way to open up the review but as much as I'm enjoying the characters I feel strangely detached from their adventures. I think something that might have made my enjoyment stronger was if I knew much about the poetry mentioned in the blurb or the churches of London. Even the undead fights felt a bit dry.I did find that while this plot had really draggy parts this time around, I felt like the characters had more going on. Especially Malcolm, whom I have really grown to like more and more. In fact, I felt like Simon and Kate took a bit of a backseat to him this time. The scenes featuring Imogen and Charlotte were my favorites.The mystery this time felt a bit anticlimatic and it ended on a small cliffhanger that makes me quite glad the next book is coming out so close to it.Notes: ARC received via NetGalley.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CF2JU8B7U2HN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345540484#wasThisHelpful","R3CF2JU8B7U2HN","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd never tried resistance bands before getting this set to try and I'm now wishing I had been using them much sooner! There's so much you can do with them from physical therapy exercises to actual strength training workouts. My primary use for them though is increasing my flexibility through stretching. Sometimes you just can't reach your own foot or other hand and these bands provide a simple and effective solution.While I don't have any basis for comparison I feel confident in recommending these to those seeking a great set of bands at different resistance levels. I tend to stick with the medium most days and if I'm feeling like I really want to challenge myself I will go with the heavy. Maybe some day I will advance to the x-heavy but it's pretty hard core. If you've never added resistance bands to your fitness routine I think this set from Phantom Fit is an excellent place to get started.Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for this honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCN44G2LPSN7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L07J5BW#wasThisHelpful","RCN44G2LPSN7G","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Awwww you guys! While ANYA AND THE SHY GUY had a couple of tiny continuity issues and it was pretty far-fetched, I couldn't help myself. I loved it.There's always something fun about the twin-swap in a romance and I totally fell hard for Will/Matt. If you adore the funny types I think you'll like him too. I couldn't help but picture a teenage version of an adorable celeb who recently became a mega-star. Anya on the other hand, earned a very special place in my heart more based on circumstance than personality. I have a big soft spot for teens who are or have been homeless, especially the ones who are smart enough to pull off what Anya does. I really wanted her to get her big scoop but at the same time I hated the idea of her story destroying S2J. I think you'll be as pleased as I was with the way their story plays out.I came in late to the series and read DAISY AND THE FRONT MAN first and I think you could almost do the same for AATSG but I would recommend starting from the beginning. There's enough back story about who the secondary characters are that felt unexplained enough I think you would enjoy it more if read in order.

"My friends and family think I love to cook but the truth is... I love to eat! And if you're not going to go broke enjoying eating there are things you learn to cook. But whipping up the basics had never really seemed like a thing you could do until I stumbled on this book on NetGalley last year. Translated and adapted from the French version I found it exceptionally accessible and friendly.While I had originally sampled it as an advanced readers copy I wound up buying it because I liked it so much that I wanted to have a permanent copy. I've admittedly not actually used any of the recipes yet but I've been hoping to start making all of my own mayonnaise, ketchup, and the chocolate milk powder from the book. If you've ever considered purchasing a cookbook to teach you the basics I would definitely put this at the top of the list. From marshmallows and crackers to hamburger buns and fries you're going to have an arsenal of basics you'll never have to buy again... and you'll always know what goes into them!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2788D4E9YUULJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KLNAII0#wasThisHelpful","R2788D4E9YUULJ","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's no secret that I'm not that big on contemporary romances and even less into New Adult. When I accidentally accepted a review invite for HIDE ME I was pretty peeved at myself but I went against my gut and figured I'd just give it a couple of chapters before I DNF'd it. Yeah, I went in knowing I wouldn't like it... and came out loving it.Whit Conrad is terribly deep in grief and running away from any chance at happiness she could possibly have when aimless surfer boy Deo Beckett happens into her life. I'll admit his chick-magnet, disgustingly confident attitude irked me at first. But it wasn't long before he grew on me and I really wanted him to win Whit over. Equally so I hated how much she was forcing herself to suffer needlessly. They are that young couple with sizzling sexual chemistry that uses it to keep from going any deeper at first. But when he wants more and she pushes him away I was surprised because of how directionless he seemed.Peppered with smolder love scenes, angst thicker than molasses, and grounded just enough in reality to feel possible, HIDE ME, is a page turner that kept me up way past my bedtime. Having gone in not expecting to like it I was stunned when I finished the book and immediately thought to myself how flawless it had been. I was definitely in book-high because it has a few minor flaws but they were so little to me that I don't even feel like I need to note them in this review. I'll let other readers tell you what didn't work for them since I enjoyed it so much I went on a spree of adding every single Silver Strand book to my Want-To-Read shelf on Goodreads as soon as I marked HIDE ME finished.If you're a fan of New Adult where there's a lot of physical intimacy between the hero and heroine countered with drama outside of the bedroom I have to recommend giving this book a try.Notes: ARC received via NetGalley.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PP7AAYJVQQYJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZOK7VQM#wasThisHelpful","R1PP7AAYJVQQYJ","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With no clue where we got lice from I found out on a Saturday evening that my 5-year-old was infested and since she had been waking at night and climbing in bed with me... so was I. *facepalm* After 10 hours of shampooing and laundry I went to bed at 4am and was so itchy I couldn't sleep so I started shopping Amazon for a better lice comb and found this. I ordered it and paid the extra to have it shipped out as fast as I could. Let me tell you what... it was worth every penny!!!After spending 3 days hand picking as many nits as I could my eyes and fingers were tired and between my daughter and I (both with very long hair) and my teenage son (turns out he had some too) we'd spent 6 hours every night at it. On day 4 the comb arrived and while there was a minor learning curve to it we reduced our combing time dramatically to about 4 hours. By the 4th night of using the comb we were completely lice free.Is this going to mean you won't get reinfested? Not at all. But I can say that I think it was a miracle. My husband went to the Fairy Tales website and watched the video and we followed the same procedure each night. It made it hurt less and cut down the amount of time he was spending going through my hair and the time I was spending on our kids. If lice are a common occurrence in your schools I recommend purchasing one of these. It's really not that expensive for how well it works and how much time and stress it saves. It truly made all the difference for us.A huge thanks to all the other reviewers who shared their experiences with it, you're the reason I decided to buy this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14PXOXQC47QP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002STJFP2#wasThisHelpful","R14PXOXQC47QP4","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read a wonderful book called Everyday Witchcraft by Deborah Blake earlier this year I decided that I wanted to add a morning oracle-related ritual to my day to help me feel grounded, encouraged, and inspired for the day.I have a couple of lovely oracle decks that I love but I also had this one wishlisted because I adore the artwork of Jasmine Becket-Griffith. While her artwork for this deck is not my favorite, I still love the beautiful cards. But I absolutely have hated the card interpretations. They're all so negative. I thought perhaps I was just drawing a lot of unhappy and hard stuff due to recent circumstances but when I began looking through the book more I found that the general tone is just icky. A lot of the interpretations read like you're doing something wrong. I have found it very discouraging and that it goes against the reason I use an oracle deck in the morning. I've decided not to use it anymore.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R322SDFRELCO9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1582703051#wasThisHelpful","R322SDFRELCO9J","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a fun and different set! I've been waiting ages for the folks at Mattel to do a Monster High circus theme and this particular set does not disappoint. It's not often I don't want to let my daughter have the Monster High toys we get but this was one of those times when I really wanted to keep it for my collection. Rochelle has such fantastic hair and I love the swing.The one major flaw I see to the set is that the picture of Rochelle as well as the Manny photo are made from cardstock and for younger kids these might be easily torn.

"I love strange books. I love strange characters, worlds, writing styles. I should have known by the Gaiman quote on the cover this was going to be fantastic and odd in all the best ways. That said, it took me several chapters to warm up to the story even though I was loving Headley's voice. It's a tricky thing to make a world within a world work and as an adult reader of YA I sometimes struggle with letting myself believe it. Once I warmed to the idea the pages seemed to fly by and I found MAGONIA difficult to set down.I feel like anything I could review in regards to the plot would spoil discoveries I think readers should get to uncover on their own but I will say that if you like alternate histories or parallel universes this has similar elements. Though I was left with some unanswered questions and threads left unraveled I thoroughly enjoyed MAGONIA and have put Headley on my list of authors to watch.Romance, airships, strange biology, outcasts... this book has it all. If you enjoy the work of Neil Gaiman or Diana Wynne Jones do not miss out on this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I2HCWHFFJA8W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062320521#wasThisHelpful","R2I2HCWHFFJA8W","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Where has this been all my life? I'm pretty much a coffee and herbal tea drinker but I've recently been considering keeping some coconut water on hand as a nice post-workout option and I think this one totally fits the bill. I was really skeptical about the idea of a chocolate drink that had the thinner texture of water but after having my picky 5 year old and equally picky spouse both sample it we all agreed it was like a thin chocolate milk. None of us taste coconut.If you're looking for an after workout drink that tastes indulgent instead of the artificially dyed fruity sports drinks that are out there I would definitely recommend giving this a try.

"It has been a wonderful and wild ride being a reader of the Hard Ink series. With any romance series ending novel it can be a tough challenge for an author to close out existing series arcing plots while still providing a great romance story. I've been through it spectacularly with Kaye once before and I am thrilled to say that once again she blew me away with a heartfelt romance and a fantastic end to the plot that brought the Hard Ink guys together.Kat Rixey is just as complex and great as her brothers, their family dynamic is great. But it's how she manages to get the previously grunty and closed-off Beckett Murda to... dare I use the word bloom... that makes this a really great romance. Their sexual chemistry is off the charts and while it really is the catalyst that brings them together, their love develops slowly and sweetly. I honestly was pretty ambivalent to Beckett before HARD TO LET GO but after I think he's one of my favorites. Like the saying goes, still waters run deep, and there is so much going on underneath his silent brooding facade.If this had just been another installment of the series it would have easily been one of my favorites but as it was tasked with closing the series it was so much better. To finally get the resolution to what happened to Frank Merritt and the guys' team, who was really behind it all... wow. I won't spoil it for anyone but there was a scene there at the end that made me cry, it was so unexpected and perfect and well, it added a reality to the military aspects of the story that I think every reader of the series will appreciate.As she always manages to do Kaye made me laugh, wince, pant, and reach for the tissues. I am once again reminded of what a fantastic talent for storytelling she has and I am super eager to dive into the spin-off Raven Riders series I once begged her to write. If it's even half as good as HARD TO LET GO and the rest of the Hard Ink series is it's going to get loads of recs from me.If you are new to the series please, please don't start here! This is one series you really need to read in order to enjoy the mystery and development of each of these wonderful characters. That each also touches on real issues faced by military veterans be they scars emotional or physical makes them all the more valuable in my eyes. Hands down one of my most recommended romance series. Just go start reading them!Notes: ARC received via Edelweiss.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RP3X2KTOZE39Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OP06D34#wasThisHelpful","RP3X2KTOZE39Y","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dang! If you read my review for the previous installment in this serial you'll know it pushed my boundaries intensely but that I really enjoyed it. Love it even. But I had a much harder time with DEEP DOMINATION's sex this time around. Everyone has a thing or two that they just don't care for and spanking is high on my list of no-no's but I can often pass over it no biggie. But then there was some pretty hardcore deep throat action that while written very sensually was really uncomfortable for me to read. I was just cringing and holding my breath just to get through reading it. Neither are my cup of tea so I didn't dig the erotica part of the book as much this time around.Hawke ramps up the vengeful hate-effing this time too. He's so hard to like and yet so easy to love. I burned through the entire book in one sitting anxiously dying for Hannah to just tell him he had the wrong sister already. The dark thoughts both have are deliciously dramatic and if you ever really want broken people to find healing together you're sure to find yourself wondering how these two will fare once the truth comes out. It could almost be terrible, however, Valente is a master at taking these dark things and polishing them just right so you can see the sparkle hiding under all the dirt.

"My 5-year-old and I are Monster High fanatics and though we've slowed down our collecting considerably due to the sheer unaffordable amount of new products they put out now we had to have this one! This is one of the coolest Monster High toys we've seen in a long time. Astranova really floats!If she just floated it would be pretty neat (yay for getting to explain the magnets to my little one) but the added lights that respond to music or even just voices make it ridiculously cool. I honestly wanted to do a video review but I can't pry this away from my daughter long enough to review it without her spazzing out about it. lolThe neatness of it aside I have to admit it has very little play factor for what you pay. You can't put her guitar in her hands after you use it to get her floating (you'll see what I'm talking about when you read the instructions). Much touching at all makes her either fall or stick to the magnet again. I would consider this one more of a collector piece compared to most.

I'm so glad I did because I love a good boarding school story and this one is really good.Since I was previously unfamiliar with the characters I definitely felt like I was missing something but that added to the mystery that Olive and Maps are trying to solve. I was pretty amused with what they discovered and am very eager to see where the story heads in the next volume.

"What a terrific, unusual concept! A delightful read for every reader who ever kinda wished they could trade places with the heroine of their favorite romance novel.While it's by no means perfect, I thought that HER FORBIDDEN HIGHLANDER was a great story. My only big complaint was that I wish it had been twice as long so I could have had more connection with Gabby before she finds herself thrust back in time living in her favorite book. Even still it was enjoyably escapist and not so brooding that it felt melodramatic. I've read many of Niles' previous books and if you know her work you know she can write a fantastic love scene and this is no exception.If you love highlander romances and would love a brief but fun palate cleansing read that tweaks the genre a little I would definitely recommend picking it up. I spread it out over a few nights but it could easily be read in one sitting making it a perfect read for summer travel.

"I love being the envy of my friends (who doesn't) and everyone has been asking me how I always have amazing mint water all summer long... FOR FREE. Well my secret is that I planted mint in my flower beds instead of shrubs and flowers because it's crazy low maintenance while providing food for the bee population in my area, looks amazing without much more than weeding, smells phenomenal, and of course, has wonderful edible uses. My favorite of whichaside from homemade mint ice cream, of courseis infused water.Every couple of days I go out and snip stalks of chocolate-mint or my new favorite orange-mint and pop them in an infuser bottle to make chilly good drinks. But let's face it, not all infuser bottles are awesome. I have one I love but the infusion cup is at the top and you're drinking the water right through it which can be a little awkward. So I picked up this one from Live Infinitely for review because the infuser is in the bottom of the bottle.Drinking wise I prefer it! I used it wrong the first time, forgetting that the words have to be a certain way and hated it but once I realized I had it wrong I was really pleased with the comfortable rim for drinking. I would love it with a spout at the top so it's just a little easier when I'm working out but it's not a deal breaker. I do feel it worth noting that I get a tiny bit of leakage that I can't seem to fix. (You can see it in the photo). It's very minimal so it would only bug me if I regularly stuck it on a wood surface. And no it's not condensation as the photo might suggest, I tested for that a few times and it does it with every use I've had.I would give this a try with delicious combos like strawberry-basil, lemon-thyme, ginger-orange, raspberry-mint, and pineapple-blueberry!Notes: I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IPZQCALPZ6R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WOUAKE0#wasThisHelpful","R2IPZQCALPZ6R","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every once in a while a read comes along that starts off not so hot where I almost give up on it. HUNTER OF HER HEART got off to a tough start. Zane wasn't very likable and Candi wasn't helping that by being a bit of a flake. I was bummed because I had enjoyed them in LONE WOLFE PROTECTOR and I always love seeing secondary characters get together later in a series. The first third of the book had me ready to call it but I decided to stick it out just a little bit longer. Which I'm glad I did because the story picked up quite a bit.If you're like me and commitment-phobe heroes make you cringe I think you'll find yourself in the same boat I was in. I wanted to think that it was because of Zane's secret but it seemed more just his personality and that didn't work for me. Once Candi brings in a good reason for him to commit even then he gets all wishy-washy but the process slowly starts.What ultimately saved this one from a lower rating was that once they started sorting their stuff out I liked Candi and Zane together. They felt more real than most paranormal romance couples are and that made me want them to find their HEA ending. While it was flawed enough I almost gave up on it, I also felt like the latter half of the story was good enough that most readers might like it.Notes: ARC received via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G1XT7VUP98G9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM6RARY#wasThisHelpful","R1G1XT7VUP98G9","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've got to say, it takes a lot to impress me with fitness gear but the Marcy flat bench is fantastic. It was quick and easy to put together and is surprisingly light for how sturdy it is. Unlike other models I've seen with rounded feet the flat feet on this are perfect for staying put. The bench is supportive but not so soft you'll slide around.I think this is a great option for the price point and will definitely look into the Marcy brand next time I'm in the market for fitness equipment for my home gym.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36QGVB1GQC2XK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W1BN8GO#wasThisHelpful","R36QGVB1GQC2XK","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you've read LOVE AT STAKE then you're ready for Melissa's turn at having a match made through the service, Fated Match. If not, I really feel like this is one time when I have to recommend reading it first. You won't need it for the happily ever after to make sense but to really get Melissa and her dad you need that background.I was really stoked to see the paranormal world expand a bit with the introduction of Tarian and the necromancers.  It added a good element of urgency and suspense to the plot. I'll admit it took me a while to warm up to Tarian, I can't quite put my finger on it but something about him felt really closed off. The chemistry between he and Melissa, however, was really good and made their situation both intense and satisfying.The one thing that didn't really work for me is kind of silly but I didn't really feel like this fit the Fated Match series because the whole matchmaking thing didn't play a very big role in the story. It's not a big deal as it's still an enjoyable read, I just think readers who come to it wanting a matchmaking story will not find what they were hoping for and thus it felt worth noting.Overall, it was a quick and enjoyable paranormal romance read. Sure to satisfy readers who like Romeo-and-Juliet (aka Our-Races-Are-Enemies) PNR.Notes: ARC received via NetGalley.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV4R2HJW2N4M5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM590WI#wasThisHelpful","RV4R2HJW2N4M5","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My personal experience with electric toothbrushes has been limited more to those with rotating heads but I really was excited to see just how slim and portable this was so I gave it a try. It's impressively sleek and comes with a great case for travel which definitely makes it an excellent choice for those who do so regularly. It also seems to hold charge for a very long time once it's been fully charged. It did take a little getting used to the sonic style but I have to admit I think I'm liking it better, my teeth feel much cleaner and the massage setting it very nice.The one major disadvantage over my last electric is that the brush storage isn't what I'd prefer. My previous electric had a lid over the stored brushes when not in use. But overall I'm very happy with it and I think I would recommend it to my friends and family.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NJ15ACDBJ9IF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NELG47U#wasThisHelpful","R2NJ15ACDBJ9IF","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with a lot of things in life, I came in a bit late to the Backstage Pass series. I was never into boy bands growing up but for some reason I just couldn't resist jumping into this series anyway. I love musichonestly, who doesn't?so I often find myself enjoying romantic reads featuring characters who play it and DAISY AND THE FRONT MAN wound up being no exception.When Daisy Morris is stood up for homecoming by the front man of her favorite band, Seconds to Juliet, she's humiliated. But when she finds out her bodyguard dad whom she'll be spending the summer with is working for S2J she sees an opportunity to have her revenge. What ensues is a fun beachy read that's sure to satisfy your sweet tooth for romance that's fluffy and lighthearted. There's a certain every-girl quality to Daisy that I think most YA readers will love and I was thrilled that Trevin was Korean, such a nice change of pace!Since this was my first Backstage Pass series read, I was occasionally left feeling I had missed something important by not reading the first two but it wasn't bad enough that I feel you couldn't read these out of order. DATFM is a warm, guilty pleasure type read that I think will make you grin if the plot appeals to you at all. I would definitely recommend it!Notes: ARC received in exchange for this honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90B31A2TZG1Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7S52SG#wasThisHelpful","R90B31A2TZG1Q","A277TO3PKKNYDH","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A277TO3PKKNYDH?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This wasn't an easy part to track down.  My Jeep didn't have a factory installed trailer tow hitch, but did have a factory installed wire harness for me to add one later.  This adapter goes from the factory 7 pin USCAR female adapter to a 4 pin flat.  It doesn't mention fitting a Jeep Grand Cherokee on the packaging, but this is definitely the right adapter.  If you need an RV 7 and a 4 flat, I would suggest the Curt 55774 adapter instead.  As far as the receiver hitch, I went with the Curt 13065 which was super easy to install and hides well up under the bumper, with only the bottom of the receiver extending.Now, here's where things get a bit tricky.  Take note of this! The factory installed wire harness doesn't actually work until you re-program the vehicle's onboard computer.  You need to take the vehicle into the dealership and tell them to update the VIN with dealer option AHX.  They will then use their wiTECH scanner and enable the feature in the onboard computer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ99R4UW7X85T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000KAZXHU#wasThisHelpful","RZ99R4UW7X85T","A1P2OBC87CTSRL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1P2OBC87CTSRL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have since adjusted the sensor so it is simply facing the house next to me.  This is less than ideal, because you have to be half way up the path before the light ever turns on.

"This is  my second Intex Easy Set pool.  I purchased an 8' by 30"" pool about four years ago, and used it for a couple of years.  This year we upgraded to the larger 12' by 30"" pool, since the kids are getting bigger.  This is one of the cheapest forms of entertainment I can find to keep my kids occupied during the summer.  It may or may not last past this season, but it is worth it either way.  I made sure to put down a ground tarp beneath the pool before I started adding water, this prevents any small rocks and debris on the concrete from puncturing the pool, and makes smoothing out the bottom much easier.  It is also important to have a level surface for the pool.  Mine is on the patio, and concrete is graded away from the house by design.  This 2 or 3 inch drop over the 13' foot width of the patio does not cause any real issue, although it isn't ideal.  The more level you can get the better, but keep in mind concrete patios are always intentionally sloped away from the house.

"Some may still remember this weird kidnapping case that really happened in 1978, Switzerland. About two months after his death. Charlie Chaplin's body was dug up by two men and held for ransom. Directed by Xavier Beauvois (Of Gods and Men), La ranon de la gloire (The Price of Fame) is loosely based on this strange case.Dont expect thrills or suspense, however. The French/Swiss/Belgian film is not so much an in-depth look at this crime itself as a drama about these two desperate men told with homage to the great artist still loved by many people.The story is about the two kidnappers: Osman Bricha (Roschdy Zem), struggling father who needs money for his daughter Samira (Sli Gmach) and hospitalized wife Noor (Nadine Labaki); and Eddy Ricaart (Benot Poelvoorde, Man Bites Dog), recently released from jail. To Osman, who is denied a bank loan, Eddy proposes a perfect plan to get money quickly. That is, stealing the body of Charlie Chaplin.La ranon de la gloire is obviously sanctioned by the Chaplin family (Charlie Chaplins real-life son Eugne Chaplin and granddaughter Dolores Chaplin appear), so one good thing about the film is, naturally, that the film looks very authentic, with some scenes filmed in Manoir de Ban in Switzerland, the place where Chaplin really lived. Also, Michel Legrands beautiful score is another plus. Some of the homage is amusing. Supporting players include Chiara Mastroianni and Peter Coyote, but I am not sure the roles they play are really necessary.Obviously the film needs improvement. La ranon de la gloire attempts to be so many things at the same time  buddy-buddy film, drama about family, comedy (inspired by Chaplin), etc.  that some parts of the film look awkward, or are just unnecessary. The film feels very slow when it should be quick. Some events including the prolonged circus episode (another reference to Chaplin) look out of place, especially when we want to know more about the case itself and those who are involved with it.La ranon de la gloire is a missed opportunity for a great comedy drama. Some parts of it are interesting, but the whole is unsatisfying.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJIUOR74GK1Z2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVF135C#wasThisHelpful","RJIUOR74GK1Z2","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"David Oelhoffens Far From Men (Loin des hommes) is based on a short story The Guest by Albert Camus. Set in the early days of the Algerian Revolution, the French drama follows the story of Daru (Viggo Mortensen speaking in French), a reclusive teacher living in the mountains of Algeria, and Mohamed (Reda Kateb), Arab prisoner Daru is made to escort to the town.Told against the background of political turmoil in Algeria, the story of two men seems rather simple, but poses many intriguing questions. Through several life-threatening incidents both characters come to understand each other, and in so doing, they are given a chance to make a choice, choice that would change their future.Interestingly some parts of the film adaptation are considerably different from the original Camus story it is based on. Some of you might not like the changes done to the original storyline. I for one do not know which is better. You should decide it for yourself.Being slow-moving at time, the film requires some patience, but with the beautifully shot landscape of the barren mountains and the convincing portrayals of the two main characters by Viggo Mortensen (who also co-produced) and Reda Kateb, Far From Men is a moving and thought-provoking drama.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28A6BOUDYZ29T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K364E8#wasThisHelpful","R28A6BOUDYZ29T","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in Belfast in 1971, the British film follows the story of Gary Hook (Jack O'Connell, Started Up Unbroken), a new recruit of the British Army. When his squad is sent to support the Royal Ulster Constabulary, however, a riot breaks out and Hook is accidentally left behind by the unit in the confusion.This means the young soldier has to survive the night alone, disoriented in the streets of Belfast, while not knowing whom to trust. 71 is a tense action thriller with a focus on realism as well as the political aspects of the Troubles.The film begins with a fast pace, with some frenzy, semi-documentary action sequence in the first half that may remind us of the style of Paul Greengrass, but it is in the films slower-paced second half that the first-time feature director Yann Demange shows what he is really capable of, with a suspenseful building up to the conclusion.And the film could not be a success without the talented players including Richard Dormer, Sean Harris, Killian Scott, David Wilmot and of course the star Jack O'Connell. Tat Radcliffes effective photography capturing the streets of Belfast is another plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3565J5BXKGH0B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X3DC644#wasThisHelpful","R3565J5BXKGH0B","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As you know, Ant-Man will be the final entry of Phase Two of the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe that started with Iron Man in 2008, but dont worry. You dont have to see any of the previous Marvel Comics movies to enjoy Ant-Man, an enjoyable action movie featuring an insect-sized hero with superhuman powers.Paul Rudd is Scott Lang, a whistleblower and thief recently released from jail. He breaks into the house of Dr. Pym (Michael Douglas), former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and original Ant-Man. What Scott finds there is something interesting; the Ant-suit, a suit created by Hank Pym that can turn the wearer into Ant-Man.So the film is about the second-generation Ant-Man, I mean, Scott, who trains to be a superhero in order to regain his daughters love (and save the world, too). Story-wise Ant-Man is pretty formulaic, but director Peyton Reed (Bring it on) keeps a good pace throughout, emphasizing the comical side of the situation in which our hero is in. The climactic one-on-one combat against the supervillain can be thrilling and funny at the same time.As I said, Ant-Man can be enjoyed as a stand-alone action film, but some knowledge about the Marvel Comics would help, especially when a certain character appears, fighting Ant-Man in a unique and amusing combat sequence. And of course, dont miss the post-credits scene that suggests the beginning of Phase Three.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HK0JYJATAVX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011DHP3GY#wasThisHelpful","R2HK0JYJATAVX0","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eight years after their 9-year-old daughter Cassandra went missing, her parents Matthew (Ryan Reynolds) and Tina (Mireille Enos) are to know, in a different way, that their daughter may be still alive. Told in a chronologically shuffled order (like some of Christopher Nolan films), Atom Egoyans thriller attempts to captivate the heart of viewers, but except the star Reynolds effective acting and beautifully shot landscapes, the film fails in doing so.I think I see the directors intention of focusing the impact that the sudden and unaccountable absence of someone would give to us  and I have seen some of the directors films including The Sweet Hereafter  but even so, The Captive is not very convincing either as a thriller or a drama, with flat characters lacking reasonable motives.You see, in The Captive, a police officer (played by Scott Speedman), who should be polite and calm in dealing with this kind of delicate case, is incredibly rude and stupid. Kevin Durands one-note character walks and talks like a villain from a Victorian novel, with monster written all over him. In short, people just don't act that way.Egoyans previous effort Devil's Knot was criticized for not telling us anything new about the case it depicts.

"If you have seen Rob Reiners Stand by Me (1986) and two Steven Spielberg sci-fi fantasy films in his early days, you have virtually seen Earth to Echo. Director Dave Greens feature debut is so obviously inspired by those classic movies he must have seen as a child, that it is nearly impossible not to notice the similarities.I am not saying the film is all bad. The film is entertaining and it certainly tries to be original, but I think in a very wrong way.In Earth to Echo three boys Alex, Tuck and Munch embark on a bicycle trip to uncover the mysterious incident of messages sent to the cell phones. As their neighborhood is going to be torn down to build a highway, they know this will be the last chance for them to be together. On their journey the boys stumble on something unexpected, something that some suspicious-looking men seem interested.Now, most moviegoers know where the story comes from, but the problem of Earth to Echo is not that. The real problem of film is that it employs the overused technique of the Blair Witch-like shaky, hand-held camera. I know the film is made for the YouTube generation, but honestly, do we really need that here?The acting of the kids is pretty good, and the special effects are decent, but, despite some nice ideas (see the unique car crash scene, for example  dont worry, no one dies in this movie), Earth to Echo needs more originality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EKKBP3379CQS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MHIKRVA#wasThisHelpful","R2EKKBP3379CQS","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good news about Insurgent, the second installment of the Divergent, series is that Shailene Woodley returns as the young heroine Tris. Woodley manages to be attractive in the clich-ridden dystopian story.With the Flightplan director Robert Schwentke (replacing Neil Burger, who directed Divergent), the new film is more fast-paced and adult-oriented, focusing more visuals (released in 3D) and action. Some of the special effects, especially those during the test scenes, are worth watching.Story-wise, however, Insurgent does not offer anything new or original. There is another problem that is even bigger; that is, with too many subplots and characters, the story gets muddled as it goes on. As a consequence, certain things look just illogical  How did they enter the building? etc.  and most of the seasoned actors involved are either miscast (Naomi Watts) or wasted (Octavia Spencer).It is reported that Insurgent will be followed by two more sequels. I hope they come up with a better story next time.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X8GRHPLAXEKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5E7ZW6#wasThisHelpful","R2X8GRHPLAXEKS","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Frank Martin is back in The Transporter Refueled, but not Jason Statham. In the fourth feature film of the hit franchise Ed Skrein plays the role of the ex-special agent who is hired to transport anything to anywhere. Perhaps the new entry may not be as bad as you may be led to believe, but still a disappointment.The story (set in South France) is nothing particularly new. Frank gets mixed up with violent gangsters led by Karasov (Radivoje Bukvic), when he accepts a job from a mysterious young woman to carry a package, which turns out to be something Frank did not expect.What is unique about the film is that the screenplay focuses the relationship between Frank and his father, a retired secret agent played by Ray Stevenson. In fact, the comical interaction between the father and son, which reminds us of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is more interesting than the convoluted main plot.You get a handful of decent action sequences (which could have been better without the quick cuts), but my impression is simply this: So whats the point of making another Transporter film without Jason Statham?","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31N0MWP60H3UW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0168UF1CW#wasThisHelpful","R31N0MWP60H3UW","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Belle and Sebastian (Belle et Sbastien) may not be the greatest French film ever made, but Nicolas Vaniers family picture has a few fine things that only this adventurist-turned-director can offer: stunningly beautiful nature of the Alps, realistic descriptions of the people living there, and a likable protagonist Sbastien, a six-year-old boy, who befriends a dog Belle.Set in 1943, the film is basically about Sbastien (Flix Bossuet), an orphan boy living with his adoptive grandfather Csar (Tchky Karyo) and Csars daughter Anglina (Margaux Chtelier) living in the Alps. One day Sbastien meets Belle, a wild dog mistakenly believed to be the Beast by the villagers. Their friendship begins. This is the most appealing part of the movie.For the new version the filmmakers decided to add another material to the story. A German army arrives at the quiet village to capture the refugees trying to cross the mountains. Nicolas Vanier wisely avoids any violent content in furthering the added story, which is a good thing. But I am not sure that the original storyline needed this episode, which is neither suspenseful nor dramatic enough.The original novel Belle and Sebastian, written by Ccile Aubry, was turned into a French TV series of the same title (19651970), which starred Aubrys son Mehdi as Sebastian. For the new film Mehdi appears briefly in a cameo role as hunter named Andr. The location is changed to the French Alps, and so is the purpose of the boys journey with the dog.Belle and Sebastian is an above average family picture with beautiful photography and capable acting from the cast, but the adult audiences might feel there is still something missing here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RWAWOF31RN8U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WT9FDU2#wasThisHelpful","R3RWAWOF31RN8U","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Diabolical starts off as a typical haunted house movie with a single mother Madison (Ali Larter) and her two children Jacob (Max Rose) and Haley (Chloe Perrin) terrorized by some weird phenomena in their suburban house. Even the paranormal experts Madison hires get terribly scared, so she starts to investigate the place with her boyfriend and science teacher Nick (Arjun Gupta).(The following paragraph includes some mild spoilers.)About halfway through the story the film suddenly transforms into a sort of sci-fi thriller, trying to explain how and why these entities have to appear specifically in Madisons house.The basic idea has potential for unique, genre-bending thriller, but sadly The Diabolical is simply not that. Some may turn a blind eye to the films obvious logical inconsistencies, but even so, The Diabolical has another and bigger problem. That is, the film is dull and boring.Director Alistair Legrand (nephew of Oscar-winning composer Michel Legrand) knows what he is doing and the cast including Ali Larter are doing their best, but The Diabolical is plodding, lacking the finesse of a skilled storyteller. Scares and tension are severely diluted with exposition delivered clumsily. Strictly for the fans of the star Ali Larter.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26MKEEVLW1LP5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014DMSJD0#wasThisHelpful","R26MKEEVLW1LP5","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kung Fu Killer (also known as Kung Fu Jungle) marks the star Donnie Yens comeback to the traditional martial arts action film. Directed by Teddy Chen (Bodyguards and Assassins), the film is also homage to the long history of the Hong Kong action movies.Donnie Yen plays Hahou Mo, a former police officer and martial arts now in jail for accidentally killing his opponent in a fight three years ago. When martial arts masters are found dead in the city, Hahou Mo knows that someone killed them in a combat and only he can prevent the murderer from killing another fighter.The story is contrived, but the fast-paced film gives us enough thrills with bone-crunching action scenes that feature Donnie Yen and Baoqiang Wang who almost steals the film. It is also amusing to find many cameos including Raymond Chow, founder of Golden Harvest.King Fu Killer may not be as intense as Donnie Yens hit Ip Man and its sequel, but is still very entertaining.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DNSJTVMSUGX6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHAG0NI#wasThisHelpful","R3DNSJTVMSUGX6","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Good Kill is a war drama without war. The film is about Major Thomas Egan (Ethan Hawke), a drone pilot and family man struggling with his consciousness while remote-controlling from Las Vegas a military drone flying over Afghanistan. The topic is timely and the setting is intriguing. Ethan Hawke is convincing as dutiful and tormented drone pilot.After the halfway mark, however, the film focuses the psychological changes that take place in the protagonist. That is not bad, but the way those changes happen needs improvement. Without revealing much about what happens, I can say that the latter half of the film is too melodramatic to be taken seriously, with the cop-out conclusion that leaves us with the impression that the film does not know where to go.Good Kill stars Ethan Hawke and is written and directed by Andrew Niccol. You may remember they made an excellent drama Gattaca back in 1997. The New Zealand-born director is also responsible for the script of The Truman Show in 1998. Both films have immediacy, interesting characters and thought-provoking story. Good Kill starts out promising all three, but ends up delivering only the first one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3B8WVUG7VE8KB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YOJID2U#wasThisHelpful","R3B8WVUG7VE8KB","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Jerry (Ryan Reynolds) is an ordinary guy working at a bathtub factory in the (fictional) sleepy town of Milton. He is pretty shy and not good at talking to others, especially women, living in a small apartment with a cat Mr. Whiskers and a dog Bosco, whose voices he hears. You may think Jerry is a little bit like Norman Bates, even though Jerry wants to be a nice person.Now, Jerry has a crush on the gorgeous Fiona (Gemma Arterton) at his workplace. When he has a chance to be alone with her, an accident happens, which leads to a much bigger and bloodier disaster, in spite of his best efforts to prevent it.Despite Ryan Reynolds effective performance as socially awkward Jerry, The Voices offers little that is interesting either as a comedy or a thriller (or anything else). You may say this is one of the darkest comedies you have seen and indeed you cannot just ignore the films twisted sense of humor seen in the talking head scene. Yes, it is weird and that is all.The Voices is directed by Marjane Satrapi, who is best known for her Oscar nominated animation Persepolis (co-directed by Vincent Paronnaud). This is a strange career move, which I think is damaging, if not fatal.If you are looking for something completely different, you may try The Voices. But you know being different does not always make a film interesting.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CQHKTOG6T5U4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TDWD02Q#wasThisHelpful","R3CQHKTOG6T5U4","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are many ways to describe the unique world of Turbo Kid. It is a Mad Max-like post-apocalyptic world where civilization has collapsed; where tyrannical warlord Zeus (scene-stealing Michael Ironside) rules with an army of warriors riding BMXs (yes, bicycles, not motorcycles). And in this wasteland the Kid (Munro Chambers), a comic book reading, bicycle-riding boy, meets a mysterious girl named Apple (Laurence Leboeuf).Turbo Kid is not just an ode to the 1980s and 90s; it works well as a piece of entertainment on its own, with ridiculously gory action scenes and delightfully eccentric characters. This is a well-worn story of heroism and boy meets girl, and the writer-director team (of Franois Simard, Anouk Whissell and Yoann-Karl Whissell) takes it very seriously.The result is a low-budget movie with a high entertainment value, a fun movie for moviegoers, especially for those who like the pop culture of the 1980s and 90s, or things such as retro games and Giorgio Moroder synth music. And the heroine Apple is really charming.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TTPB5YQ1EMTR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014QD74N2#wasThisHelpful","R1TTPB5YQ1EMTR","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jonathan Glazers Under the Skin is a kind of film that challenges the viewer to see things differently. Thats a good thing, and the premise is intriguing. Its about the human world (in this case Scotland) seen from a predatory life form disguised as a young woman played by Scarlett Johansson.The films sparse narrative and measured pace is far from that of Hollywood sci-fi movies like Species. No scientists show up to explain the mysterious womans motive for capturing men. Johanssons character, whoever it is, seems to undergo a certain psychological change at a certain point, but we are not really sure when and how this happens. And these are not bad things.Even so, and despite some brilliant images and eerie soundtrack that may draw comparison with more famous film directors like Kubrick, Under the Skin is drawn out to the point of being pretentious and self-indulgent. Even those who think the film is unique and inventive would agree that it takes too much time trying to make its point.Under the Skin strives to be unconventional at the risk of alienating viewers. I respect the decision, but also think that, slow-moving as it is, 2001: A Space Odyssey offers enough mystery and suspense, and most importantly, is not boring.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OLAW9KRX8M8E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K0MM4AM#wasThisHelpful","R3OLAW9KRX8M8E","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like Battleship made in 2012, a supernatural horror Ouija is based on a Hasbro board game. I am not really sure if a supernatural horror movie is the best kind of marketing for this product, but anyway Michael Bay and other producers thought it worth a try to make one. Well, the result is just another horror film that is not very scary.From the beginning the films story is far from compelling. In Ouija, in order to know what really happened to her best friend Debbie (Shelley Hennig), who died in a strange way, Laine (Olivia Cooke) uses an Ouija board with Sarah (Ana Coto), Trevor (Daren Kagasoff), Pete (Douglas Smith) and Isabelle (Bianca Santos).OK, so what happens to these cardboard characters? Nothing surprising or interesting. One interesting thing is that nowhere in the film is any attempt at making the story more involving, or characters more attractive. Some films may rely on clich and tired formulas, but they try to interest us in some way or other. In Ouija this does not happen.Despite its fine photography and decent production designs, Ouija offers little that you have not already seen.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XLGRL3NQ80JL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OV60I6K#wasThisHelpful","R2XLGRL3NQ80JL","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Giver is not really as bad as you might think. With two Oscar winners Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep, it just cannot be. The majority of the cast turns in decent performances and the film has nice futuristic designs. But there is something missing in the film adaptation of Lois Lowrys bestselling book, something that should get the viewers emotionally invested in what is going on in the films seemingly utopian world.The story is in short about a sort of chosen one in a perfect community (where there is no color). His name is Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) and since he was selected next Receiver of Memory, the 16-year-old boy starts to see the society led by the Chief Elder (Streep) in a different way.The lack of originality is already a problem from the beginning, but more damaging is the inconsistency of the script. For example, Jonas and other residents are supposed to live in a completely emotionless community  and yes, Father (Alexander Skarsgrd) and Mother (Katie Holmes) look like that  but Jonas and his friends seem pretty emotional even before he starts training to be the Receiver under the Giver (Bridges).Directed by veteran Phillip Noyce, The Giver works as a slick and visually attractive sci-fi adventure, but not as its Brave New World-like allegory. Maybe the original book should have been turned into a film much earlier","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PY3GLXGH7LA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU2P0HO#wasThisHelpful","R37PY3GLXGH7LA","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"John (Mark Wahlberg) and the foul-mouthed teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane, who also directs) return for a sequel. Its been about three years since the successful original was released, and there are plenty of jokes and references throughout Ted 2, but the new film seems in desperate need of a story that these characters deserve.As Ted 2 opens, MacFarlanes teddy bear marries Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth). And he wants to have a baby! In spite of the interesting opening, however, the filmmakers fail to develop the story that gets weaker as the film goes on, with a drawn-out story about Teds legal battle. Giovanni Ribisi reprises the role of a creepy kidnapper, but his character is simply unnecessary.Ted 2 MacFarlanes jokes are as crude and politically incorrect as in the original, but not as funny as before, partly because what made the first Ted unique is missing. It is not just about the novelty of talking teddy bear, but the friendship between him and Wahlbergs character.As Mila Kunis refused to return, Amanda Seyfried appears as a new girlfriend for Mark Wahlbergs character John. Seyfried is not bad. The problem is, like big names such as Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson who also appear here, her screen time is too brief.After all, though pretty entraining, Ted 2 fails to provide a drama that the main characters thunder buddies really need.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JAPK69NW53FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC4Q10#wasThisHelpful","R3JAPK69NW53FS","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in Terminator Genisys as the iconic character that made him internationally famous in 1984. And this time he is the star of the film, not just in a cameo role as in Salvation. That is the good news, and we also meet familiar characters like John Connor (Jason Clarke), Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) and Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke) played by actors of younger generation.Now the bad news is that the new plot, which part retreads those of the original and its sequel, is so complicated and even confusing that even avid fans like me who have seen the first two Terminator films many times will find it hard to follow it. Also, the alternate timeline story has many holes in it.As sci-fi action movie Genisys offers a few decent (though not very creative) action set-pieces using plenty of special effects that are certainly impressive. For those who love James Camerons Terminator films, there are amusing references (see how Lee Byung-huns shapeshifting T-1000 moves, for example).Director Alan Taylor, known for works for TV shows including Game of Thrones, and feature films including Marvels Thor: The Dark World, knows what he is doing. Terminator Genisys is an attempt to start a new trilogy that is set in a completely new timeline, but it is done with flat characters and muddled storytelling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXS10Z9ONDC84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010R40EUY#wasThisHelpful","RXS10Z9ONDC84","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in 1882, in Argentina's Patagonia region during the last days of the military campaign Conquest of the Desert, Jauja chronicles a strange journey of Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen (Viggo Mortensen), whose 15-year-old daughter Ingeborg (Viilbjrk Malling Agger) goes missing in the middle of the desert. Dinesen sets out to search for Inge on his own, but the journey leads him into the territories he has never dreamed of before.Like some of David Lynch films, Jauja is kind of a movie that fascinates some viewers because of its unreality and illogicality. Those viewers would like to discuss the content, especially what happens (or seems to happen) to Dinesen in the films last fifteen minutes, while others may find the deliberately paced film whimsical or even pretentious.Whichever group you fall into, you will admit the beauty of Argentine director Lisandro Alonsos film that captures the hauntingly beautiful nature of Patagonia with the muted colors. The credit goes to Finnish cinematographer Timo Salminen, best known for his work in Aki Kaurismki films. The music is sparse, but quite impressive (from the album Please Tomorrow by Buckethead and Viggo Mortensen).I attempted to be neutral in describing what you are going to see in Jauja (of which meaning you will find in the film), but frankly, I still do not know how to interpret the journey, let alone what the film is all about.

"I was interested in Stuck in Love (2012) because of the writer/director Josh Boone (his debut), who went on to direct, but not write, The Fault in Our Stars two years later. I was impressed with the latter, especially with the main characters played by young stars, so I decided to try Stuck in Love, which turned out not bad, but a little disappointing due to the uneven writing.Greg Kinnear is Bill Borgens, a successful writer whose ex-wife Erica (Jennifer Connelly) left him three years ago and now is living with another man. Bill cannot forget Erica, so he sneaks into the backyard and spies on her. But in his beautiful seaside house Bill has a casual sex with a jogging neighbor played by Kristen Bell). Well, why should we care?Bill has two children Samantha (Lily Collins) and Rusty (Nat Wolff). College student Samantha is an aspiring writer, a gifted one it seems, as her first book is being published by Scribners. Rusty, envious of that, also keeps a journal, and his father says what he needs is experience. So what will Rusty do? The answer is obvious.The film covers love stories of them, of Samantha cynical about love, and Rusty not quite so. Logan Lerman plays Lou, who is attracted to Samantha.Like Almost Famous,, it has a cast of talented players, young and veteran, but characters do not convince. We are supposed to believe that the Borgens has three talented writers, but despite the frequent references to literature and rock music, as well as endorsement from Stephen King (who appears  voice only  in a cameo), none of them looks like one.Stuck in Love is, in short, a romantic comedy trying to be different by being intelligent like Cameron Crowes semi-autobiographical drama, but fails because of the clichd narrative and unbelievable characters. The film follows three love stories, but not with enough character development that is often done in a heavy-handed way. Stuck in Love has its moments thanks to the fine acting from the cast, but the slick film, maybe too slick, doesnt know how to make use of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R377JKO0YK312Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7YMTB8#wasThisHelpful","R377JKO0YK312Y","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Universals animated film Minions is about the adventures of the titular small-sized, yellow-colored creatures whose life is dedicated to serving villains and monsters. After years of misfortunes of losing their masters in a most ridiculous way, three of the Minions  Stuart, Kevin and Bob  set out to find a new master and travel to USA. There they know about the 1968 Villain-Con in Orlando, where they meet Scarlett Overkill, the worlds most notorious criminal.The episodic plot is nothing but a series of sight gags and the 1960s pop culture references. Those jokes are funny, but some of them (like the moon landing hoax and the Beatles Abbey Road jacket) may be lost on younger audiences. The soundtrack is mostly famous rock numbers from the 60s, which are all nice, of course, and the colorful animation itself is beautiful with the detailed background, but the film itself suffers from the lack of storyline and interaction between characters.As you know, Minions is a spin-off of (and loose prequel to) Despicable Me (2010). Though you can enjoy Minions as a stand-alone film, maybe you need some knowledge about Despicable Me to fully appreciate the new film's ending.Minions is an enjoyable animated film with these cute henchmen.

"So finally, the fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise arrives, with Steven Spielberg as producer. Though he does not direct this time (Colin Trevorrow of Safety Not Guaranteed does), Spielbergs touch is everywhere: roller coaster ride of action and suspense with stock characters and bit of humor and romance.The film is largely set in a theme park created on the same island of Isla Nublar where incidents of Jurassic Park happened twenty-two years ago. Young brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) are among the visitors (more than 20,000 every day) traveling to the island.The brothers are to be taken care of by their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), but she is too busy for that because of the parks new attraction, a genetically modified dinosaur Indominus rex. Well, and will the new dinosaur escape?Of course, and the rest of the film is about those two irritating kids who do not listen to adults say; people in charge of the theme park who are mostly incompetent; one guy (Vincent D'Onofrio) who wants to use the parks dinosaurs as weapon; and one heroic dinosaur trainer Owen (Chris Pratt) trying to stop the chaos.Jurassic World is a pure popcorn movie with stunning visuals and (for some viewers) a bit of nostalgia. The new film refers to the original in several scenes, but sorry, where is Dr. Ian Malcolm when we need him? There is a romance between Owen and Claire, which nobody really cares. All in all, The Jurassic World delivers, but some part of it is terribly clichd.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R342LD9C47NYM3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NYC5II0#wasThisHelpful","R342LD9C47NYM3","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can enjoy James DeMonacos The Purge: Anarchy without watching its predecessor The Purge by the same director. Maybe you should start with the second installment of the series (the third one is in production) as The Purge: Anarchy is better than the first one.During the annual Purge night  when everything is allowed legally including murder  five people are stranded in the streets of Los Angeles. One of them happens to be a police sergeant (Frank Grillo), who attempts to lead the rest of the group to safety, but this unnamed sergeant has a reason to be out at night.The sergeants secret agenda is not difficult to detect. This is a thriller of which premise is basically that of The Most Dangerous Game, with a very political aspect like haves and have-nots. At least, the concept of the Purge sounds more credible here than in the first film (which was about a wealthy family living in a fancy house  why didnt they just leave the country for a day or two?)This time characters are more believable and the pace is faster.

"Takashi Shimizus 7500 follows the story of the crew and passengers on Flight 7500 from Los Angeles to Tokyo who experience strange things onboard after a person dies in a bizarre way. Is there any supernatural power going on behind this? Or are they seeing things that are not simply there?Though a feature film, 7500 looks more like an extended episode of a TV series like The Twilight Zone. The film keeps us waiting for what we expect to see  what it is depends on you  but, in spite of the atmospheric photography of David Tattersall (The Green Mile), the wait is long (and pretty boring) and the payoff is not big enough.Director Takashi Shimizu is best known for his Ju-On series (that was remade as The Grudge franchise in America). Here clearly he attempts to do something different, with characters whose back stories are explained in lengthy dialogue, but these weird things they experience do not add up to one big mystery that should keep the viewers intrigued.The result is a series of details of strange events most of which are left unexplained or explained in an unsatisfactory way. Some of those events are scary, to be sure, but once the film is over, we find ourselves thinking to ourselves: Is that all?","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3H02V737A3OB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9KN1TM#wasThisHelpful","R3H02V737A3OB9","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dolph Lundgren is a New Jersey detective Nick Cassidy intent on bringing down a family-run human trafficking ring led by Viktor Dragovic (Ron Perlman). Nick travels to Thailand, where he joins forces with a Thai police detective Tony (Ong Bak star Tony Jaa), who is also investigating a series of human trafficking cases.From the very beginning you know the story of Skin Trade is perfunctory at best, though it deals with serious social topics like human trafficking. Director Ekachai Uekrongtham uses every narrative trick that has been repeatedly employed in action movies (like a shootout at the container yard). Veterans like Peter Weller and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa appear in a small role  maybe too small for them.What is notable about the film is the impressive combat sequences between the stars Dolph Lundgren, Tony Jaa and Michael Jai White. There is nothing special about the action choreography, but the three actors show what they are capable of.

"The Purge is a kind of movie Ethan Hawke has been doing these days when not working for Richard Linklater. It is a low-budget thriller with a few nice ideas that could have been executed in a better way. It is not that the film is a terrible mess. It is rather that the film failed to fully exploit its potential as a thriller or political satire.James DeMonacos The Purge is basically a home invasion thriller like The Desperate Hours, Funny Games and Panic Room. The difference is that the main events take place during the twelve hours of the Annual Purge, when every crime including murder is legalized. The story is set in the near future, when the United States is ruled by a new totalitarian government.Ethan Hawke plays James Sandin, a successful businessman and family man of two children and wife Mary (Lena Headey). The rich family is going to spend the night of the Purge together in a fancy house protected by a security system  the same one James has sold to the neighbors. A homeless person has managed to get inside the house, however, and that makes Jamess family a target of the gun-wielding strangers.Writer / director James DeMonaco (writer of remake Assault on Precinct 13 and co-writer of The Negotiator) has intended to make a thriller with a moral message. Thats fine, but the film itself is not as thrilling or insightful as it should, with stock characters making unaccountable decisions, and old hackneyed storytelling devices like criminals taking pause to say something unnecessarily before doing what they do.As a mindless low-budget thriller The Purge is just OK, though, of course, it wants to be something more than that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXPSB9FDCWZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEIYGT8#wasThisHelpful","RTXPSB9FDCWZH","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mr. Turner is a kind of film critics are ready to heap piles of praise upon, but fails to impress general viewers including me for a very simple reason. The (digitally shot) photography is breathtakingly beautiful and the film itself is well-acted, but is pretty boring, even if you know something about the great painters life and works.Mike Leighs Mr. Turner is not really a bio-pic in a usual sense. It only covers the last days of Turners life, and it is done in an episodic way. We see the painters hatred for another painter John Constable in the scarlet buoy scene, but we dont know why this rivalry should be so huge. The scene itself is, though a bit lengthy, intense enough to interest us thanks to the fine acting from the cast including Timothy Spall as Turner, but it after all goes nowhere, followed by another episode, giving not much insightful observation about the man or the society he lives in,Probably this rather disjointed narrative is a natural result of director Leighs unique method of filmmaking, that is, improvisation by the actors. We are left to imagine (or research on our own) why this grumpy Mr. Turner has to travel to a seaside village, incognito, and have a sexual relationship with the landlady.You may say this plotless realism is the style of Mike Leigh films. Maybe so, but in his previous films like Vera Drake we could meet much more interesting characters who have a story to tell. Mr. Turner may be historically accurate, and is easy to admire with realistic locations and costumes, but feels very distant.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SVUN45OELVC2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBFMCW8#wasThisHelpful","R3SVUN45OELVC2","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[The following review may contain minor spoilers.]Based on Tom Rob Smiths 2008 novel of the same title, Child 44 follows the story of Leo Demidov (Tom Hardy), a dutiful MGB (Ministry for State Security) officer and his wife Raisa Demidova (Noomi Rapace) under Stalins rule. Leos faith to the nation is severely tested when the mutilated body of the son of Leos old friend is found. Because there is no murder in paradise, however, the case is hushed up.Later on, Leo, disgraced and sidelined, starts investigating the case that could be done by a serial killer. General Nesterov (Gary Oldman) is helpful, but Leo has to be very careful because in uncovering the truths he has to deal with not only the murderer, but the Soviet bureaucracy represented by a sneaky officer Vasili Nikitin (Joel Kinnaman). Paddy Considine, Jason Clarke, and Vincent Cassel also appear.Written by Richard Price (The Color of Money Sea of Love), the script of Child 44 attempts to cover too many territories like Stalinism and Holodomor. To be sure, the film benefits from the strong acting from the leads Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace (this is part a love story) and director Daniel Espinosa (Easy Money Safe House) does his best to keep up the pace, but with the limited success, especially in the second half of the story, in which things happen in a too incredible way (the transport train scene is just one of them).The film (and its original book) is of course inspired by the real-life serial killer Andrei Chikatilo. The subject matter is covered in a made-for-TV film Citizen X starring Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland, which I think is better as a crime or political thriller.Child 44 is a decent thriller with fine performances from the cast and a few intense moments, but as a whole disappointing trying too hard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22HW6L1XDUGLC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z710UWU#wasThisHelpful","R22HW6L1XDUGLC","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Set in 1871 America, The Salvation starts with a mild-mannered Danish settler named Jon (Mads Mikkelsen), who has been in the West with his brother Peter (Mikael Persbrandt) for seven years. Now Jon finally reunites with his wife and son, who have travelled from Europe. One terrible thing happens to them, however, and Jon, driven by anger, kills a young cowboy.The cowboy happens to be a younger brother of Colonel Delarue (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), leader of the gang who dominates the local town of Black Creek with violence. Delarue sets out for revenge immediately, telling the townspeople to find the murderer. If they dont, they have to pay the price dearly.Eva Green plays Delarue's widowed sister-in-law Madelaine (who never speaks deprived of her tongue); Eric Cantona is The Corsican, a right-hand man to Delarue; and Jonathan Pryce is slippery Mayor Keane.The Salvation is in a way a love letter to Western movies from Danish director Kristian Levring (King Is Alive). You may notice references to Western classics though the story itself is not particularly original. What is unique about the film is its photography effectively using light and darkness and barren landscapes (the film was shot in South Africa). And of course Mads Mikkelsen, as intense as ever.

"Maybe the story of AM 11:00 reminds you of that of Nacho Vigalondos cult thriller Timecrimes, but the Korean sci-fi thriller has a more straightforward narrative, being less about time travelling than psychological changes that take place in the characters who happen to get a glimpse of their future.AM 11:00 is about a group of researchers, who have been working on a time-travelling device in an undersea base. To impress the Russian financiers (who are going to back out), two of the researchers volunteer to travel to 11:00 am next day using the still imperfect technology of time machine. What they find in the future is the deserted laboratory that has been destroyed.As I said, the films story is, after all, about learning what happens to the facilities and the crew, not about time travelling. That means you are to witness how the disaster happens and what happens to each character, but unfortunately this process, which begins in a rather silly way, is not very interesting.The greatest disappointment about the film is that it offers nothing intelligent about the idea of time travelling and its consequences. Now, you know something terrible will happen at a certain place and at a certain time in the near future, so what will you do? Will you escape from the place and change the course of events? But is that possible if everything is predestined? AM 11:00 ignores these intriguing ideas completely, content with showing the future of stock characters.Though the film has potential for a more intense thriller, AM 11:00 fails to fully utilize the intriguing premise of the film, which could have been a much more compelling ride.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9LELUBPNFJ6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S7L3WIG#wasThisHelpful","R9LELUBPNFJ6C","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the Emperor (Hwangjereul Wihayeo) is a Korean crime drama about a disgraced professional baseball player Lee Hwan (cast-against-type Min-ki Lee, Tsunami), who starts working for Emperor Capital, a Busan-based mob-related company organized by Jung Sang Ha (Sung Woong Park, New World).Three years later, after bloody fights Hwan and Sang-ha successfully control the towns resort business, when another conflict takes place, leading everyone involved into a series of more violent and deadly battles.Being a fan of Korean film noir, I didnt find the films battles offensive, which features blood-soaked, knife-wielding gangsters stabbing each other (yes, knife is their choice of weapon). What I did not like about the film is the lack of interesting characters and story. For all the graphic violence and nudity, For the Emperor lacks emotional impact that you find aplenty in other Korean thrillers like New World.For the Emperor is a decent Korean film noir that needs something that is more intense and emotionally-charged.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R315KTBR9C8D7I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VHAG6GY#wasThisHelpful","R315KTBR9C8D7I","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following the success of the 2008 hit Mamma Mia! arrives Walking on Sunshine, a UK romantic comedy musical starring Hannah Arterton as Taylor, who fell in love with an Italian boy named Raf (Giulio Berruti) in Apulia, southern Italy, three years ago. Their romance didn't materialize, however, and Taylor went back to her country alone.Cue to the present and Taylor is back in Apulia, where she reunites with her outgoing sister Maddie (Annabel Scholey). Maddie says she is getting married, and her fianc is  a big surprise!  Raf himself.Helmed by the director team Max Giwa and Dania Pasquini (StreetDance), Walking on Sunshine is a very light-hearted musical featuring the 1980s songs like The Power of Love and of course Walking on Sunshine. The sun-soaked Italian location is beautiful, and the catchy 80s soundtrack is something that stays with you (with Greg Wises vocal just slightly better than Pierce Brosnans in Mamma Mia!), though jokes are corny and musical choreography is decent at best.Dont expect something unique or innovative. Walking on Sunshine knows what it is doing. It is nothing special, but fun nonetheless.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QOV23K3C2NEZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAZHSF8#wasThisHelpful","R1QOV23K3C2NEZ","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether you like the film itself or not, you will admit there is one good thing in Pitch Perfect: acapella performances. Well, it may not be as good as you expected, but still it is fine. Dont expect more than that, and perhaps you will enjoy the musical comedy, despite the predictable story and stereotyped characters.Anna Kendrick is Beca Mitchell, a freshman, who is recruited into an all-female acapella group the Barden Bellas. Skylar Astin is Jesse Swanson, a nice and outgoing guy who joins another group Treblemakers. Part of the film is about their romantic relationship, and two stars did a decent job.But the films storyline is weak. Beca says she really wants to be a DJ, which is not very convincing. Beca is rebellious enough to disobey the groups leader on stage, but will not quit the group, or the college for that matter. Why should we follow this impossible and almost non-existent story, especially when she is often an unlikable person?The reason is, of course, the films musical set-pieces, and they are decent. The rest of the film is just another formulaic Hollywood-made college comedy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MP3O06MZCI52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008JFUUIA#wasThisHelpful","R1MP3O06MZCI52","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Maze Runner opens like Vincenzo Natalis cult thriller Cube. The difference is that a young man wakes up to find himself trapped not in a cube, but in the Glade, a grassy space surrounded by a maze with huge stone walls. He has lost his memories, but as he learns the history and rules of the all-boy community there, trying to figure out how to get out of the maze, he slowly remembers what he once was.Dylan O'Brien plays this newest member of the community, and his acting is pretty good. The boy is warned off entering the maze, which he does when something happens to the communitys wise and resourceful leader Alby (Aml Ameen), who is also the oldest Glader there.The best part of The Maze Runner, a dark action fantasy based on a bestselling YA novel by James Dashner, is the maze itself. It has its own life( or sound effect), and can move us as if it has its own will.The film manages to entertain with a series of action and mystery, though not all characters are fleshed out, and not all their decisions are logical. The big secret that awaits those teenagers is not really intriguing, let alone convincing. I know its only a MacGuffin, but I think we need a better one for the film to be more interesting.I almost forgot to say that the film is the first part of the trilogy (not again!) and the second part will be released in September 2015.

"With stunning visuals, Disneys Tomorrowland wants to say something about our future, but we are not really sure what it has to say is. It is certain that this is supposed to be an adventure story, but we dont know for whom we should root.The film starts with George Clooneys character talking to the camera, though his talk is often interrupted by someone next to him (unseen from us). Mr. Clooney finally starts his story about a young and inventive boy named Frank Walker. The time is 1964 and Frank arrives at New York City for an invention contest. There he meets a mysterious girl named Athena, who gives him a T-shaped pin.The pin has a special power which I would rather not talk about. After following the story of Frank for a while, the film suddenly starts another story, about a girl Casey Newton living in 2014. She also gets the same pin, which does what it does, and Casey embarks on an adventurous journey to Tomorrowland.The film suffers not only from its confusing narrative, but from the cardboard characters whose only function is to irritate us. Casey keeps asking questions, but never listens quietly to what people have to say. George Clooney plays a tired and disillusioned character in a very boring way. Hugh Laurie plays David Nix, a one-dimensional character who is only interested in delivering some cynical lines. And they are not very amusing.One shocking thing about Tomorrowland is that the film is directed by Brad Bird best known for his films such as The Iron Giant, The Incredibles, Ratatouille and Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol. His latest film needs everything that has made his films in the past such a great one: better (and less preachy) story, better pace, and most of all, better characters we all can identify with.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FGLQFME4W7XH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WAJ8OLG#wasThisHelpful","R2FGLQFME4W7XH","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 follows the recent Hollywood trend of splitting the final book of a popular series into two feature films. And I believe its time to stop that.Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen, now in the care of District 13 led by President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore). With Peeta Mellark captured by the Capitol, Katniss is traumatized and doesnt know what to do, though some people at District 13 expect her to act like the symbolic Mockingjay, someone who embodies the spirit of revolution.Yes, the films political subtext is certainly intriguing, but that alone is not enough to make a two-hour feature film. The slow-moving Part 1 is like a very long and tedious set-up for what is coming in the following Part 2 that will be released. Apparently the filmmakers could not come up with a better idea than whats in the film  Jennifer Lawrences heroine who looks gloomy, and other characters talking to each other.The lack of action aside, the film suffers from dull interaction between characters. You get great supporting players including Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeffrey Wright, and all their characters do is just a little bit of talking.

"To call Jimi: All Is by My Side a bio-pic might be misleading. The film only covers about one year of Jimi Hendrixs life, from 1966 to 67. You are not going to see his live at Monterey. You are not going to hear Purple Haze, either. In fact, all the guitar performances are done by someone else. But the films biggest problem is not about these things.Writer / director John Ridley, who won Oscar for his screenplay for 12 Years a Slave, successfully re-creates the atmosphere of the mid-1960s London, with effective photography and credible performance from Andr Benjamin as Jimi Hendrix, but with the disjoined narrative, the film itself offers little insight into Jimi as a person or artist.I know the real-life Kathy Etchingham (played by Hayley Atwell in the film) strongly objects to the films content. Well, I dont know to what extent this film is historically accurate, and I really dont care much. But I do care whether the film is interesting or not as a drama, and there I am disappointed.After all, the film doesnt know what story to tell about the legendary musician.

"If Chinese movie industry has Detective Dee, Korean movie industry has Detective K, a period mystery about the dynastys brilliant (if occasionally bumbling) detective of the title played by Kim Myung-min. Based on a novel by Kim Tak-Hwan, the film is more like a period action comedy than a genuine mystery drama. While the film also touches upon some delicate issues like religion, it never takes itself too seriously.Set in the late 18th century Korea, the time of the King of Joseon, Detective K: Secret of Virtuous Widow follows the story of the eponymous detective and trusted aide of the monarch. Now the detective (after wrongly accused of murder) is tasked to uncover secrets and conspiracies surrounding recent murders.The twist-filled story also features a dog fancier Seo-pil (Oh Dal-su) who becomes Watson-like partner to the usually brilliant detective, as well as a mysterious lady Han Kaek-ju (Han Ji-min).Dont expect stylish, big-budget action sequences of Guy Ritchie-directed Sherlock Homes films or Tsui Harks over-the-top action stunts.

"Film is a different medium from the stage, and something that works on stage does not necessarily bring the same result on screen, especially when it is a musical. This is what is often told about difficulties of adapting a stage play for film, but as for The Last Five Years, a musical film based on a hit Off Broadway musical, the problem lies elsewhere. Its simple: characters.The story itself is simple, about five years of romance between Cathy (Anna Kendrick) and Jamie (Jeremy Jordan). The story is told (or sung) twofold, from the viewpoints of Cathy a struggling stage actress, and Jamie an up-and-coming writer. One is told chronologically while the other is told backwards. The narrative gimmick is often awkward, but finally pays off at the end of the film, which is very emotional.Songs are good, if not exceptional. Some are memorable (like Cathys Still Hurtin) and others are OK. The performances are decent. About 99 percent of the film is about Cathy and Jamie, with cameos from Betsy Wolfe and Sherie Rene Scott (both playing Cathy on stage) and Jason Robert Brown (composer of the original). The beautiful cinematography effectively captures the landscapes of New York City.However, no matter how I tried, I couldnt bring myself to like these two characters. On stage (which I havent seen) they look different, Im sure, but on screen Cathy and Jamie are too self-absorbed for us to really care for. Director Richard LaGravenese (P. S. I Love You Beautiful Creatures) allows no room for us to empathize with the joy and pain of the couple, who sometimes look even arrogant.Throughput the film they keep singing to each other  of course, they are supposed to  but would not listen much.

It tries to cover such territories as mystery and willpower, but, though the process leading up to the climax is intriguing, what follows is rather disappointing.After all, the basic idea about the doctor and his team is nothing original. The storyline per se is pretty familiar to fans of the genre, but probably the problem is theres something quite mechanical about the plot of this twist-filled thriller (do you want to call at some mysterious hackers home in the desert at night?).Im not saying The Signal is a mess.

Thomas Jane plays a police officer determined to shut down the resort which he believes corrupts citizens. Strangely, the film would not be much different without his character, whose job here seems to be running around (again) and shooting everyone in sight.Some may remember a 1973 sci-fi action Westworld. Or maybe Blade Runner. Or perhaps. I really dont care if they use some other films ideas as long as the result is entertaining. Sadly Vice is not.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25ESBXAA6WFEO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SFRHIIC#wasThisHelpful","R25ESBXAA6WFEO","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Before I Go To Sleep Nicole Kidman plays a woman named Christine Lucas, who wakes up every morning with her memories erased. She does not remember what happened in the past ten years. Drew Barrymore once played a similar character, but that was a comedy. Here Kidmans heroine feels disoriented and uneasy.In an unfamiliar house Christine feels quite uncomfortable with the man named Ben (Colin Firth), who explains the accident that happened ten years ago. Then she receives a phone call from Dr. Nasch (Mark Strong), who tells her to look for a certain thing in the wardrobe. And it seems Ben doesnt know anything about the doctor.Before I Go To Sleep starts promisingly, but the mystery drama quickly runs out of steam. The gloomy-looking movie is full of emotional nuance, but lacks a mystery to be solved, with cardboard characters you really can't care about. Despite Kidmans effective performance, director Rowan Joffe doesn't offer enough for us to care about her life today and in the past.Perhaps in the original book things are much more intriguing. Several plot holes and unaccountable motives aside, Before I Go To Sleep as a psychological mystery suffers a big problem, and that is the lack of psychology and mystery.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10NAUP26EPHRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q89N3IS#wasThisHelpful","R10NAUP26EPHRC","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In Pride (2014) a London-based group of lesbian and gay activists led by Mark Ashton (Ben Schnetzer) raises fund for the families of a small coalmining village in Wales during the UK miners' strike (198485). The inspirational story of this unlikely alliance may sound far-fetched, but the truth is this really happened.Now, at first sight Matthew Warchus film about LGSM, or Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners, is thematically similar to such films as Brassed Off and Billy Elliot, but the way Pride treats the campaign against pit closure is significantly different, with a focus on solidarity rather than conflict.And when conflict is described, it is mainly between the community members of Onllwyn, a Welsh coalmining village. Pride is a bit like an ensemble drama with many credible and intriguing characters, some of whom are based on real people, played by the talented cast including Paddy Considine, Bill Nighy and Imelda Staunton. Some characters lack depth (like George MacKays fictional ""Bromley""), but the veteran players make up for that.Pride is a well-made comedy drama with no preachy message or sentimental moment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11J1Y7K02157H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OY7YNKI#wasThisHelpful","R11J1Y7K02157H","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What is the greatest car chase scene ever made? Bullitt? Ronin? Duel? Or The French Connection? The question is hard to answer, but Mad Max 2 would not be a bad choice. If you havent ever seen it, well, you are just missing a great thing.If you havent seen the original Mad Max, dont worry. You dont have to, because Mad Max 2 (aka. The Road Warrior) is sort of a stand-alone film. It is about Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) roaming alone in the post-apocalyptic world where civilization has collapsed and everyone fights for gasoline.In the wasteland a group of people are defending their oil refinery from the gang of marauders led by 'Lord Humungus' (Kjell Nilsson). Max approaches to the defenders and offers help in exchange for gasoline. The story (which was perhaps inspired by Kurosawas Yojimbo) is fast-paced, and the film seldom lets up thanks to director George Millers skillful storytelling.The film is full of interesting characters including the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) and a motorcycle rider Wez (Vernon Wells), one of the most memorable villains in the movie history. The beautiful cinematography by Dean Semler (who went on to win Oscar for his work for Dances with Wolves) is another plus.But of course, the Australian film has been remembered for its terrific car action and you will be amazed at the dangerous stunts.

"Set in 1862, Korea, the last days of the Joseon Dynasty, Kundo: Age of the Rampant (Kundo: Min-ran-eui si-dae) is a period action drama about a pack of bandits who fight against the corrupt ruling class, but the films overall tone is more similar to that of Western movie. As an action movie, that itself is not a bad thing.Kundo has several martial arts action set-pieces that are reasonably entertaining, but the real driving force of the film is the riveting performances from Jung-woo Ha as the vengeful butcher-turned-bandit Dolmuchi, and Dong-won Kang as the deadly swordsman Jo-yoon, who is a noblemans son.The problem is, unlike Django Unchained, Yoon Jong-bins film does not allow us to relate to the hero of the convoluting story. We are supposed to cheer for the bandits and Dolmuchi who joins them, but with too many characters, not enough fleshed out, I couldn't care less for any of them.The 137-minute saga could have been more intense and emotionally involving had filmmakers focused the conflict between Dong-won Kang and Jung-woo Has characters.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X0BNB1I5VXKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LD0VANC#wasThisHelpful","R2X0BNB1I5VXKH","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Ancient Magus Bride is a fantasy manga created by Kore Yamazaki. Set in the alternate world (that vaguely looks like Victorian England), the comic follows the story of a young heroine Chise Hatori, a 15-year-old Japanese girl who is sold to a mysterious mage named Ellias Ainsworth. And his head is an animal skull.Part of the story is probably inspired by The Beauty and the Beast, but the difference is that the beast can teach a lot about the world Chise lives in, especially its beauty and danger the young girl did not notice. The fantasy contains some dark elements, but the entire tone is neither violent nor depressing.The greatest part of Kore Yamazakis comic is its detailed illustration of creatures and landscapes, but you must keep one thing before reading her manga. As the author says in the afterword, the comic originally started as a one-shot doujin manga, and as is the case with some doujin or self-published comics, The Ancient Magus Bride tends to lean on style rather than story. Sometimes the (often dialogue-heavy) story is difficult to follow, with characters whose motives are not clear.So read the comic very slowly, enjoying the beautifully drawn artwork of the strange universe where humans and non-humans, and modern technologies and magic co-exist. Some of the offbeat humor in the original may be lost in translation, but the comic will be still very attractive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FC8GK5KW3OG5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626921873#wasThisHelpful","R1FC8GK5KW3OG5","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like Terry Gilliam. I like his movies, especially those made in the 80s like Time Bandits, Brazil and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. I like his visuals style that is always unique. Now his latest film The Zero Theorem arrives. OK, the visuals are certainly unique, but somehow it is hard for me to keep watching the film because it is boring.The Zero Theorem is about a reclusive computer programmer named Qohen Leth (Christoph Waltz) living in an alternate universe, obsessively working on a mysterious project commissioned by Management (Matt Damon). And Qohen thinks he almost received a message from someone about the meaning of life, and still waiting for that. Oh, and he is visited by Bainsley (Mlanie Thierry), a beautiful woman who seems interested in him, and later Bob (Lucas Hedges), son of Management, who gives some advice.Thus it goes on and on. While watching the visually interesting but narratively incoherent movie, I found myself trying to focus on the things that are going on before me, but just couldnt. Obviously the films muddled story is about something the director wants to communicate, but he fails simply because we are not allowed to connect any of these eccentric people.Am I missing something? Maybe. Maybe the director will be happy to explain the ideas behind the films details, and Im ready to hear that. But of course, I could watch Brazil again instead.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8UVHITEW14QE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZYELIE#wasThisHelpful","R8UVHITEW14QE","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following two thrillers Unknown and Non-Stop, Run All Night marks the director Jaume Collet-Serras third collaboration with the star Liam Neeson. But dont expect a big surprise or twisty narrative here because Run All Night is a thriller with an orthodox narrative featuring a father-son relationship plot.Liam Neeson plays an alcoholic New York gangster Jimmy Conlon, who has to protect his estranged son Mike (Joel Kinnaman) from Jimmys old friend and gangster Shawn Maguire (Ed Harris). Car chases and shoot-outs ensue.The film's cast includes Common, Vincent D'Onofrio, Boyd Holbrook, Bruce McGill and Gnesis Rodrguez as well as Nick Nolte in a cameo role.As the title suggests, Run All Night features a few extended cat-and-mouse scenes. They are competently done against the backdrop of the beautifully shot night streets of New York City, but the action stunts themselves not particularly new in terms of style. Also, the film has a convoluted story which needs more interesting characters to hold it all together.Run All Night is an old-school action thriller. The thriller loses steam in its second half, but still is a fairly thrilling ride.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZLZ9V9XX7G7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNONQSQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XZLZ9V9XX7G7","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first sight The Imitation Game may look like a historical war thriller about a team of Enigma codebreakers at Bletchley Park during WWII. The film is in fact about one genius whose life story is more complicated and compelling than the German code system. The person is Alan Turing, a British mathematician often referred to as a computer pioneer.The story of The Imitation Game is told in three timelines: Turings young days at a boys school and friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom; his works at Bletchley Park with his colleague including Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley); and what happened to him six years  conviction for indecency  after the war ended. The story goes back and forth in time frequently, but because of the skillful editing you will not get confused.The independent film is directed by Morten Tyldum, a Norwegian film director known for a unique action thriller Headhunters. His latest film focuses the tormented genius Alan Turing and what he learns from the relationship with other people surrounding him. As a thriller The Imitation Game is more conventional than Headhunters, but with Benedict Cumberbatch giving a convincing portrayal of Alan Turing, the film keeps us intrigued from start to finish.It is obvious that the filmmakers took artistic liberties with the process of codebreaking that must have been really much more complex, but the fantastic performance of the star almost makes us forget that. The Imitation Game is not a biographical movie in a traditional sense, but it is most riveting as a poignant story of someone who is so much ahead of his time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYKYHT78Z8UJ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RY85CQI#wasThisHelpful","RYKYHT78Z8UJ4","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In South Korean thriller Sea Fog (Haemoo), Kim Yoon-seok (The Chaser) plays Kang Chul-joo, respected captain of an old fishing vessel. Because of a run of bad luck, the captain needs money right now, so he takes on a job of smuggling a group of illegal immigrants from China. Little does the captain  and five fishermen working for him  know that this is only the beginning of a bloody mess.Sea Fog is based on a stage play, which is inspired by a real-life incident (the Taechangho incident) that happened in 2001. Also worth noting is that the film is produced by Joon-ho Bong, acclaimed director of such works as Memories of Murder and The Host. Joon-ho Bong also co-writes the script for Sea Fog.Sea Fog benefits from the realistic production designs, atmospheric cinematography and fine acting from the cast, but lacks the subtlety of Joon-ho Bongs narrative. The film is helmed by first-time director Sung-bo Shim, who effectively raises tension towards the climax, but he tends to overreach himself in trying to focus dark side of human nature.Perhaps Sea Fog could have been better with more insightful observations into the dark side of humanity, but is still an engrossing experience.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFOG6P4N6V977/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XBPNSI2#wasThisHelpful","RFOG6P4N6V977","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reasonable Doubt starts as a thriller and morality tale, with a Chicago district attorney Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper), who commits a hit-and-run while driving under the influence of alcohol. To his great surprise, the person who is later accused of the crime is one Clinton Davis (Samuel L. Jackson), who, he claims, was only trying to save the victim. So what should Mitch do?The film (its alternate title being The Good Samaritan) has a nice idea that would make for a great courtroom thriller, but the filmmakers fail to develop it into something substantial. Directed by Peter Howitt (the Sliding Doors director is credited as Peter P. Croudins) and written by Peter A. Dowling, co-writer of a Jodie Foster thriller Flightplan, Reasonable Doubts starts promisingly but quickly loses its focus halfway through, and becomes a run-of-the-mill thriller about cardboard characters with clich narrative elements.As a whole, the film feels unfinished in terms of story.

"If you have seen either of director Nacho Vigalondos past works  Timecrimes and Extraterrestrial  you know Open Windows is not going to be an ordinary thriller. The Spanish-made film (in English language) opens with a Rear Window-like premise about one Nick Chambers (Elijah Wood), an avid fan of an actress Jill Goddard (Sasha Grey), and Nick is offered a shady opportunity to look into her private life by someone with hacking skills.Intrigued Nick eventually succumbs to the temptation, without knowing the ever resourceful hackers real objective.As you know, thrillers usually require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief, but in Open Windows the amount gets so large that even the diehard fans of the gene would find it hard to take the film seriously.Dont expect something like Hitchcocks clever and suspenseful storytelling. If Open Widows is seldom boring (thats how I found it), it is because the incredible story jumps from one gimmick to another, (though without giving us enough explanation about the characters motives). The film offers thrills, but not really in an emotionally involving way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNFB95DS5SEIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OHLRC4K#wasThisHelpful","RNFB95DS5SEIP","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Johnny Depp has made a name for himself playing a variety of unique characters, some of whom are very eccentric like Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow. Now Johnny Depp has made another movie featuring an off-the-wall character named Charlie Mortdecai, a British aristocrat (and roguish art dealer) with a curly mustache. To get out of his financial mess, Mortdecai agrees to work for the British intelligence services. And his job is to track down a stolen Goya painting.I have not read the original books by Kyril Bonfiglioli, but I think the premise is good enough for a decent crime comedy, which Mortdecai simply isnt. The film is just boring as a comedy or action. Depp does what he is required to do and at least he does his best, and Paul Bettany is funny as Jock, Mortdecais faithful servant. In fact, Jock is often funnier than the titular hero.Mortdecai has nice visuals and soundtrack, but Director David Koepp, it seems, doesnt know what to do with the caper story and the quirky characters. Slapstick jokes are half-baked. Repeated references to Mortdecais mustache get tedious quickly; and there is simply no chemistry between the stars. The relationship between Charlie Mortdecai and Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) is one of the least convincing parts of the film.The film is not totally a mess because, besides Paul Bettany, it has Olivia Munn and Jeff Goldblum. Perhaps the film would have been better with more screen time given to them.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R120TE6D4IEB1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37CE2Q#wasThisHelpful","R120TE6D4IEB1","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Foxcatcher is directed by Bennett Miller, director of Capote and Moneyball. That means, Foxcatcher is no more about mystery than Moneyball is about baseball. Foxcatcher may involve a real-life crime, but Bennett Millers film is about the shifting power dynamics between three people  an eccentric billionaire John du Pont (Steve Carell) and Olympic gold medal winning wrestler brothers Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) and Dave Schultz (Mark Ruffalo).Foxcatcher starts with Mark Schultz speaking at an elementary school. He is clearly described as someone living in the shadow of his older brother Dave. Then a billionaire wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont invites Mark to join his Team Foxcatcher, offering a fantastic training environment. In fact, du Pont has been feeling overshadowed by someone more powerful.You will sense there is something not quite right with the team, however. There is a gloomy atmosphere hanging over the place, with du Pont who is unpredictable not in a good way. Dave later joins the team, which makes things more complicated. The way the director describes the events leading up to the crime is slow, to be sure, but is confident and effective nonetheless in creating the increasing tension between three principal characters played by three gifted actors.Foxcatcher may not be what you think it is. Like Capote and Moneyball the film is very quiet, and even depressing sometimes, but worth watching credible portrayals of these complicated personalities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NEXI8GF2L1FC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QK4ANEI#wasThisHelpful","R1NEXI8GF2L1FC","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is hard to dislike Magic in the Moonlight, Woody Allens romantic comedy set in the idyllic 1920s Southern France. Certainly this is not the greatest film from Woody Allen and the romance itself is rather predictable, but the light-hearted film is enjoyable, thanks to the capable performances from the stars Emma Stone and Colin Firth.Colin Firth is Wei Ling Soo, a world-famous illusionist, who is in fact a skeptical British man named Stanley. Now Howard (Simon McBurney), Stanleys old friend, visits him, asking him to help debunk a fortune teller and medium Sophie (Emma Stone). Stanley agrees, travels to the Cte d'Azur, where Sophie is staying with a rich American family.As you expect, Stanley is first interested in beautiful and spirited Sophie professionally, and then attracted to her romantically. In the romantic scenes you will notice several topics that have been touched upon in Woody Allens past movies  magic tricks, mortality and universe, etc.  but Allen seems not interested in them as much as before. Even some characters (like Catherine McCormacks Olivia, Stanleys fiance) are quickly forgotten.Still, Magic in the Moonlight manages to entertain, with delightful Colin Firths cynic-turned-romantic protagonist. This is a pleasant and optimistic Woody Allen movie.

"Daniel Radcliffe grows horns, gaining an unwanted power to make people confess their secrets. Based on a book by Joe Hill (Stephen Kings son) and directed by Alexandre Aja known for gory horrors including High Tension and The Hills Have Eyes, Horns has a perfect set-up for a dark (and darkly witty) fantasy, which the film strives to be.The film starts petty well, with Daniel Radcliff as Ig Perrish, a man suspected of murdering his long-time girlfriend Merrin Williams (Juno Temple). Despaired and heavily drunk, Ig does one thing at the crime scene, and as a consequence he obtains a pair of horns protruding from his head, as well as special powers.And people start telling what they are thinking  mostly about their dark desires  even when Ig is not really interested. But cannot he use this power to uncover the mystery of Merrins death?When Horns is good, the film is darkly funny. From its mid-section, however, the film goes downhill, taking too much time in explaining characters backstories in the Stand By Me-like flashbacks. Also, the murder mystery is not really compelling, and the media circus unconvincing.There is an interesting cast of supporting players such as Joe Anderson, Kelli Garner, Heather Graham, Max Minghella, David Morse, Kathleen Quinlan and James Remar, and though they do pretty well what they are supposed to do, their characters do not add much to the story that slowly runs out of ideas.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ME37LVTRMS3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P1WG6MS#wasThisHelpful","R1ME37LVTRMS3N","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Blackhat is director Michael Manns first film in about six years since Public Enemies (2009). The action thriller stars Chris Hemsworth, best known as Thor, Tang Wei (Lust, Caution), Viola Davis, Holt McCallany, and Wang Leehom. Despite the interesting cast and the films timely topic of cyber terrorism, Blackhat is a huge disappointment, feeling like an extended TV episode.Chris Hemsworth plays Nicholas Hathaway, a genius computer hacker in jail. Hathaway is given a task of tracking down the hacker who has caused a nuclear power plant accident in Hong Kong, and together with Captain Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom), an agent sent from China and his best friend, Hathaway sets out to capture the perpetrator.The biggest problem with Blackhat is that the script has little to offer in terms of originality. Blackhat means evil hackers, but the cyber terrorism sequences and the investigation after them lack details to interest us. Watching unconvincing visual effects showing the inside of computers is not a very thrilling experience.Considerable portion of the film is in fact not about cybercrimes, but about more generic combat scenes you have seen somewhere before. There is a subplot about the romantic relationship between two characters, which no one really cares. With flat characters and the story that doesnt make sense (the motive of the hacker is just laughable), Blackhat is only mildly entertaining.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30PSUE7MU4F13/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SG1353E#wasThisHelpful","R30PSUE7MU4F13","ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is so tiny being just about 2 inches in diameter and with the easily adjustable silicione handle you can have great clear audio wherever you want from up to 30 feet from the device it is linked to.  It linked up in seconds to my Ipod Touch and I take this everywhere.  It is waterproof and so durable that it needs no special care.  It is also very friendly and it is so simple to adjust the audio.  And even at the highest volume your tunes will still come out with great sound.  It also includes a built in mic.  This Bluetooth speaker comes equipped to simply and brilliantly do what it is meant to.  As I write this I need to end by simply stating again - the audio clarity is amazing and the volume control gives you full access to get your audio to any level you want without distortion.

"This t shirt impresses right away.  The material is very soft and the perfect thickness.  Not too thin like some t shirts and can definitely be worn under a fancier shirt for a classy look or will certainly look great on its own.  The shirt is of the quality that makes it a perfect match to wear very casual with jeans or a little dressier with a pair of khaki's.  The ribbed neck adds the perfect touch.  The only thing off about it for me was it was a little short waisted.  Definitely didn't have the length of most t shirts size large.  But it certainly isn't enough of an issue to keep it from becoming a regular part of my wardrobe.  But if you do like your t shirts a good length this style might not be for you.  I think it may have been made with the slightly shorter length to add to the class of the shirt.  It is of much better quality than your average t shirt and everything about it except for the short quibble with the length makes it an excellent shirt for me.  I will definitely be buying the same shirt in some of the other colors offered.  So if the length won't be an issue for you I think you will love this classy and dressy t shirt.

These are not just magazine type shots but true professional quality photos done with impeccable lighting that are truly meant to be seen in large calendar size. The calendar is printed on high grade paper and also has a page showing October to December 2015 so the calendar can be put to use way before 2016. This calendar was printed in the UK. Everything is English but under each month and day each is also typed in 4 other languages. Not sure what they are but this calendar is recommended for not only English speaking people. If you enlarge the picture of the back of the calendar above you will see what I mean.So I've found my 2016 calendar and couldn't be happier.  Lastly I want to add Amazon had this Guys calendar by Avonside last year for 2015 as well and I loved it but this years manages to be even better.  I didn't think it was possible for the quality photos to get better but they have.  If you are looking for a calendar with attractive men to help you get through the year this one I highly recommend. Great quality and a great purchase!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULOZ97C7HYZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1782084835#wasThisHelpful","R3ULOZ97C7HYZJ","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fruit of the Loom were always pretty reliable for me but their new sizing makes finding a pair that even somewhat fits impossible.  My ideal size would be a Large (38-40) if that existed..  Instead they have XL (40-42) or L (36-38) .  That is a big jump.  Most of the reviews here said these tended to run small so I went with the XL.  Not only were they huge providing no fit at all - the worst part was the waistband stretched so high up it was close to my belly button.  They were so huge that there was no way just going down 1 size to the L would correct the issue and this new design with the stretchy extra material at the waistband would keep these briefs from ever having a snug fit.  Maybe snug while looking like wearing a diaper.  The fit of these honestly look as if they were designed for a very heavy person in mind who would need that extra material to cover the lower part of a big stomach.  These briefs were so ill fitting, so unflattering and just not right.  Needless to say I went and purchased briefs by Hanes (who have also changed their sizing mind you) and found perfect fitting briefs for me.  I am 54 and grew up on Fruit of the Loom briefs.  I highly recommend not letting their longevity as a company convince you they are still quality and good fitting reliable briefs.  Be prepared if you purchase that they may quickly be going back for a return.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L5PLNY97UTXA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001JBNDM6#wasThisHelpful","R3L5PLNY97UTXA","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan and have many of her dvds.  She has indeed become my main exercise regime and I am getting fit and losing weight thanks to her.  I would rate this 5 stars even though it is slower paced and more for beginners and intermediates but I was really disappointed to see that each mile was only .75 mile.  I use a pedometer every time I use her dvds and 1 mile always shows as such on the pedometer and aerobic steps show as 2,000 every mile (sometimes a little more if I boosted it up.)  Her group member Nick is my motivator who I follow on all the dvds and with this one I did every mile and every step at the same pace he did.  After the 3 miles and cool down the pedometer read 2.32 miles and 5,385 steps.  And for that reading I boosted as much as I could.  I also checked the pedometer every time she announced another mile had been done and the pedometer showed an estimated .75 mile rather than a full mile.  It also was a let down that I never felt like I never went into a steady fast paced burn.  The highest level on this dvd is a mid build up range on other dvds.  Luckily this dvd will be perfect for a friend of mine who wants to start following Leslie as well for it just doesn't provide a good enough workout to become part of my regular routine.  My favorite Leslie dvd is WALK TO THE HITS - ALL TIME FAVORITES.  It is a very strenuous workout but last time I did it I walked 6,423 aerobic steps doing the entire 3 mile dvd.  I hate giving Leslie a review less than 4 stars but it is important for her regular walkers and new ones as well to know that it is basically a mid paced 2 mile plus dvd.  It is not 3 miles as advertised.  And when I was finished I just wished I had done another dvd that would have provided a more strenuous, faster paced routine regardless of the miles.  I love all her moves and the feeling after a good workout is always amazing.  I did sweat on this one after about 20 minutes but it is the first dvd I was able to do from beginning to end the very first time and feel like it was moreso an extended warm up.  It just never got going for me.  And I need to say it one more time.  I am very disappointed with leslie that it is not 3 miles as advertised.  I want to walk so many miles per day and this was supposed to provide an option for my 3 mile day but it will not.  Definitely a Leslie lover here but disappointed with this dvd.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XIKEIJ40G7M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0145NSN92#wasThisHelpful","R1XIKEIJ40G7M","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am on my second pair of Sony noise canceling headphones I love but they are  not being made anymore.  They fit me perfectly and were so comfortable with great sound quality.  I hoped going with Sony again after trying other brands would give me another winner but I really dislike these.  Whichever ear bud size I try I can't get a good snug fit that will stay in my ear.  They seem to be in nice and comfortable and then slide right out.  And eventually they fully fall out.  Also I am really disappointed with the sound quality.  I find the sound to be very basic and generic with no real good bass or lows and highs.  Perhaps these just weren't the correct kind of headphones I was looking for for there are many positive reviews here.  But for me I don't like to settle with my earbuds so I am going to try Sony again but go up in price and also go for ones that are definitely noise canceling.  They have a more curved position to the bud that seems to work better for my ears.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1561Q5VGE6RFM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007BY3OVK#wasThisHelpful","R1561Q5VGE6RFM","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These headphones are marketed as gaming headphones and they are indeed excellent for that purpose enhancing the gaming experience with crystal clear multi dimensional audio,  Your games will come to life like never before.  But if you are wondering how these will work for other purposes they bring the same high audio quality to music, tv, and movies. The only thing that may be a con for some will be that it connects to your gaming controller via an actual audio cable.

"I am surprised by the mix of reviews here.  I love a great thriller but what really impresses me is a deep psychological thriller that really gets into the psyche of the characters and it becomes the characters that drive the novel.  That is what happens here with BRADSTREET GATE.  Author Robin Kirman intelligently (which is also a rare treat) weaves a twisted tale of a murder and a teacher and three college students by beginning slowly and then gently building to a very satisfying conclusion.  But the reason for reading this novel is the journey to the end.  Kirman follows the characters over a 10 year period and her level of detail and very assured hand in her characters pulls the reader in.  The plot twists all make sense and everything here blends perfectly.  This is an author I will definitely be following.  Very impressive debut.  Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14H27ADMMEUJU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139318#wasThisHelpful","R14H27ADMMEUJU","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is so refreshing to find a product that is high of quality, durable and even better than advertised.  This is my very first Pyrex set and finally all my Tupperware can be thrown away.  The varying sizes of bowls here is amazing from very large to very small.  The glass they are made of is of the highest quality and these bowls have the added bonus of being very attractive.  They can be used for mixing, storage - just about anything.  And what I love is that they are indeed microwave and oven safe.  I can store leftovers in the fridge and the lids also go on tight enough to make these bowls also great for longer storage in the freezer.  And whether cooking or reheating I have found all great in the oven or microwave.  The biggest deal for me here is the two baking pans.  A large one and even the smaller one is of a great size.  I don't have a dishwasher (yes I do - me!) so these Pyrex products are also essential for me because they are so easy to clean.  Even if something sticks on the pan after baking I just let it soak a little and then it cleans easily.  The added bonus that I can prepare food in these bowls or pans and then use them for serving as well is also superb.  And of final note the lids are made of a very durable plastic.I think all that I am raving about is what Pyrex lovers have always known.  This is new to me so I much share my enthusiasm.  A new Pyrex user and fan has been born.  I highly recommend this set.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EZ609T0LSKP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0119IGNB6#wasThisHelpful","R3EZ609T0LSKP4","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love towel wraps and was excited to get a new one.  They are so convenient to wrap on when getting ready in the bathroom and after a shower.  All previous wraps I've had have been an actual towel with quality absorbency.  This wrap is made of microfiber.  The material is indeed soft but it is also very thin and not really absorbent at all.  If the rest of the wrap was of good quality I still would have liked this wrap but the Velcro closure is very cheaply made and you can feel thin cardboard under the thin microfiber material and it is very uncomfortable and actually hurts when on the body.  The one size of the wrap is fine and had it been made of thicker higher quality material including better material within the velcro closure this item could have been a winner.  Just holding the towel wrap in my hands I can feel how cheap the velcro closure is and know that in no time it will tear.  I'm rather surprised by the price here - seems pretty steep for such a subpar product.  if you want a comfy, convenient towel wrap look elsewhere.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TLTA7R82W0AF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011EBNB5O#wasThisHelpful","R2TLTA7R82W0AF","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here we have  a condensed version of Quilted Northern Ultra Plush bath tissue.  I am sure the product is environmentally friendly for the cardboard core is not needed.  The roll fits on the bath spindle the exact same way and works perfectly providing the same quality tissue.  Interestingly enough the product only takes up a little less space when packaged without the core - nothing really significant.  I give this tissue a high grade for I am a huge fan of Quilted Northern Ultra Plush and the added addition of being better for the environment.  One star is subtracted for ultimately it is the same product packaged differently with minor tweaks.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DCG39FT5A4DT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013DQJKTE#wasThisHelpful","R3DCG39FT5A4DT","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am such a fan of Katharine McPhee and have loved her and been in awe of her vocal ability since American Idol.  Smash was a true gift for me and all Kat fans.  Seeing the full range and potential of her angelic voice was a weekly gift.  Then time passed and the new single was Lick my Lips.  Very different from Smash and I must admit I was a little disappointed, or nervous rather as to what the new cd would be like.  I definitely should have known better for Kat can do no wrong.  There is no style of music she cannot conquer and here is yet another side of the musical talent and range of Katharine McPhee and I love it!!  And Lick my Lips shines here.The cd starts with the title track HYSTERIA  and lets you know this is different music from Kat and you also hear the emotion, range and vocal gymnastics that are there.  Edgy, intriguing and fun the song opens the door for the rest of the awesome cd.  I am also a sucker for a Kat ballad and I was blown away by the two major ones here.  BREAK begins with haunting lilting vocals and the song builds to a true emotional wallop.  And then there is my favorite on the whole cd - LOVE STRIKES begins with light piano notes and then Kat starts singing and the raw emotion present brings me to tears every time.  Her vocals soar displaying a new range, new style and even new emotional impact stronger than I've ever heard from her before.  FEATHER and ONLY ONE are both great uptempo songs while APPETITE is a haunting and very sensual Kat.  Magic.  There is not a single miss here.  The mix of tempos and styles all show a brand new side of Kat and the closing I DON'T NEED LOVE is a true vocal tour de force with an uptempo track.  Her true vocal abilities are shown here.  This is a demanding song and it builds and builds with Kat's angelic voice growing stronger and stronger, building and building till it ends with a true impact that will make the listener hit track 1 to start over all again.  At least it did for me.  Highly recommend this cd not only for Katharine McPhee fans but for any true fan of quality music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141TLKBK7OQ09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YDF75OC#wasThisHelpful","R141TLKBK7OQ09","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Killing Lessons by Saul Black is a rare find.  There are many quality thrillers out there and also many quality literary novels but rarely do you see the combination of both.  Black brings to the suspense/thriller genre  a story that is so realistic in its horror while also providing deeply meshed out characters and literary prose that flow from page to page.  I love psychological thrillers where we get into the minds of the characters and Black delivers that at the highest level.  Many thrillers are written with the acts of violence rather removed.  Here the reader is forced to face the experiences as if they are truly living them.  There is nothing gratuitous here either.  Instead it is a style that pulls the reader in expertly.  The opening of the novel sets the stage for what the reader can expect.  I turned the pages with trepidation and as everything unfolded I was enthralled with the atmospheric presence Saul Black provides and the believable and realistic characters truly came to life for me.  These characters are flawed and practically jump off the pages with their humanness.  Their actions and thoughts are not there for plot purposes but rather as believable characters enduring not only the unfolding horrors but their inner demons and lives.  I have never read a serial killer novel this intense nor one that also had a detective as engrossing as Valerie Hart.  I highly recommend this novel.  It is the rare combination of a true literary work and also a novel at the top of the thriller genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y0OELNVRWGYH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250057345#wasThisHelpful","R2Y0OELNVRWGYH","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These will work out pretty well for almost anyone and will be great as an extra second pair for me.  I am kind of an audiophile and these are fine on the fly but not for my primary headphones.  The sound, fit, noise isolation are all fine.  But only fine.  The ear buds are adequate for me but not totally comfortable and after a bit of time get a little uncomfortable.  The sound and bass is good but in all honesty I prefer Sony for sound and comfort even with their lower end headphones.  I think it is a matter of preference though.  For me the Sony buds are more comfortable and provide more noise isolation with better sound quality.  But that is why there are so many brands and styles available.  I also found the cord with these Panasonic headphones to be a good length but for me it did get tangled easily.  I am only saying how these worked for me and suited my needs.  It really does come down to what works for each person and the ears can be the most sensitive body part.  What works for one may not for another and vice versa.  And in all honesty for the price these are really good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJ9SD2VFRVAB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4LGU1Y#wasThisHelpful","R1QJ9SD2VFRVAB","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always been a Levi's wearer but have been dissatisfied with what seems like a decline in their quality the last few years.  Material seems thinner and the cost of them way too high.  I am so thrilled I discovered these Wrangler jeans.  They are a perfect substitute for the Levis 550 relaxed fit jeans while providing much better quality.  They are made of quality and durable denim and look great.  And after washing even better!  The fit is great as well.

"It is frustrating when books are totally miscategorized in their genre.  I chose this novel as an LGBT novel and in no way is it that.  Instead what we have is a translation of classic Japanese literature.  Nan-Core by Mahokaru Numata is a treat of intelligent literature in a style we don't see here in the US.  Superbly written this novel is a blend of heartfelt drama addressing family, love, honor and the search for identity with pretty hard core gothic horror.  And because the novel is so intelligently executed it all works.  Numata takes the reader on a heart palpitating journey.  This novel is short yet huge in its impact.  The miscategorizing of its genre could keep those who would love it from seeking it out awhile also keeping those thinking it was not what was expected from giving it a shot.  Any true lover of literature will find this an exemplary work of art.  And how intriguing it is to see what lies in the Japanese culture.  It comes across strongly not only in the prose but also in the atmosphere within the story.  This novel is so much more than the brief synopsis written on the page description.

"The concept of these mitts is great and I wanted to like them and more importantly wanted to be able to use them.  But sadly I cannot.  I am a 6 foot guy and have never been known to have oversized hands so it just amazes me how small these pot holders are.  For reference my hand measures 8 inches from my wrist to the tip of my middle finger.  The mitts are so small that when I put my hands in the pocket of them I can't get my fingers in far enough to get a grip.  So I tried using them without the pocket to just try to get the benefit of the heat resistance from the  neoprene.  Again so small I couldn't get a grip on anything.  Useless.  And I am not saying I got my hands in to use them but they left too much area of my hand or lower arm bare.  I am honestly saying they were just to small for my hands to fit in at all.

"I have always been a Levi's 501 jeans wearer and for almost 2 years have been wearing size 40 length 32.  I am 54 6 feet and was weighing in at about 265.  Over the past 4 months I have been getting in shape and have lost 20 pounds so far but what more importantly comes with that is the slimming down of the body overall.  I have a belly which is always the last thing to go.  Going down in size in the Levi's was impossible and now they are just too big.  These Comfort Waist Wrangler jeans are the answer for me.  First off the quality of the jeans themselves and the material is totally on par with that of Levi's - maybe even better and more durable.  The elastic waist is in no may like ridiculous stretchy pants.  Instead the internal elastic waistband is a mere 1% spandex which gives just that extra give needed when buttoning the jeans.  Without that I wouldn't fit into these but now with my lost weight and slimming body these relaxed fit jeans fit snug but not too tight and look absolutely great allowing me to cater to my new thinner self.  And again the waist is not a cheap elastic material.  Instead the jeans appear the same as regular jeans till you go to button them and they have that little give.  I am thrilled that even while still having my slowing fading pot belly I can go down a size in jeans.  Finally I can wear a size 38.  And these jeans are in no way meant just for older folks like me.  Anyone who has a little extra in the waist will find these allow you to still have a great fit.  And they wash great as well.  I truly am very impressed with the quality of these jeans and can finally say goodbye to Levi's and especially to their outrageous prices.  Highly recommend these jeans.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25TRM1PBDDMQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKXSRXQ#wasThisHelpful","R25TRM1PBDDMQ","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been looking for a scale that is both decorative and accurate in its reading for quite a while now.  To receive this Taylor glass digital scale far surpassed all my desires and needs.  The scale is made of a very stable and durable glass and the faux marble design is classy and subtle.  The design will blend perfectly into any high end bathroom and is also simple enough that it will also add a great touch to any modern dcor or any style between these two ends.  More importantly though is its accuracy.  The scale comes with the batteries already inside and is honestly the most user friendly scale I have ever tried.  With first use you simply step on and off it quickly.  That resets the scale to zero and it is set to go.  When you stand on the scale to weigh yourself it will jump to your weight and at the end slow down to 0.2 pound increments of accuracy.  When the weight is ready the scale will flash twice and then the weight will be locked in.  The 3"" lcd readout is bright and easy to read.  The tempered glass platform is made of the highest quality and this scale will read any weight up to 400 pounds which is a great bonus.  I can't recommend this scale enough.

"Be sure to note exactly what you are getting here before purchasing to make sure you get what you want.  The emphasis here is that you are getting a set of five bands with varying resistance (Yellow: 2-4lbs, Blue: 4-6lbs, Green: 10-12lbs, Black: 15-20lbs, and Red: 25-30lbs). The bands are strong, flexible and durable.  They are also easily stackable to build the weight of maximum resistance you want.  The set is user friendly for what you get.  It comes in a nice zipper pouch.  The added components are of good quality but you only get a door anchor which helps keep the bands in place when exercising.  You also get ankle straps that a great for bringing your workout to your legs.  The foam handles are comfortable and strong for extending the bands.  The one thing that confuses me is that the straps are very long and seem to only really be good for a tall person like me.  The directions are minimal and don't really offer suggestions or guide a person on how to use these bands to their best benefit.  So if you are looking for varying weight resistance bands that are of a long length this set might serve you well.  Again, read the details of what you get.

"I wasn't sure if this would fit my Sony NWZE385 16 GB Walkman MP3.  The Walkman does fit but it is not a totally snug fit so there is sliding movement from top to bottom with about 1/4 inch of empty space.  The band fits on my arm but a more secure fit would be possible if the band was stretchable.  Instead I must make it very tight and if being very active it will eventually slide.  Also due to the slippage of theWalkman I must wear the band with the Walkman upside down to make sure the ear buds stay securely attached to the player.  And no matter how I position the band I find it pretty much impossible to click the function keys to jump tracks or change music.  I must stop, take off the band to do that.  At least once my music is set and the band in place I am pretty much set.  Sadly this product is a settling product.  It is the only option available to serve this purpose for the Sony NWZE385 16 GB Walkman MP3.  Lastly I am not sure how good the protective sleeve the Walkman rests in is from protecting it from sweat.  I don't sweat excessively when I wear it.  If you are looking for a product to wear your Walkman on your arm this is the only product available.  It will do the job but just be aware it is not perfect.  Also make sure you get the correct size band for your player.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZV81SS7NMZ1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IYP7VXW#wasThisHelpful","R2ZV81SS7NMZ1I","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Due to how hard it was to get this attached to the original band and then how bulky and cumbersome it became I toyed with the original band to be able to use that alone with a very tight fit.  This extender does work but is not made to seamlessly fit.  Instead you must really force the end into the original band and it does not add the number of inches stated in the product description.  It also makes the band very heavy and difficult to put on.  There is no way that the extender or original strap will not tear over minimal time due to how hard this is to use.  Also it comes with no instructions and due to how tricky and difficult it is to attach the extender it would be good to have some directions letting you know you were doing it right.  Instead I had to keep looking at the pictures on Amazon to make sure it was right.  If you really need it give it a try.  Sadly the iGadgitz arm band was the only item available to do the simple job of attaching my Sony NWZE385 16 GB Walkman to my arm.  This product for me was useless and too much of a pain to return.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RDSH0FHKNIRT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LX0ZT3E#wasThisHelpful","R2RDSH0FHKNIRT","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been over 10 years since I have given remanufactured ink cartridges a shot.  They were always leaking and worked streaky at best.  So I've been buying the HP 92 and 93 dual pack to be sure they would work.  But the cartridges are very pricey and when I saw the price and reviews of the Valuetoner cartridges I decided to give them a shot.  If they didn't work out - nothing really lost due to the price.  I was totally impressed with the purchase right upon receiving them.  The cartridges are packaged individually and with great care.  They also come with detailed and clear details on the cartridges themselves, how they work and how to troubleshoot if your printer won't see them as valid cartridges.  It all went very simply for me.  My printer noted that they weren't authentic HP cartridges but accepted them right away and printed the test page the same as after every cartridge installation.  These cartridges did not leak at all upon opening and printed flawlessly upon installation.  The test page was perfect and after about 100 pages both cartridges have not streaked or faltered in quality at all.  I see some people feel some cartridges are not performing as they wish.  Honestly that has happened with authentic HP cartridges to me many times as well.  I print many photos and often with the HP cartridges they would start fading or streaking after only 10 prints and I would have to put my printer through the clean cartridges mode.  With these Valuetoner cartridges that has yet to happen.  I am more than thrilled and impressed with their quality and the professional packaging of the company.  I highly recommend giving this company and these cartridges a shot.  If my cartridges do indeed start to falter I will adjust this review accordingly to be as accurate and helpful as possible.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1A8B5HALR35XJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UI2NC6Y#wasThisHelpful","R1A8B5HALR35XJ","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I just purchased a 32 oz narrow mouth water bottle and needed something to be able to clean it.  Thus the OXO Good Grips bottle brush.  Boy was I impressed with what I thought was going to be a simple basic item.  The handle is long and sturdy and the brush is hard enough to be sure to get the job done and soft enough to not scratch.  The brush gently squeezes into my water bottle and then the brush expands and provides a thorough cleaning.  It is also excellent for cleaning tall glasses where you don't want to take a chance getting your hand in there.  I am confused by some saying the handle or item itself is too small.  The handle by itself is 10 inches and the brush is 3 inches for a total of 13 inches.  I experimented with bottles with different size openings and found this brush could squeeze into anything with an opening even as small as 3/4 inches and then expand to fully clean.  Very impressed with this durable brush.  Lastly it also has a rubber grip on the top portion of the handle to help make cleaning even easier.  Definitely recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S4R118EO47U6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004OCLJ#wasThisHelpful","R1S4R118EO47U6","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For such a long time I have been reusing 16 oz. water bottles after I purchase them for the gym, outside exercising and just for having water on hand.  But problems with that were 1) bottle was too small 2) bottle hard to clean and 3) bottle pretty flimsy.  This Nalgene water bottle provided solutions to all my problems and has now become an item that I carry with me every day no matter where I am or where I go.  The bottle is strong, sturdy and when empty not too heavy while still being extremely durable. (I love the orange color I got.)  And when full it still isn't too heavy.  The cap fits on snugly and no matter how this bottle gets tossed around it doesn't leak at all.  The mouth opening is also perfect for me.  It far surpasses those ridiculous squirt bottles and is also not a wide bottle which manages to dribble water all over me when used.  This narrow mouth top is about the size of a quarter and just the perfect size to get a good amount of water each time.I use the treadmill at the gym and this bottle fits into the cup holder just fine.  But where it serves its greater purpose is on my daily aerobic walks and while just living life day to day.  The 32 ounces it holds is just the perfect amount to keep me hydrated all day with the bottle not being too heavy.  The most important factors here are the bottle is bpa free, it is very durable and does not leak, perfect size mouth and easy to carry around.  Highly recommend.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19C8FKSFCJNAD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001T9CRR0#wasThisHelpful","R19C8FKSFCJNAD","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hanes has always been my go to for white briefs and it has been a long time since I needed to order new pairs.  A lot has changed in that time.  Sizing was very frustrating for I used to simply get them in size 40 and I would get the fit I wanted.  Now they have changed their sizing to S,M,L etc.  The L is 38-40 and I am losing some weight so I gave them a shot.  Luckily for me they were the perfect size.  They fit snugly while not being too tight.  The material is heavier in the front where they need be and thinner the rest of the way around.  At first I wasn't happy noticing this difference from my older pairs but especially after washing I find the thinner material very breathable and soft.  These briefs certainly wash well and shrank just a minimal amount - I did wash them in hot water.  Some people have said due to the thin material these can seen see through.  I totally disagree.  As I stated above, the material is thicker where necessary.  Being tagless just adds to the comfort.  I took off one star for I did have to do some guesswork on which size would work best for me and think some others may have more trouble finding that correct snug fitting size due their new sizing system.  But for me, luckily having found the correct size that works, Hanes will continue to be my white briefs of choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSMQCGDTWCOP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00569PW80#wasThisHelpful","R3PSMQCGDTWCOP","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This shower curtain is a great addition to any bathroom dcor.  I received the cream curtain in a damask design.  The design is luxurious and stylish without being over the top.  I have only positives for this curtain.  It is 100% polyester and manages to feel like a quality fabric curtain.  Common sense dictates that a shower lining must be used with it for this curtain is fabric and not meant to get wet.  This curtain is expertly designed so it will add that final touch to a high end bathroom or bring modern style to a more casual bathroom like mine.  I like brightly colored towels and mats and this cream designed curtain manages to make my bathroom look fresher and crisper with the curtain standing out beautifully while enhancing the other bright colors I have.  It will be perfect for the fall and winter months.

"I am a guy and I absolutely love this hair blower.  I love that it is very solid in construction, blows out steady strong air, is very easy to handle and hold and also find the fluorescent pink color a real kick.  But what matters to me most is that it has a true cool setting.  I wear my hair from short to mid length and I sweat easily.  In hot summers and even within the humid air after a shower in the winter warm air even on a low setting always takes forever to dry my hair and will also tend to make it dry.  I have been searching high and low for a hair blower that has a cool setting.  My old one only has warm/hot and I could only find ones that were the same but had an added cold burst.  This isn't really a setting and is meant to be used to hold hair in place when styling.I am glad that I got this hair dryer during a very hot summer so I could really test how it suits my needs and even on hot humid days when I can't stop the sweat the cool setting works well to dry my hair while cooling me down as well.  Now I can have full healthy hair even in humid weather and the 1875 watts really have the dryer putting out a strong stream of air.  I highly recommend this hair blower.  It is of much better construction than my old one without being too heavy or bulky.  I see it being very user friendly for women with long hair or styled hair as well.  And it also has that burst of cold air which I will occasionally press for some fun.  It's good to see a product so well made that works so well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JI51SR0534WS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY8Y03Q#wasThisHelpful","R3JI51SR0534WS","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You would think after all this time a clock radio would be a reliable easy to use item.  Up to this one I just couldn't find one I really liked.  My old one was a Sony and this Timex puts it to shame.  First off I love its appearance - it is sleek, slim and modern taking up very little space on my nightstand.  It adds a definite positive look.  And the numbers showing the time are huge which is a must for me when I wake up without my glasses on.  There is a dimmer to adjust the brightness to your preference.  Also of utmost importance is setting or resetting the time.  When first plugged in it showed the day and month followed by the time zone.  It was eastern, my time zone, but the time was off one hour.  The manual explains everything clearly and simply and a quick slide to the DST Switch added the hour I needed.  The buzzer is an excellent volume for me and the radio comes in great with a total of 20 available presets.  You can use the aux in jack to connect external audio for playback and finally there is a usb port to charge any device you need to.  From the sleek design to having an actual hands on manual that explains everything this clock radio by Timex is the most user friendly one you can find.  I love it and highly recommend it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KRTWKE2L0OHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UNDEKWI#wasThisHelpful","R1KRTWKE2L0OHF","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always relied on Scotch-Brite non scratch sponges for my kitchen uses with pans, dishes etc.  They have always been reliable cleaning well and keeping all items scratch free.  But till these sponges I had yet to find any sponge to really work well on hard to clean areas around the home where grime and dirt has accumulated.  My perfect test for these was a seldom used shower stall that had been neglected.  I had tried other products that never got it fully clean and also made the task no easier.  Though these sponges advertise themselves with no pre-soaking needed being a pro, that doesn't matter to me and I did presoak the sponge as well as wet the shower stall tiles and ceramic base before use.  This sponge honestly proved to be miraculous.  Very little extra energy needed to be exerted on my part and this sponge easily and smoothly cut through all the grime and mess ultimately leaving a spotless and shiny shower stall.  I used it to clean my bathroom sink which I thought was clean and a new found shine emerged.  Bottom line, these sponges do as advertised and are indeed ""extreme""  cutting through the hardest and dirtiest areas.  Also unlike other similar products they do not wear out quickly.  After use simply clean the sponge and rinse, let dry and it will be ready for use again.  Also for how extreme their cleaning power is they don't scratch any surfaces that I could tell.  I highly recommend these sponges.  For those jobs you usually find yourself forcefully scrubbing away at these sponges will be a wonderful solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34Z4NK8QZ2D52/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0100DOWKU#wasThisHelpful","R34Z4NK8QZ2D52","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When a true artist writes a novel it is amazing to see the true magic that appears.  And that is what happens here with MORE HAPPY THAN NOT the magical and truly heartfelt debut from Adam Silvera.  This novel is also so hard to classify.  Is it a gay novel?  No it is a novel where being gay is a part of the huge story being told.  Finally someone strong enough to write a novel where gay doesn't have to jump at you, be stressed as a major theme etc. even as the main character himself struggles with it.  The other complexity is that this is described a s a young adult novel and I say nope, it is a novel for people of all ages.  I am 53 and devoured it and the mastery of the mind that Silvera possesses.A simple life is shown for main character Aaron.  He is not really happy, not really troubled.  He is existing.  He has a supportive girlfriend, nonexistent brother and very busy mother.  His life has had trauma including the suicide of his father.  But then something happens.  Aaron meets Thomas and finally someone gets him.  he can be himself in a way he never could before.  And along with this comes feelings, emotions and obsession.  And Aaron's old life isn't too welcoming of his new special friend.  And Thomas really seems to bring out the true Aaron and that is a gay Aaron.  But all the problems that come with it make Aaron want to make it go away, sadly.  And the Leteo Institute can help with that.And that is enough of the plot for what this novel is about is the true magical realities of life.  Emotions glow and shine here jumping off the page.  The characters are so real and believable the reader can't help but get fully drawn into all the worlds that encompass Aaron.  And Aaron himself is a magical being.  It is a true honor to follow him on his journey of self discovery, fully allowing himself to identify all the parts of himself from his interests to desires.  Huge kudos to Silvera.  He presents here a truly special masterpiece of literary work that all can enjoy.  It  is about life and being true to ones self.  And the imagination that Silvera possesses adds layers and layers of searing wonder to an already special story.

"I need to start by saying simply that FINDING JAKE is an exemplary piece of literary work written by Bryan Reardon who uses his skill with complex psychological themes, character development and a true gift of handling the written language to present a story that is timely, realistic and devastatingly believable.  The subject matter is hard core.  A stay at home dad who truly loves his family begins to question how well he knows one of his sons and goes through a deep inner struggle after a shooting happens at the sons school.  His son ends up being the only child missing and he must try to figure out what that means,  This story becomes very real as it openly encompasses all real and true emotions and feelings a parent and family would endure including faith and doubt, love and heartache.  The realities and emotions are laid on the page raw here.  The novel also manages to be a piece of psychological suspense while tackling these issues.  Reardon takes the reader on a wallop of an emotional journey till the satisfying conclusion.  This novel is very important to read not only for being an excellent novel but also due to how well it tackles issues that are so important in life today.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P90ARICYL2HL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062339486#wasThisHelpful","R2P90ARICYL2HL","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE PRESERVATIONIST is the type of book that really shows how talented the writer is.  The story is pretty basic.  Freshman girl on college campus who is pretty fragile.  40 year old man who works at the campus becomes infatuated with her.  Another young man becomes interested in her as well.  Add into all this a serial killer striking on campus and the stage is set for a pretty good thriller.  But what author Justin Kramon manages to do is pretty amazing.  The novel starts pretty simply leading the reader to think it will be a basicly told tale but then an atmosphere of true creepiness, anxiety and growing horror instills itself in the tale and never lets up.  The characters become very real and whether the reader likes them or not the plot twists and turns play on your emotions till the final conclusion.  Kramon makes this a very real tale about fear, stalking and the true menaces that exist in society today.  Kudos to him.  The novel may actually be very disturbing for some but this is a testament to how good the author is.  He makes it all so very real.

"I am a die hard historical fiction reader and I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with THE ILLUSIONIST.  It is not so much historical fiction as much a period piece taking place in 1870 Victorian England.  Author Rosie Thomas skillfully brings all of that period to life.  The atmosphere and way of life jumps off the pages.  Bust more importantly this is a character driven novel that evolves around a young woman Eliza who is trying to find her way in life as a person and more importantly as a woman.  She is working as a model when she meets the amazingly well developed character Devil who is a showman looking to start his own theater company..  Add in Carlo Bonomi, a dwarf and the bizarre Jasper Button and you have the full set of main characters here.  They are quirky, bizarre and more importantly very human and fully developed by Thomas.  This novel has a captivating story line that will effortlessly pull the reader in.  It combines the world of the theater, a love story and a complex thriller.  And throughout all this the story is held together by Eliza as we follow her on her inner and outer journey.  Rosie Thomas shows true artistry here as she combines these innovative characters with such  a strange yet truly believable story line with the back drop of Victorian England.  The story line brought to my mind some of John Irving's novels.  If you like novels that are intelligently written and very imaginative with well developed characters you will love this book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNN5VZRIENF6K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1468309900#wasThisHelpful","RNN5VZRIENF6K","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story is about Livy Jackson who is convinced the death of her friend was not suicide as it has been determined to be and with much research thinks it may be linked to the murder of her sister 18 years earlier.

"When you read the story synopsis for this novel you may be taken aback by how dark and disturbing it sounds.  Author Jessica Treadway tackles some heavy stuff here and comes up with an amazingly complex and intricate intelligent psychological thriller.  What we get added in is the full concept of the family dynamic.  Sadly the story here is not one unheard of in true crime.  Parents that have an awkward, different and somewhat troubled daughter are happy when she finds a boyfriend and seems to come out of her shell.  But then disaster strikes and the parents are attacked brutally asleep in bed.  The husband dies, mother survives and the boyfriend is found guilty.  But he then receives an appeal and the daughter returns home.  That is the story in a nutshell but what Treadway provides the reader is so much more.  This is a deep and intelligent psychological thriller told with maturity, insight and truly complex characters that jump from the page.  Treadway handles this very disturbing subject matter with full respect to the reader and takes them on a true journey.  The story is told from the viewpoint of Hannah, the mother, who is forced to relive the nightmare event over and over and the multitude of feelings and emotions she goes through are both devastatingly realistic and believable.  This novel may be difficult for some but it is told with such intelligence and literary prowess that the reader will feel safe while treading such subject matter.  Disturbing but highly recommended.  This is what quality literature is.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R131I5PR1HJH1E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455554073#wasThisHelpful","R131I5PR1HJH1E","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is excellent for a summer beach read or late at night before bed - though falling asleep might be a little difficult at some points of this creative thriller.  Evelyn Baine is an FBI profiler whose best friend had disappeared 18 years earlier.  Now in the present day another girl goes missing, now making it four total, with the same clues being left.  This is a very intriguing premise and author Elizabeth Heiter runs with it providing a strong suspenseful read with many unexpected twists and turns.  Understandably the main character is emotionally involved in finding out what happened to her friend but at times character development is not fully consistent or even somewhat lacking.  But this novel is not a deep intelligent psychological thriller and I don't mean that in a bad way.  What the reader gets is a strong novel of romantic suspense that is driven by a very imaginative plot that carries the reader to the very satisfying ending.

"This is the first camcorder I have ever owned.  I have used friends over the years and pretty much know how they work and am so glad that they have been around a long time before getting my first one.  This camera is so user friendly and is very small and fits in the palm of your hand.  This makes it easy to use for video experts as well as those new to camcorders whatever the age.  The camera films seamlessly and even if you jitter a little when filming the video shoots flawlessly.  You also get a suction cup mount that will attach to your car or other moving thing as well as one for a helmet or more stationary item.  Everything you need to process your video, edit it, make special videos or movies is here and the directions are very good.  Some say they are not but you get basic instructions here and more detailed info is available online which many companies are doing now.  I could go on and on but all the camcorder says it does in the item description it does and then some.  I must again stress how simple it is to use and that it will provide all the high quality necessary for video experts as well as provide a new user with all the tools to put this camera to its best use.  I've been having a ball with it and have been shooting some fun videos to put on the internet.  Much fun.  I've researched other such items and really think this action cam set is the best deal.

"Joy Fielding has been writing for a long time and I became a huge fan after reading her deliciously suspenseful book SEE JANE RUN  That was an amazing literary psychological novel of true suspense.  Since then her books have been hit or miss.  I loved STILL LIFE and HEARTSTOPPER but really didn't like SHADOW CREEK or NOW YOU SEE HER.  I found her style to be turning more mainstream and many novels even took on a Mary Higgins Clark style with one dimensional characters and slight plot lines.With this new one SOMEONE IS WATCHING Joy Fielding pretty much returns to her true form.  When it comes to the plot she is masterful here with believable twists and turns and suspense that truly will keep the reader breathless.  The characters are another story.,  The main character Bailey Carpenter is well developed and her psychological profile mixed with the great story are what make the novel work.  Other characters can tend to be pretty one dimensional and some conversations are pretty silly.  But from the first truly dramatic scene in the book Fielding turns into an A+ writer in regards to the strong plot.  Her writing there shows she still has the chops for an excellent psychological thriller.  Read till that scene and Fielding will pull you in with it and make you read till the end.  Her sometimes too detailed descriptions of clothing, furnishings and the like which are truly a la Higgins Clark need to be just overlooked.  The overall read here is excellent and to Ms. Fielding I say write a truly great novel like SEE JANE RUN to  remind your readers you still have it.  And I guarantee new readers will come running to read it too.  But this novel I can definitely recommend.  Give it a shot and really good suspense will come your way.  It may not be SEE JANE RUN but it comes close.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAJNYH7IYFMZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553390635#wasThisHelpful","RAJNYH7IYFMZ5","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"l I love this Curel fragrance free lotion and have been using it for years now.  I don't use it on my face but it gets daily use on my hands and the rest of my body.  I have sensitive skin and arm really turned off by any fragrance.  This lotion is truly fragrance free and what is next in order of importance for me also is it doesn't get greasy at all.  It is a medium thick lotion and absorbs into the skin pretty quickly moisturizing right away.  I use it on my hands before bed year round.  In the summer months that is all I need to keep my hands soft  no matter how often I wash them or whatever else they get put thru.  In the winter months I may need to use it another time during the day due to the dryness in the air here in the northeast.  It is also in the wintertime that I use it on my body as well for having the heat on so often my body can get dry and need some help.  Curel advertises this product as providing 24 hour relief.  It certainly does that but I also find with regular daily use it thankfully makes you feel like you don't have dry skin at all.  It certainly does comfort as it states and I love how it replenishes moisture making your skin feel healthy without that greasy feeling other products may have.  Highly recommend and if you have sensitive skin this should definitely work for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFG2URPR9EG1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZ22Y4S#wasThisHelpful","RFG2URPR9EG1H","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had lasik surgery years ago which worked great but now have dry eyes and an eye condition called blepharitis.  These are the only drops my eye doctor recommended and also the only ones I found truly work with my own trial and error with different drops.  These drops are very comfortable and soothing on the eye when used and the lubricating effect is pretty instantaneous.  I use them daily in the morning and evening.  By doing this my eyes never get the grit feeling or slightly blurred vision associated with dry eye.  Other drops I tried either burned the eyes a little or just didn't continue to work over time and I needed to use them more frequently.  My local drugstore has their version of this eye drop but with certain products you need to stay with the name brand.  I stand true by the Refresh tears and highly recommend them to anyone with continuous dry eye.  And the true testament is my eye doctor always telling me he can tell I am using the drops by the moisture of my eyes.  If you've struggled trying out other brands of eye drops Refresh just may be your answer.  They are the only ones for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HB8WFGEX15SS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0041EB492#wasThisHelpful","R1HB8WFGEX15SS","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have gone through so many backpacks over the past few years and the zippers either broke or material tore and this was just with every day use.  I have been using this Fat Boy backpack for 2 months now and am thrilled with it.  It is not just ok or just of acceptable quality.  This is a great backpack.  It has so many pockets that it fulfills any need imaginable I may have.  There are 2 large pouches and a mid size pouch that has a pocket, key ring and other storage compartments.  The front has a small zippered pocket that holds quite a bit and is perfect for keys and items needed to be on the ready.  Due to the problems I had with other backpacks I eased into use with this one and that was not necessary at all.  The Fat Boy backpack is made of very strong durable duralite material and is made to withstand heavy use and still hold strong.I only have positive things to say about this backpack.  First, it is a very attractive bag.  Each zipper has two ends and are very strong and never catch on anything or show sign of wear no matter how stuffed the backpack may be.  I use it every day and it has gone from being stuffed to the brim with heavy books and other items to just dragging it around with the daily necessities.  The bag is a perfect size that is great for use with minimal storage and expands to a huge size when each storage area is fully packed.  And as I said it never shows wear.  The straps are very comfortable, the clip in front with which to add heavy gear is very helpful and most importantly for me the small handle on top is very durable as well.  That is often how I carry the bag and again, it never pulls or shows signs of wear.  Also of importance is the material of the inner sleeves and that is strong as well and will not tear.  I have also used this backpack in the rain and it has never gotten wet inside.I recommend this backpack very highly for any possible use from school to hiking or even overnight traveling.  It can be small and slim when need be and does indeed open up to be a true fat boy when filled to the brim and you will be amazed at all it will hold.  I'm thrilled I discovered this brand.  It comes with a 5 year warranty and is of the highest quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ5QTU4N5TUUZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00439GTNG#wasThisHelpful","RQ5QTU4N5TUUZ","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Often engagement calendars such as this aren't of the highest quality.  That is far from the truth with the 2015 Downton Abbey engagement calendar.  The pages are of excellent quality glossy stock paper.  Each page which has the dates has 7 days on it with the current, past and next month in small print at the bottom.  And every other page is a glorious picture of the cast and set of Downton.  These beautiful photos are definitely enhanced by the quality of the glossy paper on which they are printed.  This calendar indeed does Downton proud and will make any fan very happy.  Also each date is within a spacious rectangular square for plenty of writing.  In the back there is a page showing all the months for 2014, 2015 and 2016 plus lovely lined blank pages for notes.

"The title of Olly Mur's new cd NEVER BEEN BETTER says it all.  He has never been better!!  I am a huge Olly fan and am so glad I discovered him.  I am still waiting for him to fully take the US by storm.  He has such a strong individual identity to his music and its a style we are definitely lacking here in the US.  Songs may have a tinge of Maroon 5 at times or even Bruno Mars to Michael Buble but when it comes to it there is only one Olly Murs.  He is a true artist - a singer and performer  with a cheeky personality and amazing voice with a range that can go to the very low to high falsetto.  The first single here WRAPPED UP is a feel good disco tinged danced track that is amazing.  The opening track DID YOU MISS ME starts things off with a strong uptempo beat that had me answering ""Yes I did miss you Olly!!""  The song also sets a high order for the rest of the cd.  I have loved all of Olly's cds and don't think there is one bad track on any of them but here on NEVER BEEN BETTER he manages to raise the bar.  His style and passion is still in the forefront but this cd is in no way a rehash of other albums and other hits like DANCE WITH ME TONIGHT or TROUBLEMAKER.  BEAUTIFUL TO ME and NOTHING WITHOUT YOU are beautiful ballads and HOPE YOU GOT WHAT YOU CAME FOR, WHY DO I LOVE YOU and CAN'T SAY NO are awesome uptempo tracks.A real standout here is also UP a great duet with Demi Lovato.  The thing with Olly is on his cds each song comes to life with his true artistry and emotive ability.  This guy can really sing and his strong vibrant personality that is such a major part of his charisma also shines thru on all tracks.  And Olly is an artist that makes his music even better when performed live and if you have seen him with each superb track here you can just envision it being brought to life with his intense passion and talent  STICK WITH ME is an anthemic type song and the regular cd ends with two lovely slow almost a cappella ballads TOMORROW and LET ME IN that truly showcase Olly's vocal abilities.  The deluxe edition comes with four additional tracks including the standouts WE STILL LOVE and HISTORY.If you are an Olly fan already purchasing this will be a no brainer but if you are just finding out about Olly Murs I highly recommend this cd.  Olly is the real deal and an artist to definitely be following.  This is his fourth studio album and he just continues to grow and get even better and the future for him is timeless.  He is so huge in the UK and I really hope with this cd the US can get on board as well. I love Olly.  NEVER BEEN BETTER is my favorite song on this new cd and the title sums up the cd as a whole.  Can't recommend it enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IGJCDTX1BJSM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NMZW7TC#wasThisHelpful","R3IGJCDTX1BJSM","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With Hane's products I always know they will be comfortable and fit as they should but with these I wondered if they could honestly deliver as described.  And the answer is a definite yes.  First off, as I already stated these briefs are ultra soft and fit like perfection seamlessly not pulling or tugging in any way they should not.  To test if they truly adapt to body temperature change I wore these for many days here in the northeast going in and out of cold weather, while exercising and jogging and pretty much any activity you could think of.  And where when wearing my regular briefs I would sweat and be left damp these did indeed adapt to my body temperature changes and remain warm and protective throughout all changes.  I was so impressed I ordered some t shirts as well.  For someone who tends to be an excessive sweater these are a true gift.  Definitely recommend.

"I love that all Diana Ross's RCA albums have been gloriously remastered by Funkytowngrooves.  To some these were the wasted years.  I totally disagree.  Listening to these albums there are many standout album tracks and some that fall into the category of Ross classics.  Most artists were having a difficult time finding the right sound in the early 80s after disco had died and a new techno sound was emerging.  Diana Ross managed to do it providing some excellent music as far as I am concerned.With the 1983 RCA ROSS  Diana's vocal performances are superb and she takes a full on r&b urban soul interpretation of the songs, even those that are more pop.  From the opening THAT'S HOW YOU START OVER to LOVE WILL MAKE IT RIGHT, LET'S GO UP and even GIRLS she caresses each song with that velvety Ross voice and makes each song shine.  The standouts are the funky jammin PIECES OF ICE and my favorite the uptempo UP FRONT.  This cd is beautifully remastered and there are 8 bonus tracks that are worth the price of admission alone - 3 different mixes of PIECES OF ICE and 4 of UP FRONT.  Add into this the great ballad LOVE OR LONELINESS and in-depth liner notes and you get a Ross gem.I highly recommend this great expanded edition of the 1983 RCA ROSS not only to Diana fans. but also to all r&b/soul fans.  Diana sounds great here and this album stands up there with many of her finest.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NVO4VD0FH9GJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M5565OS#wasThisHelpful","R2NVO4VD0FH9GJ","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had to return this one.  I was very disappointed with this blanket for many reasons.  I was replacing an old high quality fleece blanket that was starting to wear where it tucked under the mattress.  I saw all the rave reviews here so quickly purchased it.  I was very surprised by how lightweight it was.  It was soft but seemed of lower grade quality and something that wouldn't last long compared to my old one.  The one I have was thicker and softer than this one.  But perhaps this is just a matter of opinion.  The chemical smell it had upon opening was not.  I had purchased a cotton blanket, new sheets along with this blanket.  I washed everything and only had a problem with this blanket.  After washing the chemical smell was just as strong and even stranger for it was now mixed with the pleasant smell of my detergent.  I ended up sticking with my old blanket which is of far superior quality and sent this one bad.  Must admit I was very disappointed.  The smell kept me from being able to try it out and test its true durability and comfort/warmth factor.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I399207V805A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFLFT44#wasThisHelpful","R3I399207V805A","A3EUSH8DPW75LR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3EUSH8DPW75LR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every year at this time I go on my search for my calendar of choice for the upcoming year.  I found many great options here on Amazon and then realized upon closer inspection that many lacked the normal info on each calendar month.  They only listed the days without listing holidays and more importantly having a small square of the previous and upcoming month.  I was so glad I realized this and then I luckily found this Guys calendar.  Often a calendar can be a disappointment when seen in person but not this one.  12 hunky guys of all varieties in seductive poses shot to definitely show them all at their best.  These are not just magazine type shots but true professional quality photos done with impeccable lighting that are truly meant to be seen in large calendar size.  The calendar is printed on high grade paper and also has a page showing October to December 2014 so the calendar can be put to use way before 2015.  This calendar was printed in the UK.  Everything is English but under each month and day each is also typed in 4 other languages.  Not sure what they are but this calendar is recommended for not only English speaking people.  If you enlarge the picture of the back of the calendar above you will see what I mean.So I've found my 2015 calendar and couldn't be happier.

"I needed to replace a very old cotton blanket that I had.  I use it alone with sheets in the spring/summer months and along with a fleece blanket in the winter.  The old one I had was very soft but also felt like a knit and stretched out very easily and quickly became threadbare.  But it was comfortable.  This Utopia cotton blanket now shows me what a quality cotton blanket should be.  It is not stretchy like my old one.  It has a weight to it that manages to still keep you cool in the warm months and add warmth in those cool winter ones.  I washed it once and it did shrink a little but this was due to my putting it on high heat in the dryer.  I got the full/queen size and it fits perfectly on my queen bed.  The plum color is very attractive.  The blanket is very soft and comfortable and very durable.  It's so nice to have a light blanket that still has some weight and where the material does not pull or stretch at its own will.  This is a quality 100% cotton blanket and puts cheaper lower quality ones to shame.

"So much is great about these sheets.  They are amazingly soft, wash very well and are the perfect thickness for warm summer nights or cool winter ones.  The title is indeed misleading.  Are they Egyptian quality?  I have no idea.  And they are said to be 1500 thread count but that info is no where to be found on the package.  Sadly most of the negative reviews here are due to this misleading info in the title.  These sheets are indeed 100% polyester and of a very high quality especially for such a price.  I love these sheets.  I added them to all new bedding material - comforter and blankets and they add an extra luxurious touch.  I have also washed them many times and the gorgeous color and softness have in no way faded.For those looking for 1500 thread count that is not what these are.  I wish these were advertised for exactly what they are.  The misleading info is in no way necessary.  They are indeed high quality sheets that can sell very well for what they actually are.  I gave a true 5 star review for the thread count etc. didn't matter to me.  I got soft, durable, attractive luxurious sheets that are very comfortable.  My needs were totally met and then some.

"It's an Xbox One. I wanted a PS4, but the PS4 is nothing like the PS3 in terms of media center hub. Our Xbox360 was like a jet engine, so that didn't help either.However, we have over 1,000 DLC songs for Rock Band (Xbox360), and they won't transfer to Sony's console, so that kind of made the decision pretty easy. We mostly use it for Netflix at the moment, if it even turns on at all (summer = rarely watch TV). It IS very quiet, so there's that, which is a huge plus for us.Games... I don't know. I got GTA5 with it, but I hate FPS-style games on consoles because I grew up with mouse + keyboard. So I bought GTA5 for PC, and have played over 100 hours so far. I bought my wife Dragon Age: Inquisition, but she's a PC gamer as well, and has been addicted to Civ5 all summer (school teacher, this is her only time to play).I'm sure there will eventually be non-FPS games (we love racing and sports and puzzle games) that will never come out for PC, so we'll eventually get our gaming in. Definitely when Rock Band 4 comes out this fall.I'm still unhappy that I have to pay for XBL just to use Netflix and other apps. I don't play online on the consoles, only PC. But I paid just so I can cry and complain about it, though my normal brain assures me that eventually I'll use enough features to justify the $32 (got it on a great sale!). Plus, I am well aware of the fact that paying for a premium service means the service is generally superior to others. I own a PS3 as well, and Xbox has always been better in terms of online services, though Sony has definitely caught up these days. So I complain, but in the end, I understand and accept. It's a first-world problem. I guess I'm lucky enough to complain about paying $32 for a luxury when $32 in other parts of the world could buy life-saving medicine.

"When I first put these on my Jackson, I was amazed at how bright they were. Then I turned on my amp (Marshall head + 1960 cabinet) and was very disappointed. The strings were TOO bright. I know, that sounds odd, but I just didn't like it. Keep in mind, I'm a ""metal"" guy, so I like my sound a lot darker, but I always love the bright-yet-evil tones new strings always bring.The Jackson is tuned normally, and I do play more than just metal, but even clean tones and non-metal distorted tones were just too dang bright. The treble nature of these strings + 2x9v EMG-81 bridge pickups kept muddling everything together in a weird, not pleasant way. I've messed with my tone controls a hundred different ways, and no matter what, it was just too bright. I initially was going to give the strings a 1- or 2- star rating, but with the explanation/context of why. They are NOT bad strings at all. Just too freakin' bright and sharp and treble-y.However, I bought these about the same time as I bought my wife an electric bass + amp. I decided to leave the strings on the Jackson as my ESP has the super bottom-end heavy strings and is set up and tuned to D, though I spend a lot of time in drop C. So I kept these Cobalts on the Jackson so she and I wouldn't have tuning issues while teaching her to play. Fast-forward about two months, and my initial dislike for the strings has changed.I'm really liking how they've held their brightness, but it has mellowed out quite a bit after 6-8 weeks of banging around on them. Again, still very bright, but yet now they no longer bleed notes into one another while annoying me to death with the sheer high-pitched treble.However, even though I'm very thorough about cleaning strings and the guitar after every use, they are starting to corrode. I play the ESP about 1.5x more than the Jackson, and the ESP's strings are at least twice as old as the Jackson w/Cobalts, yet the ESP's strings are not showing any signs of rusty-corrosion-whatever it is that happens to metal strings.If you're after a really bright tone, these are the best I've ever heard. I'm very tempted to try the super bottom-end versions on my ESP. But like everything audio, everyone's tastes / preferences will be different. There's probably seven other guitarists who are exactly like me in terms of music style and genre preferences who would throw rocks at my head for saying the Cobalts are too bright because to them, the Cobalts are too muddy or such. I'm mostly disappointed that they don't hold up to sweat/moisture as well as the non-Cobalts on my ESP.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RODRCN0F9EK6L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0078YF9V6#wasThisHelpful","RODRCN0F9EK6L","A2UTQBD31N4DMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTQBD31N4DMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Bought this and the Swiss Navy brand at the same time. While I don't really need to go into details, I can say that this stuff isn't really all that great. It is extremely slick at first, but unlike the Swiss Navy product, it gets tacky very quickly, almost like water-based lubricants. It's not really all that pleasant of a sensation, if you can imagine when such a product would be used.It's very expensive compared to the Swiss Navy stuff (which is kind of embarrassingly large spray-pump bottle, which makes me feel weird for some reason, but hey, at least it's not the 55gal drum of personal lubricant that was on sale during Prime Day disaster sale). It doesn't take a lot, for sure, but this would run out about 25x faster than the other brand (which costs less).However, this is our first time trying silicon lubricant, and I'm glad we did. It is VERY superior to water-based products (in our opinion). After 13 years, I'm not embarrassed to say that being disappointed in this particular product is okay for the fact that just trying silicon-based products in general has re-excited our already fulfilling lives.(wow, that sounds kind of pretentious!

"Bought my very first SLR (a Nikon D3300 DSLR), and needed this to get the images/movies from the camera to my desktop. The camera is only USB 2.0, and with 32GB of junk (I'm still learning how to use the camera so I take a ton of pics and movies and most are awful or blurry as I'm learning the settings) to move, I wanted it to go quickly.Transfers are just as good as my portable SSD drive. I'm sure having a top-end SD card and being a PC junkie my whole life helps in the sense that I buy/own high-end gaming and editing machines. I like to deal with the pictures and movies on the desktops as they all have RAID-0 platter or SSD drives, so speed is important to me.This unit is nice and small, which is both good and bad, as I've already lost it once in the short time I've owned it. I love that it has a cap, but wish companies would figure out how to keep the cap attached to the unit with a short leash (durable one too). Of course, that's a feature in units costing 2x or more.Overall, very satisfied. I would recommend this product to anyone. Transcend might be a bit of a no-name company, but to techies like me, they're a very familiar name and make excellent products (and like any product line, there are bound to be some lemons in there... it's tech!).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JQ4AWNTPKX4V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJRS8F8#wasThisHelpful","R3JQ4AWNTPKX4V","A2UTQBD31N4DMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTQBD31N4DMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on the top reviews, and after 3+ weeks of driving myself and my wife crazy with the hardcore researching about which camera to buy in this price class, I chose the D3300. My first experience was with a third-party seller, and I'm still extremely angry at them for hosing my order up so badly.So, I decided to spend a little more and buy from Amazon instead, knowing Amazon would make any problems go away as quickly as possible. Since I didn't get the kit from a 3rd party, I paid more and got a lot less in terms of accessories. I've had to buy the wireless remote, wired remote, filters, petal shade thing, cleaning cloths and brushes, all that stuff that I've just found out is pretty essential if you're going to spend the time to learn how much this camera can do. I'm an avid sci-fi nerd, which means I love nothing more than to stare at the night sky, and now stare at the night sky while the camera is doing a long exposure to capture the Milky Way.The case is nice and padded, and has room for the camera and both lenses, and so far, all of my accessories. It has adjustable padded velcro doohickies in it to resize the compartments to your needs. It's not stiff at all, which could be worrisome if I was rough and tumble, but since this is my first ""real"" camera in my 41 years, I tend to treat it like my ESP and Jackson guitars (like they are unstable nitroglycerin containers).The lenses are both Nikon-made, though I'm nowhere near experienced enough to know if they are as great as others have said in these reviews. So far, the camera and lenses work exactly as they should, and I've quickly learned how to actually do manual settings in some situations (as Auto mode is okay, but when you hit the right exposure/ISO/etc, the full moon through the zoomed 200mm is too awesome for words... I guess I'm weird but it's still amazing that my moon pictures that I got the settings right look just as good as the National Geographic type quality stuff I've seen my whole life... the craters and such... this came from MY CAMERA!).The D3300 doesn't have all the extra Autofocus bells and whistles that some others do, but so far, it works great. Again, I'm a nooblet, but I'm doing something right, and I'm sure that something is getting a good camera and lens that will guide me with excellent results. The flash is something I haven't used much of yet, though I am definitely going to purchase an external unit as I'm a nerd and want to learn that too.One of the things I like about the lenses, and this is probably common knowledge to SLR users, is that they have a little button on them to lock the lens ""closed"" (or ""retracted"" is probably a better term). The camera is constantly reminding me when I turn it on that I have to hold the button on the lens housing and twist to get it to lock in the ""open"" mode. Seems like it would be annoying, but I'm paranoid-careful still so this is a good thing. Plus it retracts them further than their shortest active mode, which saves an inch or more of space in the bag.Overall, I am more pleased with this camera kit than I can put into words. Again, it's my first ""real"" camera. Sort of like when I bought my first ""real"" (ie: expensive as @#%@) guitar. It's a learning experience for sure, but I joined a local camera club that meets regularly, and I'm a big internet nerd so I've been reading as much as I can then rushing outside to try it out. I like that the camera guides me into doing things without confusing me too much.The biggest issue I've run into so far is I had to search the internet to find out why the camera wouldn't take pictures in the dark. I KNOW these things are awesome at taking pictures of the night sky, but mine wouldn't... For experienced camera persons, you're probably wanting to thump me in the head because you know the answer, but for other rookies like me, the answer is: set it to manual focus.Yep, turn off AF (autofocus). If it's too dark, the camera can't focus on a subject and so refuses to open the shutter. Now, there might be another way around this, but this was the only real answer I found that solved my problem. Now I've got about 9GB of images from just about every shutter speed imaginable, and I'm about to have about 5000000GB more now that I have a wired shutter remote and can leave it open for an hour or more.Note to self: buy a nice motorized tripod with GPS so it will track the stars and not leave streaks.This kit did come with the wireless / WiFi adapter. I haven't used it yet, and to be honest, I'm not sure if I ever will. I guess I should finally stop being an old man and get an Instagram account. I have a nice LG G3 phone, but I can't really see how using my camera in WiFi mode would be helpful. It seems like just another step or six that I'd have to go through when what I really dig is popping the SD card and plugging it into the desktop via USB 3.0 card reader. Blazing fast transfers that way, much faster than WiFi or USB 2.0 phone. I'll keep it around just in case someone tells me a good use for it, but if the kit came without it, I wouldn't have cared. Which also means I am glad I saved some money and bought this model instead of the next step up (D5300?) which has built-in WiFi and GPS.Thanks to all of the great reviews of this product. They really did help me make up my mind between this and the Canon T5i (I REALLY wanted the 1080p video @ 60fps, and from everything I've read and seen, the D3300 video capabilities are superior to almost every other camera in this price range) and a few others (Pentax and Minolta were candidates too).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKDQ7TS58DVPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T8LQ8VW#wasThisHelpful","RKDQ7TS58DVPQ","A2UTQBD31N4DMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTQBD31N4DMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this because a bunch of beach bullies made fun of me for not being able to shatter beer bottles by squeezing them with my hands. My wife grew tired of my crying and complaining about how these mean men always ran me off the beach in shame.Fast forward a week. I accidentally crumpled the door handle on my car as I was getting in to drive to the beach. I left impressions in the steering wheel while I psyched myself up for the coming confrontation. I nearly ripped the interior door handle to shreds getting out of the car.When I arrived at the usual place, the bullies were there, smashing bottles of various thickness with their hands. As I approached, their taunting began immediately. I said nothing, simply grabbing a Corona bottle from the nearest one and turning it into fine silicon powder before any of them could blink.The looks of fear directed at me were priceless, but the soiling of their designer beachwear when I reached down and grabbed a handful of sand then crushed it with so much force that a diamond formed with my enclosed fingers... best feeling ever. Well, almost best. The bullies running away crying tears of shame and terror was of course much more delicious, but that sounds like bragging and as I've learned since I developed this new superhuman power... bragging only makes idiots want to challenge you.Also, yes, compressing sand does not create diamonds. Normally. This Gripmaster is a game changer, however. The laws of physics and chemistry and scientology are out the window now.

I've done a thorough check of the bass at the important areas and all is perfect. One of the knobs is mismatched and was loose (still attached to the post but needed tightened), but included in the package was an extra knob that matches the other three =/. All the normal tools that come with new guitars/basses was included.Opened the box, stretched out the strings a bit, tuned it up, and began to bang away on it. Great bass so far. I really, really like the action and the weight (my wife, on the other hand, feels like there's a 90lb block of wood hanging from her shoulder haha, but I've been playing 20 years and she's been playing for about 11 days).Never owned a Schecter instrument before, but I've always heard good things about them.

"Bought it as a ""scratch & dent"" unit for a decent amount off. Box looked like it took a detour through Kabul then Baghdad before arriving. Unit was packed in factory styrofoam and has no damage other than the slight cosmetic damage on the vinyl covering (that was shown in the product picture... SERIOUS KUDOS to whoever put that picture up, I wish more pics of the actual imperfections/damage were put up so cheap shoppers like me wouldn't have to play roulette!).Amp has plenty of power and very nice punch for a 10"". Decent tone controls. The onboard tuner really sucks and I'm not sure why as it should be about the easiest thing to get right in any situation (considering I bought a $10 clip-on digital tuner that is actually better than the one built into my Boss GT-8 board). I won't take a star off for the crummy tuner as again, this amp has a really nice sound, and gets as loud as I need it (bought it for my wife and her new bass, I'm playing guitar through a Marshall MG100HDFX head + 1960A cabinet + 2x12 custom Celestion cab).But the best about this amp is that it has an angle bottom and can sit either flat like a typical amp or a floor monitor pointed up. I wish more amps had this feature (then again, I haven't purchased a new amp in almost a decade so maybe they all do now? But I didn't see any other bass amps with this feature during my shopping travels).This isn't an expensive, pro amplifier.

Not a fan of it at all and now I regret buying this instead of the slightly more expensive one I initially wanted.Still, it makes excellent coffee and it will never shatter like the previous eight or nine glass presses we've gone through (seriously, you accidentally drop a plastic fork on the things in the sink and they shatter like cartoon glass).

"Read a ton of reviews and forum posts that praised this card as magical. It is indeed very magical for the price.Intel Quad Q6600 @ stockCorsair 8GB2x80GB RAID-0 + 5TB of storage600w Corsair psuAs you can see, the machine that received this card is a bit older, and has served as our home server for probably 5 or 6 years now. It had a Radeon 4850 512MB in it, and played Eve and some other games decently, but it had too much trouble playing Borderlands 2, Diablo 3, Elite: Dangerous, and Star Citizen. So I saw this for a great price after all the reviews (and bought a Giga Vapour R9 290 for my main rig at the same time) and bought it.Pros:Plays all the games @ 1080 on high (newest games) or ultra (some older titles). Steady 60+ FPS.Doesn't require PCI-e 6/8 pin power connector. Runs off PCI-e slot voltage.Quite a small card. Kind of hard to believe such a small pcb can provide so much oomph in games.Doesn't get hot enough to need a giant blower/fan.Cons:During some intense fights, the fan will spin up and is very noticeable, but it absolutely does NOT sound like a jet engine or how some of the higher-end gfx cards sound when they nearly catch fire.Not so great at 2140/4k. But this is a budget gaming card.If you are looking for a killer budget card that can play all the games (as of April, 2015 at least) and play them well without sacrificing too many graphics options, this is the card for you. EVGA has always made excellent video cards, and their warranty is still decent.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBTH9IJDIVODX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDG3IDO#wasThisHelpful","RBTH9IJDIVODX","A2UTQBD31N4DMD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UTQBD31N4DMD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For my Nexus 6P, I bought this ""Cruzerlite Cell Phone Case for HUAWEI Nexus 6P - Retail Packaging - Red"" to match my old Nexus 5's Nexus 5 Case, Cruzerlite Bugdroid Circuit TPU Case Compatible for Nexus 5 - Red.  They look to be nearly identical.  The case fits the phone just fine, all the openings line up correctly with their corresponding parts of the phone, the slight thickness of the case gives just enough extra material to make picking up the Nexus 6P a bit easier, and the material around the power/volume buttons makes it a lot easier to avoid accidentally hitting those buttons (which is my biggest gripe with the phone).  The one slight negative is the same as many others here have mentioned:  because the openings for the power/volume buttons are recessed into a thinner rectangle of edge material, that area of the case's edge doesn't grab the phone as firmly as the rest of the package.  I doubt there'll be a problem in normal use.  But, it's definitely noticeable with my first time exploration of the case.

So, in the shower, it ought to maintain its looks without the linseed oil.  We'll wait and see.My only issues are theoretical.  First, it was shipped in a perfectly fitting single box.  It really should have been double-boxed since any damage to that shipping box could very well have carried through and damaged the wood.  Ours was in perfect condition, so, again, it's just a theoretical issue.  The other possible concern might be with the feet.  They're hard rubber feet screwed into the wooden legs and are non-adjustable.  Adjustable ones would have been nice for shower floors more slanted than ours.  But, overall, I can't complain.

"""In the Best Families"" is the 17th book (first published in 1950) in Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe"" series.

"""Three Doors to Death"" is the 16th book in Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe"" series.  Note that it's not a novel.  It's three short stories (""Man Alive,"" ""Omit Flowers,"" and ""Door to Death"") of about 70 pages each.  The book, itself, was first published in 1950, while the short stories were first published in 1947, 1948, and 1949, respectively.  Since this is the 16th book in the series, I'll assume you know the drill:  the writing is good old Stout/Wolfe writing.  No real surprises here.  There are a couple of weak points though.  In ""Omit Flowers,"" for some reason, it seems as if the police never even bothered to talk to the victim's ex.  That doesn't seem likely.  And, in ""Door to Death,"" the police arrest, handcuff, and cart away their choice of evil-doer.  Yet, they can't even show a likely motive.  Again, that seems a bit odd.

"""The Second Confession"" is the 15th book in Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe"" series.  It was first published in 1949, and since these books mirror the prevailing issues of the day, it's interesting to note how fast the enemies changed in society.  In the previous couple of book, the common enemies were Japan/Germany (WWII).  In this book, it's the ""Commies"" (Cold War).  Anyway, that's just an interesting aside.  The writing, story, characters, humor, etc., are all excellent.  The only quibble I've got is that antagonistic actions of several pairs of characters don't really get explained.  The assumption is that the bad guy had something on them.  But, it's just left hanging.  For that, I'd drop the rating half a star.  But, of course, integers are the rule.

"""Trouble in Triplicate"" is the 14th book in Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe"" series.  It's NOT a novel.  Instead, it's a set of three short stories (""Before I Die,"" ""Help Wanted, Male,"" and ""Instead of Evidence"" -- each only about 70 pages long).  The book, itself, was first published in 1949.  But, the short stories, for some reason, are out of order amongst themselves and within the series (they were initially published in 1947, 1945, and 1946 (respectively), whereas the previous book was first published in 1948).  Unfortunately, even though Stout's technical writing is as good as it always is, the quality of the three stories varies drastically.  The first story, ""Before I Die,"" is the best of the lot and is worth 4 stars.  The story is good and the dilemma Wolfe and Archie face when stuck with a client they definitely don't want is interesting.  The second story, ""Help Wanted, Male,"" is the worst of the lot and is only worth about 2 stars (inconceivable for a Rex Stout ""Nero Wolfe"" story).  Very simply, the degree of luck, happenstance, and planning on the part of the bad guy are just beyond belief.  It's just ridiculous.  The final story, ""Instead of Evidence"" is OK (call it 3 stars).  The issue with that story is simply that the perpetrator is obvious (again, not something we usually see with these books).  So, averaging them out, I'd rate the book at an OK 3 stars out of 5.

"My only issue with Rex Stout's ""And Be a Villain"" (the 13th book in his Nero Wolfe series (first published in 1948)) is that the ending is a tad weak.  In a lot of these books, Nero Wolfe pulls the answer out of his posterior-dorsal.  When he does that, usually we see how he got there and agree with it.  In this book, his ""answer"" is really weak.  But, other than that, the book is excellent with Stout's excellent writing, a twisty plot, and crazy characters.

This one's particularly lively since Archie is basically rolling in clover throughout it.  The usual excellence in writing.  The one thing that bothers me a bit is Stout's continuing caricaturization of Inspector Cramer.  In the earlier works, Cramer was very competent and occasionally got a bit miffed with Wolfe.  In this one, Cramer's still competent, but he's in permanent volcano mode every time he meets our protagonists.  That's particularly irritating since Wolfe saved his bacon in the previous book.

Both of these stories were first published at the height of World War 2 (1944), and that leads to a problem.  The first novella (""Not Quite Dead Enough"") is fine.  Since it's so short, it's a bit abrupt.  But, it's a decent Nero Wolfe mystery.  The second novella, though (""Booby Trap"") just suffers from too much wartime propaganda.  I can certainly understand why it does that (the ""Nero Wolfe"" series works within the society present at the time of their writing, and the war was certainly at the top of everything at the time), but it just doesn't feel right for Nero Wolfe.  The writing is still good, so the book is something any ""Nero Wolfe"" fan will want to read.  It just might not be something they'd go out of their way to read twice.

"The most important thing to know about Peter Clines' ""The Fold"" is that it's not really science fiction.  It's really a horror story camouflaged as science fiction.  The problem is that I didn't really figure it out until about half way through the book.  Up to that point, it reads like science fiction with some really stupid people in it (stupid because they don't figure out what's really happening until after that half-way point, even though it's blatantly obvious immediately after they describe what they think is happening at the beginning).  Other than that, the book reads fine until that point.  Then it starts collapsing.  First, the ""science"" isn't internally consistent (most obviously is the first really bad thing that happens wouldn't appear out of nowhere -- they would see it coming).  Second, as the science fiction aspect fades away and is replaced by horror, the characters start doing things half-posterior-dorsaled.  And finally, as the story reaches its climax near the end, Clines' writing gets more and more descriptive.  So, what should be a series of actions scenes get drawn out in a frustrating manner.  A lot of my complaints here are really my fault, though.  I should have recognized Clines name from The Eerie Adventures of the Lycanthrope Robinson Crusoe and realized what the book was before I started.

"""Too Many Cooks"" is the 5th book in Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe"" series.  Once again, Stout shows his excellence as a purveyor of plots and in his use of the language.

Now, I'm not one of those people who wail and moan when they read 80 year old books and find that people then didn't share in today's politically correct attitudes.  So, I'm not complaining of the existence of some of the racial stuff in the book (actually, I found Stout's attitude (assuming Nero Wolfe is his avatar in these books) to be amazingly modern).

"We bought two of these ""Kindle Voyage, 6"" High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Adaptive Built-in Light, PagePress Sensors, Wi-Fi"" devices at another retailer (whose initials are BB) simply to ease the return process in case we got units with bad screens (it looks like somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of these reviewers are having that issue).  I'm happy to report that both of our Voyages have fine displays.  We're upgrading from our old Kindle Paperwhites, though, so even though there are a lot of improvements, they're not earth-shattering.  Basically, the display is a bit better, but not a lot.  The interface is a bit faster, but not a lot.  The hardware's a bit smaller and lighter, but not a lot.  The PagePress buttons are nice, but not a lot (even though I've got the level of effort turned all the way down on that, I still find it harder to turn pages that way than just tapping on the screen).  I'd say there are only two things which are significantly different between the Voyage and the Paperwhite (and they're both minor).  On the plus side, the change in location of the power button from the bottom of the device to the back-right of the device is really nice:  it's a lot more convenient and easy to use than before.  On the negative side, the length of the provided USB charging/data cable and the lack of an AC Adapter (actually, that last might be a change from several versions back) is disappointing.  My old cable is about 6 feet long.  The new one is about 5 feet long.  That loss of a foot means the new cable is too short for where I use it.  For the price of the Voyage, Amazon should have included a rapid charging system with a longer cable.So, overall, even though we're pleased with these Voyages (I'm rating them at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5), I'm not sure everyone would consider the improvements to be worth the extra price.  If you're coming from several generations of Kindle back (or don't have one at all), go ahead and get this.  But, if you're just one generation of Kindle back, it's more of a personal preference.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R183H8K8III9EN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IOY8XWQ#wasThisHelpful","R183H8K8III9EN","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Fer-de-Lance"" is the 1st of Rex Stout's ""Nero Wolfe Mysteries.""  The book was published in 1934 and the style of the writing is very much in line with other mysteries that I've read from the period.  With the caveat that the world and writing were very different then from what they are now, the book is very well done with excellent technical writing, really interesting characters, and a good plot.  An interesting twist is added to the progress of the mystery due to Nero Wolfe's ""genius.""  So, you think you know how things are going to play out, but get surprised by Wolfe balancing the artistry of the situation.  Not only is this a Very Good book (I'm rating it at 4 stars out of 5), but it's also a very good start to the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ISVJS5P6LKJ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V4BPG0#wasThisHelpful","R1ISVJS5P6LKJ5","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a bit disappointed with Anthony Ryan's ""Queen of Fire.""  I was very pleased with both the first and second books in the trilogy.  But, even though this book has a similar structure to the second book and ties up the trilogy nicely, it, at best, is only so-so.  As far as I can determine, the problem is that the book has too many main characters and their activities all center on battle. Now, the first book revolved around Vaelin.  That was good.  The second book rotated through four main characters:  Vaelin, Frentis, Reva, and Lyrna (each with his or her own entourage).  That's a bit much.  But, for the most part each main character was doing very different things, so their storylines were both interesting and separable.  This book also rotates through those four main characters.  But, except for Vaelin (mostly and oddly), almost everything involves the battles needed to finish the war.  Essentially, the book goes from battle to battle to battle with oodles of horrific stuff thrown in for leavening.  By the time the end rolls around, we're just numb with it.  Also associated with the rotation through four main characters is the trouble with keeping all their associates straight.  According to the Dramatis Personae, there are 83 notable characters in the book.  Again, by the time the end drew near, I had basically given up trying to keep everyone straight.That overabundance of characters and battle might be the crux of my problems with this book. But, there are other, smaller issues that are bothersome as well.  First, except for one case, every tribe of ""savages"" that anyone meets is a tribe of ""noble savages.""  Once, OK.  Twice, maybe.  But, after that, no.  Secondly, and somewhat related to the ""noble savage"" issue is the ""John Carter of Mars"" syndrome:  almost every person in the book seems to be some kind of latent warrior hero.  Find some orphan, rescue a damsel, free a slave, or whatever.  Give them a sword and a bit of training, and they're killing supermen who've been bred and raised their whole lives fighting.  Again, once is OK.  Twice, maybe.  But, after that, no.  And, finally, there's the logistics of the war.  The biggest issue I have in that area is the production of the fleet the Realm needs.  I don't care how wonderful their spontaneously generated, out of the blue, da Vinci is, they're not going to build that amount of capital ships inside of six months when all their processed materials are gone, their timber burned, and their manpower wiped out.  It just can't be done.So, overall, I'm not impressed with this final book in the trilogy and am rating it at a merely OK 3 stars out of 5.  The more worrisome thing, though, is that I have the feeling at the back of my mind that I'm rating the book higher than it really should be simply because I liked the first two books in the series and really want to like this one.  But, I suppose that if you've already read those first two book, you'll want to read this one regardless.The books in Anthony Ryan's ""Raven's Shadow"" series are:1.

"Twice in Carol Berg's ""Restoration,"" I became so frustrated and depressed over how the story was ""progressing"" that I put it down thinking not to continue.  But, because I wanted to see how she was going to resolve things, I forced myself through.  Similarly to how the second book goes on and on about nasty stuff and never seems to get anywhere, this book goes on and on about frustrating stuff and never seems to get anywhere.  Yes.  Carol Berg can write.  I've got no doubt of her ability to craft world, story, and characters.  But, she just seems to drive a point home until the legs rot off the horse.  In this book, as the bad things pile up and up, it takes over 40% of the book until the main characters manage to stumble into the obvious (and only) solution to their problem.  Meanwhile, we're treated to their frustrations and loss for the whole time (heck, they can't even have a meal, go to the bathroom, or take a bath without disaster befalling them).  Then, for a bit, things look better.  Until we get to watch the protagonist led by his nasal protuberance down the rue du primrose while we scream about brain damage and missing the obvious.  Of course, by the end, she does manage to tie things up nicely.  But, that only allows me to bring my rating up to an OK 3 stars out of 5.  Overall, I'm a bit disappointed in the series.  I was very pleased with the first book.  But, the pain involved in wading through the last two books was just too much.The novels in Carol Berg's Rai-Kirah series are:1.

"Carol Berg's philosophy in this book seems to be:  ""into every life, ... the other shoe will drop, and you might as well become a shoe salesman.""  The first book (""Transformation"") in Carol Berg's ""Rai-Kirah"" series focuses on the protagonist's physical enslavement and how he has to work through it to fix much bigger problems.  This book (""Revelation"") focuses on his character-driven self-enslavement and how he has to work through that to fix even bigger problems (the first and last thirds of the book are centered on this).  For icing, Berg has the protagonist drop himself into a world of physical hurt (because, yes, it has to be done) for the middle third of the book.  So, the book is highly depressing.  Still, this could have been fine.  Except that Berg goes on and on with these terrible things.  Of course, the protagonist struggles time and time again to take steps to correct these bad things.  But, inevitably (and we know it's inevitable as we see it building up), bad things come of it.  I'm hoping the third book won't be as nasty, since Berg's writing is so good and the story so interesting.  But, I have to rate this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.The novels in Carol Berg's Rai-Kirah series are:1.  Transformation (Rai Kirah Book 1)2.  Revelation (Rai Kirah Book 2)3.

"I bought this ""AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A Male to Micro B - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters)"" as a longer (and hopefully better) replacement for the dinky cable that came with my Samsung T1 Portable 500GB USB 3.0 External SSD (MU-PS500B/AM).  It works perfectly fine.  Running some CrystalDiskMark speed tests on that drive using each of the cables gives, essentially, the same results.  The recurring negative comments I've seen here about this AmazonBasics cable is that the Micro B connector is smaller than normal and the cable is awkward to manage because of its thickness.  In my case, both connectors are exactly the same as the one that came with that drive.  Yes, the cable is thicker than other cables.  But, with the six foot length I got, I'm not having any handling issues.

"EDIT 4:  I assume this will be my final edit.  As a follow-on to what I reported in the Edit's below, I just got a refurbished version back from them today. Same problem:  the drive might or might not connect.  I can't come up with any way to pinpoint the problem. It happens with multiple computers, multiple cables, multiple operating systems, multiple USB ports, and now, multiple drives. At this point, I guess I'm just going to consider it a total loss and accept that I threw over $200 down the toilet.  If you do buy one of these and it starts to give you issues connecting, don't wait and see if it gets better.  Return it if you can.EDIT 3:  Over the last three months, the intermittent connection problem I noted, below, has extended itself from the initial drive setup, past a 50% successful connection rate in regular use, and into a definite connection struggle.  This morning, in Linux, Windows 10, and Windows 8.1, I ended up trying multiple USB ports and finally rebooting the machine with the drive connected to get it to connect.  Initially, I thought this was a problem with the Windows drivers.  But, since it's also happening on Linux, happens with different USB ports, different machines, and different cables, and is getting worse, I'm now saying the drive is bad.  So, I'll try contacting Samsung (1-800-SAMSUNG) and see what they'll say.  Also, I'm dropping my rating from my initial 4 stars all the way down to 1 star.EDIT 2:  No.  The connection problem, at least in my case, doesn't appear to be a problem with the cable.  I got my AmazonBasics USB 3.0 Cable - A Male to Micro B - 6 Feet (1.8 Meters) and tried to connect from various ports.  Same problem:  sometimes it connected and sometimes it didn't.  CrystalMark gives about the same speed results.EDIT 1:  I've seen several reviews running back to January 2015 about the possibility that the cable (which is ridiculously too short) is the cause of these connection problems.  I'm going to see if a replacement cable will work and do a little talkin' to Amazon and Samsung about this.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I'm very happy with the speed of this ""Samsung T1 Portable 500GB USB 3.0 External SSD (MU-PS500B/AM).""  My primary use for it is for backup files across multiple machines.  For my first test, I had Windows 10 Build 10130 store a System Image to this drive.  With my old WD40EZRX drive in an external enclosure attached to the same USB 3.0 port, that usually took about 25 minutes.  With this T1, it took four (4) minutes.  I sure can't complain about that.  I also ran CrystalDiskMark 4.0.3 x64 on it and got the following:Seq Q32T1:  Read = 435.0 MB/s, Write = 418.4 MB/s4K Q32T1:  Read = 146.8 MB/s, Write = 136.7 MB/sSeq:  Read = 406.4 MB/s, Write = 389.1 MB/s4K:  Read = 24.24 MB/s, Write = 40.90 MB/sVery roughly speaking those non-4K results are about 80% of each of my internal (SATA 3) SSDs, while the 4K Q32T1 test is about 40% of them, the 4K Read is about 70% of them, and the 4K Write is about 30%.  I really have no idea about those benchmarks (I've included them in case someone's interested).  But, I assume the difference in speed is due to the differences between the SATA 3 and USB 3.0 interfaces.Alright.  I'm happy with the performance.  But, I've got issues with the arrogance of Samsung regarding how they've packaged this drive.  When you first plug it in, it runs some software that lets you name the drive and decide about encryption.  There's no way around that.  If your machine can't run that utility, your drive doesn't work.  Once that utility runs, it's not needed any more.  Yet, it sits there staring at you from the System Tray.  There's no obvious way to turn it off and there's no entry for it in Programs & Features, so you can't uninstall it.  Even more fun, it turns out that Samsung's utility sticks this software under the hidden ""ProgramData"" folder.  So, to get rid of it, you first have to bring up your Task Scheduler, find Samsung_PSSD_Registration there, End it, Disable it, and Delete it (that's what I did, anyway).  Then you can delete (or move to an archive somewhere) the ""Samsung Apps"" folder under ""ProgramData.""  This is just plain arrogant.  The drive should just work as soon as it's plugged into any USB 3.0 port on any computer of any flavor.  If Samsung wants to have a utility to rename and encrypt the drive, then they should just give us a normal download on their site.And, finally, I've got my ""iffy"" section.  It took me 5 tries across two machines to get that utility to run.  On my Windows 10 Build 10130 machine, plugging the drive into a front USB 3.0 port resulted in nothing.  Zip, zero, nada, etc..  The OS didn't even recognize that anything had been plugged in.  On a Windows 8.1 machine, I got the same result.  Eeek.  Next, I tried plugging it into a rear USB 3.0 port.  On the Windows 10 machine, I got a beep that indicated the OS had recognized something had happened.  But, nothing else.  On the Window 8.1 machine, I got the same beep and an OS notification that the device was being installed, but nothing else.  Back on the Windows 10 machine, I again tried that USB 3.0 rear port and, finally, the OS recognized it and the Samsung installation utility ran.  So, I'm a bit worried about the drive.  It seems to be running fine and everything tests out OK.  But, I'm just wondering about why it took all those tries to get things working.Also, my Windows 10 machine will not ""Safely Remove the Hardware....""  I've run SysInternal's Process Explorer and looked for anything accessing the drive.  But, there's nothing.  This could very well be a Windows 10 issue, though.Without the mandatory, hidden Samsung utility and without my initial connection problems, I'd have given this a full 5 stars.  But, because of them, I'm knocking a star off and rating it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33V8Y2DYMA74V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RWXVMRS#wasThisHelpful","R33V8Y2DYMA74V","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm pretty darn depressed about this Nvidia Shield 16GB (Android TV).  Upon it's release a week or so ago, I drooled over the hardware specs and jumped up and down about the possibility of replacing my Roku 3 Streaming Media Player (2014 model) and Xbox 360.  Plus, the ability to cast and mirror from my Nexus 5 phone and link to the stuff in my Google account was just gravy.  Alas, it was not to be.  I'm assuming the problem is that I jumped on this too early.  NVIDIA is still trying to work out the bugs, kinks, and lacks.  So, here's a list of my current issues with it:- No Amazon Apps:  That's right.  As of this writing, there are no Amazon apps officially available for this.  Yes.  You can sideload a few of them.  But, they either just don't work, or work miserably (lack of controller support).  This is an absolute killer for me.  My primary reason for buying this Shield was to replace my Roku 3.  Yes.  I can use the Google Play Movies & TV app to watch the few movies I've bought through the Google Play Store.  But, the vast majority of my media is right here on Amazon.  Without an Amazon Instant Video app (and it can't even be sideloaded), the Shield has lost most of it glamour.- USB Keyboards and Mice Don't Work:  There's a thread on this over in the NVIDIA Shield forums.  I don't know if the Shield has a problem with ALL USB keyboards and mice.  But, my Logitech Mk560 Wireless Wave Combo Plus: K351 Keyboard & M705 Wireless Mouse is one of the ones that just doesn't work.  The connection to the devices seems to drop whenever they're idle for about two seconds.  So, typing and pointing with these is just impossible.  Without a keyboard and mouse, you're stuck with using the controller for text/pointing input.  And that's a pain.- No Multiple Users:  The Shield just doesn't support multiple users.  If a second person wants to sign in to the device for a personalized experience, he's SOL.  Yes, a second person can sign in.  But, to do that, the previous person must be logged out.  And, not JUST logged out.  Their account must be REMOVED.  That means that when they want to sign back in, they can't just choose a remembered account.  They have to laboriously go through the whole log in procedure again.  And, they have to use the controller for text input because, as noted above, the keyboard and mouse don't work.  Plus, the Settings/Apps/Recommendations/NVIDIA Gaming ID all stay the same across the accounts.  The only thing that logging in seems to do is specify the Google account to use to buy things.- External Storage Isn't All That Useful:  Unless a game has been written to support external offload, you won't be able to move your games to an external device you've added for storage (USB connected drive or Micro SD card).  Yes, you can store data files, music, and photos on an external drive.  But, games are going to take up a lot of space.  As such, the 16GB version I bought isn't all that useful.  I read one review where the reviewers downloaded four games and filled up their storage.  Theoretically, that should change with Android M.  But, right now, if you're a gamer, it's not a good situation.- I'm Just Old:  This relates to that 10 foot, living room, controller-based interface.  It just makes my brain itch.  The interface design standards seem to be such that nothing tells anyone anything.  In general, if you've got a row of icons sitting on the screen, making them active and waiting doesn't get you any information.  I can't tell you how many times I've looked at those icons throughout the games and system and wondered what in the heck they do.  If I select it (using the never explained buttons on the controller), will it erase the game, format the drive, blow up the television, crash the car, and level the house?  Or, will it mark something as a favorite?  I don't know.  I'm of an age where I wonder about older people who can't understand that they can just click on the Start Button to do something.  Now, I've realized that my son is of an age where he's got to wonder about me when I can't understand what the buttons and icons on these controller-based interfaces do.  It's sad.Anyway, I'm a bit upset with this NVIDIA Shield.  With it's tremendous hardware specs, it promised so much.  But, it just hasn't delivered yet.  So, I'm sorry to say that I'm rating it at a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5.  I'll see if Amazon will let me return it.  Maybe I'll end up selling it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2757CG4S5AZES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U33Q940#wasThisHelpful","R2757CG4S5AZES","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this NVIDIA Shield Remote to go along with my NVIDIA SHIELD (Android TV).  It's nice looking, small, and works well with the Shield.  But, now that I've used it for a bit, I realize there's really no purpose to having it.  Whatever it can do, the controller that comes with the Shield can do just as well.  The only benefit to having this is that it's a boat-load smaller than the controller, so (assuming you've got the controller somewhere else) it takes up far less table room.  If, for some reason, you need an extra remote (and the app you can add to your phone isn't good enough), then go ahead and buy this.  Otherwise, don't bother.

"I'm very impressed with Carol Berg's ""Transformation.""  Her writing is excellent and her world, characters, and plot are all very well done and interesting.  From the very first words, I was captivated.  The only issues I have with it are 1) we can see some of the situations that the protagonist gets into from quite a way off, and 2) the ""density"" of the activities in the second half of the book is different from that of the first half (i.e., the activities in the first half take up most of the timeline, but there are more gaps where time passes in the second half).  Neither of these things is drastic, but they were enough for me to just barely knock my rating down a notch.  So, I'm rating this book at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.The novels in Carol Berg's Rai-Kirah series are:1.  Transformation (Rai Kirah Book 1)2.  Revelation (Rai Kirah Book 2)3.

"I'll get the elephant in the room out of the way right up front.  If you're intending to use this monitor for graphics work, don't.  It uses a TN panel, so the colors and color shifts preclude any accurate color work, If you're planning on using it for gaming, you might think twice about it.  Only by using the DisplayPort 1.2a connection and a fairly powerful graphics card (and I'd guess that the equivalent of a GTX 970 would be the bare minimum) can you even get 60 fps in a game at full resolution.  Because of the huge number of pixels you'll be pushing, your actual frame rates will probably be lower than you'd like.With that elephant gone, I will say that ViewSonic is up-front on their own web site about the target audience for this monitor.  The main product page there says it's designed for ""Scientific/Rendering, Finance/Modeling, Surveillance/Mapping.""  If you go to their Downloads tab and look at the Datasheet, it says it's designed for ""Business, Finance, Surveillance.""  So, jumping the gun to put my overall rating up front (since this review is so long), WITH THAT AUDIENCE IN MIND, I'm rating this ""ViewSonic VG2860MHL-4K 28-Inch 4K Ultra HD LED Monitor"" at an OK 3 stars out of 5.Now for some supporting information.  First, the relevant specs/components:- According to the factory service menu, the LCD panel it uses is an M280DGJ-L30 C2 TN panel made by Innolux.  The normal issues around TN panels are color shifting at angles and lack of colors.  ViewSonic has gone above the normal behavior by using 10-bit color (true 8-bits + 2-bits FRC) as compared to the usual use of 6- or 8-bit color for TNs.  Theoretically, that makes this monitor good with color (more on that later).  The color shifts when looking at the monitor at an angle are present, but they're not as bad as I had expected.  Still, they exist.- Even though both Amazon's and ViewSonic's product pages frequently mention ""Future-proof"" in reference to connectivity, the monitor uses DisplayPort 1.2a instead of 1.3 and HDMI 1.4 instead of 2.0.  Use of DisplayPort 1.2a is not really an issue since that will still allow 60 Hz at the monitor's native resolution (3840 x 2160).  HDMI 1.4 is a different matter.  Where HDMI 2.0 would allow 60 fps at native resolution, HDMI 1.4 allows a maximum of 30 Hz.  So, not only is this monitor not ""future-proof,"" it's actually somewhat obsolete (not many monitors use HDMI 2.0 yet).- The two speakers are on the BACK of the monitor.  I checked them out and they're loud enough.  But, pretty much as expected, they sound about like transistor radio speakers (or, more currently, cell phone speakers).  I'd highly recommend you use something else for sound (like Audioengine A2+ Premium Powered Desktop Speakers - Pair (Black)).  However, the headphone jack produces GREAT sound (depending on your headphones, of course).- This is a 16:9 monitor instead of 16:10.  Granted, most monitors these days use 16:9.  But, my old HP ZR2440w 24-inch, 1920 x 1200, 16:10, LED Backlit, IPS Monitor has only about an inch less vertical space than this monitor (though horizontally, there's a big difference).- As near as I can find, my old HP monitor has it's pixels packed at about 100 dpi.  This Viewsonic monitor's pixels are packed at about 160 dpi.  Yet, looking at the two screens next to each other, I can't really tell the difference in the fineness of the display.  I was VERY surprised by this.Packaging/Set up/Web Site:- The monitor came nicely double-boxed and packaged.  Putting it together was easy:  lie the monitor face down with the bottom facing you, rotate the mounting arm so it faces the bottom of the monitor, hook the base on and tighten it with the finger screw.  Plug in the obvious power cord, the non-obvious data cable, turn it on, insert the CD and check it for the User Guide, Registration, and VSFiles (drivers and color profile stuff - note that the ""software"" directory they mention isn't on the CD -- the files are in the VSFiles directory and you'll have to point your monitor's properties at that directory to update to those files).  The biggest problem with this is that the bags of cables are not labeled with what they are.  You have to know enough to figure out what cable is what and eyeball them to figure out which one to use.  The next biggest quibble is with the information tag hanging from the tab that locks the monitor to keep it from raising/lowering.  It's nothing but a mess of pictures, so you get to exercise your creativity trying to figure out what it's really saying.  Similarly, the Quick Start piece of paper is a set of four fairly worthless pictures that mean exactly what I wrote earlier in this paragraph.- There's no hard copy of the User Guide included with the packaging and it's not available for downloading from the ViewSonic web site.  So, if you don't have an existing monitor, you won't be able to read the User Guide until after you've got the monitor set up.  Similarly, if you don't have an optical drive (I don't on this computer), you won't be able to access it at all (the drivers, though, ARE available on the ViewSonic web site).- With just the default Windows drivers, the Nvidia Control Panel said ""this display does not support HDCP (High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection).""  But, after installing the included drivers and rebooting, that changed to say it DID support HDCP.  So, make sure you install the drivers (though the colors looked no different between the default Windows color profile and the one included with the monitor).- I see absolutely no physical problems with the monitor:  no scratches, no dead pixels, no stuck pixels.  Perfect.- The monitor controls for the OSD are located UNDERNEATH the bottom edge of the screen (i.e., they can't be seen).  Plus, they're tiny little nubs of buttons.  Their labels are not colored.  They're just embossed into the bottom front plastic (i.e., they're hard to see - while I was trying to manually calibrate the monitor, I actually had to sit there with a flashlight pointing at the bezel).Testing:- Relevant to the testing of this monitor, the significant parts of my system are 1) an ASUS STRIX-GTX970-DC20C-4GD5 Graphics Cards STRIX-GTX970-DC20C-4GD5 which has one DisplayPort 1.2 and one HDMI 2.0 port, and 2) that earlier-mentioned HP ZR2440w 24-inch, 1920 x 1200, 16:10, LED Backlit, IPS Monitor.  To get a full 60 Hz on this monitor, I connected it to my video card via the included DisplayPort cable.  I left my HP monitor connected via its HDMI cable.  I'm running Windows 10 Technical Preview Build 10122 (x64).- Windows found the monitor without problems and I set it up for the full native resolution of 3840 x 2160 at 60 Hz.- To test the colors, I went to lagom.nl.  Firstly, on that web site's Display Settings screen, it says the resolution is 2560 x 1440 even though it's set to native 3840 x 2160.  I'm assuming that's an artifact of how the monitor handles the high resolution through the DisplayPort.  Outside of a yellowish  tinge, the display is pretty good for its audience.  Even the color shifting at angles isn't that noticeable.  The gamma is too low (1.4 or 1.5 instead of 2.2).  And, under lagom's Contrast mode, I lost a bottom bar or two of blue color.- I tried calibrating the colors through Windows' Calibration routine.  But, I couldn't fix the gamma.  My best manual color adjustment was from the monitor's OSD:  in Color Adjust, I switched from Native to a User Color of 80/80/100 (R/G/B) (none of the pre-made options under the OSD were any better).  But, in general, even adjusted like that, the colors were sort of washed out.  So, I went back to the yellowish defaults (less washed out).  The color difference is pretty obvious when two displays are next to each other and I move things across them.  But, with only the one display on, you get used to it and don't really notice it any more.- I played some games (Overlord and Borderlands 2).  Because the colors are generally a bit washed out and yellowish, they were similarly washed out and yellowish in the games too.  To limit my frame rate to 60 fps, I keep my display driver on Adaptive.  Surprisingly, even at native resolution, the game frame rates didn't suffer unduly (maybe down in the 40s -- but then, a GTX 970 is no slouch).  The fans on my video card ramped up pretty quickly though. In general, I was pleasantly surprised by gaming with this monitor.  I expected far worse.  But, if you've got a really good graphics card, you could consider it.- I watched some HD videos and had no issues.  With the general color issues in mind, they were fine.- For office applications, I fired up all my applications and apps.  Again, the colors are a bit yellow and washed out.  But, except for one application (SpiderOak), everything scaled just fine (Windows defaults to 150% scaling) and was readable at this high resolution.  The large increase in the horizontal is nice since you can slap documents side-by-side quite nicely.  But, the lack of vertical increase in space over my old monitor means that there doesn't really feel like there's all that much added real estate.Personal Opinion:  My old HP ZR2440w 24-inch, 1920 x 1200, 16:10, LED Backlit, IPS Monitor is not being made any more.  But, its current ""new"" price on Amazon is about $499 ($399 when I bought it 3 years ago).  This VG2860MHL-4k monitor is currently selling at around $649.  Personally, I don't think the price difference is worth it.  I'm happier with the crispness and colors of my 24-inch IPS display than I am with those on this 28-inch TN display.  To me, vertical space is more important at this point than horizontal space.  And that 16:10 ratio on the smaller monitor gives me almost as much space as the 16:9 ratio on the larger.  If you're a graphics professional, I'd say you absolutely need an IPS monitor (if you're a ViewSonic fan, maybe their ViewSonic VP2780-4K  27-Inch 4K Ultra HD LED Monitor (3840x2160, 60Hz, 5ms, 20M:1 DCR, HDMI 2.0, Dual MHL, DisplayPort, MultiPicture, Pre-Calibrated) would fit the bill (I've never seen it, but it looks like it might work)).  If you're a gamer, you're probably better off ""future-proofing"" yourself by trying a monitor with DisplayPort 1.3 and HDMI 2.0 connections (maybe multiples of those at 4K resolutions just to make sure you can pump the pixels through fast enough).  But, in general, I'd say just about everyone would be better off finding a good 24-inch, 16:10, 1920 x 1200, DisplayPort 1.3, HDMI 2.0, IPS monitor for, probably, a lot less money.  If you really need the space, pop that up to a 27-inch, 16:10, 2560 x 1600, DisplayPort 1.3, HDMI 2.0, IPS monitor.  Overall, this monitor is adequate for its target audience and budget.  But, I just can't see spending the extra money for not much gain (if any).Notes:- To get to the factory service menu, first turn off the monitor.  Then hold Button 1 (the one you normally use to bring up the OSD) and press (shortly) the Power On button.  Keep holding Button 1 until anything happens on the monitor to indicate it's on.  Then release Button 1 and press it as if to call up OSD.  Go down to the ""F"" at the bottom of the OSD and select it with Button 2.- The monitor comes with an MHL cable.  According to Wikipedia, MHL (Mobile High-Definition Link) ""is an industry standard for a mobile audio/video interface that allows consumers to connect mobile phones, tablets, and other portable consumer electronics (CE) devices to high-definition televisions (HDTVs) and audio receivers.""  Unfortunately, all we have around here are Nexus 5 cell phones which don't support MHL.  So, I wasn't able to test that.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVSYM0ZVITIF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SHZSWC8#wasThisHelpful","RVSYM0ZVITIF","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dave Barry's ""Dave Barry Turns Fifty"" isn't quite what I expected it to be.  I expected more of Dave's observations on growing old.  That stuff is in there.  But, most of the book focuses on what happened during the years from Dave's birth to his adulthood.  I enjoyed that material because it reminded me of all the similar things way back in my youth (and, it's funny, too).

"In ""Sky Coyote,"" Kage Baker seems intent on missing the boat with her own series.  First of all, in almost all technical aspects, this book is worse than the first book in the series.  Where that book had well-done and well-researched writing, with varied and decently filled-out characters, this book rambles about unimportant trivia, buries any historical research under horse-feathers, and has only one character with any semblance of depth.  The one thing in this book that is done better than in the first is a sense of purpose.  Unfortunately, it's really the wrong purpose.  OK.  Some details:First, besides the mere existence of the two cultures in the area where this story takes place, Baker has destroyed almost everything that might lead towards a feeling of historical accuracy.  She's replaced almost every aspect of the tribe that is the protagonist's mission with allegorical representations of the worst of our own culture.  She's replaced the historical story of the first book with allegorical preaching in this book.  I mean, really, she's putting talk of management/labor relations, child care, divorce, alimony, business, etc., into the mouths of Stone-Age, pre-literate, pre-anything people.  It's just silly.Second, in this book, we've got the return of the two main characters of the first book.  Joseph is the protagonist and is reasonably filled out.  Mendoza comes along for the ride and, like every other character, is a nullity.  There's no character there even though a few more interesting and tantalizing tidbits of her past are revealed.And, finally, the story Baker goes on and on about (the mission that Joseph is on) ought to have been merely a side-quest.  What's really interesting (and should be the core of the series) is the relationship between these immortal cyborgs and their future creators (or masters, i.e., the Company).  About 10% of the book involves that relationship.  And, it's fascinating:  what is truly happening between immortals who are better, faster, stronger, smarter, wiser, etc. and the people/culture/company that created them.  Especially when it looks like those creators might be on their way to Eloi-hood.So, unfortunately, I'm rating this book at a Pretty Bad 2 stars out of 5.  Even worse, I'm not even sure I'll continue with the series.  I'd love to find out what's really going on with Mendoza and what's going to happen between these immortals and the Dr. Zeus Company.  But, if that's going to be buried under another nine books of cruft like this book, then I don't think I'll want to wade through it.The novels in Kage Baker's ""Company"" series are:1.  In the Garden of Iden (The Company)2.  Sky Coyote (The Company)3.  Mendoza in Hollywood (The Company)4.  The Graveyard Game (The Company)5.  The Life of the World to Come (The Company)6.

"Kage Baker's ""In the Garden of Iden"" is a bit of a let-down.  Supposedly, it's an historical-based science fiction story.  But, really, the science fiction aspect seems to be merely a wrapper around nothing but an Historical Romance novel.  I suppose it could also be called a ""coming of age"" book (though you'd have to twist the term to apply to the protagonist) or a plain old ""slice of life"" story.  It's a shame.  The concept behind the book is interesting, the writing is well-done and well-researched, and the characters are varied and decently filled-out.  But, except for the first few chapters, nothing of any importance happens.  Instead, we're treated to the chronicling of a 19 year old girl's first love.  Now, this is Kage Baker's first novel (and the first of her Company series).  So, I'm going to hope for better in later works.  But, for this one, I'm going to rate it at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5.The novels in Kage Baker's ""Company"" series are:1.  In the Garden of Iden (The Company)2.  Sky Coyote (The Company)3.

"Like many (if not most) of Tim Powers' works, his 1979 novel ""The Drawing of the Dark"" (his third novel) is historically based with a supernatural twist.  This one's a little different from his other works since the focus is more on an historical event (the siege of Vienna in 1529) than on an historical person (though the main characters are out of the Arthur/Merlin/Fisher King legends).  Also like his other works, it takes quite a while to figure out what's going on.  In this case, we can't start seeing what's going on until we're almost a third of the way through the book.  For the most part, the writing is just fine until about the 80% point.  Then, it seems to weaken (it doesn't get bad, it's just that a few things happen that seem out of character or more removed from us than they should be).  This trend continues right through to the end:  the final scene just doesn't have any personal oomph to it.  It feels like the main characters have been taken over by their roles and are just going through the motions to tie things up.  Once they've done that, everyone's given their walking papers, and they head on home.  Because of that weakness at the end, I'd like to reduce my rating by half a star to 3-1/2 stars.  But, since I'm restricted to integers, I'll be generous and leave it at a Pretty Good 4 stars out of 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RYOUSXKXX85/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QZA3CA#wasThisHelpful","R33RYOUSXKXX85","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Instead of ending it right there, the bad boss has him taken back to a lair so he can gloat and prepare the shark-mounted lasers (well, not really).

"If anyone needs proof that our civilization is at its end, all they have to do is go buy a toaster.  We, can no longer even make fire.  If you look at my toaster history, below, you'll see that this collapse has been going on for at least the last 14 years.  Our cheap Oster toaster that lasted us for 5 years finally reached the point where we had to replace it.  This ""Kitchenaid Contour Silver 2-Slice Toaster KMT2115CU"" is our third attempt at a replacement in four days.  They've all failed and all been returned.  In this case, the toaster actually works a bit.  The problem is that the two sides of a piece of bread do not toast equally.  To get the lesser-cooked side decently toasted, the more-cooked side will be burned.  To get the more-cooked side decently toasted, the lesser-cooked side will be un-browned.  Plus, it takes a long time to toast.  This is better than the previous two toasters, but not good enough (heck, the old one we're replacing still toasts better than this).  So back it goes.  I have no idea how retailers can survive the inventory churn caused by this total lack of quality and quality control.  Ditto for the manufacturers.  But, since the manufacturers are the problem here, they can go bankrupt and improve the world for all that I care.  Anyway, I rate this thing at a Very Bad 1 star out of 5.And, if anyone's interested, here's the history for our search for fire:-05/12/15:  Kitchenaid Contour Silver 2-Slice Toaster KMT2115CU:  Returned.

"We picked up this ""Hamilton Beach 24810 4-Slice Long Slot Keep Warm Toaster"" at Costco for FAR less than it is here.  Regardless, it's going back since it only toasts one side of the bread (the inner side).  Also, the darn thing beeps.  For some reason, it beeps once when you depress the lever to start toasting (as if you didn't know you had just started toasting something even though your finger is still on the lever) and it beeps three times when the toast is done.  I suppose the beeping when the toast is done might serve some purpose (though theoretically (and the manual specifically states it), you shouldn't leave the toaster unattended while toasting).  But, I imagine many people will scoff at that since they've got things to do while the toast is toasting.  The trouble is that we can't disable that beeping and it sounds like my backup batteries on my computer during a power failure (very jarring).

"Robert Kroese's ""Mercury Rises"" is the 2nd in his ""Mercury"" series of book.  Unfortunately, it suffers a bit from sequelitis.  Specifically, it's got all the elements of the first book:  irreverent humor, constant japes and wisecracks, and a nicely intertwined plot.  But, it's just missing something.  It feels just a tad less clever than the first book.  My biggest issue with the book, though, isn't really with that lack.  Instead, unlike the first book, this one definitely requires the later books.  Now, I'd read the first three books once before.  From that vantage, I can see that the first book really wasn't complete.  But, it ""felt"" complete.  This book doesn't end in a cliff-hanger.  But, it's very obvious that there's more that needs doing.  These aren't huge issues.

"Robert Kroese's ""Mercury Falls"" is both a(n) humorous and an intellectual book to read.  Be warned, though, that the humor might not appeal to everyone:  it's highly irreverent.  So, as another review here states (from the opposite side of the ratings spectrum), read the material in the ""Look Inside"" link on Amazon's product page before buying it.  Even better than the humor, is the intertwined nature of the plot.  Kroese weaves just about everything in the book, including the number of footnotes and the asides, into the plot at some point.  He's also really good at bringing in references to other works.  I especially liked the reference to Douglas Adams' bowl of petunias from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  So, I'm very happy to rate the book at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.The novels in Robert Kroese's ""Mercury"" series are:1.  Mercury Falls (Mercury Series Book 1)2.  Mercury Rises (Mercury Series Book 2)3.  Mercury Rests (Mercury Series Book 3)4.

"Robert A. Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" hasn't weathered the 64 years since its initial publication well.  Back in 1951, when he first published it, I suppose the behavior of the main characters would have been considered risque and ""edgy"" (one of the reasons it was so severely censored back then).  But, today, that behavior (particularly the main character's behavior) just comes across as being caddish or loutish.  Oddly enough, Heinlein muffs the one thing that should have been a positive in our current world view:  the main female character starts out as an emancipated, strong lead (she's smarter, faster, and a better agent than her mail counterpart).  But, by the end, Heinlein has turned her into some kind of Stepford Wife whose sole line seem to be ""Yes, dear.""  Even worse than what the changes in how we expect people to behave have hit the book is the discontinuity in the main character's role:  He's supposed to be a kind of super agent.  Yet, he never behaves as such, either in physical ""agent"" ability or in his mental acumen.  He basically comes across as a boss's pet (and that come's across even more when a relationship is revealed about a third of the way through the book).  This really hits home near the end when he's actually promoted.  Yet, all of the previous is fairly trivial compared to the biggest problem:  every single character in the book behaves illogically.  It's not just a matter of doing things that make no sense (which happens, too).  No, the big problem is that nobody does what they, very obviously, really should be doing.  All the time.  From the very start, right down to the finish line.  It makes the book painful to read.All of that is a shame.  In my youth, Heinlein was my favorite author (not just one of my favorites -- he was THE favorite).  Even today, his Starship Troopers is one of my favorite books.  So, it pains me to have to write such a negative review here.  Yes.  This book is interesting and Heinlein's foresight makes his books worth reading.  But, the problems with this book just override that.  So, all I can do is rate the book at a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTBDA7B9ZDULV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00APA1EN2#wasThisHelpful","RTBDA7B9ZDULV","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes.  Linda Nagata's ""Deception Well"" is weird, slow, and filled with contradictions.  But, the biggest problem is the whole family of logic elephants in the room.  From almost the very start of the book until its very end, you're annoyed with structural issues.  But, you've also got to contend with the constant nagging question in the back of your head related to the core plot:  why didn't/don't the powers that be (TPTB) just let those people go down to the surface of the planet?  Those people are nothing to TPTB.  In fact, they're worse than nothing:  they're invaders.  Why not just let them go down to what TPTB are sure is certain doom?  That decision leads to a whole lot of baby elephants that keep nagging at you:- if TPTB want to avoid deaths, why do things that lead directly to the death of most of them?- if TPTB want to save them, why keep them as permanent refugees?- if TPTB are worried about what the main character will do, why not just let him go down to the planet?- if TPTB believe absolutely that they can be re-born from their own metadata (to an extent one main character will let his body be killed so he can transmit said metadata to a different location and only have one instantiation), why don't they just record the main character (to salve their consciousness) and toss him out an airlock?- if TPTB are afraid of reactions from whatever's down on the planet, why fire weapons down there?- if TPTB want the main character to come back once he's out of reach, why ask him when there's not anything he can do about it?- if TPTB want the main character's help, why do they beat him about the head and shoulders and otherwise torment him?It would have been nice to have all those elephants removed (as well as the structural problems (especially the slow pacing)) since Nagata might have been able to focus some attention on her weird universe and explain it better.

"If you've read much of Jack L. Chalker's works, you'll understand how something related to H.G. Wells' ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" might appeal to him.  Thus, we've got Chalker's ""The Moreau Factor.""  It's an interesting plot coupled with some of the very serious issues that our technology is presenting us with.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  But, it does suffer from some problems.  First, there are some editing issues.  Oh, not things like misspelled words or grammar.  Instead, there are discontinuities where it looks like he wrote the book for a bit and then stopped for a while.  Then, when he picked it up again, he didn't re-read the earlier stuff and we get either duplicate or contradicting information.  More subtly, the tone of the book changes.  The first few chapters feel more gritty and less high-tech than I'd have expected from Chalker.  After that, things feel smoother and much higher tech.  And then, the remainder of the book reads more like Chalker's other works (i.e., very high tech and centering around personal transformation).  This isn't a major problem, but it does jar a bit.  More bothersome is that even though, by the end, we learn who's doing what to whom and why, I still have problems with it.  There are much easier, cheaper, and less messy ways of solving the problems the antagonists were facing than what they chose.  To me, it looks like they chose these methods because that's what Chalker likes to write about.  But, even with that, I found the story to be a good one.  So, I'm rating the book (with some slight misgivings) at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SFFTLN7K845T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345402960#wasThisHelpful","R2SFFTLN7K845T","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Others here have noted that Joe Abercrombie's ""Half a King"" is less ""gritty,"" bloody, visceral, etc. than some of his other works.  I agree (a bit - don't go looking for the characters to be dancing with rainbows or singing in six part harmony).  But, whereas they bemoan that ""loss,"" I'm happy with it.  There's more than enough blood, guts, death, dismemberment, torment, meanness, etc. in this book, but it's been tempered by a slightly rosy suggestion of cleverness and maybe (just maybe) a hint of decency.  Abercrombie's writing is very good and the world, plot, and characters are all very well done.  I'm usually a bit ambivalent about his books, but this one's got enough of a positive trend for me to rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5 and to look forward to the next in line.The novels in Joe Abercrombie's ""Shattered Sea"" series are:1.

"The Icefalcon is an interesting enigma of a character throughout Barbara Hambly's ""Darwath"" series.  This book, ""Icefalcon's Quest,"" is designed to flesh out and give the background of the Icefalcon.  It's definitely a book that needed writing and actually does a pretty good job of giving us that information.  But, unfortunately, the story could have been (and should have been) better.  I've got three main problems with it.  First, for all that it dumps us right into Hambly's signature despair, it takes fully two-thirds of the book before we even get an inkling of what's happening.  Instead, those first two hundred pages are filled with the Icefalcon following Tir.  Yes, we're getting all the Icefalcon stuff.  But, we're sitting there for all those pages scratching our heads and wondering when the story is going to go someplace.  Second, there are just too many gaping holes in what's happening.  For instance:- The wet-work in this book is personally handled by our old pal Bektis, the somewhat incompetent, pompous, and cowardly court mage.  He'd never do that.- We never get an explanation of why Bektis is doing this (especially since he's got a nifty new gadget that should keep him out from under someone's thumb).- We get almost no explanation of Bektis' nifty tool nor why he would continue using it more than once.- The rationale we get in the last few pages of the book for the main bad guy doing this is horribly weak.- It makes no sense that all the resources (and their ability to be used) that the bad guys have were found where they were.And, finally, it's just silly to think that all those guys with swords and the wizard with the nifty tool would put up with the abuse that the lead bad guy heaps on them.  These guys have passed straight through henchman status and are plummeting through minionhood.  So, all together, I can only rate the book at an OK 3 stars out of 5.  It's good for an Icefalcon fix, but as a story, it's just too weak and drawn out.  If Hambly had condensed the first couple of hundred pages down to 50 or so, and then worked some more with the last 150 pages, it would have been better.The novels in the Darwath series are:1, 2, and 3.

"Unfortunately, I'm stuck with being able to give only one rating to Steven Barnes' ""Blood Brothers.""  It's unfortunate, because technically, the book is very well written with good characters and an engaging plot.  But, personally, I found that the pure nastiness of the book overrode all the technical excellence.  I probably could have lived with the book if the 100 or so pages of Dahlia Childe's diary stuck in the middle had been summarized or otherwise sanitized.

"I'm highly disappointed with Jack L. Chalker's ""Priam's Lens.""  It doesn't read like the Chalker I know.  The most prevalent problem with it is that there's just too much talking.  It goes on and on.  Heck, the story doesn't really begin until around 250 pages into the book.  Coupled with that is the fact that fully half of the book follows a tribe of survivors of the evil aliens and is not interesting at all (in characters or in story).  But, the biggest problem is that the book is just filled with inconsistencies and contradictions.  Things will be described as being one way, only to be described as being totally different in the next chapter.

"Through most of Eric S. Nylund's ""Signal to Noise,"" the biggest issue I had with it was that the main character, Jack, is an idiot.  I'm not talking about just a slow guy.  I'm talking about a guy who seems to be incapable of understanding some of the main characteristics of his milieu (his forte, his arena, his bailiwick, etc.).  Here's a guy whose profession is encryption and who does side jobs for the NSA-equivalent organization of his universe.  Yet, from day one, he's constantly neglecting computer security (and human security, too).  Of course, I figured that this character flaw would enable some nice character growth as the novel progressed.  Nope.  If anything, his idiocy gets worse.  Even more heinous, after using something that's supposed to make him better at what he is, he gets even worse.  OK.  Fine.  I was still very happy with the book.  It's fast-paced, well-written, and interesting.  But, in the last 30 pages or so, the book collapses.  Yes, it's the first of two books.  But, with what happens at the end of it, I basically have to throw up my hands and say ""why bother?"" (I wish I could say more, but it would be a major spoiler).

"I'm sad to say, Arthur C. Clarke's ""2061 (Space Odyssey Book 3)"" is nowhere near as good as the previous book in the series.  First of all, the first third of the book is almost entirely filler.  Some of it is used for positioning the pieces on the board.  But, for all intents and purposes, it could have been cut entirely from the book.  Second, the crux of the rest of the book is that a spaceship gets stranded somewhere.  It survives its ""landing,"" but can't leave without fuel.  But, unless I'm mis-remembering some of the stuff from the filler third of the book, it's surrounded by the very material it uses for propellant.  Third, the great mystery object that we're supposed to be wondering about is very obviously what it is just as soon as it's mentioned.  Third, I can't come up with any rational reason for anyone to do the things they did that resulted in the stranded spaceship.  And finally, though it's merely a bad frosting on a negative cake, almost the entire last chapter is lifted verbatim from the previous book.  I have no idea what happened to Clarke to cause him to write this book this way.  About the only thing I can say about it that isn't negative is that it isn't actively bad.

"I'm happy to say that Arthur C. Clarke's ""2010:  Odyssey Two"" is a better book than the first book in the series.  The reason for this is simple:  the first book is written as a descriptive novel of science and science fiction revolving around a fairly weak plot.  This book is written as a true science fiction story.  Some of the later (Bowman) chapters in the book are still highly descriptive in nature, but then, since Bowman is existing on his own, there's not much that can be done about that.  My only real complaints with the book are that 1) there are a couple of swaths cut and pasted directly from ""2001"" directly into it, and 2) Clarke ""revised history"" by aligning the prequel events with the ""2001"" MOVIE instead of with the BOOK.  This revisionist history isn't as bad as what Crichton did with The Lost World: A Novel (Jurassic Park Book 2) (where he brings back a thoroughly dead character because he didn't die in the movie), but still, the change of location from Saturn to Jupiter is a bit noticeable.  Even so, these negatives are not huge.  Thus, I'm happy to rate this book at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.The novels in Arthur C.

"The biggest problem with Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"" is that it's basically a vehicle to describe science and science fiction instead of a vehicle to tell a story.  Though Clarke's writing (as always) is excellent, the plot is very weak and the book is almost entirely descriptive in nature.  So, there's very little actual activity taking place and, worse still, the descriptiveness doesn't even occur via real dialog.  Instead, it occurs via inner dialog.  I doubt there's even 1000 words spoken in the whole thing.  Again, Clarke does an excellent job of writing this expo.

"In theory, this ""Toto SS114#01 Traditional SoftClose Elongated Toilet Seat, Cotton White"" is the replacement seat for the TOTO MS854114S#01 Ultramax Elongated One Piece Toilet, Cotton White.  Originally, I had read the negative reviews here and, instead of buying this seat, I bought a Centoco 1700SC-301 Plastic Elongated Toilet Seat with Closed Front, Crane White.  Unfortunately, that seat is far from a replacement for my Ultramax.  So, I came back here and bought the SS114#01.  Well, this seat fits the toilet, is the same color, closes nicely with the soft-close hinge, and has about the same-sized/shaped hole.  BUT, it differs from the original seat in two important ways.  First, the original seat is very concave.  So, sitting on it is very comfortable.  The seat basically cups your tushy-indents.  This SS114#01 replacement seat, however, is NOT concave.  It's not horribly convex like many other toilet seats are.  But, there's definitely a rounded feel pushing up into your bottom when you sit on it.  Second, when raising the original seat lid, it stops before hitting the toilet tank (in a near vertical position).  This replacement seat only stops when it hits the tank.  It's not the end of the world, but that little tap every time the lid goes up is a bit annoying.  So, right now, I'm rating this seat at a barely Acceptable 3 stars out of 5.

"Iain M. Banks' ""Against a Dark Background"" is certainly not a happy book.  It's filled with nasty people doing nasty things to other nasty people on a nasty world.  So, right there, that doesn't put it up there with my favorites.  But, dragging it down even more is all the background information Banks includes.  Yes.  I'm pretty sure a good chunk of that is needed.  But, for some reason, the constant flashbacks for background just slow the plot progress down to a crawl.  It's an interesting conundrum.  What differentiates ""too much background"" from ""good background?""  For instance, in Nick Harkaway's The Gone-Away World, the author spends the first third of that book on backstory.  Yet, every word of it is interesting and wonderful.  In ""Against a Dark Background,"" I just wanted to tell Banks to get on with it.  Perhaps it's just that I don't much care for any of the characters in this book.  So, not only don't I care all that much about what happens TO them, I don't really care all that much ABOUT them.

"I've been using the Vanilla version of this Nutra Summa Pea Protein for a while now.

Based solely on taste, I'd actually reduce it a star:  the chocolate flavor is very harsh.  It covers some of the odd pea protein flavor, but I think I'd actually prefer that flavor to this bitter chocolate flavor.  Looking at the ingredients, I can see why.  The chocolate flavor is from added cocoa powder.  I guess that's a good thing:  after all, this is supposed to be a nutritional supplement.  So, adding fats and even more sugar to smooth out the cocoa powder taste would be counter-productive.  Now, my wife actually adds cocoa powder to her coffee.  She likes it.  So, I'm going to assume other people would also like it and keep my rating for the Chocolate version at the same OK 3 stars out of 5 I rated the Vanilla version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU4NM18KKZ5RG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009STEX1Q#wasThisHelpful","RU4NM18KKZ5RG","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Surprisingly (for me, anyway), these ""Lidtke Technologies L-Tryptophan Complete Capsules"" actually seem to work to improve my sleep.  It's also possible that they help a bit with my mood (a hard thing to tell from inside my own head).  Two capsules on an empty stomach about an hour before bed seems to be the right dosage for me.  These L-tryptophan capsules are more expensive than other brands, but Lidtke seems to have a good reputation, the pills are packaged very nicely in an actual glass bottle, and the L-tryptophan is blended with other supplements to improve its efficacy (at least according to what I can find on the internet).  The only negative thing I have with this product is that I can't find any information about how the L-tryptophan is produced, what it's made from (though it's supposed to be non-GMO), it's source country, or even where the product is bottled.  Lidtke, itself, seems to be located in Casa Grande, AZ.  But, that doesn't mean anything regarding the product source.  The best I can find is at the bottom of their home page (http://lidtke.com/) where it says:""At LIDTKE we literally search the world for premium raw materials that even surpass pharmaceutical standards.""So, the implication is that their L-tryptophan could come from anywhere (i.e., China -- where most of the world's L-tryptophan is produced).  Countering that lack of a specified source, LIDTKE is one of the very few sources of L-tryptophan that I've found who show some kind of ""stamp of good housekeeping."" They've got a GMP mark on the label (look it up on Wikipedia). So, theoretically, there's at least some kind of approved practices going on.  Still, overall, I'm pleased with the product and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5.I'd also like to add a generic warning about any L-tryptophan supplement:  do not take one if you're currently taking, or have recently taken, another serotonin enhancing substance (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) like Prozac, or even certain other supplements). The time those substances stay in the body can be on the order of weeks to months. So don't combine any L-tryptophan supplements with those substances.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R288GMPTJ709C2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001E56G5S#wasThisHelpful","R288GMPTJ709C2","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Supposedly, they're far superior to any others for preventing badly ""adapted"" SIM cards from destroying a phone by getting stuck in the SIM prongs.  So, I tried these.  As far as I can tell, they're exactly the same as the free adapters that came in the AT&T GoPhone SIM Card Kit I bought.  They seem to be made of the same material, they're the same size, and the SIM card fits just as badly in this expensive Sadapter version as it does in the free AT&T adapter.

"Functionally, I've got no problem with this ""ARRIS / Motorola SurfBoard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem.""  I actually like it quite a bit.  My internet speed went from around 45 Mbps with my old SB6120 to around 65 Mbps with this SB6183 (I'm on a Cox Preferred plan, so I'm supposed to be good to 100 Mbps).  My reasons for dropping the modem a star down to a ""mere"" Very Good 4 stars out of 5 are a bit squishy.  First, all the documents say that when the SB6183 is up and running, all the LEDs (and they're bright -- especially through the ventilation holes in the side of the case) should be solid blue or green.  Well, my Send and Receive lights are solid blue as described, but my Power and Online lights are solid white (not green).  There doesn't seem to be anything functionally wrong, but I asked about that on Arris' twitter page (@ARRISEVERYWHERE #SB6183) and got no response.  Ditto for a message on their website.  My other minor concern is that the modem runs hot.  I never noticed any heat from my old SB6120.  But, I can certainly feel the heat coming off this SB6183.  Again, no functional problem.  Just a concern.To other Cox subscribers, I'll also pass along some information I found along the way.  At the time I activated this modem, Cox's activation page didn't have an option for the SB6183.  So, I had to call in and talk to someone.  It turns out that was a good thing since, apparently, their online activation setup doesn't change the account from DOCSIS 2.0 (old modem) to DOCSIS 3.0 (new modem).  I've seen posts from people who've activated online and didn't get all their channels bonded for their full speed (according to 192.168.100.1, I'm getting 12 downstream channels and 4 upstream ones).  A phone call is necessary to unlock the DOCSIS 3.0 capabilities.  Also, checking the equipment Cox has registered to my account, it shows a RGI6183 instead of an SB6183.  Cox says that's the correct designation (I don't know why they don't use the actual name).  And, finally, every day my Event Log for the modem give me something like:""Sat Dec 06 14:40:57 2014 Error (4) DHCP RENEW WARNING - Field invalid in response v4 option;CM-MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;CMTS-MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx;CM-QOS=1.1;CM-VER=3.0;""Apparently, that's because the DHCP client the modem uses doesn't have the options the server is requesting, so the modem logs it as an error.  From what I've been told, though, it's not a problem.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XS91FF3RET71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MA5U1FW#wasThisHelpful","R2XS91FF3RET71","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is going to be an odd review.  First, I'll start with the big thing weighing down my rating of this ""Linksys AC1750 Wi-Fi Wireless Dual-Band+ Router with Gigabit & USB 3.0 Ports, Smart Wi-Fi App Enabled to Control Your Network from Anywhere (EA6500):""  according to the Managing Editor of SmallNetBuilder (Tim Higgins), Linksys has discontinued this EA6500 router.  He mentioned that in an article and in a forum post where I specifically asked about it.  I've also seen the same statement on several other sites.  Also, according to the Download page for the router, the latest firmware is the one that it ships with (1.1.40.160909) and is dated six months ago (05/30/2014).  So, right up front, I'll say that unless you find this router at a DEEP discount (much, MUCH less than any non-discontinued AC1750 router), I wouldn't buy it.As to the EA6500, itself, first of all, this is Version 2 of the router (it has a USB 3.0 port vs just a USB 2.0 port).  Slightly more technical, it's a very nice looking piece of hardware with a nice, easy-to-use UI for configuring it.  At this level, the only negative I really have with it is that even though Linksys provides the default wireless network names and passwords in several locations, they don't mention the default wired password anywhere (it's ""admin"").  Setting it up was simple.  I plugged it in, connected an ethernet cable between it and my computer, told it I didn't want to use the configuration tool, gave it the default password, and had at it.  The UI is big, separated into logical functions, and fairly easy to understand (well, easy for a router).  Once it's configured, you can also use a bundled NFC card and a Linksys app by tapping the card to your NFC-enabled phone and it will automatically connect it to the router.  That's gee-whiz neat, but fairly useless.  It's probably easier to just enter the password on your phone than it would be managing that card and messing with an app.But, even ignoring the EA6500's discontinued status, the big negative is the wireless range/speed.  I'm currently using a new ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless-AC1750 Gigabit Router (so new that I haven't even written my review of it).  Connecting my computer to either of these routers, running through my ARRIS / Motorola SurfBoard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem - (SB6183) Retail Packaging - White to my Cox Preferred internet connection, I get about the same 63 Mbps down, 14 Mbps up, with 17 ms ping.  No problem.  But, going wireless through my Nexus 5 phone from about 35 - 40 feet away (where I normally connect) is a different kettle of fish.  The Asus AC66U gives me 23 Mbps/ 7 Mbps / 14 ms on 2.4 GHz and 14/7/22 on 5.0 GHz.  With the Linksys EA6500 v2, that drops to 3/1/16 (2.4 GHz) and 4/4/30 (5.0 GHz).  That's just not good enough for my use.In summary, this is a discontinued product with good esthetics and an easy-to-use UI, good wired speed, but terrible wireless range/speed (at least in my case).  So, I'm rating it at a Not Very Good 2 stars out of 5.  Again, if you can find it deeply discounted from the price any non-discontinued AC1750 router and will be connecting either via wires or a very nearby wireless device, you might consider it.  Otherwise, buy something else.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MO7DNUNFDR0J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008I21EA2#wasThisHelpful","R3MO7DNUNFDR0J","A3DQWFWINN3V5A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DQWFWINN3V5A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oddly, I found the first book in the series (a mere novella) to be slightly better than this one (a ""double-length novella"").  It's not a dramatic difference.  It's just that I think the first book was so short that the exploration and explanation of the fascinating premise behind the book took the front and center position.  Here, the plot takes precedence.  And, while it's a fine plot, it's nowhere near as deep as a standard Sanderson plot.  Of course, that's to be expected since the book is far shorter than his other books (double-length novella vs epic novel).  Still, it's an interesting, well-done story and well worth the read.

"I keep being amazed at the breadth of Brandon Sanderson's imagination.  Perhaps he has that Terry Pratchett DNA which causes cosmic rays to strike his skull and spark off a constant stream of amazing ideas.

I have no IOS device and bought this for my Android phone.  So, right now, I can do absolutely nothing with it.  There is an app on the Google Play Store (B-BLE) which allows me to connect to the device and see that it's working.

"This Nutra Summa Pea Protein is a good meal replacement with a tolerable taste.  Each serving provides about 20 grams of protein and (very roughly) half the daily requirement of all the essential amino acids.  I've had no GI (i.e., gas) issues with it and one glass of the stuff for breakfast keeps me full until lunch.  Besides the taste being merely tolerable (sort of a dark, gritty, chalky flavor (this is for the vanilla version)), I've got a few other non-positives.  First, the powder doesn't mix all that well.  I have to put it into my Nutri Ninja Pro Blender (BL450) to get it to mix.  Second, the instructions recommend one scoop of powder in 8 ounces of milk.  That's way too thick of a drink.  I double the liquid by adding a total of eight more ounces of ice/water and blending that for a decent smoothie.  And, finally, it's fairly expensive.  Here on Amazon, the price works out to about a dollar a serving (about 30 servings in the 2.03 pound container).  Still, it does the job.

"I'm not very happy with the packaging of this book.  It's Roger Zelazny's ""To Die in Italbar"" coupled with his ""A Dark Traveling.""  The two stories are fine, but they should never have been published together.  They're not related in any way.The first story (""To Die in Italbar"") is set in Zelazny's Pei'an universe and features a cameo role for Francis Sandow (his protagonist in ""Isle of the Dead"").  Interestingly, according to the Wikipedia entry for the story, Zelazny said:""If I could kill off one book it would be To Die in Italbar. I wrote that in a hurry to make some money after I quit my job.""It's interesting because I think it's a pretty darn good story.  Oh, it's a bit short, the characterizations are fairly shallow, and Sandow's role is practically non-existent.  But, the writing is all Zelazny, it's decently paced, and it's interesting.I was really surprised by the second story (""A Dark Traveling"").  First, it's a Young Adult (YA) story (apparently, his only such). Second, I actually enjoyed it.  Usually, in these two-story compendiums, one story is good and the other is bad.  And, since this one is YA, I really expected something not-that-good.  But, from my point of view, both are good in this one.  It's an interesting book in that the characters remind me a lot of those in Heinlein's YA material.  Yet, again, the story has Zelazny all over it.  I've got only two complaints about this one:  first, the ending is a bit abrupt; and second, the characters are a couple of years too young for their behavior (even for Heinlein).It's surprising since these two stories are so far apart in just about every respect.

Her best friend Pete needs a manager for the cafe they worked in as college students. Sure, some of her employees are surly jerks, but she's dealt with worse (and none of them are any match for Redheaded She Devil). But a first day that starts out with a customer going into anaphylactic shock and ends with one of the employees she'd just reprimanded stabbed to death in an alley is not an auspicious start to a new life. (Then again, if it helps business, maybe murder's not that bad?) And while some eye candy who has very good taste in women might be exactly what she needs to take her mind off of murder, why does Juliet think her would-be suitor might be trouble?Fardig has created another hilarious, reluctant sleuth, but Juliet Langley definitely likes to have more fun than Lizzie Hart. (It's nice to see that Lizzie isn't entirely gone; one of the characters from her series makes an important appearance, and she's mentioned once, albeit not by name.) Is she a little closed off?

"This is a wonderful workout that combines fitness, ballet and yoga to create a surprisingly intense cardio-sculpting workout that at times has an interval feel.Be warned: the fitness is choreographed and low-impact and could probably be called ""dancy"" on its own. I love this, but if you're looking for more traditional calisthenics you won't find it here. Conversely, some of the ballet might feel more like modern dance, and Fable does not use one word of ballet terminology. (A plie is simply a knee bend, second position is a wide squat, a fondu is a wrap, etc.) Also of note is that the yoga is designed to be a break in this workout; the moves are done for a shorter period of time and are much less intense, focusing more on flexibility than strength. On paper that might not sound like a benefit, but after the fitness and ballet sections you will welcome it.Fitness junkies might also object to the long warm up- about thirteen minutes- but it not only helps to warm up the body but also give a taste of some of the movements and choreography to come. The ""work"" portion is divided into four sections, all of which are further divided into fitness, ballet and then yoga. The first fitness segment is absolutely the hardest: you will not only hold a balance on one leg, youll also do it in flexion combined with lateral flexion. If you can get through that, you can get through the rest of the sections, but with a lot of sweat. The second segment focuses on lateral movement and the third on extension. The fourth segment focuses on variations on one-legged squats, but (mercifully) its shorter than the other three, using four counts for each pattern, rather than eight (and even though she has you repeat each pattern twelve times rather than eight, it still comes out to less time overall). By the time you get to the cooldown you should be covered in sweat.In the previously released Beyond Balletone, Fable had separate sections in each segment for balance and power. In this one, she sneaks in power by asking you to focus on one movement in each section, usually a lift or push. This adds to the overall interval effect of the workout.Since starting this workout, Ive noticed the work in my glutes (all those large range extensions are going somewhere!) but also in my upper back, and in the good way. A lot of the pain in my neck and shoulders has been greatly reduced, though I cant tell you whether thats due to the arm movements or the lack of focus on them. Either way, its a good effect.If youre looking for simple yet dancy low-impact cardio sculpting, this is for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36LNLLMGYBQTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DLSNOQ#wasThisHelpful","R36LNLLMGYBQTP","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book would be perfect for anyone from young adult to adult. I wouldn't give this to a middle graders, but I might consider it for a mature 7th grader.This is not the story of ""Maria"", the beloved character from everyone's favorite children's show, Sesame Street. This is the story of the actress who grew up to play her, and it's rich with detail that more sensitive readers might be upset by. (Although, as much as everyone has cringed about the abuse, what upset me most was an insensitive teacher who mocked her family's poverty.) The style Manzano writes in recounting her life as a young child perfectly captures the disjointed recollections we string together as childhood memories.Anyone who ever spent any time in New York before it became a gentrified play space will find her descriptions of the Bronx she grew up in instantly evocative. As talented as Manzano is as a storyteller, that was my favorite ""character"" in the memoir.Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ABXSIA4XG99B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545621844#wasThisHelpful","R2ABXSIA4XG99B","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On paper, Hyeong-Do isn't very likable: he's a long time hit man who's both brutal and efficient, and he'll take out anyone if he's ordered to. So why do we root for this guy through the entire film to succeed?As with many popular South Korean films, this one not-so-subtly mocks modern Korean culture. Everyone is very impressed that Hyeong-Do is a salaried employee of a well-established ""company""; he is, but of course he and they aren't do the respect that's automatically attached to them...or are they? The office scenes border on eerie; if you expected to see people in catsuits working with weapons and working with sophisticated weapons, you're going to be disappointed; the employees of this company wear staid suits every day to go to work, and they have as many file cabinets, cubicles and salespeople as any other modern office. They also go on retreats, where they celebrate promotions and give out plaques. In other words, this is a job like any other, but it's also just another job.And yet of course it's more than that. The grizzled, retired mentor who suddenly decided he needed to leave talks about the love-hate pull of the all-consuming ""life"". So why does Hyeong-Do want to get out? A combination of a vulnerable newbie and a long-forgotten crush that makes him think he can do his job his way- but when you work for the company, you do it their way.This had it's share of blood and bone breaking, but as Korean action films go, the level of violence- and the depth of pathos- wasn't disturbing; in fact, this might even qualify as ""feel good"" for the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BX7UE24MHX5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CG0YM24#wasThisHelpful","R2BX7UE24MHX5K","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It should be noted that this movie is both violent and shocking, but not necessarily ""shockingly violent"". When you watch a Korean action movie, you should expect a high level of violence for most. (If you don't hear some bones snap at least twice, it must be a very short film.) As with many action films theses days, by the time you get to the final ""battle scene"", you're pretty numbed to it, and it starts to look more like a bloody choreographed dance than a fight scene.The shock is in the exploitation referenced and, to some extent, depicted in the film. This isn't the first Korean film by a long shot to talk about human trafficking, and they're not the first to mention organ harvesting, but this is the first to make such graphic reference to it- and it doesn't pull any punches. When the hardened main characters' faces drop in horror, brace yourself. Also, as much as you might turn away from the violence on screen- it *is* a lot- there's a heart-breaking scene toward the end that will make you cringe because you know how bad the follow up's going to be.Having said that, this was still an affecting film; the chemistry between the lost adult in the pawnshop and the emotionally abandoned little girl drives the film to the end. Know that if you're expecting a traditional happy ending you're going to be disappointed, but the ending does make sense given the main characters.Recommended for fans of Korean action films.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13CVJUJYDVCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004H2IMSO#wasThisHelpful","R13CVJUJYDVCC","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm someone who tries to pay as little attention to sports as possible, but even I know about Junior Seau's impressive football career and his shocking suicide. I think it's fair to say that many people's first thought upon hearing ""Junior Seau"" is ""concussion"". I chose this book with that in mind.Unfortunately, I'm not the target audience for this book. At the very least, readers should go into this with a minimal knowledge of football terms- I finally had to ask my husband what a ""sack"" was- and it might be most advantageous for readers who have an intense interest in recent football history and statistics. I ended up putting this book down halfway through in frustration; while I came away with a clear picture of Seau as physically gifted but emotionally immature, I was getting much more information on the stats for most of the games Seau played and the political tug of war being fought by management and coaches.

"I'll agree with other reviewers that this isn't an exhaustive history of tea, nor does it cover every aspect of tea production; however, it does provide a thorough look at how tea production evolved and how its popularity spread through East Asia, Western Europe and eventually the United States.Although I have done some reading on the history of tea before, I still learned quite a bit from this book. For example, I didn't realize that tea used to be processed into bricks and then shaved. I also didn't realize that tea trade with China was the proximate cause of the Opium Wars (and an indirect cause of the invasion of India). Like many modern tea drinkers, I was surprised to find that tea production in India is so new (18th to 19th century).Modern readers might find it interesting that tea has been linked to both health and status since it's earliest days. What I found provocative are the implications that it might also have been linked to a ""return to nature""/protest of urbanization movement since the 15th centuries. Definitely something to think about the next time you're invited to inhale the aroma from your cup and be transported to a place of calm and peace.Recommended for those who want to learn about the history of tea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36ABM3TI9E6IO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804837244#wasThisHelpful","R36ABM3TI9E6IO","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Other than the Guy Ritchie Sherlock Holmes movies, I'm not a huge fan of Steampunk. I've also never sought out stories of djinn (genies) because, in general, paranormal is not my thing. But I am a huge fan of A. Star aka Diantha Jones, so I devoured this release. And ooh!Glory St Pierre isn't just sassy- she's snarky and self-confident, and not easily bullied. So if Irving Amir has a problem with human beings, that's just too damn bad, especially if he's obliged to grant *her* wishes. If only he wasn't as sexy...oh wait, not a problem because he's so smug about it Glory's just a little less tempted. It's going to take nothing less than a mortal threat to get these two to let down their guard- and then the real fun begins. Hunters, renegade djinns and then some very cool automatons are just some of the things Glory is going to encounter as Amir pulls her into his world, but the biggest shock is what she's going to find out about her own.Star did a wonderful job describing not only the otherworldly settings and contraptions- can I have an bat like that?!- but also the action scenes. More importantly, it only takes her a few paragraphs to convey the essentials of all of her characters; that, more than anything else, made reading this go by all too quickly.Yes, this is Book One, meaning that there is more to come in this universe (you may gasp when you read the set up for what's coming next).

"Both as a response to requests of longtime customers and to address her husband's sugar sensitivity- and, it seems, because of the intellectual challenge required- Chang rejiggered some old favorites to use less sugar.In many cases, Chang keeps the basic structure of a recipe but simply reduces the amount of sugar. (If you've ever put more than a cup of sugar into a cake recipe, you'll be relieved to know that you can get away with as little as a third of a cup to achieve the same results in structure and lose very little in taste.) In other cases, Chang uses ""natural"" alternatives, including honey, maple syrup, dates and fruit juice concentrates; she does mention stevia's properties, but (thankfully) doesn't use it in baking because stevia is only a sweetener and doesn't work as a stabilizer. Finally, she relies on the natural sweetness in some common ingredients, including dairy cream, coconut milk and vanilla. (Is vanilla, even in seed/paste form, sweet? I don't think so, but because so many of us associate the flavor with sweetness, psychologically that's enough to convey it without extra sugar, at least in whipped cream.)As someone who has been baking for a family for decades, I've known for quite some time that much of the sugar could be reduced without a problem- in cakes. I was particularly impressed by what Chang could do with frosting. The ""cover model"" is a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting; as anyone who has ever made a cream cheese frosting knows, it becomes softer more quickly and sometimes requires more sugar than buttercream frostings to help hold its shape. Chang uses a combination of vigorous beating and heavy cream to achieve an impressively similar result.Highly recommended for home bakers who want to use less sugar.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YY9JNQV6NTSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MJMJO5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1YY9JNQV6NTSB","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ten year old Micah Tuttle has been raised by his grandfather Ephraim since his parents died several years before. It has been the two of them against the world, and Micah couldn't be happier. His favorite pastime: listening to his grandfather tell him the story of the time he visited the magical Circus Mirandus. But the little world the two inhabit disintegrates as Ephraim's health takes a turn for the worse. There's only one thing that can help them: Ephraim wants to cash in on the miracle the circus' Lightbender promised him when he was ten. But can even the powerful Lightbender grant Ephraim's most cherished wish? He will if Micah has anything to say about it...but what is Ephraim's wish?Although almost 300 pages long, I finished it in less than four hours. That isn't a testament to my speediness as much as it is Beasley's skill in weaving a story of magical realism and creating wonderful characters. From the second page, you want to reach out and hug Micah and, as is fitting in a book like this, you cheer when characters are introduced to help Micah on his quest, including the earnest Jenny Mendoza and The Messenger. Beasley also does a wonderful job describing the magical circus and its performers; I could vividly imagine every scene she described, and that's not always easy for a reader like me.The big question the story poses is what is the nature of Magic and why Ephraim and Micah so willingly embrace it? Not to give anything away, but that question can be answered in part by another character...but why is Ephraim so reluctant to talk about them?I sniffled several times throughout this story, but ultimately it lead to a heartwarming ending.

"Sarah Kendzior isn't covering original material: the people who might have aspired to be in the middle class decades before- or those who could have fooled themselves into thinking they were- are seeing their opportunities and infrastructure rot from the inside out.

(It must be said that Kendzior isn't entirely enthusiastic about our ability to do so.) Are we riding bikes more because we want to be part of the in-crowd doing that, or because we can't afford a car (or public transportation)?

"This workout is easy to follow in that you're probably already familiar with them and they are easy to describe (bridges/hip lifts, leg lifts, arm lifts, etc.). However, this workout is tough. Yes, most sections are variations on one exercise, but 1) there are a number of variations and 2) there are a number of reps (4 sets of 8, and then a pulse of some type for another 4 sets of 8) for each variation. The bridge section, which primarily targets the glutes but also get into your lower abs and inner and outer thighs, lasts about fifteen minutes; ten minutes in you will be aching.The section I found the most difficult are the leg lifts for the outer thighs. It may be because they were already pre-exhausted by the bridge section, or it may be because the muscle it's targeting is relatively small (mostly the gluteus medius). All I can tell you is that this section leaves me breathless every time I do it.The arm section is a surprising little gem. Not the trademarked Swan Arms, but a series of pushes to the side and back, along with some circles to the back. The arms never lifts more than 45 degrees, but it still manages to work the shoulders and triceps really well.The abs section was the only one that didn't really speak to me. It can be thought of as a variation on the Pilates roll down and/or the C-curve abs that frequently show up in barre workouts. However, her speed and the high number of repetitions make her a little difficult to follow; showing some modifications would have made this section better.My only other complaint is that while the little stretch breaks interspersed throughout the workout are much appreciated, they would have been more helpful if they had been held a little longer. (Since this clocks in at 52 minutes but was originally advertised as an hour, there was time to do so.)Those are small complaints, however; overall I still think this is a great workout, and would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a vigorous but almost all-floor workout.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY6453LAUGQEN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008F283J0#wasThisHelpful","RY6453LAUGQEN","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Once again, I'm kicking myself for waiting two years to read something.While this book explores Jesus the person, not Jesus Christ, the messiah, it isn't simply about the man's life. Aslan describes the context that Jesus' movement rose up in: thanks to the Maccabees, Israel had enjoyed about a century of independence after Hellenistic rulers before infighting and ineptitude at the top created an opening for the Romans to jump into. As vicious as some of their administrators were- even Augustus expressed a little horror at Herod's excesses- the banal corruption exhibited by the priest class wasn't much better (and, in fact, it was pretty much a requirement that the priests work hand-in-hand with the governors).It doesn't take much imagination to realize that after centuries of war, infighting and constant political turmoil Israel was a place of Haves and Have Nots. It was the Have Nots that Jesus and the other prophets of his generation were speaking to; in other words, Jesus' message was a predominantly political one. When he called himself The Son of Man, he was making reference to an old code for King, and when he talked about the coming of The Kingdom of Heaven, he was referring to the ""kingdom"" that would be born of an actual revolution in which, literally, the meek would inherit the earth.Jesus wasn't the only promised messiah of his time, and his execution at the hands of the Romans (and it was the Romans, no matter how hard Paul tried to twist it later) excluded him from the title. This is why the story of the resurrection was necessary in order to keep Jesus alive (as it were). As with Jesus miracle working, I imagined Aslan stepping back from his keyboard with his hands up. As he notes, there is no historical or factual explanation for resurrection, and can't be argued along those lines. The issue is not whether it happened, but that all of his adherents came to insist that it did. This allowed Jesus the man to begin the evolution into Jesus the deity, and without this Christianity would not have taken hold.The throughline for Aslan is that Jesus was first and foremost a radical, rabble-rousing Jew who had specific, worldly ambitions for his fellow Jewish brethren. He also notes that Jesus was probably illiterate, as was a staggering 95%+ of the population at that time. That might explain some liberties his gospels take with the source material, although it's not clear what kind of education he might have learned from the man who would later be known as John the Baptist. As he notes, it's a tragedy that Jesus the revolutionary isn't as well studied as Jesus the messiah.Recommended for anyone interested in the history of religion","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REWASY9FGO42U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BRUQ7ZY#wasThisHelpful","REWASY9FGO42U","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot promise you that you will change your life or find your bliss, but I can say that I had a lot of fun following her tidying advice.The basic premise of the philosophy, as you may have heard ad infinitum, is to only keep those things which ""spark joy"". If that's a little too airy for you, try things that you have a visceral, immediate, positive reaction to. As others have noted, there's an essential difference between focusing on what you're getting rid of (as many other cleaning/tidying advice does) and focusing on what you're keeping. In my opinion, Kondo's way of doing not only helps you as you transition your space, but also going forward when you make new purchases.Speaking of purchases, what made me grin and even giggle was her observation that ""storage experts are hoarders"". Yes, yes, a thousand times yes. (The Container Store must be gritting their teeth.) Whereas people who advocate storage solutions are trying to maximize the amount of objects one can store in their space, her advice is to review and whittle down your possessions until you feel a ""click"" that tells you when you've reached the minimum you can own. This should be more like a weight lifted off of your than a panic that you don't have enough; if you feel that, you've gone too far.A corollary of her advice not to obsess over storage is not to buy special storage solutions. She advises using shoe boxes and other boxes you probably already have around the house. (That sounds very DIY, but it comes off as much less pretentious than most DIY titles.) After sorting through my drawers, bookshelves, bathroom, kitchen (including cabinets and shelves) and closets (bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen), I'm happy to report that I haven't had to buy one special storage item to more logically store my items other than book ends to help vertically store my books.This book isn't taking off because it's giving a lot of specific advice on tidying, although it does do that. What makes it ""magical"" is that it promises that you can tidy once (however long that session might be) and then be DONE so you can get on with the rest of your life. Just as importantly, the process of tidying, which requires you to listen to yourself to determine what makes you happy, can help reveal what you would like to do with the rest of your life.After my tidying jaunts, I did indeed feel refreshed. The little bits I have to do daily to keep the space tidy- which is really putting things in their place and then wiping down surfaces- don't feel onerous but instead like lovely little rituals.

"Cawood's Tainted Love was one of the best pieces of fiction I've ever read, and the follow up does not disappoint. The reader was sickeningly aware from the beginning of Faith McKenzie's story in Tainted Love that she was becoming trapped in a cycle of dangerous physical violence. What Julia Swift suffers through is more subtle but just as disturbing to read: her husband doesn't beat her unconscious; instead, he slowly, consistently wears down her self-esteem and isolates her from friends and family. According to Wayne, Julia is a misguided and naive young woman who's lucky to have him around to protect her from the Big Bad World- and no one symbolizes that more than Ashleigh Jordan, his very intelligent and successful ex- and Julia's best friend.In some ways, Ashleigh can feel just as overbearing and controlling of Julia as Wayne can. The reader is going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what Ashleigh's motivation is: is she trying to protect Julia, or is she so blinded by her history with Wayne that she's trying to hurt him through Julia? Regardless of the answer, the fact that Ashleigh and Julia's married brother Sean have been dancing around each other since college isn't making anything less complicated.This is the kind of story that builds on you and then makes you want to jump out of your skin. Everyone who reads it will understand all too well how a beautiful and talented young woman like Julia can find herself trapped in a psychologically abusive relationship. I look forward to reading the rest of her story, and I can't wait to dig deeper into what the truth is about the mysterious Ashleigh.Disclaimer: I know the author.

"Let's get the basics out of the way: this is the story of Ares told through one of the most bloody stories in all Greek mythology, The Trojan War aka the Iliad. As O'Connor notes, he begins his tale in the same place that Homer did, after Achilles has tantrumed off the field of battle. O'Connor follows the story through, down to the abominations the Greeks wrought on the Trojans after they were victorious. (For more on that, see The War at Troy: What Homer Didn't Tell.) Yes, O'Connor's illustrations and story-telling are as impressive as ever.The series opened with Zeus, and eventually all of the other books have come back to him. This book is no different. O'Connor hinted in the story of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, that Zeus was playing the long game, and in the story of Ares (god of war and Aphrodite's lover), it's fascinating to see who gets that and why.The story opens with Ares listening to one of his sons cursing him for being indifferent to his fate. If only; the same irrationality and bloodlust that drive him to dip his hands into gore make him among the more attached parents on Olympus. Unlike Zeus or Poseidon, he doesn't see his children as potential pawns but as attachments of himself. Ares is destructive, but he is also passionate, in destruction and in love.This wasn't strictly Ares' show; as many readers know, just about every Olympian with the exception of Hestia picked a side in the war and eventually came to blows themselves over it. Of all of the other gods, Athena was the one I couldn't stop reflecting on. For a goddess synonymous with wisdom and cunning, she is surprisingly (dare I say it) hot-tempered and arrogant. The goddess known for her skill at manipulating others is blind to the fact that she has been manipulated, and the weapon used against her was her pride. In that way, she's the parallel to Achilles, the strong but ill-fated hero of the Greeks, and not the clever Odysseus, who doesn't play much of a role in this story. You leave this story with a lot less respect for Athena than you had in other books, which leaves us with the awful, deflated feeling that the only thing that's left after the Trojan War is power (Zeus) and destruction (Ares). Now guess which one has more integrity?Impatiently awaiting the next installment","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UF87XRE2GT48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626720134#wasThisHelpful","R3UF87XRE2GT48","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Semya Slotin's strength has always been her gut instincts (her super intelligence is an added bonus). But when she's struggling with both grief and impending motherhood, those instincts might be a little dull. She knows that her lover Vincent is still alive, but nothing else is as sharp as it used to be. Being an orphaned outsider is finally starting to catch up with her, and her spats with her partner-in-crime Polliannah aren't helping anything. So maybe indulging the manipulative CIA agent who wants to offer her information in exchange for something really dangerous isn't a good idea, but suddenly Ms. Slotin is a little more desperate than she used to be.Two crime families- in Moscow, of all places- would be dangerous enough. Throw in a couple of jealous mob wives, a long-lost father and a police commissioner/former agent who's starting to get a clue about what his former agency was *really* doing and you've got a lot of drama. But all that's irrelevant, ultimately. The real question: is Semya going to end up more alone than when she started out, or is she finally going to convince people that just maybe her gut isn't as rusty as it might seem?Loved it, of course, and read it all in one sitting. (Good thing that was a snow day, because the scenes between Polli and said former agent were h-o-t.) My favorite part of all though was the reunion between Semya and her father. (And if you ever wondered where the name ""Semya"" came from, you're going to find out.) Here's hoping Sam Dovos isn't too dirty so he can stick around for the next books...and boy do I hope we find out (or confirm) why Ulrich Edgerton needed to ruin Semya's family's life.Desperately awaiting book six.*I received a free copy in exchange for an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SS9XQMGM5TX3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S20UDZW#wasThisHelpful","R1SS9XQMGM5TX3","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's not Lizzie Hart's fault trouble keeps finding her, but maybe she can figure out how to get out of her own way once in a while?Lizzie hasn't even finished her bagel on her first day back at work before someone (else) is found dead. Unfortunately, this time she's well-acquainted with both the victim and the accused murderer. Because Lizzie can't catch a break, this case is going to put her back into the orbit of her hot ex-boyfriend Lee just as she's ready to take things to the next level with her even hotter almost-boyfriend Blake. Good: she might get to work through some of the issues that have left her more than a little closed off with Blake; bad: she might not be able to resist Lee as well as she thought she could.Not enough complications? Then how about the fact that the latest murders have a distinctly creepy occult angle to them and if Lizzie wants to clear an innocent person she's going to have to infiltrate a coven. And from there...hilarity ensues.Once again, Fardig made me laugh til I cried in a number of the scenes.

"Hector Salgado has yet another gut punch of a case to solve in Barcelona: the suicides of three employees of the same cosmetics company. They all attended the same company retreat, and they all came across something incredibly disturbing. But is that enough to cause three people to take their own lives?Meanwhile, Hector is also trying to piece together what happened to his estranged wife Ruth six months before at the end of The Summer of Dead Toys. His nemesis claimed responsibility- but he's dead. With him died his best chance for resolving the case...or did it? Leire Castro, his impetuous subordinate, needs something to do while waiting for her son to be born, and working on this case sounds like the perfect pastime. But what Leire hasn't counted is how deeply she has to get into Ruth's life in order to retrace her steps on her last day; as she does so, she begins to understand why Hector couldn't let her go after she left him. But what is she going to do with a shocking piece of information that even Salgado was unaware of?Salgado has six and then five suspects to work through. He understands very quickly that their motive is the same (even if he doesn't know at first what it is). It's the psychological make up of each individual- and the dynamics of the group itself- that are going to be key to solving it. The leader, the ingenue, the good soldier, the experienced commander, the bumbling newbie or the heiress...or is Salgado not looking hard enough where he should be?Whereas the mystery in The Summer of Dead Toys backed up from the center and circled around itself before coming to a resolution, the answer here can be better described as linear; once Salgado figures out what the case is really about, the answer comes pretty quickly. In that way, this wasn't a perfect mystery; finding out who was behind the deaths wasn't as satisfying as it could have been (although the motivation was heartbreaking). Also, while the clue as to what really happened during the company retreat did make sense, it felt a little too easily resolved. And *the* question, which the fate of five people seemed to hinge on, wasn't explicitly answered, although the reader might appreciate who answered it and why. If I could, I would give this 4.5 stars instead of 5.Other than Ruth, The Good Suicides makes almost no mention of the The Summer of Dead Toys. However, the pathetic imagery (both human and animal) that haunts Salgado is reminiscent of the chilling tableaus encountered in the first book: something vulnerable that never stood a chance in life but whose existence points to something evil. As much as Salgado is trying to come to terms with the complicated, corrupt world he inhabits and present a veneer of calm, with each book the reader begins to understand that this is just a facade. The truth about the first suicide is something that stay with both the reader and Hector for a while, no matter how much he tries to ""celebrate"" after solving the case.It is the last page, really the last sentence, that insured that I will read and devour the sequel. I did see it coming in the chapters right before it, but it still took my breath away. Suffice to say, Ruth's disappearance is more intimately connected to Hector than even he is aware.Despite my complaints, I could not put this down; I read the entire book in one day, staying up well past my bed time in order to do so. Those who like international mysteries with a big helping of psychology will want to carve time out of their schedule for this as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13JK01MIQS4PH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770435904#wasThisHelpful","R13JK01MIQS4PH","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ostensibly, this is the story of the strange period of time between 1996 and 1999 when adults turned a child's toy into currency, but it is just as much an examination of the nature of a fad and the people who create them.Beanie Babies were plush stuffed animals which had the then-unique characteristic of being understuffed and filled in key places with pellets which made them easy to pose. Available in a variety of colors and animal characters, the toys were slow to pick up interest. That lag time gave the toy company's founder, Ty Warner, time to tweak his models, which resulted in certain toys changing color or other attributes (e.g., spots and mouths). The fact that Warner insisted on his products being sold in small venues like gift shops and specialty toy shops and eschewed big box retailers like Toys 'R Us and Wal-Mart meant that when his toys did become popular there was a built-in scarcity. That made it a logical fit as a secondary market collectible (as much as anyone can apply the word ""logic"" to collectibles).Ty Warner was (is?) a highly-focused businessman who obsessed over the tiniest details of his creations. He, like many other successful entrepreneurs, also had a finely honed gut feel for what worked for his audience. It's not a surprise that someone with his skills could create a high-quality toy that would appeal to children and adults alike. But Warner's story is only part of what made Beanie Babies a cultural phenomenon; the ""early adopters"" in the Chicago-area were the ones who not only evangelized the toys but also created and then reinforced the idea of ""rare editions"" and first started treating the toys like a kind of currency. However, it might be fair to say that Beanie Babies didn't really take off as a fad until they authors, both traditional and self-published, started producing guides that listed the current and projected values of the toys.While this wasn't the first bubble, the sudden popularity of the internet and the World Wide Web made it possible for this to reach peak popularity much more quickly. Not only did Ty, Inc. use its website in ways its much larger competitors hadn't thought of yet to reinforce the ""personality"" of the brand, it also benefited from the second market trading that was taking place on eBay.Bissonnette does an impressive job of putting together the history of the toy, the ensuing craze and the not-always-stable people involved, but it's his discussion of overall market behavior that makes this a worthwhile read. (Hint: if you think this story is reminiscent of the housing or Dot Com bubbles, you might be onto something.) Even if you walk away without a clear understanding of the economics behind a craze, you'll get a glimpse into a surprisingly fascinating moment in American history.Recommended for fans of pop culture and economics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VGMB2QSD8WGF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1591846021#wasThisHelpful","R3VGMB2QSD8WGF","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was another Korean film I'd wanted to see for over a decade.Comparisons to Romeo and Juliet don't work; the issue that separates the young lovers isn't rivalry but class. The primary reason this story has held so much weight for over two hundred years is that it shows how fluid class is despite powerful prejudices.Myongrang Lee is the son of the current governor of Namwon. When he goes to explore the area, he spies Chunhyang. She is the daughter of Wolmae, a courtesan, and a former governor of Namwon. Her father had promised to take mother and child to Seoul with him, but died before he could. To honor the governor's legacy, her mother raised her to be well-accomplished in the arts; amazingly, she could also read and write. Myongrang is even more smitten when she refuses to come to him but send a reply referencing an old poem: if he wants to see her, he must come to her.When Myongrang does finally sneak away to her, he asks Wolmae for Chunhyang's hand. Mother and daughter reluctantly agree as they feel they can't refuse someone of his class, but Chunhyang soon falls genuinely in love with him as well. They enjoy idyllic nights and days at Wolmae's house until the governor discovers his tryst (but not his marriage). When the governor receives a promotion and is sent to Seoul, he orders Myongrang to accompany him. Myongrang, heeding his mother's words, keeps his marriage a secret for fear that he'll be disowned. However, he promises to return for Chunhyang after he has passed the state exams and received an appointment by the king.After three years of mourning her husband's departure, Chunhyang is summoned before the new, brutal governor. He chose Namwon because he had heard of Chunhyang's beauty and orders her to serve as his courtesan. When she asserts her status as a married woman and refuses, he scoffs at the idea that a courtesan's daughter could be anything but a courtesan. When she still refuses to submit, he accuses her of treason. When she demands to know what law she has broken, she is struck ten times and then later imprisoned. Her ultimate sentence is to be beaten to death as the governor celebrates his birthday.Meanwhile in Seoul, Myongrang has been studying obsessively, and after the exam he is revealed to have achieved the highest score. The king appoints him the Ethics Chief, and he is sent to investigate corrruption in...Namwon. There he discovers that Chunhyang is awaiting death for refusing the advances of the governor. He also discovers that the governor and the lords have been exploiting the people. Without revealing his true position, he observes the governor and his corrupt court, then reveals the police forces he has sent for to arrest the governor and his men. After his reunion with Chunhyang, Myongrang confronts the governor, who continues to insist that Chunhyang was the one who did him an injustice because she refused to exceed to the demands of someone of a higher class. To which Myongrang replies: ""It wasn't injustice; she was trying to be a human being.""Much has been made about the use of Pansori to narrate this story. While it would have been possible to tell the story without it, doing so not only highlighted the point about class that the film was trying to make, but also deepened the narrative beyond what could have come across as simply a good versus evil fairytale. That's how the story ends, the singer tells the audience, but who knows what happens next? That question isn't rhetorical; it's something we have to ask ourselves any time something has forced us to think.Recommended for fans of Korean history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWGDP7R03422E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00005NX23#wasThisHelpful","RWGDP7R03422E","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After managing to injure myself with Pilates, yoga, heavy weights and just walking around (thank you, weak ankles!), I needed a workout that would allow me to work my upper body without bearing weight on it and help me strengthen and stretch. After spending a couple of weeks moping, I remembered Classical Stretch and Essentrics and ordered this DVD. Just what the doctor ordered. Please note, then, that this isn't one of their more vigorous workouts.The ""trademark exercises"" Esmonde-White uses in the beginning open up the back and sides nicely. (Unlike many other systems, they focus on opening up the upper body before the lower body.) It also helps strengthen postural muscles and work the abs/waist. Please note: you won't wake up the next morning with the same kind of soreness in your rectus abdominis you'd feel if you did a lot of crunches, but over time you will feel this, particularly as it opens up and strengthens your sides, which helps you stand taller. The arm work in the standing session is a little less intense than their other releases, but that's not a complaint! And while these exercises (pulling your arms away from your torso and moving them with flexed wrists) are tough, they get easier with each session (although your medial delts will still burn).The floorwork focuses on the legs. As with the arms, the key to performing the exercises is pulling the limb away from the torso and moving from that position (this is pretty much the key to the eccentric/""essentric"" focus of the system; others might refer to it as ""working in length""). Because the same muscle is stretched and strengthened at the same time, your range is going to be limited. Also, you're not going to want to (or have to) perform the same number of repetitions as you do in other systems. As difficult as the side lying work is for the outer hips/thighs, I found the much shorter seated session for the quads literally breathtaking. However, the stretch that follows releases the lower body and starts getting into the upper back.The next standing session is barre work. As the cover says, they have been doing barre work since their inception, which precedes the explosion of interest in the Lotte Berke/Bar Method/Core Fusion/etc-style. While those methods focus on smaller movements and lots of repetitions, these movements feature a slightly greater range of motion and fewer repetitions. As Esmonde-White says, the workout is intended to be sustainable, and a lot of repetitions, particularly of rear leglifts, can irritate the lower back. The barre stretch (and her barre is a chair) is very thorough but you'll probably feel it most through the psoas and hamstrings. I not only gasped through this section, I broke a sweat.Unfortunately, I have to steal time to workout, and being able to do 60 minutes at once is a luxury. I really appreciate the premixes, which not only list the amount of time for each but also list the focus of the mini-workouts.Highly recommended for time-crunched people in need of a balanced workout.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U3U3M2MPJFF5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FQ7KQPG#wasThisHelpful","R3U3U3M2MPJFF5","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In From The Cold is the story of how a young woman rebuilds her life after leaving an abusive marriage.As other reviewers have noted, what makes this story so chilling is that the abuse Tess endures is so banal: while there are some episodes of humiliating physical contact, the majority of the abuse Tess' husband Mark inflicts is psychological; his constant belittling of her has made her doubt her ability to make decisions for herself. Fortunately, Tess has some sense of self left, and when her husband unapologetically violates her privacy, she starts to realize that he is the problem, not her.Many women in abusive relationships report isolation that perpetuates itself as the abuse continues. Tess is connected to a religious community, but the values of her church reinforce her husband's belief that he should be in charge of her very soul. To make matters worse, he has told not only fellow churchgoers but also her family that Tess is mentally unstable. In the end, Tess has no choice but to make plans to flee. And then the story really starts.The story is ultimately about a woman who learns to love and trust herself after spending a lifetime being told that she was essentially worthless. I was moved by the realism of the young woman's situation, and anyone who has ever dealt with a manipulative person will applaud Robbins for so accurately portraying what those interactions feel like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ABXGKRMJ2DT0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FO6Q6DK#wasThisHelpful","R1ABXGKRMJ2DT0","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And The City Swallowed Them tells the true story of the murder of young Canadian model Diana O'Brien in Shanghai and the convicton of her confessed killer. At the end of the piece you will still have lingering questions about Who Dunnit and why- and that's just what Hvistendahl wants.It's all too easy to believe the confession from Chen Jun, the young man who, like many Chinese migrants, was disaffected, out of luck and looking for a way home. Understanding that the confessed killer grew up without either of his parents and almost no female influences after his family was effectively cheated out of a land exchange adds more weight to the credibility of his confession. Indeed, the man himself does a pretty convincing job of selling it, and the story the police put together and meticulously present to the murdered woman's parents fits. But...In a city that seems to be reinventing itself daily and in which human beings are commodities, there's something unsettling about the people on both sides of the Pacific who brought the victim from China to Canada. The Canadian agent who sent twenty-two year old Diana to Canada and instructed her to falsify her visa request appears remorseless, and there's no shortage of people to tell similar tales of malfeasance about her. But at least she's around; her Chinese counterpart disappears shortly after perfunctory questioning, and to this day there's not a trace of her. And given some of the harrowing tales that the other models tell of working in Shanghai- not getting paid is the least of their worries- it's almost too convenient that a random stranger would have gotten to her first. (One firm conclusion: modeling sounds a lot more like human trafficking these days than the glamorous profession it's been made out to be.) Yet, as the author points out, in a city filled with lonely inter- and intranational migrants, violent crime is much more likely to take place between strangers than friends and family.Did either of these people get justice? We might never know- but we can try to do better for those who come after them.Recommended for fans of long form journalism.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHPDNA8Y5E54J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWHZ4LQ#wasThisHelpful","RHPDNA8Y5E54J","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

We know from the rest of the series that everyone is holding their cards close to their vest and almost nothing is as it seems, but who knew that Lenka was keeping the biggest secrets of all?It's not giving anything away to say that this isn't Lenka's first go round as the son of Hermes, but why he's bound up to a mortal existence is something that tweaked my myth-loving heart. (Might we see a story for Hermes soon?) But from the beginning, this hero was more than your average demigod; he was a key member of one of the most famous adventures in Greek mythology. I loved Jones's retelling of this famous tale, even if it was a little different than the classic version.But Lenka's story is of Mythos, and Mythos is all about the Olympian gods. Our favorite Olympian Apollo isn't content to screw around with his own children's lives; Lenka is integral to his plans and he has just the leverage to make Lenka do his bidding. But does even Apollo know the truth about Lenka's dream? And if he does, is that part of his plan, or something he needs to skirt around?Those aren't even the only questions, but the biggest one is posed by Lenka himself: can he do the right thing even if it means he'll continue to be condemned? Just one problem: does he know for sure what the right thing is?There's a whole lot more going on here, but that's all I can say without giving the plot away. Suffice to say I can't wait until the next installment of the series...even if it leads to yet more unanswered questions.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CLYRM45GO0SI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MSVF2Y8#wasThisHelpful","R1CLYRM45GO0SI","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is better seen as three parts of the same story told from different angles rather than standalone novellas. Of the three, only the second is truly self-contained; it provides useful information that informs the other two but doesn't need them to tell it's story. Please keep that in mind as you read; I was very frustrated by the ending of the first book but satisfied by the end.Poor Ellie Brooke perhaps wasn't surprised to feel herself pulled into a world haunted by death from the very first page of the story, but that she felt herself literally haunted was the surprise. Why had the seeming bon vivant Laurent summon her all the way from England to restore his garden in modern-day Porquerolles, and why did his mother regard her with such antipathy from the first? It's not hard to figure out what happened to Ellie and what-or who-is going to follow us into the next story, but the question is why.The second novel follows blind Marthe Lincel as she bravely works to use her gifts mixing scents for the kindly Mussets into something useful for the French Resistance. She is blessed with bravery and integrity; her weaknesses are, as for everyone else, other people: whom can she trust, and how can she protect those she cares for without harming others. Worse, how can she go on after a painful loss? Of all three stories, this was the one that moved me the most.The final story follows Iris Nightingale from the 1940s to the present day, and here all the strands come together. Iris works for British Intelligence, helping the French Resistance coordinate intelligence with the larger effort. Pragmatic and competent despite her young age, she nevertheless finds herself swept up into a romance with a head-on is it reckless?- French agent. Tracking down what became of him and her later resignation that she'll never know us just one of the meanings behind the title ""The Shadow Life"". Iris will eventually get her answers, but is the cost worth the truth?This spooky tale of romantic suspense had a slow build that made the ending more satisfying even if many of the connections were easy to spot. I would recommend this to fans of historical romance as well as paranormal suspense.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TG8OD76VTOOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJ37AP6#wasThisHelpful","R1TG8OD76VTOOF","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copy in exchange for an honest review.In Mystical High, the first book of The Desert Series, the town of Mystekal was in decay. As if to underscore how much, multiple people reported ghost sitings. But they quickly found out that the living could be much more frightening than the dead, and the death of the Ernest Carrow, the murderous high school principal who also owned much of the town, allowed the residents to start rebuilding their lives and rebuilding Mystekal.Arielle Dalworth, newly returned to Mystekal (and remarried to her husband after an ill-conceived tryst with a slimeball Hollywood producer) is charged with reviving the once grand theater. As she's making arrangements, her hilariously brilliant son River meets Larsen ""Lars"" Davis, a talented young man who dreams of a career as an actor but whose life is made hellish by the bullying he suffers over his sexuality- both in school and at home. River may be quirky, but he's also brave, and there's no way he's going to watch someone suffer like that. But there are limits to what a good friend can do, especially when most of your trouble is at home. Lars is going to need a guardian angel to help get him out of his miserable situation...and one happens to be working in his school cafeteria. But what is haunting gentle, kind Kathryn, and why does it hurt her so much to see him bullied? There's a lot to unravel and unpack, and some of it is going to include a shocking revelation that will help explain some of the past. But is that going to be enough to prevent another disaster just as the town is coming back to life?From page one, the reader knows this story is going to be about bullying. As hard as it is to read about someone being bullied in school, it's even harder to read about someone being bullied at home. Your heart will break as you read how sweet and thoughtful Lars suffers through his mother's insults (and those of the people she brings home). However, seeing the Dalworths, especially River and Arielle, reach out inspires hope that Lars' situation will improve.One of the things I love about Brodey's writing is that she shows the shades of all of her characters, whether they're ""good"" or ""bad"". Some of the characters do stupid things, but she gives all of them the capacity to dig deep and understand why so that both they and the readers understand. Still, as someone points out, it takes a lot more than logical understanding to prevent your insecurities from being your own worst enemies, and sometimes that process takes time. Arguably, one of the questions lingering over the series is whether people have enough time to ""grow up"" before they do something they'll regret.The shocking revelation in this book helps shed some light on some of what happened in the first book. (Hint: if you liked Book Two and Six of the Harry Potter series, you'll definitely get a kick out of this one.) But ultimately, tragedy is a circumstance, and people still make choices. Brodey explains some of her characters' actions more deeply, but she doesn't excuse them.I found myself tearing up at the end when we finally get to meet the ""desert star"", and I'm pretty sure other readers will too.

"In 1982, Michele Balistreri is an angry young police captain who holds bureaucracy, religion and politics in almost as much contempt as he holds himself. Good thing there's plenty of partying, alcohol and willing women to quiet his demons. However, when he mishandles the disappearance and murder of a beautiful young woman he'd had designs on, his life is changed forever. By 2005, he's living on anti-depressants, decaf coffee and rations out both his cigarettes and alcohol (and sex isn't something he wants to allow himself any longer either). He's a walking attempt at penitence with nothing to believe in. A slew of murdered young women gives him the will to do more than exist, but when the murders become too reminiscent of his earlier professional and moral failure, he has to ask himself how much the truth is worth.The Italy of 1982 is decadent, and you can feel how someone young and with something to prove would find that Italy, with its easy beauty and luxury, frustrating. It was however, filled with promise, even if Balistreri can't recognize it. The Italy of 2006 is just as corrupt but now it's stagnant. If Italy was fighting for its soul in 1982, by 2006 its fights are about power and the big ones are orchestrated. The Italy portrayed here is is decaying from the inside out, and now the foreign faces that fill it aren't tourists but the immigrants it both depends on and scorns. This novel is as much an examination of Italy and the people in it vying for power as it is a mystery/thriller.I figured out the villain (or is it villains?) and the dominant motivations pretty quickly, but those were the easy questions to answer. How it was done and everyone who was involved- and why- were the bigger mysteries, and watching Balistreri and his team unwind the puzzle was engrossing. Before I was halfway through I was unable to put it down and spent the better part of a day finishing it.Recommended for fans of international mysteries and thrillers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TQN331REUDQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=162365002X#wasThisHelpful","R3TQN331REUDQD","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I found this book difficult to get into; the author's style immediately gives away how personally attached she is to her subject matter, and some of her enthusiasm and effusiveness was jarring. However, once I hunkered down, I could understand her fascination. Most of the women she wrote about did lead fascinating careers and were, if not all revolutionary, definitely trailblazers.It shows how quickly things turn that while we are immersed in an almost survivalist ""back to nature"" phase in cooking and home decor, people aren't talking about the contributions of Patience Gray, who literally lived what she preached about the snout-to-tail philosophy from the 1960s onward. It's equally surprising that as we ""look forward"" to the post-apocalyptic world (of climate change) we don't reflect more on what architect Alison Smithson had to say about her period's visions of what the world would look like after The Bomb. The more things change...It is, perhaps, less surprising that we don't reflect on the genius that Muriel and Betty Box brought to the silver screen, in large part because the work they produced wasn't genius- just very successful at a time when women were not expected to know how to shape anything other than ""women's"" stories for women. And while there were representatives from ""women's"" fields here (Nancy Spain, the journalist who was assigned the women's page; Margery Fish, the garden writer; and Gray), the stories I found most engrossing were of Jacquetta Hawkes, the archaeologist and Rose Heilbron, the barrister and later judge. Honestly, I dreaded going into those chapters, but rather than being dry they painted a picture not only of the women who forged ahead in spite of opposition but also the fascinating times and societies they traveled in. (Heilbron's story was my favorite; it made me smile to think of a prim, educated woman calmly putting some of the organized crime members she defended firmly in their place.) Some of my enjoyment might also stem from the fact that Cooke's style is more serious and calmer in these chapters; I got the sense throughout that she was mimicking the writing style of each of her subjects.It's a worthy read for anyone interested in the history of Feminism and British History. However, twenty years after reading Susan Faludi's Backlash, I have to say that it's depressing that it would be such a surprise that women in the Fifties worked outside the home as much as they did or that they enjoyed the measure of success and influence that they did, prejudiced laws notwithstanding. Hopefully this will be a good reminder that the reason the Fifties media pushed the idea of the ideal housewife so hard was because women like this were putting the lie to it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKVXX37WHBWEM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062333860#wasThisHelpful","RKVXX37WHBWEM","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As much as this is the story of the 19th century Korean artist ""Ohwon"" (Jang Seung-ub), it is also the story of Korea's last years as an independent country. (Korea lost its independence in 1905 and did not regain it until the end of World War II.)As others have broken down, Jang Seung-ub was born a peasant. His life is saved as a young boy by a nobleman when he is being beaten by another peasant, but the nobleman can do only so much for him; his wife admonishes him to send the boy away...because they can't afford to feed him. Several years later, the two meet up again, and the nobleman arranges for him to be sent to gain artistic instruction from a respected master. This is the first time Jang will run into the confinements not only of the system of the arts but also most of Korea at that time: talent is not as valuable as connections.In fits and starts, the Korean establishment (as represented by a group of fellow artists who comment on his works throughout the film) comes to respect Jang's genius, but each snub pushes him further into his vices: drinking, disrespecting women and refusing to work. His most stable relationship is with a courtesan he rents a house with, but the woman who haunts him is the noble younger sister of the man who saved him. She, however, is untouchable, not only because of the class difference, but because of a congenital illness. It's fair to say that she was his idea of perfection, and when she dies he's plunged into another depression. When, years later, he meets a courtesan who looks exactly like her, he's quickly disillusioned to find that she's as coarse as the rest of her class.The woman he does truly love, the courtesan Mae-Hyang, is separated from him by religious persecution: she's Catholic, and after they meet Catholics are purged and persecuted. It's only toward the end of the story, when Korea is in such a state of decline that religious persecution is low on their list of priorities, that the two can meet again without fear. However, so much damage has been done to both Jang and Korea that any thought of permanence is doomed.As Jang's reputation spreads and Korea's politics decay, he (and Korean art in general) become more and more the solace for the Korean psyche. This is particularly painful to Jang when he is struggling to find his own vision and not simply copy old masters. For anyone who knows the history of this period, it's impossible not to hear an indictment of the intellectual culture of Korea, which rewarded mastery of Chinese Classics and considered any deviation from it heresy.Throughout the film, China and Japan struggle for dominance over Korea; we see this through not only the soldiers stomping through the scenes but also the people vying to own some of Jang's art. This is a reflection of the Korean nobility's struggle of ideas between a Reformist and Conservative vision, and to what extent foreign influence should be allowed. It becomes clear that the only thing authentically Korean is the voice of the artist- but an artist is as influenced by his times as anyone else.Highly recommended for those interested in Korean history and art.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7XC9DH5KFZK5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001611C4#wasThisHelpful","R7XC9DH5KFZK5","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a review copy in exchange for an honest review.Casey is in her early thirties, holed up in the mountains of New York State while she licks her wounds from the break up of her longtime relationship with Nick. Even in her sleepy campsite she can't help but hear about his debut novel and how it's taking the literary world by storm. She's closer to reconnecting with the self she lost in her twenties while she was nurturing his dreams, but that doesn't make his thanks to his new girlfriend any less stinging.In walks Ben, a camper in his late twenties that Casey knows she can't have but that she can't stop thinking about anyway. And who could? He's tall, dark-haired, handsome, kind, a great cook- and really into Casey. She soon realizes that she doesn't want to say no to a future with him, but what about his dreams?And really, what about hers? What I found most thought-provoking in this book was the implied question of whether dreams change. The younger Casey wanted to be a painter but shelved that ambition and replaced it with a more practical degree in Art History. So when she gets an unexpected opportunity to have a long-buried fantasy satisfied, why does she hesitate? Is she unworthy of the dream- or is the dream unworthy of her? And how many of her desires invite the same question?There are several graphic sex scenes in this novel, but everything goes toward the development of the relationship between Casey and Ben. The novel is very sensual even before the two meet: as I was reading, I felt myself transported to the lake, mountains, cabin and campsites. Brooks does an excellent describing not only the way a setting looks but how it feels. And not just settings: even though I'm an avowed tea drinker, I found myself craving a cup of very hot French-pressed coffee with a splash of cream, accompanied by an almond croissant with powdered sugar on top. Really, everything that Brooks described was mouthwatering- and not just the food.This was an enjoyable, quick but not-too-quick read. I would happily read more from Brooks (but I really hope she incorporates more food in future works).","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJMJ5UV2G2YJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M0L232U#wasThisHelpful","RYJMJ5UV2G2YJ","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Matcha tea lattes fit that bill perfectly, but they get to be ridiculously expensive if you buy them in cafes.Kazu's matcha tea mixes very well (as with most such powders, it's better diluted with a little warm water first) and one and a half teaspoons is perfectly complemented by a half teaspoon of sugar.

"Rosie ""Aunty"" Lee is a wealthy widow who keeps herself occupied by running a catering business. Even indulging her lifelong love of cooking isn't enough to keep her out of trouble- although when someone is killed at one of the function she's catering, it's hard to blame her.The pat answer for why Mabel Sung and her sickly son Leonard ended up dead is murder-suicide, but Aunty Lee isn't having any of that. Too bad, because the next easiest answer is that one of her specialties poisoned him, and she knows that isn't true either. And what does this have to do with the young Chinese national who just committed suicide, the boyfriend who is presumed dead and the house that Mabel Sung constructed shortly before her death?It always strikes me as odd that the word ""cozy"" is applied to something that involves murder; doubly odd here that it will also apply to one of the darkest forms of human trafficking. You might find yourself giggling at some of Aunty Lee's (contrived) outbursts, but you'll also find yourself genuinely disturbed by what you read.Aunty Lee is not a perfect detective, and that's part of her charm. The story doesn't suffer from an overuse of red herrings, but Aunty Lee's ability to read people works only up to a point. However, her instinct that something doesn't quite fit and her determination to fully understand something more than makes up for it. So, too, does the fact that she's ultimately a good judge of characters, and even the most irritating of the people she keeps around end up having more to them than might be evident at first.Highly recommended for fans of mysteries- and food.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9V3CEKZXE71Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062338323#wasThisHelpful","R9V3CEKZXE71Z","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was not predictable, but that was due in part to the number of red herrings and detours thrown into the story. Even the big angle hinted at on the cover and in the promo materials is meant to throw you off. There's a point at which that can come off as clever, but at 407 pages, it's more irritating that anything else.Mongo the hit man thinks he's very smart, good looking and suave. He may very well be one of the smartest people he's ever met- and that only highlights that he needed to get out more. He doesn't read as a sociopath as much as he does a sophomoric loser who's gotten lucky enough times that he now believes his own PR. Detective Jeb Barker has a lower estimation of himself, but that doesn't keep him from underestimating the importance of politics and optics, especially when you're dealing with a high profile case like the murder of a Hollywood starlet. Both of them are going to trip themselves up, but one of them is going to do a better (or worse) job of it.Mysteries have a certain rhythm to them, and cops and detectives should be approaching their cases in a no-nonsense way if it's going to come off as at all believable. This does that. However, even within those parameters, this comes off as stilted, and without too many dialogue tags it's difficult to tell who's speaking at times. And some of the language just doesn't work in some places and made me think that I was reading something that might be better set in the Fifties than in the 21st century. (What guy describes two topless women as ""terrific broads"" in this day and age?) The expository dialogue also got to be a little bit much, and given that much of it was part of the red herrings, annoying.Finally, the loose ends, as someone mentioned, are frustrating, particularly the lack of explanation for a very important ""tip"" that came through early on.Not the worst mystery I've ever read, but definitely one that could have been tightened up more.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RNBAAY8ZMYCY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480485802#wasThisHelpful","R1RNBAAY8ZMYCY","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you think you're going to read a book like this and come away with a better understanding of any candidate's policy on anything, you're mistaken. This is all political calculation with a big dose of gossip and some armchair psychoanalysis. Once you accept that, you can enjoy the ride.This book lacks the fun factor of Game Change in part because the 2012 campaign wasn't nearly as much of a circus as the 2008 one. The Republican field was filled with unstable lunatics (calling the candidacy for Romney early on was easy) but, obviously, the Democrat's nominee was known from the get-go. And while the Obamans may have been as dysfunctional as any political operation, that's just not the same thing as John Edwards trying to get past his own mistakes and Hillary Clinton trying to overcome her reputation (and establishment sexism). On the GOP side, while Bachmann,Gingrich, Cain and Perry provided plenty of amusing and cringe-worthy episodes, they were never nearly as important as the star of 2008's GOP debacle, Sarah Palin. Oddly, there was almost nothing about Ron Paul, arguably the wackiest of all of the candidates.People who watched the Republican presidential field closely might be surprised by how many, well, sane and sagacious characters there were: Haley Barbour, Mitch Daniels and Jeb Bush most prominent among them. All of them had reasons to stay out of the race and away from the national stage, but they saw pretty clearly on that Mitt was a weak candidate who would create a vacuum that would invite a freak show.The candidate that many thought had the best chance: Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey. Although he flirted with the idea for a few weeks, ultimately he decided that his bona fides weren't strong enough. Once he made his decision to stay out, putting his clout behind Mitt was the obvious choice. While many thought he would make a strong candidate for VP, the vetting process dashed that notion pretty decisively. Suggestion: don't bet on Christie in 2016 (even if he clears BridgeGate). Who else will you probably not see again? Jon Huntsman, the ostensibly reasonable and moderate candidate who turned out to be not nearly as wealthy or principled as his public image led observers to believe.The story presented here is that Romney lost because he refused to apologize even when he knew he had made a mistake and because he was so desperate to keep the conservative base that he wouldn't take on obviously offensive positions that he didn't agree with (e.g., Rush Limbaugh's insults to Sandra Fluke). While I agree that these were mistakes, I think it's odd that they didn't speak to the other obvious observation about the Romney candidacy: he lied and frequently, and his statements such as the infamous 47 Percent remark highlighted the electorate's worst fears that he was a plutocrat who didn't understand middle- or lower-economic-classes. (His team's explanations for why they lost only seemed to confirm those fears.)Is that a lot of Romney? Yes- and perhaps it's even clearer why the book lacked the fun factor of Game Change.Recommended for political news junkies who aren't interested in policy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KEI4OCKDFNS0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204403#wasThisHelpful","R2KEI4OCKDFNS0","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I might not have been the best person to read this; a family member of mine was stationed in Mali during the coup- for the Peace Corps. Obviously, I'd been following the developments pretty closely, and I had a good source to check in with after I read this book. So I can confidently report that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb was not a feint and no one was kidnapped from the Peace Corps in Mali. And while there was some corruption, a drug ring leading to Al Qaeda is highly unlikely. What I'm more likely to find plausible are the tales of inter-departmental infighting in the US, and that the person trying to control everything would be a fish-out-of-water academic works too. (The wink in the last chapter about just who might be running back channel operations is maybe a little much, but this is fiction and that was fun.)My bigger gripes are about the writing style, some of which I found plodding and overly declarative, and at times I had trouble telling who was speaking. For whatever reason, that was more of a problem in the task force and departmental meetings; outsiders- and particularly the Malians- were more enjoyable to follow. In spite of the awkwardness, the author was able to convey the personalities of the characters and I could easily imagine the scenes.All in all, recommended with some reservations for fans of political thrillers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DYH678C87V6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399168605#wasThisHelpful","R1DYH678C87V6N","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Semya Slotin is brilliant, loyal and brave (or is it reckless?). Hyper-competent and self-sufficient, she'd get through life just fine with her best friend/partner-in-crime Polliannah Koch. But she doesn't have to; the perfect man for her is out there, and his name is Vincent Mallory Edgerton.Vincent is also smart, loyal and brave, but just as cocky (being born into a loving, uber-privileged family can do that to a guy). But his family does try to give back, hence the creation of FREGG, a secret crime fighting organization that doesn't answer to any government but occasionally gets tapped on the shoulder by one. Vincent is the second generation and one of their best assets...so it takes something as serious as an attempted hit on him to make his superiors (including his father) put him on a deep undercover assignment. Vincent is pretty sure the next two years are going to be hell- until tying up some loose ends puts him directly into a beautiful detective's path. Just one problem: the gorgeous woman who's seemingly made for him is related to the people who put the hit on him. Make that two problems: she doesn't know. One more: he can't tell her.Think I just gave away the plot of the book? That's just the sideshow; the real work is tracking down a missing person, and that investigation quickly reveals something much more nefarious. Good thing Vincent is so experienced...so how come Semya keeps getting the scoop first?I loved this; fast-paced, international reach, and a case that had personal meaning for the detectives (and an issue that's shockingly prevalent across the world). Semya shows real vulnerability for the first time in this series; she's earned the right. (But even at her most vulnerable, she still manages to do some damage...) But I still have questions: Why is Semya's adoptive mother sniping at Vincent's father, and why did Semya's biological mother go to him before Semya was born? How come her biological father was never told about her? What isn't Vincent's father telling us? Finally, where is Vincent now? I am waiting impatiently for the next book to answer those questions!Recommended for lovers of mystery and romantic suspense","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10KR860R8M3VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LS7M0L6#wasThisHelpful","R10KR860R8M3VV","A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3KV4RQE2FVIZ0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This book follows Dr. KittyCat, a veterinarian, as she tends to assorted patients with the assistance of her helper, Peanut, the mouse. The focus is a puppy that has injured her leg. The artwork features black and white photographs of real animals accented by ink illustrations and details. It is hard to resist the photos of baby animals but the ink accents the fact they are black and white.

"To paraphrase Ronald Reagan, when it comes to dog food, don't trust and be sure to verify. While my brother is recovering from surgery I am caring for his dogs. Both have packed on the pounds and could afford to lose some weight. to that end, I thought this food might be a tasty solution. The copy indicated that chicken was the first ingredient. It is not. Corn is. And while no doubt tasty and filling, it provides minimal nutritional value. Chicken is the third ingredient. That being said the low odor kibble is just under 3/4 of an inch and is easy for both the  ninety pound shepherd and the seventy pound chow to handle. They seemed to like it although they didn't dive into it with the same gusto they do with Fromm's or Merrick's.I have yet to observe any negative side effects from their consumption. It is still to early to tell what if any impact it will have on their weight.While the thrity pound bag is convenient for multi-dog households, unlike the easy open bags I've come to expect with premium foods, this one is pasted shut.Good nutrition is key to good health.

There are no exotic ingredients. Both the nutritional information and the amount of time needed, hands on and total needed, are provided.But lo-cal  may not necessarily translate into healthy. I was a bit surprised by her vigorous defense of Cool Whip Lite as an ingredient. Yes it cuts calories and fat content and is addictively sweet and creamy. but it also contains high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil  along with artificial flavoring xanthan and guar gums, pollysorbate 60, sorbitan monsterate and sodium polyphoshates. It is not used in all the recipes but a number including some pies, cheesecakes and eclair filling.  Not saying that it will kill you but I would rather a smaller serving with natural ingredients than a chemically induced dessert, no matter how delicious.That being said, this is an attractive book that delivers great flavor without breaking the calorie bank.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32GD74J634D2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0848744519#wasThisHelpful","R32GD74J634D2M","A2OCDK0BOW6UCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OCDK0BOW6UCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although you may be tempted to give these the brush off after encountering the rather pungent PU odor, give them a chance. I found the odor dissipated quickly after opening and shampooing the brushes. The range of ten brushes is good, you will have one that will work for just about every make up need. the brushes are attractive with a kabuki style. The handles are wood in an aluminum tube. One of mine was slightly bent but it did not affect usage. The brushes themselves are quite soft and I observed no shedding.

"When a Mormon leader is found murder, shocking secrets are revealed. these secrets challenge the judgmental and unforgiving perceptions of the insular Mormon community and sends busybody housefrau Linda bumbling into the police investigation. Linda, of course, has many issues of her own. Married to the long suffering and indulgent Kurt, she is suffering her first tastes of empty nest syndrome. Nosy and gossipy, she uses her position to snoop. But not all trespasses are forgiven and some are life threatening.I did not care for this book. The writing is sophomoric and the chattiness detracts from the little suspense. Linda is one of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered. She lives a fifties lifestyle while espousing progressive positions that  wildly diverge from her conservative community's stated values. She , of course, is compassionate and understanding when it comes to gay and transgender issues. What could have been an intelligent examination of how religious institutions grapple with changing social mores seemed more like a cheap attempt to exploit hot button issues. I am not a Mormon and cannot speak to either their theology or practices. However, the reactionary, paternalistic, judgmental group here only begs the question why anyhone wold would voluntarily stay in such a church. To the author's credit, there were a few twists among all the descriptions of what people were eating. but this is not a book I could, in good conscience, recommend.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M81ZQZEIWK8A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616956100#wasThisHelpful","R1M81ZQZEIWK8A","A2OCDK0BOW6UCY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2OCDK0BOW6UCY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a convenient set for travel. It includes an eye mask, ear plugs and an inflatable pillow. the mask and the pillow are made of a thin, somewhat coarse velveteen material.Both had a strong plastic odor. I found that hand washing with Woolite and a few drops of fabric softener eliminated the odor and softened the fabric. (Dry flat. These items should not be machine washed or dried, ironed or bleached.) The mask is thin with no recesses for the eyes. However, it was comfortable and blocked the light. It has an elastic band which does stretch however if you have a large head or very big hair, it may be too snug. The pillow inflated without issue and was surprisingly comfortable. I though t it looked small but it curved around my neck providing comfort and support. The ear plugs are the standard orange, relatively soft and smooth. They do dull outside noise.This is not a bad set for the price. I would have preferred more padding in the mask and softer material.

Featuring 10 dual sided wall panels, four wooden pets, Anna and Ethan character figures and forty accessories, this toy provides plenty of options. The panels and accessories attach magnetically. I found the purpose driven story line about taking photos to help shelter pets find homes worthwhile. It never hurts to let children know that there are options for even hopeless or sad situations and even kids can contribute. The parts seem sturdy.

"Before seeing this product, I was unaware a counter top ice maker was even a thing!  I am so glad that I know now!  Our refrigerator water system stopped working and the fridge is out of warranty so we were looking at a pretty hefty repair charge.  This is the answer!!  It fits perfectly on the counter and it is super easy to operate.  It comes with an instruction booklet that is easy to understand.  You can choose between 3 sizes of cubes, small, medium, and large.  It can be programmed to make ice when you want as well.  I filled the water tank with just under a gallon of water.  I chose the small size cubes to see how quickly it actually worked.  I am happy to say within 15 minutes, I had my first ice!  This is truly an amazing product.  Within 2 hours, the entire ice basket was filled.  My husband and I both used ice in our sodas, and the machine automatically produced more ice!  It has an alert been to notify you when you need to add more water.  The machine also includes a cute little ice scooper!

"This is pretty amazing product! I never really thought about cleansing my skin with anything other than a washcloth. But this device actually does a better job than I ever could. It uses two AA batteries which are not included. And it comes with multiple brush heads that you can switch out depending what you want to do. It has a brush for poor cleansing, a buffer for gentle exfoliation, and a body brush for all over cleansing, plus many more. It is gentle yet very effective, and I feel like my skin has never felt cleaner. I use it daily, in the evening before bed and my skin feels so fresh and healthy when I go to bed it's amazing!I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GMRNVO9CYO1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NUKBE2U#wasThisHelpful","R1GMRNVO9CYO1I","AANG4NITPGM9A","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AANG4NITPGM9A?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:19 MinsThis is an awesome product, perfect for any child that lives for shopkins! The case can be folded together and Velcro'ed shut for easy carrying.The case has six zippered compartments that are divided into three sections, each section is a different size so multiple shopkins can be stored in each area. There is also a larger top compartment also was a zipper that you can store some of the larger items. It comes with a hook but we chose not to use it. It's easy to just fold up and Velcro shut and put in a backpack or on the desk. This case is very well made. It is constructed very well and the zippers are attached sturdily so there is no chance they will tear while being used. Each compartment has a clear plastic window so it is easy for your child to look in and see just what shopkins she wants instead of having to dig through a bunch that are all over the house.

"For quite some time I have taken Garcinia supplements to help in my weight loss. But I'm really not a fan of swallowing pills. I was so happy to find this Garcinia liquid with green coffee bean extract. The dosage is easy, it is 1 mL, approximately 20 drops, twice a day. You can mix it in juice or water, but I just straight into my mouth. It tastes very nice and is easy to take that way. Because it's a liquid, your body absorbs it faster than it would capsules so that is another huge plus.

There are metal connectors on the ends of the ropes however, you may need to add other hardware depending on where you plan to hang the swing.

"My doctor has started seeing a rise in my blood pressure and told me I need to do something about it. I decided to try these pills instead of the ones she offered to prescribe to see if they would work. I have been taking them for just over a week, and while the change in my blood pressure is not huge, there is a change. It is looking a little bit more normal than it had been and I have high hopes that it will keep improving. I will come back and update this review in a couple of weeks with my writings. The pills are easy to take, easy to swallow, and the recommended dosage is 1 to 3 pills a day.

"""God's Kingdom"" is my introduction to the works of Howard Frank Mosher. I found the collection of short stories about the same family in the North East Kingdom of Vermont very well-written and for the most part entertaining and thoughtful by turns. In many ways the collection reminded me of a great favourite, ""Olive Kitteridge,"" but the latter was more engaging as I felt a connection to the often unlikeable Olive that I did not experience with Mosher' s Jim Kinneson. With the exception of the first story, ""Blooded,"" Jim just did not come to life for me again until the final story, ""God's Kingdom"". So often to me he seemed a detached observer in a family of eccentrics. The most vivid characters are the minor ones, with less emphasis on Jim, his father, and even his grandfather, who was so engaging in ""Blooded"". There are many passages dealing with the near mythic character of Pliny Templeton, who was a former slave and connection to the areas abolitionist past. The greatest strength of the collection is the beautifully writing that takes the reader deep into  the heart of nature. It is lyrical writing, a celebration of the natural world, evoking a place that has always been special. The best people are those in awe of nature, the worst are those who fail to feel the magic of place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GDP0S1O06LPE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250069483#wasThisHelpful","R1GDP0S1O06LPE","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"A wonderful assortment of Swiss made milk chocolate arrives in a beautiful presentation box suitable for gift giving without additional wrapping. There is a small booklet attached to the ribbon on the box that has a picture of the individual chocolates with a brief description of the filling. I sampled one of the hazelnut filled pieces and it was creamy with a nice strong nutty flavor. One of the caramel filled pieces was equally creamy but the caramel flavor was more subtle. The pieces are small, in that you can eat a chocolate in one or two bites. Here in America we are more accustomed to larger pieces, but this assortment might be a good choice for those who love chocolate but need to limit the amount they eat.

"I have been a fan of football since high school when my family gathered in front of the television every Saturday to watch Notre Dame play. Later, I became a fan of professional football, and, as has been the case with many, slowly started to come to the realization that many retired players were starting to age mentally much faster than men in the general population who had never played the sport. As a fan of the game, at first I did not know what to believe, as the NFL had doctors who claimed that the alarming reports coming from researchers outside the football community regarding concussions were untrue.A few years ago, I watched a PBS report on the program ""Frontline"" that went a long way toward making me a believer that concussions were the cause of the horrific mental problems experienced by former NFL players. It was my introduction to Bennett Omalu, the pathologist who made the breakthrough discoveries that struck fear into the hearts of two NFL commissioners and others at the highest levels of the game. Doctor Omalu' s findings on the physical signs of repeated brain trauma began when he studied the brain of former Steeler player Mike Webster, who had died of a heart attack after several years of exhibiting bizarre and often violent behaviour. The brains of other dead NFL players exhibited the same findings, and the conclusion was that these injuries were the result of repeated concussions the players had experienced in their professional careers.""Concussion"" is in some ways a memoir of Dr Omalu, his childhood and youth in Nigeria, Africa, and his education and career in America, working in the office of the Pittsburgh Medical Examiner. If your interest in the subject of concussions and the NFL is your primary reason for reading the book, you might find yourself skimming the details of the doctor's life. But I think that would be a mistake, as those parts are interesting on their own, but also because they illustrate or of the reasons many had difficulty accepting Omalu' s findings -- a built in racial or cultural bias against an outsider who could be frankly annoying in his defense of his findings. It took the doctor quite a bit of time to understand the place of football in American culture and to grasp the fact that the NFL was not going to embrace his discovery.The author does an excellent job of relating the various points if view regarding this important topic...how the NFL came to be seen in a similar light to Big Tobacco in its denial of medical evidence; how Omalu' s lack of understanding of American culture and his race made him less credible to many even though he possessed multiple college degrees; and the tragic stories of ruined players told by their survivors. I highly recommend this book for those interested in this subject and how the persistence of a few dedicated researchers helped current and future generations of players fight the powerful NFL. I was less interested in the story of the fall of Omalu' s mentor at the M.E.'s office and I also felt that the doctor himself came off as a much more sympathetic character in the ""Frontline"" program than he does at times in the book. But, I certainly understand his frustration and his bewilderment over being rejected many times for reasons that had nothin to do with his expertise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EYVZXXOV4U1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812987578#wasThisHelpful","R3EYVZXXOV4U1V","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This utterly delightful Christmas cup by Lenox is going to be my special little mug for hot chocolate or tea during the holidays. No, I don't know if the whimsical little pocket on the front actually has a function, but I am treating it as a decoration. The pocket is low enough on the cup that a left handed person can use it just as easily as a right handed individual --- the pocket does not interfere with drinking out of the cup. My fingers are average and I did not have any trouble slipping them through the handle. Since I do not have a dish washer I cannot comment on care other than to say the cup washed and air dried beautifully in a dish drainer. The companion pieces are available on Amazon, and I think they would make a beautiful Christmas tablescape. The cup arrives in a colourful holiday gift box. While 8 or 12 would make a wonderful present for someone who does quite a bit of entertaining, two would make a nice gift for a couple, or one for an individual. The original review was for a single cup that had a pocket on the side, not for the cups pictured.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39N9JSDDIDUOG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TV5H1B6#wasThisHelpful","R39N9JSDDIDUOG","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"MS Fiorato' s novel provides a backstory to Shakespeare's play ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" giving the reader the beginning of the love match of Beatrice and Benedick. For those who love the play, it is a rare treat. It is also a treat for those of us who are not regular readers of the Bard of Avon. I enjoyed the adventures of the characters, the dialogue was well done (not what I call foresoothy, in that it did not mimic Shakespeare's language, but was pleasant to the ear when I read it out loud), and offers an interesting theory of Shakespeare's ""lost years.""

"This book by paper artist Hannah Viano is absolutely stunning. Ms Viano cuts out her designs from black paper and it appears they are then mounted on colored paper. The cover illustration is a perfect example of her work throughout the book and one of my favorites. All of the designs are taken from nature and the artist does not, for the most part, pick the expected: ""H"" is not horse as one might think, but for herring, and the fish swirl in a circle on the page.Ms Viano dedicates her book to parents who let their children run a little wild, climb trees, and jump in puddles, which was the way I was raised (although they didn't know about the tree climbing) and the way I raised my son as well.

"""Speed Kings"" is really three books in one: a collective biography of the 1932 bobsled team and the world in which they came of age, the 1932 Winter Olympics, and the remainder of the book about World War II. If you are looking for a pure sports book on the Olympics, this book is not the one. It does give a history of the sport of bobsledding, which had its origins in Europe at the turn of the 20th century, and, as others have remarked, about one - third actually deals with the Olympics. I think the main difference between ""Speed Kings"" and another recent sports book, ""The Boys in the Boat,"" is that the latter deals with people that the reader can easily relate to, while the former deals more with playboy types. I found myself doing a great deal of skimming, whilst, I will admit, stopping to read more gossipy entries, such as those on  James Jay O'Brien and his obsession with a now mostly forgotten silent movie star, Mae Murray. I think this book will have appeal for the right audience, but for those who were hoping for a tighter focus on the 1932 Olympics it might be a disappointment.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZKMS12ADPBAZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592409091#wasThisHelpful","RZKMS12ADPBAZ","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Being a woman of a certain age, actually a few years more than a certain age, I know that products such as Vichy Vichy Elixir are not going to give the same results as an invasive cosmetic procedure. But they can give some temporary positive results when applied, such as softer feeling skin and the minimizing the appearance of lines and wrinkles. That is certainly the case with the Elixir, as upon application I noticed that my lines were not as noticeable. The Elixir has a nice feeling on the skin because it is not greasy. I use the dropper to deposit the Elixir on the palm of my hand, then use my fingertips to apply it to my face, forehead, and neck. There is only a faint scent which disappears upon application.

"""Carrying Albert Home"" is a silly book that I struggled to finish.  I have read other books by Homer Hickman, and I was also taken by the cover art, so I kept thinking the book was going to improve as I continued reading. It did not do it for me. I could not stand the character of Hickam' s mother Elsie. Hopefully Elsie was not as distasteful in real life as she is portrayed in this book, or else Homer and his brother would never have been born. I am guessing some artistic license was employed in the author's portrait of his parents and what definitely seems to fit what we now call a dysfunctional family. How much truth there is in this account of returning a gift alligator to Florida is beside the point, as the book falls into the category of picaresque genre literature, which you either like or you don't.

"In the final book of the trilogy of 100 years in the life of the Langdon family the author takes a rather heavy-handed approach to contemporary issues. I found the characters harder to connect to than in the previous novels, and there is not much in the way of levening humour that might have made the book a more enjoyable reading experience. Jane Smiley does have a particular political and social agenda that she is pushing hard in this book, and while I share many of those views, I am not particularly fond of didactic novels.

"This book is a brief but excellent examination of Jewish law from Abraham to the present. Alan Dershowitz is a professor of law at Harvard University and a well-known author of many books, magazine articles, and essays on law and politics. Here he examines the evolution of legal principles beginning with the Hebrew Bible accounts of Abraham and Moses and their ""negotiations"" with God. One of the most interesting chapters of that first section is the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the concept of how many good people had to be present to stop the destruction of the cities. That actually has continued down to the present day with the concept of how many guilty people could  be set free in order to keep one innocent person from being imprisoned or executed. The magic number in examples continues to be ten...""better 10 guilty people go free than one innocent person be convicted."" The author goes on to explain how differences of opinion on this concept would differ from an authoritarian society to a liberal one. The second half of the book looks at some well-known Jewish lawyers, including some who are our contemporaries. The book is written in a very approachable style, and includes extensive notes. I recommend this book for those interested in the law, religion, or both.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QX3FIUFKTLKB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805242937#wasThisHelpful","R2QX3FIUFKTLKB","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is encouraging to know that some famous authors got off to rocky starts with their earliest stories. The several short stories by the teenage Truman Capote that make up this collection are very forgettable, and a couple are in my opinion particularly so, such as the opening story, ""The Parting of the Way,"" with a cliche ending one could see coming from the beginning. It is not that the writing is particularly bad, because it is not, but the subject matter and the predictable conclusions show an immaturity that I remember from the stories I wrote in my youth. And, even for short stories, they seemed rushed and incomplete. The story of the little boy, Teddy, neglected by his parents and denied a dog to assuage his loneliness was the sweetest of the stories, and, while again one knew how it would end, was probably the most satisfying and my personal favourite. I doubt I would read any of these stories again, which is certainly not the case with Capote' s mature works.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R160JE3EHSZ3B1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0812998227#wasThisHelpful","R160JE3EHSZ3B1","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Chaya Deitsch has written a very fascinating account of her early life growing up a Lubavitcher, a member of an Orthodox Jewish sect where she never felt fully comfortable from an early age. Much of her childhood was spent going back and forth between her maternal grandparent' s home in the  Crown Heights section of  New York City and the parental home in Connecticut, where her father's family had their plastics business.In many ways Chaya' s childhood was not much different from many non-Orthodox Jews and non-Jews...she had a television, a stereo, access to whatever books she wanted to read from the public library (just no books on Christmas), went to a co-ed school until the end if 8th grade. Her modest clothing was bought from expensive stores, and she apparently never was  tempted to eat shell fish and pork products. But it was clear that her freer life in the suburbs was different from the life if her cousins in Crown Heights. Attending services with her father was more an attempt to bond with him that out of any particularly religious need.Ms Deitsch' s inner rebellion centered on longing for a life outside the traditional Hasidic community....she wanted a university education, when she thought about marriage it was something that would happen much later and certainly not an arranged one at age 18, and she wanted a career. These longings began in childhood, and one of the criticisms if the book is that too much time is spent on her pre-teen years while the years when she actually began to make meaningful changes is crowded into the last quarter of the book. The author began, however, to lay the foundation for her ""escape"" to a different life when she seriously wanted to emulate the strong women in her family who had defied both the Nazis and the Soviets. She was fortunate to have parents who loved her and wanted the best for her, but who were bewildered by her needs, needs she didn't share until she was ready to attend Barnard College instead of marrying. But they supported her desire for a high education and did not disown her. The book is well written, in the nature of most memoirs recreates some conversations that we have to take with a tiny grain of salt years after the event, and the details of a life most of us will never know is fascinating.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R273AHZMX43HNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0805243178#wasThisHelpful","R273AHZMX43HNE","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been a fan of Thomas Pitt over William Monk, therefore I have read almost all of the Pitt books and just selected novels out of the Monk series as they sounded interesting. ""Corridors of the Night"" is actually William's wife Hester' s story, which is perhaps why I did not find it terribly compelling. Once it became clear that experiments on the waifs Hester found in the hospital whilst on night duty were going to be a major focus of the book, I found my interest to flag. And that other waif, Scruff, with his dialect that becomes almost too much for me throughout an entire novel, was also a major player. He is the Monk series version of the London housemaid in the Pitt series, to represent the very, very lower class folk. Perry has balanced the two series with similar characters, including the major couples, William and Hester and Thomas and Charlotte. Both men have major issues on the job but happy personal lives with intelligent and sympathetic women they adore.I was disappointed to realize that a mystery involving the early days of blood transfusions was not as interesting as I had hoped. I think this book will be a natural for devoted fans of the Monk series, but for those new to the series I would recommend starting with the first book, ""The Face of a Stranger.""","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1641DDRK5VFOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553391380#wasThisHelpful","R1641DDRK5VFOZ","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The large industrial size shelf stable Coffee-mate is the latest in a line of holiday themed creamers. It will be good unopened on the shelf for several months and, once opened, good without refrigeration for at least 30 days. I did not find the flavor quite as intense as the refrigerated version, and one skimpy pump is hardly adequate to be a serving. This is a common problem, as I don't know of anyone who considers a teaspoon full, or even less, sufficient to sweeten a cup of coffee. It took me three pumps to get the flavor I wanted, for total of 75 calories. The carb and sugar count was 15 mg each. The pump was easy to assemble and insert in the bottle...it cannot be removed once in place.

"A year ago I had an aluminium tortilla press that ended up going to the local Goodwill Store because it was impossible to get anything other than a tiny tortilla suitable for a doll's tea party. This is totally different! The cast iron press is very heavy, and the plates are pre-seasoned, although I did use parchment paper for a better release of the tortilla. The handle must be assembled, and I found the pressure I needed to exert was much more than I needed with the lighter weight aluminium model.Tortilla presses are really only for making corn tortillas, as flour tortillas are rolled with a rolling pin. My suggestion is to make sure you have allowed yourself plenty of time when you use this for the first time, read all information on making tortillas prior to beginning, and have all your supplies at hand. Making tortillas by hand is not for the faintest of heart in my opinion, it is not much cheaper than buying a good brand at a grocery store or specialty store.

"This is a fairly fast moving historical romance that one can easily read in a day. As a debut novel there are some awkward sentences and some overuse of cliches (""the silence was deafening"") but by and large these are things that can be expected to improve as Ms Campbell continues writing.The author is commended for not setting her book in the overworked Recency period but rather setting the book in 9th century England, with conflicts between Saxons and Vikings. It has been awhile since I have seen a good Viking romance, which used to be a staple of the historical romance genre. The characters are appealing, particularly our Saxon heroine, Avelynn, and the noble Viking, Alrik. The dialogue is realistic, walking the line successfully between being too modern but not full of awkward ""foresoothy"" phrases in an attempt to sound like we imagine people talked in the 800's.

"Warning: Spoilers includedThis book would have worked far better for me if the main characters of Loretta Young, Clark Gable, and their daughter Judy Lewis had been presented under fictional names. Yes, most people of a certain age, or with a deep interest in the movie industry, would have recognized the story, but Adriana Trigiani has chosen to use the real names. Part of the problem is that we then have fictional conversations and scenes that probably never happened which are going to be taken as the truth.I have to confess, I have never felt the Trigiani magic which so many experience reading her books, and turned out to be no exception. The writing is workmanlike but not literary, the dialogue is reasonably realistic, and the best parts are the sections dealing strictly with the movie industry and Hollywood during the Golden Age. However, the nuns at the orphanage in San Francisco of the early 1930s sound more like post Vatican II than accounts I have read of the abusive maternity homes of the period.SPOILERS: Those of us who have read the book by Judy Lewis and Young' s account of her life know that Loretta Young seemed much more concerned with protecting her image than Ms Trigiani indicates. She accused Gable of ""date rape, "" which was not revealed until after her death. There is no way this can be proven 80 years after the event. But, per Miss Lewis's statement, her mother called her a ""walking mortal sin,"" which is just cruel and inexcusable. They were estranged until Miss Young' s death. All of this information was available to Ms Trigiani.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EMVHOP2B22QD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062319191#wasThisHelpful","R1EMVHOP2B22QD","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Witch Hazel? I haven't heard that term for ages, so I did not know what to expect from this hand cream as I associated witch hazel with an astringent. I couldn't have been more wrong, as this hand cream almost instantly gives the appearance of smooth, supple, and youthful skin. Using just a pea-size amount, I can moisturize both hands and have the results last for hours.

The author has culled personal accounts of existence in a Belgian facility that most have probably never heard of before finding this book. The stories are of prisoners from all walks of life and are very personal and intimate. The book is filled with photographs of the present day Breendonk as well as archival photos.

"This is a nice, low-key memoir written by a 60 year old man as a tribute to his 95 year old father. Stuart Stevens grew up in Mississippi, the son  of politically liberal parents at a time when the south, and indeed, the nation, was involved in the struggle for equal rights for black Americans. It was not totally clear to me if the white Stevens family had suffered in any meaningful way for their liberal views, although the younger Stevens was sent to Virginia for some of his pre-university years. The younger Stevens eventually got into politics, and was apparently slightly more conservative than his parents, as his last political work had been with the losing 2012 Romney campaign. Feeling lost and adrift he wanted to spend more time with his elderly parents, particularly his father. Never having lost his love for college football, the SEC, and Ole' Miss, Stevens decides to approach his parents about taking in all the Ole' Miss games during the next season.The slim volume explores the bond that football had created between the Stevens father-son duo when the son was in grade school, their loyalty to one team that never wavered over 50 years, and the attempt to reconnect and recapture the magic of the past. By and large, the attempt succeeded and is beautifully captured by Stevens. There is much humor in the book, particularly when Stevens relates his mother's attempt to over dress them in 90 degree heat with equal humidity, to encounters with fans of Ole Miss', to road trips, to fascination with hot dogs. There are also serious examination of integration, the retirement of a Confederate battleflag and rewriting of Dixie, the ultimate integration of the college and the team. The Stevens men had always been close, even when separated by miles, so the bonding related in the book was not perhaps as dramatic had they been estranged at some point, but that is one of the,reasons I liked this book so much.....the genuine love and respect between the two men just shown through beautifully. Recommended for football fans and lovers of memoirs that don't contain alcohol and drug fueled feuds and last minute reconciliation. Just quiet and thoughtful reflections.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R9GABU8ERVV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353022#wasThisHelpful","R1R9GABU8ERVV9","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the sort of horse related set I would have loved to have had as a child. I selected this hoping my granddaughter would enjoy it and we set it up upon  receipt. Not being a horsey girl, and near the top end of the age range, she thought it clever but had no interest in playing with it. The manufacturer gives the age range as being from 36 months to 15 years, and I think this is not accurate on either end.For 3 year olds I think the difficulty is they would need adult assistance and supervision setting it up as some of the pieces were small for little hands. Without being set on a table or other sturdy surface I think it could be challenging for the youngest children to play with as they would need to be very gentle. It is not made for rough play. On the highest end of the age group, the teenager would have to be really in to riding and it would be more appropriate as a display piece.Why then 5 stars?  The reasons are the pieces are hand painted, extraordinarily detailed, include English rather than western tack, and in the hands of the right age group would supply hours of fun. The price points are fairly reasonable that the accessories could be added for a total riding stable for under $175.00. As the child becomes older, the horse and rider could become display pieces. This set encourages imaginative play that is often missing in many contemporary toys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VY017VN6HCCC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QKLM16O#wasThisHelpful","R2VY017VN6HCCC","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Raifords return in this second book in the Rex Burns series about a father-daughter private detective firm that started with ""Body Slam."" While I do appreciate the unusual setting, a very large tanker, it also means rather long passages where nothing much is going on and the duo is actually working apart. The mystery is so-so, the writing pretty straight forward and workmanlike, dialogue is realistic. My biggest complaint has more to do with the main characters, who are somewhat lacklustre for private detectives.

"I did not know quite what to expect in this one volume treatment of the last full year of World War II. The book is a door stop at being more than 500 pages, but the subject area to be covered is equally huge. Jay Winik looks at the various allied countries and their respective leaders, and also devotes much time to what was happening in the Nazi concentration camps. 71 years later we know the outcome of these issues, but the author is still able to generate much tension and excitement with his writing, which is very approachable for the average reader as well as those more versed in the subject. As someone born in the very last year if the war, I had a father who was a veteran of the Pacific Theatre, and, I was to find out many years later, the cousin of  men who died in service in the invasion of Italy, the Battle of the Bulge, and on the USS Indianapolis. In many ways, WW II was similar to the American Civil War, in that many, many families were touched due to the number of those who served.

Ms Harkup devotes much time to the scientific properties of each poison, it's use or probable use in real life, and how it was employed in the works of Miss Christie. This is not a how to do it book for would be prisoners, but a reasonably serious discussion of poisons in history and literature.

"This book has received rave reviews all over the Internet but I found it to be tedious and of little interest due to a very unlikable heroine. Georgia Ford breaks off her engagement due to a misunderstanding with her fiance, that while shocking on the surface is something that could have been worked out. Georgia flees back to the family vineyard, where much to her dismay she finds out her father wants to sell the property. The rest of the novel is taken up with the bossy young woman giving out unwanted advice to everyone while she decides if she wants to reconcile with her fiance. Georgia is really a pill in my opinion. In real life you would flee her...and being a character in a novel you have the option of fleeing her by closing the book. She seems to be the natural inheritor of the title TSTL, short for Too Stupid To Live, where the heroine operates constantly against her own best interest. The setting is the best part of the novel and the dialogue is fairly realistic.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R98ZWGYEMW8VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476789258#wasThisHelpful","R98ZWGYEMW8VY","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Be warned:  Mary Buser's memoir of her days at Rikers is very depressing to read. The author started out as a very idealistic social worker intern, and ended her career in the system years later still with a sense of idealism but in her own way as beaten down as any inmate she tried to help. Unfortunately, her career ended a decade and a half ago, so the memoir in some ways seems a little late to the party. However, solitary confinement, covered in this book, is still being used in many major prisons, even though it has generally been discredited as an effective form of punishment. The book is well-written and compelling, and deals with social problems that still plague us in 2015, even though the national crime rate as dropped. We are still the only first world nation with a death penalty and we have not yet come to grips with how to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. I recommend this book for those interested in the judicial system, and perhaps interested in social work. Not, however, for the faint of heart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24GCT2P7JBENX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250077842#wasThisHelpful","R24GCT2P7JBENX","AT0E6UBVJMJ6W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AT0E6UBVJMJ6W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As soon as I received the Slumberjack I opened it up and tried it out on my bed. I think this bag is going to be just perfect for the two purposes I intend to use it for: some late summer, early fall camping and to have it available this winter in the event of a power outage. Two years in a row we had a power outage in the coldest weather and we lost our heat for a few days. Even with blankets piled on, the nights were very cold. This bag should be the answer as it will keep one warm down below 20 degree and it does not get down that low in the house. The bag is very attracive in plum and gold. It has a pouch for a pillow to make it comfortable for one's neck and head. I am only a little over 5 feet tall and the bag is for women up to 6 feet tall, so I do not expect it will have any fit issues for a woman of average build up to the maximum height requirement. I cannot address any issues regarding cleaning the bag.UPDATED 10/12/15: Last night I opened up the bag and put it on my bed to use as a comforter. It worked fine as a single layer on a cold night. I was a little worried that it might move around too much as I slept as it is 100% polyester, but it did not. On a cool to medium cold night you probably will only need the opened bag over you without an intermediate layer.

"What would you pay for a book that could give you all of the answers?  What if it could not be purchased, but only shared.  That is the premise of this little volume, a book about a book.  A seeker finds a master, a man whose title, old fool, belies everything he is not.  The master possesses a book of life which might reveal truth, or not...... And the seeker learns a little from it.New age literature?  Yes of course.  Complete with neo liberal assumptions?  Again, almost a given.  (I'm not sure if the skeptic in me was more annoyed by the blind repetition of global warming assumptions or the utterly unscientific belief that solar and wind can produce meaningful amounts of power, but either way I was a bit turned off by this portion of the book.). Yet, I can't help but feel that this book conveys a basic truth about our existence.  Questions and curiosity are what drive humans.  In Anne Rice's first and best book, Interview with a Vampire, Louie realizes that it is his anxiety about not having answers that keeps him from literally withering away.  But Louie's questioning nature is a human, not undead attribute.  Similarly, when we fall into routine and fail to question life as it comes, we become like the undead, living, but not truly alive.And if this be new age thought, then great.

"So you want to hike the John Muir Trail.  Which guidebook to get?  There are really only two that are up to date, the Wilderness Press edition and this little book from the British outdoor publisher Cicerone.  I own both books, but have a slight preference for this one.  Printed on glossy paper with sharp full color pictures this should whet your appetite for the trail.  But it is also lighter than the Wilderness Press volume which has grown in size and weight over the years.  And amazingly enough, this book packs in more as well.As one might expect, the book is geared towards an international visitor to the states, but a lot of the information in it will be useful to those traveling from other locales in the US.  Major airports, public transportation (and the lack thereof to and from Yosemite and Whitney Portal, and the issues with mailing supplies are all detailed in this book.  The book also suggests a reasonable, and quite doable schedule for your trip and even helps you navigate your way through the almost Byzantine system of camping and hiking permits you need to obtain for the trail.  Finally, it includes decent color sketch maps of the route.  Readers should know however that the author intends that you use this guide in conjunction with the excellent map set sold by Tom Harrison.The John Muir Trail is one of the classic American hikes.  Mile for mile it offers some of the most spectacular scenery in the world.

"I will start this review by noting that I am a climate skeptic, which most readers of this book will call a ""Denier"" (capital d for emphasis) so those who do not want their fundamental assumptions challenged should simply vote this review unhelpful now, perhaps leave a scathing or threatening comment and move on.  And with that said, this is a interesting book that asks some serious questions and deserves  a wider readership than it is already receiving.In brief, Marshall is convinced that climate change is a ""fact.""  He carefully defines climate change as the likelihood that temperatures will rise 4 degrees Celsius in the next century or so, and then asks why large numbers of people are resistant to these facts.  He concludes that we have an evolutionary adaptation to resist fears about the distant future.  Our brains, he argues, are hard wired to reject immediate costs for long range benefits.  He cites a variety of studies in evolutionary psychology to defend this claim, most notably a famous experiment which showed that people, if confronted with a hypothetical disease (for which a vaccine was available) that killed only 1 in every thousand infected, would pay $200 for the vaccine.  But the same people would need $10,000 to be infected by the disease to study the vaccine.  In short, people are more risk averse in the short than long term.  Marshall then interviews a variety of skeptics and finds to no one's surprise that these conclusions from evolutionary psychology are born out.The above problem is aggravated by fact that humans also tend to band together in groupings that reinforce their own belief systems, and in an age where information is widely available on the Internet, this trend is actually reinforced.  So much is available that we can literally select our own reality.  And we do so, often using the same mythic images to construct our narratives.  Both believers and skeptics of global warming are inclined to creating conspiracies about their opponents, compare them to Nazis, and focus on their moral failings.  (Some of these latter narratives are so powerful that even as Marshall recognizes them for what they are, he still feels obliged to come up with an apologetic.  It is rather hard for us lower middle class skeptics to appreciate the sincerity of the jet setters who tell us to use less.)Having identified the problem, Marshall then suggests a series of solutions.  His main point is to recognize and acknowledge the cultural barriers that divide people on climate change and realize that the same narrative will not work on every person.  He suggests instead that advocates for new policies based on climate change need to adopt narratives that meet the values and (presumably) hard wired belief systems people have.  After all, he notes, the 1970s were not so bad, and we drove less then, so what have we to fear? How's that for a ""conservative"" narrative?  (Some of us have different memories of the 70s.)All this is well and good, and will undoubtedly give advocates for political action hope that they will eventually be able to change the minds of ""Deniers"" out there.  (Failing that, it will be easier for those who agree with the hypothesis of this book to dismiss with their less ""evolved"" brethren.  To his credit, that is never Marshall's actual intent.)  But the problem with this book, and indeed nearly all popular books on evolutionary psychology, is the matter of what Archimedean point the author (and to judge by the other reviews here, the all too confident readers) are standing on.  Essentially the point this book makes boils down to this:  some people don't accept scientific evidence and rational argument because they are hard wired to do so.  But if some people are hard wired to do so, what gives the author such a privileged position?  How do we know that they aren't subject to ""hard wiring"" that makes them see ""facts"" that aren't there.The above point may sound rhetorical, but it's not.  At the beginning of the book, Marshall asks why the victims of wildfires in Texas, and hurricane Sandy, are so loathe to attribute their disasters to Climate Change.  Why indeed?  What is to Marshall overwhelming proof that we are hard wired to reject science, is actually evidence of shoddy science.  And let me be very clear on this for any reader who does not keep up on the scientific literature:  there is absolutely no evidence that hurricanes are increasing in strength or numbers over the last 50 years.  None.  And in fact the opposite is true.  We know, and this is the ""scientific consensus"" of specialists in the field that they are not.  (The situation with wildfires is a bit more complex.). So why is Marshall so keen on ""denying"" science?  A critic might suggest, ""He must be hard wired to do so!""And indeed it is very easy to make the claim (one could even write a whole book about it) that those who believe in global warming do so because of evolutionary belief systems.  After all, humans have always believed in apocalypse, despite the fact none of them ever come to pass.  So, while it is comforting to dismiss the argument of your critics as hard wiring, doing so is not advisable.  It undermines the very basis of rational discourse and the ""facts"" you claim to base your own position on.But Marshall's question remains.  Why do so many people reject the facts of climate change?  Comfortable as it may be to invoke evolutionary psychology or a conspiracy of ""Big Oil"" money interests, neither of these explanations holds weight.  Although the answer will not be comfortable for the left, the likely reason is because their ""facts"" are nowhere near as well founded as they think they are, and their solutions, which oddly enough almost uniformly reject nuclear power, are even less effective.  In short, if large numbers of people disagree with you, that is quite possibly a sign that you are wrong.  How can you know?  Read the actual evidence for yourselves.  You may be surprised to find that the people you thought were ignoring the scientific literature are actually reading it more carefully than you.  They may even be actively involved in writing it.  But be sure to read this book too.  If you read nothing else, and you share a left wing perspective, it will make you feel better about yourselves.  And if you don't share that perspective, you will find just how incredibly shallow the answers of true believers like Marshall are even when they ask serious questions.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R5MTN0EOTNO60/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J5ED8CE#wasThisHelpful","R5MTN0EOTNO60","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The famous El Camino trail in Spain may soon have a North American counterpart.  If, as expected, Pope Francis makes Father Junipero Serra a saint, then Trekkers may soon take to pilgrimages along the California coast (and slightly inland) to visit the missions and Fr Serra's burial site in Carmel.  Already some Trekkers are trying this and marking off routes.  This book covers the Southern California missions and suggests a largely urban hike along bike paths and back roads.I liked the idea behind the book and the route seemed relatively easy compared to the more traditional wilderness treks popular among Appalachian and Pacific Crest trail hikers.  The author, Lutz, has a preference for the European style of B&B hiking and it shows in his hotel recommendations.  It is possible to do the entire Southern California section of his proposed El Camino Real Trail without ever camping.  That can make for lite packs and a fun, if expensive walking vacation.I'm intrigued by the route and idea.  I love visiting the missions for their history, grandeur, and sacred space.  But like most American hikers, my preference still lies in Wilderness.  So I'm adding this route to my bucket list aand hoping I get a chance to do this pilgrimage in my own backyard.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CD8RUBNZEV6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WDN9P5S#wasThisHelpful","R10CD8RUBNZEV6","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read as much trail literature as I can, and I also dabble at the edges of the long distance hiking community, but no writer I've read in the last decade can compete with Carrot Quinn.  She has the gift of descriptive writing.  Readers can see what she sees on the trail and in her life, but like another great outdoor writer, Hemingway, she does not burden the reader with interpretations of the experience.  She leaves that for the readers to discover for themselves.  We are treated to snippets of conversations, visions of beauty, intimacy, pain, solitude, fear, and friendship, but no real interpretation.  And unlike Hemingway, we are not force fed some serious overarching theme which we are meant to reflect on.  Indeed, I think in some cases Ms. Quinn is herself not able to come to terms with her own experiences and the reader is deftly left with the same ambiguity she feels.Thru hiking can be a profound experience.  The very austerity of the trail can create mystical and transformative experiences for hikers.  But those experiences rarely translate well to written or spoken language.  Instead we are often told of how hard the readjustment to everyday life is after a thru hike at the end of a hiking journal.  Similar to the metamorphic return from the mountaintop, these experiences often signify loss as hikers seek to return to the ""real world.""  But Quinn has made a conscious decision to not return.  Instead, hiking remains her life, summer and winter.  Although I doubt she would consider this a pursuit of grace, in part because that language smacks of a traditional Christianity which has not been kind to her, it surely is.  And it is a grace that extends beyond her book into her hiking blog, the only one of hundreds which I subscribe too.  So get this book, sign up to receive blog updates, and prepare to be amazed by the depth and feeling that Quinn, the best hiking author of this generation conveys.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24DUTRYEELSAX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W4RICAM#wasThisHelpful","R24DUTRYEELSAX","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Long distance hiking is very much a young persons game.  As I approach 50 I find fewer and fewer people my age on the trail, and last summer, while hiking on the AT, I was briefly chastised by a hiker who noted my old pack didn't fit as well as it once may have and, ""at your age....""  But I've got nothing on G. William Jolly, the author of this book.  Jolly decided.to take up distance hiking at the age of 71 when he walked most of the Washington section of the Pacific Crest Trail, from Bridge of the Gods to Harts Pass.Hiking in one's seventies offers a fairly unique opportunity.  Many young writers find, or almost find, themselves while hiking the trail.  Jolly, by contrast, knows who he is and doesn't experience any profound changes, though an infected big toe does figure prominently in the final 20% of the book.  But he does find the trail offers him a lot of time for reflection on his life.  He thinks of the father he never had, and the step father who passed away too soon, discusses his turbulent relationships with his brother, and with God, and he finds time to share in the revels of his more youthful trail companions, even if often from a distance.  (Growing old, he notes, is rather like growing invisible.  We are seen less and expected to just retire from the social scene.). But Jolly refuses to just fade away.  Instead, he walks, albeit slowly, along some of America's greatest pathways.  Alas, this book only covers Washington.  He has also since hike much of the Northern California and Oregon sections of the PCT, and at the age of 73, hiked the John Muir Trail.  There is probably another book in there, and I left this one hoping for more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25F6838PSH8CB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UEUAMNG#wasThisHelpful","R25F6838PSH8CB","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ventura County is far more diverse than you might imagine.  It contains some of the nicest parklands and hiking in the greater LA area, and it is relatively uncrowded.  And if you want to hike there, many miles of trails beckon, from developed urban parks to wilderness along the Sespe River.  This little book by John McKinney will guide you to 24 of these hikes, many of which are quite short and accessible to even to moderately handicapped people, as my wife will attest.  But it has one significant drawback, about which more shortly.First the good:  all 24 of these hikes can be done in a day and several, like Rose Valley Falls, a real scenic gem, can be completed in under an hour.  Indeed, readers looking for a quick stroll after a day on the beach or at work will find ample opportunities with this book which includes several hikes in and around Ojai's open space preserves and in Ventura parks.  Even local botanical gardens receive some attention.But the book also includes some challenging hikes like the ascent of Nordhoff peak.  Happily McKinney includes some options for those who want a shorter route on these trails.  Finally, those hoping to try their hand at a short backpacking trip will find multiple options as several of these trails, like Pine Mountain, pass by backcountry camps.  I've hiked ten of the routes described here and in general I can say that McKinney's mileage and sketch maps are accurate.With so much going for it, one might ask what could be lacking in a book like this.  Of course a small guide will not be comprehensive.  (The best comprehensive guide to the area, by the way is Robert Stone's Best Dayhikes, Ventura.). But, because this guide is so brief, it is very inexpensive, especially in the Kindle edition.  If you are just visiting Ventura for a few days, or regularly pass through on your way elsewhere, then it is an excellent buy.  Still, I would like to have seen a few beach strolls.  Also, hikers should be aware that, although they are not in Ventura county proper, the best access to the Channel Islands, one of California's best, and least visited national parks, is from Ventura Harbor aboard concessionaire Island Packers.  And those islands represent the best day hikes to be had in the region.  Still, for the price, this is a nice guide.  Get it and have fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PG2FYMWIO0TM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D324GZM#wasThisHelpful","R1PG2FYMWIO0TM","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have purchased every edition of Afoot and Afield, Orange County.  And I have loved every one.  I no longer live in Riverside, so I don't get out to Orange County for hiking as much, but when I do, I try to take this book along.  Recently updated by David Money Harris, the best of the current Wilderness Press authors, this book includes over 30 new hikes, mostly in recently opened lands previously held by the Irvine Land Company and now open for public recreation.  Due to recent wildfires, a few of my favorite hikes, most notably Laurel Spring, are no longer here.  But the vast majority of the classic hikes are still here:  O'Neill park and Caspers Wilderness park still receive a lot of attention.  And the coastal section of the county has been revised and considerably expanded to include several hikes along local green belts and within smaller preserves that protect what is left of southern California's coastal wetlands.  (The photo is from one of these, the Back Bay Nature Preserve in Newport Beach.)But the biggest change to the book is not within the pages at all.  Harris has for years been developing a free hiking app, etrails, which is designed predominantly for Pacific Crest Trail hikers.  The app includes route descriptions, embedded topo maps, and the option, if you want to seriously cut into your iPhone's battery life of locating yourself on route.  It is a nice feature of for the PCT, though that route is fairly well signed.  But in his most recent update, Harris added a brief Orange County section that mirrors the book.  Descriptions are limited, and you are still well advised to buy the book.  But many Orange County trails, especially in the more urbanized areas, are interlaced with a slew of side routes, use paths, etc.  And in places where trails are disconnected and loops require short meanders on surface streets the satellite mapping feature of the app that accompanies this book is particularly valuable.  As I was field testing the new edition, I decided to hike the Back Bay Loop, nearly 10 miles, around Newport Bay. It was beautiful, but the route description in the book was fairly complicated, and the variety of paths were only incompletely signed.  I found the mapping feature of the accompanying app absolutely invaluable while hiking.  Finally the app has the added benefit of giving precise mileage (to the nearest tenth) while many hikes in the book simply round to the nearest whole mile in the written description.The bottom line then is that if you live in or near Organge County, or are willing to drive a bit to get some spectacular spring coastal walking, this is the book to get.  Harris is faithful to the book format that made Jerry Schad's Affoot and Afield series such a popular collection for day hikers in Southern California.  His additions to the book and the accompanying latest etrails app make this a great find for hikers and outdoor enthusiasts in the area of Orange County.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22AL7GMZIT839/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=089997757X#wasThisHelpful","R22AL7GMZIT839","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Maps in the National Geographic's ""Trail's Illustrated"" series are usually among the best available for hikers.  This one is no exception.  Clear and easy to read, it's scale is broad enough that you can follow nearly any trail among the many great parks in the area and at the same time locate yourself relative to any of the other recreational areas nearby.  Several trail systems connect, and the map also shows the full Skyline to the Sea Trail, the pre eminent hike in the Bay Area.  Of course, it features point to mileage for all trails and other recreational routes, is GPS compatible, and includes more hikes than the title implies.  Besides Big Basin and Santa Cruz proper, Butano Creek, Henry Cowell Redwoods, Castle Rock, Ano Nuevo Preserve, and Sanborn Skyline Park are among the many great places you can hike using this map.  The map does not, however, cover the northern end of the range.  Still, this is a wonderful place to explore.  I was pleased to see it included the public lands around Lexington Reservoir, and I will be visiting there on my next trip to the Bay Area.  Highly recommended for dedicated hikers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23OQ30MPMO8Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1566956757#wasThisHelpful","R23OQ30MPMO8Y3","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a hiker, there are two things you absolutely need in a map.  The first is a good detailed elevation profile.  There is no substitute for a fine topographical map even in the GPS age.  The second thing you need is mileages on trails between points.  This map is a 5 star product on the first point.  It is a one star product on the second.  Lacking point to point mileage, it is essentially worthless.  I was personally shocked when I noticed this.  National Geographic usually puts out a better product.  Of course, the map is GPS compatible and covers a wide area, so I will average the two ratings and give it three starts.

"Loreen Niewenhuis begins her description of a thousand mile journey by noting that she divorced her husband before she began to walk. At that point, I almost stopped reading the book. I thought one Wild was plenty. A whole new hiking genre of people getting over their former relationships on the trail seems a bit much. I didn't want to read another ""I found redemption on the trail"" book. Happily, the first two pages is where the comparison to the still very popular ""Wild"" ends, and despite the fact that Strayed got more publicity, this little volume by Niewenhuis is by far the better book. The author's true love is the Great Lakes region, and it shows on every page.As trail literature goes, this slim volume has surprisingly little actual detail about the hike. Yes, at times the author was hot. She was also concerned about the possibility of being stranded on Manitoba Island as the winds picked up and made a ferry crossing unlikely. But this book is really an exploration of the Great Lakes and their history and the hike is simply the vehicle for presenting the fascinating stories of Tecumseh, Nicola Tesla, the salmon who have overcome significant environmental hazzards to become nearly self sufficient in the lakes. Niewenhuis has a keen eye for detail, and the readers will be treated to the scenes as varied as frogs atop a dead, but not yet decaying, deer (the frogs are there for the flies and quite fat) or vivid descriptions of mines and mine tours including those in Copper Harbor. Virtually everyone will learn something new. I did not know, for example, that Lake Erie is only about 5000 years old, a virtual blink of an eye in geological time. Nor did I know that the street I grew up on, Manitou, is a Native American word for Great Spirit. In all, readers following the journey can learn a lot about the region and incidentally be treated to a great adventure laced with nice doses of humor.But in one sense, the author does undergo a transformation. No, she does not overcome dramatic personal failures or guilt. She never felt that to begin with and rightly so. But in the process of walking with minimal possessions she becomes, in her own words, ""more me."" Her life is focused, and she has time to reflect on just what is most important in her life. In the end, of course, she decides the land she traverses is itself an important part of her. But friendship is also important, and as she walks the final miles of her trek towards Niagra Falls, she is joined by many others who cheer her on. Not every hiking story needs to be about changing your life. But the best ones do involve new personal understanding. And perhaps that is what real redemption is. This book captures it perfectly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9IBDXBKNE5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1933987219#wasThisHelpful","R1J9IBDXBKNE5E","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hiking in eastern Sierras of California can be a challenging exercise on multiple levels.  On the one hand, elevations are high and trails are (often) steep, so don't expect to move as quickly as you do on a trail in California's coastal parks.  On the other hand, there is so much to choose from and many of the hikes are known only to locals, so finding the perfect route is a bit difficult.  This book resolves both of these problems.  No, you won't hike faster, but the elevation profiles and detailed route descriptions at least give you a hint of what to expect.  And the hikes described include little known trails (I have spent considerable time in the eastern Sierras, and I was not familiar with over a dozen of these hikes) that offer a lot of spectacular scenery in return for your effort.  But readers of this book should be in good shape.  Most of these routes are not for beginning hikers or casual walkers.  An all wheel drive vehicle with high clearance is also a good choice for those wanting to explore the trails in this book.What to like.  Reading this book is almost as good as hiking the trails themselves.  Every page is a plate, and the many photographs are sharp and whet one's appetite for the trail.  I personally like the color coded chapters, the aforementioned elevation profiles, and the authors' consistent hike ratings, from easy to very strenuous.  Each of the 50 hikes also includes an introduction, discussing what to expect on the trail, some vital statistics of mileage and start/end GPS coordinates, and often sidebars on local or natural history.  Driving directions are detailed and, based on my experiences, accurate.  Route descriptions are far more descriptive than found in most hiking guides, and topographical maps for each hike are a real plus.On the other hand, there are a few minor flaws with the book, none of which were sufficient for me to lower it a star on my review rating (some productions are so beautiful that one can overlook a couple mistakes) but they deserve some mention.  First, the editors at KD publications missed a few things.  The description of the drive to the Boundary Peak TH refers readers to a photo on p. 211, but the picture is actually on p. 213.  At least an entire page of text simply vanishes between p. 266 and p. 267.  Fortunately, these pages refer to the history of the town of Independence and not any particular hikes in the region. (I love Independence, however, and would have liked to see the full commentary.) Other little grammatical errors occasionally appear in the text.  From a strictly geographical perspective, readers should know, as my review title points out, this is a guide to the High Sierras east side, not the whole of the range.  You will not find hikes north of the June Lake Loop here (no northern Yosemite, for example).  Still in all, I was so thrilled by this original guide that even the little flaws often found with a small press cannot drop the high ratings I have given the book.Hiking the eastern Sierra's highest passes and lake basins, to say nothing of the steep use trails in the White Mountains, is a challenging business.  A good guidebook should introduce you to the best of the region and help keep you safe while you explore.  This guidebook is not merely good.  Even with a few flaws, it is great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11247E2ABTV7R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0578112094#wasThisHelpful","R11247E2ABTV7R","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And south of Sonora Pass and highway 108 lies the Emigrant Wilderness.  This is where California's Sierra Mountains really begin to change their character.  The granite fault block range is still the bedrock of the mountains, but extrusive volcanic outcroppings become much more prevalent.  Of more import for the early settlers traveling to California, the mountains are also lower here and somewhat more easy to traverse.  (Still, wagon trains over Sonora Pass used a rope and pulley system to lower their possessions off the steep grade.) And if you want to explore this area, you will find it with surprisingly few changes in the ensuing century and a half.  Yes, Hwy 108 is paved, but its gradiant still reflects the wagon route in many places, and the only developments are small resorts.  Outside this narrow band of pavement, all travel is still by foot or horseback, and you will want a good map for it.  Of the several choices available, this one by Harrison is probably the best.The map is constructed on a 1:63,360 scale, which means each inch represents a full mile, but this scale shows not only the whole of the Emigrant Wilderness but also part of the Hoover Wilderness, much of northern Yosemite, and the southern tip of the Carson Iceberg Wilderness.  Of greater import to hikers, it shows the main access routes to the Emigrant Wilderness which is generally not very accessible in the way some more popular wilderness areas are.  As with all recent Harrison Maps, this one is printed on a synthetic plastic paper which is waterproof and tear resistant.  Trails are clearly delineated as is topography with contour lines at 80 foot intervals.  And of course, you can use this map in conjunction with your hand held GPS unit, should you need to.Honesty compells me to admit that I have mostly just hiked around the edges of this wild area.  Accessing the heart of it was on my summer ""to do"" list, but things just did not work out this year.  When I try again, this map will be my main source of information on the trail.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDHCF7QTEO5BW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1877689734#wasThisHelpful","RDHCF7QTEO5BW","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mary Austin's 'The Land of Little Rain' is one of the classic works of American naturalist literature.  A short collection of essays, the book basically describes, in vivid detail, the desert landscape and its influence on the people and animals that inhabit it.  While America has produced some great writers of nature, Thoreau and Muir come to mind here, Mary Austin has no equal.  Thoreau is writing more about himself than the land he explores; Muir is selling conservation, not fairly describing what he sees and experiences.  Only Austin truly captures the land and describes its denizens in such copious (and exquisite) detail.So why do literary critics, including Terry Williams in her forward to this book, have such a difficult time capturing the essence of Austin?  I think the problem is that for the most part, you have to experience the desert to some degree before you can appreciate what Austin writes about it.  And modern critics generally don't do that.  They recognize (they think) some ideas in Austin that they sympathize with:  environmentalism, early feminism, native American rights, etc, but they then try to interpret Austin along these lines and fail dramatically.  Yes, you can quote mine Austin and find, as Williams does, some support for the 1994 Desert Protection Act.  But Williams wants to make Austin a modern environmentalist (and incidentally excoriate congressman Jerry Lewis for opposing the act) and the truth of the matter is that Austin probably would not have liked what successors have done in her name.  Her essay on the ""pocket trapper,"" a hard rock miner always hoping to find a good strike, presupposes the opportunity for men (and women) to lose themselves chasing desert dreams, an opportunity the 1994 act explicitly forbids.  But it is in losing oneself in the desert that one eventually finds meaning and new perspectives.  The miner, Winnenap (Shoshone medicine man living, and dying in exile among the Paiutes), Seyavi (Paiute basket weaver), and a whole host of other characters who populate pages of these short essays all come to this understanding, aptly summarized in the conclusion of the title story:  you are of no account in the world.  Your very existence is effectively the result of grace.  In the desert, you see and experience this reality more clearly than you can anywhere else.Sadly, the desert Austin writes of is vanishing, largely at the hands of those who claim to be its protectors.  ""Liberal"" ""environmentalists"" and ""conservationists"" are busy plowing it up to create the new ""green"" industries of tomorrow.  Already much of the Mojave has been flattened to make way for solar energy plants, euphemistically called ""farms."" And while valley fever has risen proportionately with the destruction of the landscape, the California poppies, which used to put on a spectacular display every spring, have been increasingly displaced. Indeed, my wife who reveled in the poppy bloom every spring found nearly none this year. So it is with the plants and animals on the desert hills that have been leveled in regular plots and covered with roads for wind ""farms.""  And nary a word is offered in protest of this desecration.  But Austin does offer us some measure of hope.  The desert, she says, changes men and not the other way around.  Hopefully it will recover from the rapes of the last decade as those who work in it come to see their destruction for what it is. If not, all that will remain of the desert will be the words of Mary Austin, and few among her future readers will be able to understand them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WUJ3X34F7QH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140249192#wasThisHelpful","R2WUJ3X34F7QH4","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Louv, in his classic Last Child in the Woods identifies the basic problem among children today:  they are suffering from nature deficit disorder.  The solution is fairly simple; get them outside.  But how do you do that?  Veteran outdoor author and hiker Jeff Alt, famous for his Appalachian Trail memoir, A Walk for Sunshine has an answer.  Get your kids hiking as soon as possible.  How soon is that?  Well, two to three months is fine (get a nice stroller or carrier) and get them outside.  In fact any age is fine, but sooner is better than later.  And as the subtitle strongly implies, your goal is to keep it fun.  After all, the authentic outdoor experience you are offering your children is in direct competition with the latest virtual worlds offered by the on line gaming experience, and the health of your child (and you) depends to a great degree on your child willing choosing a smart balance between the healthy authentic wilderness experience and the addictive alternatives our world offers them in copious volume.What this book offers is a how to guide for getting your child hiking at every age.  Suggestions range from activities that your child will enjoy on the trail to what sort of equipment and clothing you need to purchase.  Trail choice and length is also discussed, as are the basics of backpacking and emergency first aid.  The book does have a clear east coast bias, in part because Alt lives there, so examples seem to come predominantly from the Great Smokey Mountains and Shenandoah National Park, but moderately knowledgeable westerners will be able to apply his ideas to their own (altogether superior) outdoor options. The actual hiking situations Alt describes are universally applicable.On the whole, I thought this was a good book, in part because I like Alt's somewhat self depreciating writing style, and mostly because I think the topic he addresses is the most important one in American child rearing today.  It is all too easy to leave child rearing to the latest device (there's an app for that too!) but kids need to be engaged out of doors.  And with education moving away from the truly authentic towards a techno driven ""common core"" (which ironically comes with dumbed down content standards) the opportunity to raise truly well rounded children is declining.  Parents need to pick up the slack teachers like myself are increasingly leaving, and this requires active engagement with your child out of doors.

"Channel Islands National Park is one of the least visited parks in the country.  Not being able to drive right up to the Islands plays a big part in the relative lack of visitation, of course, but it also leads to some of the charm.  If you want to see these Islands, you need your own private sea faring boat, or you need to pony up for a passage on one of the boat concessions to get out there.  But that is half the fun.  The other half, of course, is deciding what to do once you are on the Islands, and unlike nearby (and popular) Catalina Island, you do not have the option of a resort or bed and breakfast.  What you do get is camping, hiking, kayaking, scuba adventures, and the alternative of just hanging out at the beach, sans southern California crowds.  You also have a decision about which map to take.  For years, the only real choice was Franko's, a nice recreation map of the area.  He showed all the trails, and covered alternative activities, especially scuba diving, one of his favorite sports.  But as of 2012 Franko is not personally producing maps anymore and his work was more focused on water sports in any event.  This 2006 Trails Illustrated Map is on the whole a better product, especially for those of us who enjoy hiking and sightseeing.  It is larger, provides more detail about the trails on each island, and includes up to date regulations for each island.The features I like best about this map are the numbered trails with point by point mileage.  Instead of just saying it is about 8 miles from Cuyler Harbor (depending on where you land at San Miguel) to Point Bennett, this map gives mileage between all significant stops along the way.  It also provides numbers to every major destination on each island with a key describing each hike.  An extensive text also provides recreational information specific to each island.  Camping regulations, contact information for island transportation concessionaires, and where the best wildlife viewing is available are all included with this map.  Whether you plan on a half day hike atop Anacapa, or an overnight on Santa Cruz or Santa Rosa, this map shows all your options.  On the whole then, the Trails Illustrated Map is my new primary source for Channel Islands Park recreation, especially since the older Franko maps will not be updated by the original author.  Get this one, and go see America's own Gallapagos Islands.  If you are lucky, you will be rewarded by an encounter with an Island Fox, seeing an Elephant Seal, or just taken aback by how much open space there is here so close (and yet so far away) from the bustling metropolis that is southern California.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23YNYB0EHEKUE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=156695410X#wasThisHelpful","R23YNYB0EHEKUE","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Want high alpine scenery in southern California?  Want to explore this area on foot far from the nearest major road?  Then you want to visit the San Gorgonio Wilderness in the San Bernardino National Forest.  The San Bernardino Forest has the distinction of being the most populated forest in the United States.  Small cities (Big Bear and Lake Arrowhead) are complemented by little townships and trails in these areas are more of the short nature trail variety.  But as soon as you leave the small village of Angelus Oaks to the west, or escape Big Bear and head over Onyx summit to the east, you are in some of the wildest country in California.  State Hwy 18 traverses above the Santa Ana River, but well below the high summits in the range, all of which must be explored by foot, and all of which are found on this new map by Tom Harrison.The 2012 edition of this map, which is what Amazon is actually selling, has a number of good features compared to earlier maps of the same area.  It is up to date on mileage.  Many of these trails have been reworked since they were first built by Depression era CCC crews over a century ago, and they now have a more moderate grade.  They are also a little longer, and the new map reflects this.  The route from Fish Creek, for example, is correctly portrayed on this map as 20.8 miles.  With a contour interval of 80 feet, and a scale of 1:47,520, this map is very readable.  It is, like all recent Harrison maps, also printed on a synthetic plastic paper which is tear resistant and waterproof.  And of course, if you are one of those hikers who absolutely needs a hand held GPS unit, this map is compatible with it.  So get the map, pick up your permit, and go explore the wildest part of southern California on your next available weekend or day off.  This area is too good to take a pass on.  And take this map with you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCWUEAOBHHC55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1877689521#wasThisHelpful","RCWUEAOBHHC55","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Every so often, I wish I lived in San Diego County's extensive backcountry. It is beautiful.  Largely chaparral, the area also features true desert and mountain forests, and you can find something to do there year round.  In the hot summer months, Mt. Laguna and the Cuyamaca Mountains offer relatively cooler hiking in evergreen forests.  In the winter, those same places offer skiing, or you can explore the nearby Anza-Borrego Desert.  And in between, the foothill areas from 1500-4000 feet in elevation, the majority of the backcountry, blossom and offer great hiking, biking, off roading...whatever your outdoor pleasure.  Indeed, my wife's great love is sketching wildflowers and spring in the San Diego backcountry offers multiple opportunities for that.  So you would think a recreational map covering this whole area would be a great idea, and you would not be alone.  Tom Harrison agrees and has updated his mid 1990s map with this 2012 color version on water proof tear resistant plastic.  It shows a lot, but therein lies the problem.Basically, in order to show all the San Diego backcountry, Harrison has to use a pretty big scale, 1:125,000.  This is two to five times the scale one would ordinarily use for a topographical map.  It means one inch is roughly two miles and contour intervals are 200 feet.  Put another way, this map will help you find general recreational areas, but it will not help you explore the trails you find there.  Some are not even on this map; others are so portrayed as so tiny that you will really only use this map to find their trail head.Having said that, there are still a lot of nice things to be said about this map. Part of the joy in exploring the San Diego backcountry lies in finding those special recreation spots in this vast land.  A map like Harrison's makes this task far easier; certainly less time consuming.  It's nice to know when you stay at Agua Caliente Regional Park (some of the nicest hot springs in southern California) that you are close to the multiple trails in Mountain Palm Springs.  Daring (or foolish, your call) cross country hikers can use this map to complete a ""Canada to Mexico"" ecosystem trek, from the top of Mt. Laguna to Vallecito Regional park.  And if you are hiking the Pacific Crest Trail in San Diego county, and I have done so more than once, this is a good map for you.  Harrison's trail includes point by point mileage and it is accurate!  Still, I would recommend getting more detailed maps at major recreation areas like Mt. Laguna, Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, and for the Anza-Borrego Desert.  There is only so much a map like this can convey and when it comes to exploring the area around hiking trails, less is sometimes more.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJQW3RVPSBVO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1877689548#wasThisHelpful","RJQW3RVPSBVO4","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently picked up a copy of Jeffrey Schaffer's 'Carson-Iceberg Wilderness,' last printed in 1992.  This is but one of dozens of Wilderness Press titles that Schaffer, a consummate field geologist, topographer, and hiker produced for what was then the premier outdoor press for the western US.  I've read many of these books, and used them to plan vacations.  And taken these books for granted.  Imagine an outdoor guide that devoted extensive chapters to the physical geography of a region, ecosystems found within each microclimate of the guidebook, fishing opportunities, hunting, and of course hiking.  These used to be commonplace, in part because the writing of Jeffrey Schaffer in books like this one established it as the norm for outdoor writing.  And as I read this book, I realized just how much outdoor writing has changed since his ""retirement"" from active guidebook writing.  This book will likely not see another edition, and that will be a tragedy.It should go without saying that this is still the definitive guidebook to that underused section of the Sierra south of Lake Tahoe and north of Yosemite.  Here volcanism is much more prominent than in the ""high"" Sierra, and lakes are comparatively fewer, but this is still beautiful country, overlooked by most hikers except the growing number of PCT hikers who get to experience this wonderful land on their way to Canada.  Since the guide was printed, fishermen (who still dominate wilderness users in this area) are no longer allowed to fish in several streams where dwindling populations of Lahanton Cutthroat Trout, a rare and protected fish, still exist.  But even the chapter on fishing still contains valuable information on how to enjoy success in this sometimes difficult area to fish.  Finally, you get Schaffer's hand drawn map with meticulous attention to each and every turn in the trail.  Few outdoor authors can match his skill in this area.But what I as reader really enjoy about Shaffer's work is that his natural history chapters are not simply a recapitulation of what one can find in popular science treatments.  Schaffer, from his earliest books to his latest always utilized his own personal research, even when it conflicted with recognized authorities who did their work in the library and not in the field.  Thus he notes that the idea meadows are glacial lakes which have filled in is essentially a ""geologic folk tale.""  Of course, as he notes, given enough time and a drying climate, this will eventually happen, but lakes in the region are only 15,000-30,000 years old and in that entire period have only accumulated about a foot of sediment.  His evidence?  His own field research on lake sediments as opposed to the ""models"" that still dominate scholarship in geology.  Nor is Schaffer shy in noting what should be obvious, namely that what little warming has actually occurred recently is nothing compared to what earth has experienced in the past.  We are, he notes, in an interglacial period and in all likelihood it will be brief. Another ice age is far more likely than continued global warming.  No doubt the scientific ""consensus"" will disagree, but I would put my money on Schaffer's actual field research in the long run.  And if you want to explore this stunningly beautiful and relatively lonely region, you would do well to put your money on any edition of this book you can find. Guidebooks like this are just no longer written and not only will you discover a beautiful landscape, you will also learn more about the country you plan to hike.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JMB8DBCDZUR3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0899971350#wasThisHelpful","R2JMB8DBCDZUR3","A1OGXR0166Q0XJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OGXR0166Q0XJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Makes as good a case for preserving civil liberties and individual privacy against government interference as I have read, and you don't have to be of any particular political persuasion to appreciate the argument. Also excoriates the mainstream media with righteous, smoldering contempt for toeing the party line and publishing only ""government-approved"" material. Greenwald appeals to mainstream reporters to revert back to the press's original role, which was to act as an independent bulwark against government actions, not as a tool in bed with the Washington elite. Greenwald sometimes sounds a little too shrill and self-righteous in his denunciations of the mainstream media - and he is also a bit unfair in neglecting the contributions of the few dissenting reporters in conventional media sources - but if anyone has earned the right to scold it's him.The first part of the book in which Greenwald meets NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden reads like a thriller, but the second part defending the essence of privacy and freedom of the press is actually more interesting and valuable. The fact that Snowden - a relatively lowly contractor with a high school diploma - could actually listen to any phone call or read any email he wanted really attests to how easy high-tech spying has become. The scale of surveillance unearthed by the Snowden documents is stupendous and is a striking example of what has been called ""technological solutionism""; you take the easy way out and collect everyone's data simply because that's the path of least resistance. However as members of Congress with access to the data themselves confessed, this ""collect it all"" policy has not been responsible for the prevention of a single terrorist plot since 9/11. All it does it erode individual rights and embed the national security state more deeply in our lives.For me, the most striking argument that Greenwald makes in favor of privacy is regarding its value as a driving force for unleashing human creativity and intellect; no Einstein, Picasso or Beethoven would have been able to do what they did if they constantly feared that someone was watching them. Privacy is not just about safeguarding our intimate moments or being able to express dissent, it's about being able to have the peace of mind to work and think in solitude so that human beings can achieve their highest potential. It is this most valuable human trait that government surveillance really tramples on.

"In this book Nicholas Wade advances two simple premises: firstly, that we should stop looking only toward culture as a determinant of differences between populations and individuals, and secondly, that those who claim that any biological basis for race is fiction are ignoring increasingly important findings from modern genetics and science. The guiding thread throughout the book is that ""human evolution is recent, copious and regional"" and that this has led to the genesis of distinct differences and classifications between human groups. What we do with this evidence should always be up for social debate, but the evidence itself cannot be ignored.That is basically the gist of the book. It's worth noting at the outset that at no point does Wade downplay the effects of culture and environment in dictating social, cognitive or behavioral differences - in fact he mentions culture as an important factor at least ten times by my count - but all he is saying is that, based on a variety of scientific studies enabled by the explosive recent growth of genomics and sequencing, we need to now recognize a strong genetic component to these differences.The book can be roughly divided into three parts. The first part details the many horrific and unseemly uses that the concept of race has been put to by loathsome racists and elitists ranging from Social Darwinists to National Socialists. Wade reminds us that while these perpetrators had a fundamentally misguided, crackpot definition of race, that does not mean race does not exist in a modern incarnation. This part also clearly serves to delineate the difference between a scientific fact and what we as human beings decide to do with it, and it tells us that an idea should not be taboo just because murderous tyrants might have warped its definition and used it to enslave and decimate their fellow humans.The second part of the book is really the meat of the story and Wade is on relatively firm ground here. Wade details a variety of studies based on tools like tandem DNA repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that point to very distinctive genetic differences between populations dictating both physical and mental traits. For me the most striking evidence that something called race is real comes from the fact that when you ask computer algorithms to cluster genes based on differences and similarities in an unbiased manner, these statistical programs consistently settle on the five continental races - Caucasian, East Asian, African, Native American and African Aboriginal. Very few people would deny that there are clear genetic underpinnings behind traits like skin color or height among people on different continents, but Wade's achievement here is to clearly explain how it's not just one or two genes underlying such traits but a combination of genes - the effects of many of which are not obvious - that distinguish between races. The other point that he drives home is that even minor differences between gene frequencies can lead to significant observable differences because of additive effects.  Wade also demolishes the beliefs of many leading thinkers who would rather have differences defined almost entirely by culture - these include Stephen Jay Gould who thought that humans evolved very little in the last ten thousand years (as Wade points out, about 14% of the genome has been under active selection since modern humans appeared on the scene), and Richard Lewontin who perpetuated a well-known belief that the dominance of intra as opposed to inter individual differences makes any discussion of race meaningless. As Wade demonstrates through citations of solid research and interviews with leading geneticists, this belief is simply erroneous since a variety of genetic clustering methods do seem to point to the existence of distinct races.The last part of the book is likely to be regarded as more controversial because it deals mainly with cognitive, social and personality traits and is much more speculative. However Wade fully realizes this and also realizes that ""there is nothing wrong with speculation, of course, as long as its premises are made clear"", and this could be part of a scientist's credo. The crux of the matter is to ask why genes would also not account for mental and social differences between races if they do account for physical differences. The problem there is that although the hypothesis is valid, the evidence is slim for now. Some of the topics that Wade deals with in this third part are thus admittedly hazy in terms of evidence. For instance there is ample contemplation about whether a set of behavioral and genetic factors might have made the West progress faster than the East. However Wade also makes it clear that ""progressive"" does not mean ""superior""; what he is rather doing is sifting through the evidence and asking if some of it might account for these more complex differences in social systems. Similarly, while there are pronounced racial differences in IQ, one must recognize the limitations of IQ, but more importantly should recognize that IQ says nothing about whether one human is ""better"" or ""worse"" than another; in fact the question is meaningless. Wade brings a similar approach to exploring genetic influences on cognitive abilities and personality traits; evidently, as he recognizes, the evidence on this topic is quite slim. He looks at the effects of genes on traits as diverse as language, reciprocity and propensity to dole out punishment. This discussion makes it clear that we are just getting started and there are many horizons that will be uncovered in the near future; for instance, tantalizing hints of links between genes for certain enzymes and aggressive or amiable behavior are just emerging. Some of the other paradigms Wade writes about, such as the high intelligence of Ashkenazi Jews, the gene-driven contrast between chimp and human societies and the rise of the West are interesting but have been covered by other authors like Steven Pinker, Greg Cochran and Gregory Clark. If I have a criticism of the book it is that in his efforts to cover extensive ground, Wade sometimes gives short shrift to research on interesting topics like oxytocin and hormonal influences. But what he does make clear is that the research opportunities in the field are definitely exciting, and scientists should not have to tiptoe around these topics for political reasons.Overall I found this book extremely well-researched, thoughtfully written and objectively argued. The many researchers whose work Wade cites makes the writing authoritative; on the other hand, where speculation is warranted or noted he usually explicitly points it out as such. Some of these speculations such as the effects of genetics on the behavior of entire societies are quite far flung but I don't see any reason why, based on what we do know about the spread of genes among groups, they should be dismissed out of hand. At the very least they serve as reasonable hypotheses to be pondered, thrashed out and tested. Science is about ideas, not answers.But the real lesson of the book should not be lost on us: A scientific topic cannot be declared off limits or whitewashed because its findings can be socially or politically incendiary; as Wade notes, ""Whether or not a thesis might be politically incendiary should have no bearing on the estimate of its scientific validity."" He gives nuclear physics as a good analogy; knowledge of the atom can lead to both destruction and advancement, but without this knowledge there will still be destruction. More importantly, one cannot hide the fruits of science; how they are used as instruments of social or political policy is a matter of principle and should be decoupled from the science itself. In fact, knowing the facts provides us with a clear basis for making progressive decisions and gives us a powerful weapon for defeating the nefarious goals of demagogues who would use pseudoscience to support their dubious claims. In that sense, I agree with Wade that even if genetic differences between races become enshrined into scientific fact, it does not mean at all that we will immediately descend into 19th-century racism; our moral compass has already decided the direction of that particular current.Ultimately Wade's argument is about the transparency of knowledge. He admonishes some of the critics - especially some liberal academics and the American Anthropological Association - for espousing a ""culture only"" philosophy that is increasingly at odds with scientific facts and designed mainly for political correctness and a straitjacketed worldview. I don't think liberal academics are the only ones guilty of this attitude but some of them certainly embrace it. Liberal academics, however, have always prided themselves on being objective examiners of the scientific truth. Wade rightly says that they should join hands with all of us in bringing that same critical and honest attitude to examining the recent evidence about race and genetics. Whatever it reveals, we can be sure that as human beings we will try our best not to let it harm the cause of our fellow beings. We are, all of us, human beings first and scientists second.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XIJWXLU1N47G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204462#wasThisHelpful","R2XIJWXLU1N47G","A36A9HWQ9U1IK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36A9HWQ9U1IK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have little to add to the positive reviews of this book. Robert Caro is a national treasure who has done all of us a great service by writing what will undoubtedly go down in history as both one of the greatest political biographies of all time and a seminal study of power. The level of research in this book is truly astonishing, spanning almost forty years and constituting a book in itself. Nobody can ever top this work.What I found deeply disappointing about the series is the subpar writing. Perhaps the most egregious transgression is the way in which Caro begins every third paragraph with ""And"". Almost every middle school English teacher warns against doing this. Doing it occasionally is fine, but Caro completely goes overboard with it. In addition his style is extremely rambling. Almost every section contains sentences in which the asides often exceed the main points in length. The other problem is repetition; Caro is so obsessed with giving us every tiny detail from LBJ's life that he will bend over backwards every few lines to tell us the same thing - usually something about LBJ's character - in ten different ways. This sometimes makes what is undoubtedly a historic biography tedious and annoying to read.I would still definitely recommend the book and its successors, simply for the level of research and the amazing narrative about the man and his times that Caro brings us. It's a superlative example of what someone who dedicates his or her life to a single pursuit can achieve. But at the very least you should brace yourself for some subpar writing before embarking on this 3000 page journey (which will become even longer with the fifth volume). My advice: Ignore this aspect of the writing, and contemplate what the books have achieved.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UNM87RJH3EOF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002GKGB0U#wasThisHelpful","R3UNM87RJH3EOF","A36A9HWQ9U1IK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36A9HWQ9U1IK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elizabeth Kolbert combines the sharp observational powers of a field biologist with the literary skill of a seasoned and thoughtful writer. In her previous book Notes from a Field Catastrophe, she travelled to far-flung parts of the globe to dig up stories on the deleterious effects of climate change. In her latest book she combines similar reporting from around the world with chapters from the history of science to bring us a noteworthy account of one of the most spectacular and important stories of biology and history  mass extinctions. There have been five documented big extinctions in history, with the most popular one being the death of the dinosaurs that was memorably caused by a meteorite. However we are probably now in the throes of a sixth extinction, and as Kolbert documents, at least parts of it are being caused by human beings destructive tendencies and our unquenchable thirst for natural resources. The concern for extinctions is not merely a discussion for the drawing rooms of bleeding-heart environmentalists; as a chemist, I am well-aware that about half of all drugs on the market are derived from natural sources. Every time we kill off another marine sponge or frog, we may be depriving ourselves of the next breakthrough drug against cancer or AIDS.Kolbert starts by telling us how we came to know about extinctions in the eighteenth century. It took a long time for scientists and the public to actually believe in such devastating events, simply because of their magnitude. It was Georges Cuvier, a French naturalist, who painstakingly collected fossils and bones of giant and exotic creatures from around the world and turned conjecture into reality. By cataloging their sheer abundance Cuvier convinced everyone of the reality of worlds lost in time that were completely different from our own. Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell who came after Cuvier also debated extinctions; but since Darwins theory required very gradual changes over time, he could not quite fathom how entire species of animals could disappear in an evolutionary eyeblink. Kolbert also tells the fascinating story of the Alvarez father-son duo who discovered the potential reason for the extinction of the dinosaurs by measuring the startlingly high concentration of iridium  an element found in abundance only in meteorites  in certain clay layers.The real meat of the book is Kolberts travels to different parts of the world and her reporting of what seem like extinctions of specific species. In one chapter she explores the impact of climate change on ocean acidification  one of the more neglected aspects of the global warming debate  on coral reefs. Ocean acidification is a consequence of simple chemistry; when carbon dioxide dissolves in water it lowers its pH, and the resulting acidic solution starts to eat away at corals which are composed of calcium carbonate.Last year I was in Hawaii and one of the most revealing experiences I had there was snorkeling around the island where Captain Cook was killed. Peering through the goggles, I could see not only a spectacular ecosystem of fishes, tube worms, sea cucumbers, jellyfish and other denizens of the deep but also how critically dependent all of them were on the coral reefs. The worms were permanently latched on to the reefs and the fishes were constantly kissing the surface with puckered lips, consuming the plant and microbial material deposited in the oxygen-rich pores of the intricate structures. Clearly the reefs support many living worlds, and as Kolbert finds out first-hand, these worlds are being depleted by ocean acidification. Even those who may be skeptical of the warming effects of CO2 emissions should take this impact very seriously. And as I mentioned before, nor is this concern purely moral; marine sponges have been the source of some of the most promising drugs against cancer and will continue to be so.Kolbert also explores the disappearance of other species spanning the spectrum of species diversity, from birds to frogs to mammals. In documenting this she travels to caves in Italy, rain forests in Central Africa and even a location in  of all places  suburban New Jersey, where traces of the K/T boundary event that killed off the dinosaurs can be found. Fungal infections seem to be a leading and particularly concerning cause of several current extinctions, most notably those of New England bats and Panamian golden frogs. Amphibians are more affected than almost any other species partly because of their sensitive skin. In a vivid chapter Kolbert locates an artificial ecosystem set up by scientists in Panama where the last few hundred golden frogs survive. By now the fungus is so rampant in their natural environment that releasing them outside would be fatal. These brightly colored creatures, nurtured by their human caretakers, are the last surviving members of their tribe and on the brink of disappearing from the face of the planet. A similar poignant chapter introduced us to a male Hawaiian crow, who just like the golden frogs, is part of a species that exists only in a zoo. All attempts by the zoo personnel to induce this crow to mate have been unsuccessful so far and one does not know how much longer his thread will stay unbroken.Kolbert wisely stays away from attributing many of these species disappearances to human activity. But in many cases there is strong evidence that does link human activity to rapid species depletion. In this context deforestation may be an even bigger threat than climate change; indeed, a universal mathematical scaling law linking number of species to area seems to encapsulate the impact of deforestation. So is the introduction of non-endemic species by air and sea travel which when introduced into a new ecosystem find themselves free of predators and start decimating the local population; the brown tree snake which was introduced in Guam and which literally ate its way through several bird and amphibian populations is a noteworthy case. The voracious zebra mussel which has wreaked havoc in waterways in the US is another example.The impact of humans is undeniable, and in measuring this impact we see the sometimes cruel and indifferent streaks of inhumanity which mark us as one of the few species on the planet which takes pleasure in killing others. Particularly barbaric was the butchering of the flightless Great Auk to extinction in Northern Europe in the nineteenth century; Kolbert talks about how hungry sailors devoured the auks not only by dunking them in boiling water but also by using them as fuel for the fire underneath. One of the simple reasons why humans can quickly render larger animals extinct is because of their slow breeding rate. This explains the disappearance of the megafauna in New Zealand for instance, where the hunting of the large, flightless moa provides a stark test case. In ecosystems untouched by humans, whatever disadvantages are suffered by creatures because of their slow reproductive rate can be compensated for by their larger size and strength. When intelligent human beings wielding weapons arrive on the scene, the equation radically changes. This is precisely why larger animals like lions, tigers and apes are the most threatened species today.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of humans devastating impact on other species emerges when we look not to distant species but to a very close one  the Neanderthal. One of the most significant discoveries in science during the last few years has been the realization that after encountering Neanderthals in Europe and Western Asia about forty thousand years ago, Homo sapiens first interbred with them and then somehow killed them off. There is something deeply creepy about this fact. As revealed by groundbreaking recent work on sequencing Neanderthal DNA, virtually all of us have between 1 and 4 percent of this DNA in our own genome. We may even have inherited a few genes for disease from our close cousins. This work has been made possible largely by the efforts of Swedish geneticist Svante Paabo who Kolbert interviews, and his recent book provides a fascinating look at the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome.What caused Neanderthals to go extinct while we lived? War certainly could be one reason; after all population sizes as well as mortality rates then were quite low. Perhaps Neanderthal populations were already on the brink of extinction when humans met them so purely on a statistical basis they may have been unlikely to survive for too long. My favorite explanation is disease. It is very much possible that interbreeding between modern humans and Neanderthals made the latter more susceptible to certain diseases passed on from humans. Neanderthals could also have been more prone to certain diseases to begin with. There is also some evidence that humans were more creative and intelligent than Neanderthals, so we may have been better equipped to deal with diseases than our less evolved cousins. Whatever the reason, the co-existence of humans and Neanderthals followed by their disappearance is another data point on the table of extinctions in which humans might have played a dominant role.The whole saga of extinctions also conceals a profound irony. In death there is life. The same great five extinctions that killed off more than 90% of species on the planet also opened up ecological niches and resources to previously suppressed creatures. Dinosaurs made room for mammals and amphibians and led to the evolution of human beings. It is also almost poetically ironic that a few members of the same human species that killed off so many of its evolutionarily distant and close cousins are also making heroic efforts to preserve the remaining members of certain species in zoos and other ecological enclaves. We dont know how this story of extinctions is going to end. Perhaps it will end with humans killing most other species on the planet by breaking the chain of interdependencies between various animals and plants. If we do this we may be killing ourselves by destroying the intricate web of natural resources that allows us to farm, feed and clothe the world. Or perhaps we may kill ourselves more directly through climate change, overpopulation or nuclear war. In any case, the history of extinctions tells us that the planet will survive. Nature always finds a way.*First published on the Scientific American Blog Network.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I7Z6WMBQ88K7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EGJE4G2#wasThisHelpful","R1I7Z6WMBQ88K7","A36A9HWQ9U1IK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36A9HWQ9U1IK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pedro Ferreira's book ""The Perfect Theory: A Century of Geniuses and the Battle over General Relativity"" essentially tells us what other people did with Einstein's general theory of relativity after he developed it. While one chapter is devoted to Einstein's hard struggle with learning the non-Riemannian geometry and building the field equations that define the theory, the book really takes off after 1917 when a series of men and women discovered the awesome implications of these equations. The book is a fast read and it does a very good job portraying the colorful personalities and exciting discoveries unearthed by general relativity.By 1919 the theory had been well-established as part of the scientific enterprise, especially after it retrodicted the correct value of the perihelion of mercury and predicted the bending of starlight observed by Arthur Eddington, a discovery that splashed Einstein's name on the front pages of the world's leading newspapers. Eddington was Einstein's heir, thoroughly learning the theory and grasping its implications for stellar structure. Ironically he did not dare to take these implications to their logical conclusion. That task was left to a young Indian astrophysicist named Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar who paved the way toward the discovery of black holes by considering what happens when stars run out of fuel and collapse under gravitational contraction. Famously Eddington rebuked Chandrasekhar's findings and revealed himself to be much like Einstein, a revolutionary in young age and a reactionary in old age.The story of black holes is one important thread that the book follows. Chandrasekhar's ideas were further developed by Lev Landau, Fritz Zwicky and Robert Oppenheimer in the 30s. Oppenheimer's story is especially interesting since he was the one who theoretically discovered black holes but later completely dissociated himself from them, showing no interest in general relativity until the end of his life. In fact Oppenheimer's view of relativity was similar to that of the vast majority of physicists who were caught up in the revolutions in nuclear and quantum physics in the 30s and 40s. Quantum mechanics and particle physics were the new frontiers; relativity was a speculative backwater.It was the eminent Princeton University physicist John Wheeler who picked up where Oppenheimer had left off. Wheeler is really the father of modern relativity since he was the one who rejuvenated interest in the topic in the 50s and 60s. Many of his students like Jacob Bekenstein and Kip Thorne became leaders in the field. In Britain the field was fathered by Dennis Sciama, whose students Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking led the way in understanding singularities and the Big Bang. Hawking especially forged a very important link between information, relativity, thermodynamics and quantum mechanics through his exploration of what we now call the ""black hole information paradox"".Hawking's work on singularities connects to the second major thread of the book, this time involving the applications of general relativity to the entire universe. The story begins right after Einstein developed his framework when Russian bomber pilot Alexander Friedmann and Belgian priest Georges Lemaitre found out that one of the solutions of the equations would be an expanding universe. In a famous mistake which Einstein called ""the greatest blunder of my life"", Einstein had found this solution but, based on the observation of a locally static universe, had applied a fudge factor - a ""cosmological constant""- to halt the expansion which turned out to have great significance almost eight decades later. Lemaitre and Friedmann's story logically leads to that of Edwin Hubble who in 1929 observed the redshifting of galaxies, thereby inaugurating one of the great eras in the exploration of the cosmos. This era culminated in the discovery of dark matter and dark energy and the transformation of cosmology into a precision science, all of which has opened up frontiers undreamt of by Einstein. And Ferreira hopes there's much more in store than can flow from those beautiful equations.Ferreira is quite adept at describing these two main threads. One of the most important aspects of the development of relativity was the shot in the arm which the theory received from experimental observations of distant objects by radio telescopes made by Martin Ryle, Jocelyn Bell and others. In fact the book underscores the fact that without these observations relativity would have continued to be considered mathematical doodling at worst and speculative science at best. The grounding of relativity in the real world through the discoveries of quasars, pulsars, neutron stars and black holes makes the paramount significance of experimental evidence in lending respectability to a theory quite clear. Personally I would have appreciated it if Ferreira had also considered some other evidence for general relativity, such as the observation of frame-dragging by Gravity Probe B, a technical marvel and a jaw-dropping exercise in accurate measurement if there ever was one.The last part of the book concerns the quest over the last four decades to combine general relativity with quantum mechanics, an effort that was started by Wheeler and his student Bryce DeWitt in the 60s. The same techniques of field theory that led to such spectacular successes in particle physics - culminating in the Standard Model - failed abysmally when applied to relativity. One possible way out is string theory whose virtue is that gravity emerges naturally from the theoretical framework. Another promising framework is loop quantum gravity. The problem with string theory, as well known by now, is that it makes no testable predictions and its solution space is so vast that virtually anything can be accommodated in its expansive embrace. In science, a theory that can explain anything and everything is usually considered a theory that can explain nothing.One thing that again struck me is how important experiment and observation are for actually taking a theory from a realm of fanciful speculation to hard reality. It's worth comparing the progress of quantum mechanics, general relativity and string theory in this context. Quantum mechanics was fully developed in the 1920s and immediately explained scores of previously confusing experimental facts. Its success only grew in the 30s and 40s as it was applied to solid-state physics, chemistry and nuclear physics, always amply supported by experiment. The philosophical conundrums in the theory - which we still struggle with - did not harm the theory because of its great experimental success. In contrast, general relativity was developed about ten years earlier. By 1940 or so it had two major experimental predictions to its credit: the bending of starlight and the expansion of the universe. But even by the late 1950s it had not become part of mainstream physics and was considered more mathematics than physics, mainly because the experimental evidence was lacking. As mentioned above, it was only the development of radio astronomy that really put the whole framework on a firm pedestal.Thus it took quantum mechanics no time at all and relativity almost forty years to become respectable, even when there were two astonishing experimental observations which the latter had successfully predicted. The great difference was the experimental evidence, copious in case of the former and spotty and only slowly emerging in case of the latter. Compared to this, string theory has been around for about forty years and there is still no unambiguous experimental evidence in its favor. Purely on a historical basis this might hint that it may be on the wrong track. There's a reason why Feynman said that the only true test of a scientific theory is experiment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R7NPJHYH9RK0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0547554893#wasThisHelpful","R1R7NPJHYH9RK0","A36A9HWQ9U1IK4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36A9HWQ9U1IK4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got a pair for biking in fall weather. The gloves look nice, however they have terrible design flaw. Though the size is correct, the gloves are very restrictive at the fingers. There is so much material bundled up inside. The worst area is the thumb. After wearing it for 3 hrs biking, my thumbs hurt, as I had to fight against my restrictive gloves and push really hard to operate my gears.The gloves are made of 2 layers - outer wind proof layer, and inner liner that is similar to a base layer. When I turned the gloves inside out, I discovered that the liner on the fingers is wider and longer than the outer layer by at least 1/4 inch. In addition, there is a piece of 1 square inch fabric over the liner that adds even more bulk. The out layer tapers at the finger tips that make the gloves look good, however, it totally restricts the finger movement.To fix the problem, I removed the stitches on the thumbs (ends) that creates room for the liner and finger movement. Then I duct taped the opening to block out the wind. It is not pretty, but solved the problem.

Some reviewers mentioned that it tends to stretch easily and loose its elasticity, and maybe it is meant to be really tight to secure the tendons/muscles, so I decided to keep the small size instead of exchanging it for a medium. So far, it has worked well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LVR8903YMIK1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0010VUMB0#wasThisHelpful","R2LVR8903YMIK1","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I used to have problem with my HR monitor in certain conditions, particularly when biking. This product is easy to use and gives more reliable readings than water, which tends to evaporate after a bit. Just a little drop on each electrode works for several hours. This product is also convenient when starting the workout far away from any source of clean water (spitting works as the same as water, but is a bit disgusting :-).Suspicious spikes in heart rate or sudden dropouts are things of the past for me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQIPFKPUVOTA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000HZD2NU#wasThisHelpful","RQIPFKPUVOTA8","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is copied from the review on Bob's Red Mill Old Country Muesli. Same product, same review.The muesli is high quality, no sugar added, and tastes good. I typically add hot water to it and let it soak for 10-15 min. Then it has the right balance of texture. If you use yogurt or cold water, it will take longer time to soften the oats.However, I'd like to echo another reviewer's comment: it contains way too much sunflower seeds (about 10% of the total). Raw sunflower seeds don't taste good. What's more important is: sunflower seeds and dates (another ingredient in the mix) are high in phytoestrogens, or plant estrogen that work like estrogen in the body.  Estrogen is associated with breast cancer and even prostate cancer (google the subject). One who has estrogen dominance issue definitely needs to be mindful about it.For this reason, I will not buy this product again.

"This book provides biographies for a number of Americans that are noteworthy for their environmental activism in recent years. Some of these are rather colorful characters, and the author generally does a good job to fill the pages with interesting details about them.That being said, there are a number issues I have with the book.First I feel that it fails to keep the distance and objectivity that a good biographer should have from his subjects. The book is written in a activist, good guys vs. bad guys style that does not leave a whole lot of room for critical thinking.Second, the book is somewhat anticlimactic. It simply runs out of steam towards the end, the depiction of the the characters gets progressively shorter and shallower. Almost like the author had an assignment to cover x people and ran out of time to meet the deadline.Third, I really dislike the title. It sounds crummy, there is no obvious connection to the robber barons of yore, and it is misleading too, as many of the people in the book are not even rich.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13YAXBAPLKV6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005IV0N62#wasThisHelpful","R13YAXBAPLKV6P","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After enjoying snowshoeing with the basic Yukon Charlie snowshoes bought at Costco, my husband and I decided that it was time to upgrade. We considered MSR lighting ascent and Atlas 12 series. Because the ease of getting in/out of the snowshoes is an important criteria, we went for Atlas. After trying them extensively in deep powder snow in UP MI for 10 days, we are quite impressed by the 12's performance:- the best binding: it literally only takes us 2 seconds to put on or take off our snowshoes; Once the heel strap is adjusted to the appropriate length, we never need to touch it again. Then the only thing left to do is tighten or loosen the strap around the foot which takes only 1 second or two. During our hour long trek for days, the binding stayed securely in place, never needed to re-tighten a single time.- The foam padding under the binding is very boot-friendly and doesn't scrub and damage boots;- half pound lighter than the 10 series. Weight matters a lot. Thought the 12 series is only half lb. heavier than Yukon Charlie's, I feel the extra weight immediately after trekking in them.- it has one more metal tooth gripping at the bottom than the 10's. I don't think that it matters much in normal condition, but maybe help on ice. We trekked on steep terrains with the 12 series. They felt very secure.Our only reservation about the snowshoes is their binding mechanism.  It behaves differently from some other snowshoes in that they don't allow the snowshoe heels to fall down vertically: they are somewhat ""springy"". This is good because it makes it easier to lift the snowshoes over obstacles. However, it also makes for a LOT of snow being thrown up against your backside particularly on somewhat packed snowshoe trails. Gaiters are absolutely recommended if you don't want snow flying into your boots.In short, Atlas 12's have greatly enhanced our snowshoe enjoyment. It is a good investment for many years to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QKLUT13ED1H8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002HHEYRY#wasThisHelpful","R1QKLUT13ED1H8","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We were really excited about buying this kettle because the design looks kind of smart on the picture, and because we own a pressure cooker made by Kuhn Rikon that we really love. But after having used it for a couple of days, we are quite disappointed.The main reason is the design that makes the whistle shift away, when the kettle is lifted. It's just crummy. The movement is not smooth, but happens suddenly, making the kettle shake and producing a loud metal-hits-metal noise.Also this design makes it really very difficult to completely drain the kettle. I do not like having water sitting in the kettle for days on end.Aesthetically, the kettle is far less sleek than it appears on the picture: The backside of the handle is attached to the kettle with a roughly 1"" rectangular metal box. It looks bulky and edgy like a cheap machine part.In summary, this kettle would do the job boiling water, but is neither particularly sleek nor pleasing to operate. It is certainly not worth its price.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8NBH1WPLUBJE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0028RXJ74#wasThisHelpful","R8NBH1WPLUBJE","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this for my xc skiing. The features I like about VestPac are:- low profile. It allows me to wear it underneath my jacket. However, it does add a bit of bulk under the jacket and wearing it makes me look a bit hunchbacked.- small volume: 1 liter reservoir capacity if perfect for my typical 15k skiing runWhat I hope that it can improve:- weight. I am surprised about how heavy it is even when empty. I guess that multiple layers of material and pockets contribute to the weight. For a race, this weight is a burden. The maker should look into ways to reduce the weight.- freezing. When temperate is in the single digit, the end of the tube freezes even with the body heat under the jacket.In short, I like the product, but I think that it can improve.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BKRVUD79ET2S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0083SWEWI#wasThisHelpful","R2BKRVUD79ET2S","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great pair of snowshoes and keeps the boots securely tight with the showshoes. But after I tried the 12 series, I am in love with the 12's. Here is why:- the best binding: it is really a breeze to tighten or loosen the binding over the shoes (much easier than the already pretty good 10 series); There is foam padding under the binding and its snug/flat around the boots once the binding is tightened- half pound lighter than the 10 series: weight matters a lot to us when we have to frequently fly w/ our snowshoes and multiple pairs of skies- it has one more metal tooth gripping at the bottom than the 10's. I don't think that it matters much in normal condition, but maybe helpful when the slope is really steep.Not sure whether the above difference justify the $100 difference in the price, but we went for the 12s as we know that we will use them a lot and they should last for a long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTI8YK0RANEBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0060K7O4O#wasThisHelpful","RTI8YK0RANEBX","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The DVD is very helpful if you want to use roller, beastie balls and beastie bar correctly. The DVD covers technique on 10 body areas and how to use beastie wall system. It also has an introduction part and extra (Jeff's credential).Each body area section covers: 1) explanation about the targeted muscles; 2) roller demo and mistakes to avoid; 3) beastie bar or single beasti ball demo; 4) relaxation.  Having watched it, I learned new techniques, and also realized that a few things I did in the past were not correct.Why 4 star then? In each section, Jeff repeats that rumbleroller is better than the regular roller, that black rumbleroller is 30%-35% firmer than the blue, and that beastie bar is better at getting into the muscles than rumbleroller, etc. etc. Imagine, listening to it once, twice, thrice....and ten times! You get an idea how boring it gets and how much time it wastes.

"During my 10 day xc skiing trip, I really fell in love with this little massage tool. I used it daily to massage my back muscles, should blades, shoulders and gluts. The relief I got from the massage was incredible.The ball really gets to the trigger points, way more targeted than a rumbleroller. I feel like a massage therapist pushing deep into my trigger points -- a bit painful, sore but rejuvenating.The self massage can be done on floor, in bed or on a couch (if the mattress and couch are relatively firm). The stand is useful for shoulder and neck massage on the floor. It keeps the ball elevated, thus makes it easier to massage the shoulder/neck and the feeling is more intense.I got the original (clear) one. It has the perfect firmness and give.

With the KR rack on the WMF trivet, food is away from the water and double rack cooking is possible.The reason why I give it a four star is because it is not as good as the trivet for WMF Perfect Ultra pressure cooker (only available in EU and Asia).

"This review is from: Kuhn Rikon Family Style Pressure Cooker Stockpot 12 Quart (Kitchen)I grew up with food cooked in the old style pressure cooker in China, but never wanted to use it myself because it didn't look safe - steam hissing out of the valve that looked about to fly into the ceiling at any moment. But recently, a friend of mine in China (who owns both Fissler and WMF Ultra) convinced me that the newer pressure cooker is a totally different game. It makes cooking super fast and food comes out delicious. Tempted, I decided to get one also. The short version is that I got Kuhn Ricon Family Style pressure cooker 12 qt. Cooking with it is easy and fast, and food indeed come out extremely good! Below is the long version of the comparison between different makers and different sizes.In terms of the maker, the top 3 contenders are: Fissler, WMF and Kuhn Rikon. WMF only sells their entry level model (""Perfect Plus"") in the US and it is getting mixed reviews. The improved model (""Perfect Ultra"") is better and more durable but not available in the US. Fissler seems to have similar issues as WMF ""Perfect Plus"": its plastic handle is prone to cracking. So I decided to go with Kuhn Rikon (KR) which is all steel and old style mechanics, but really durable and foolproof with 5 different safety features.Once I decided on the maker, choosing the right size was another challenge. The measurements on KR's website are a bit confusing and incomplete. After talking to the customer service, I got the following dimensions:stockpot 6qt: 8.75"" ('), 7"" (h), 8 lb.stockpot 8qt: 8.75"" ('), 9"" (h), 8.5 lb.family style 12qt: 11"" ('), 6"" (h), 12 lb.Note: Add 2.5"" to the height with the lid on. Actual capacity is 2/3 as you can only fill the pot up to its 2/3.After getting KR Stockpot 8qt initially and then exchanged it with a Family Style 8qt, I come to the following conclusions:* Stockpot 6qt: ideal for small family and small serving sizes, but too small to make 6 servings or large batch of stocks.* Stockpot 8qt: 2"" taller than and same diameter as the 6qt. The shape is not practical -- very tall and narrow -- other than having an extra 2qt capacity for making stock, you can't do much more than what you can with a 6qt pot.* Family Style 12qt: It is much heavier with a thicker rubber ring and a much larger cooking surface. I find it to be the most versatile for making different foods with different methods (steaming whole fish, whole vegi, making stocks, browning large cut of meat, etc.), and great for double-deck cooking (cooking something in the pot and steaming something on the rack). Downside: not ideal for making small serving sizes. A cup of water just covers the bottom. My way to get around it so far is to steam the smaller serving such as a cup of rice in a bowl instead of cooking it in the water.If I could have two pc, I'd get a 6qt stockpot and a 12qt family style pot. But if I can only have one pc, I prefer the family style pot for its flexibility.The pressure cooker is very easy to use:* bring the content to boil, the valve on the lid starts to rise, pressure starts to build up in the pc.* To adjust the pressure: the valve has 2 red rings, ring I - lower pressure, ring II - higher pressure. Once the pressure reaches the desired level, turn the heat down to maintain the pressure level (about 2-3 on my induction cook top). When the valve rises to 2.5 rings level, the valve will automatically let the steam out with a hissing sound.* To close the lid: unlike other pc, KR has short handles which are great for storage. Initially, I was concerned about whether it could be opened and closed easily. Once I used it, my worries went away. There is an arrow on the lid. Position the lid so that the arrow points to the handle, twist, it closes.* To de-pressure: 3 modes: 1) fast: less than 30 sec. by rinsing the rim of the lid with cold running water; 2) normal: about 1 min. by pressing the valve with a spoon; 3) slow: about 10 min. by letting it cool down naturally. The above time is based on steaming with very little water in the pc. If you have a lot of liquid food in the pc, it will take a bit longer.A useful accessory for steaming or double-deck cooking: WMF trivetThe rack that is included in the KR pc only stands to 1/4"" tall. WMF trivet is about 2"" tall. With the KR rack on the WMF trivet, food is away from the water and double rack cooking is possible.Update: I have been using this regularly for almost a year and I love it. The size is perfect for the two of us. It is truly versatile for both small and large portions. I find that it is unnecessary to steam the small amount of rice in a bowl. I just cooked it the pot, 1 cup of rice. No problem at all.A tip for cleaning: I am often too lazy to clean my pot immediately after use. As a punishment, food/sauce dried up and became difficult to clean. In that case, I put some water (say 1/2 cup or 1 cup) in the pot, cook it with pressure for a few minutes. The high temperature and steam always clean up the dried up stuff without fail. Then I just need to wash/rinse the pot. No scrubbing is needed.Pictures: the tall one is 8qt, the other 12qt","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IN4JHYZ2GWC8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009A9XT#wasThisHelpful","R2IN4JHYZ2GWC8","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

After talking to the customer service, I got the following dimensions:stockpot 6qt: 8.75"" (), 7"" (h), 8 lb.stockpot 8qt: 8.75"" (), 9"" (h), 8.5 lb.family style 8qt: 11"" (), 6"" (h), 12 lb.Note: Add 2.5"" to the height with the lid on. Actual capacity is 2/3 as you can only fill the pot up to its 2/3.After getting KR Stockpot 8qt initially and then exchanged it with a Family Style 8qt, I come to the following conclusions:* Stockpot 6qt: ideal for small family and small serving sizes, but too small to make 6 servings or large batch of stocks.* Stockpot 8qt: 2"" taller than and same diameter as the 6qt. The shape is not practical -- very tall and narrow -- other than having an extra 2qt capacity for making stock, you can't do much more than what you can with a 6qt pot.* Family Style 8qt: It is much heavier with a thicker rubber ring and a much larger cooking surface. I find it to be the most versatile for making different foods with different methods (steaming whole fish, whole vegi, making stocks, browning large cut of meat, etc.), and great for double-deck cooking (cooking something in the pot and steaming something on the rack). Downside: not ideal for making small serving sizes. A cup of water just covers the bottom. My way to get around it so far is to steam the smaller serving such as a cup of rice in a bowl instead of cooking it in the water.If I could have two pc, I'd get 1 6qt stockpot and 1 8qt family style pot. But if I can only have one pc, I prefer the family style pot for its flexibility.The pressure cooker is very easy to use:* bring the content to boil, the valve on the lid starts to rise, pressure starts to build up in the pc.* To adjust the pressure: the valve has 2 red rings, ring I - lower pressure, ring II - higher pressure. Once the pressure reaches the desired level, turn the heat down to maintain the pressure level (about 2-3 on my induction cook top). When the valve rises to 2.5 rings level, the valve will automatically let the steam out with a hissing sound.* To close the lid: unlike other pc, KR has short handles which are great for storage. Initially, I was concerned about whether it could be opened and closed easily. Once I used it, my worries went away. There is an arrow on the lid. Position the lid so that the arrow points to the handle, twist, it closes.* To de-pressure: 3 modes: 1) fast: less than 30 sec. by rinsing the rim of the lid with cold running water; 2) normal: about 1 min. by pressing the valve with a spoon; 3) slow: about 10 min. by letting it cool down naturally. The above time is based on steaming with very little water in the pc. If you have a lot of liquid food in the pc, it will take a bit longer.A useful accessory for steaming or double-deck cooking: WMF trivetThe rack that is included in the KR pc only stands to 1/4"" tall. WMF trivet is about 2"" tall. With the KR rack on the WMF trivet, food is away from the water and double rack cooking is possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EPO2J29EAU22/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003R2QYIA#wasThisHelpful","R2EPO2J29EAU22","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I grew up with food cooked in the old style pressure cooker in China, but never wanted to use it myself because it didn't look safe - steam hissing out of the valve that looked about to fly into the ceiling at any moment. But recently, a friend of mine in China (who owns both Fissler and WMF Ultra) convinced me that the newer pressure cooker is a totally different game. It makes cooking super fast and food comes out delicious. Tempted, I decided to get one also. The short version is that I got Kuhn Ricon Family Style pressure cooker 12 qt. Cooking with it is easy and fast, and food indeed come out extremely good! Below is the long version of the comparison between different makers and different sizes.In terms of the maker, the top 3 contenders are: Fissler, WMF and Kuhn Rikon. WMF only sells their entry level model (""Perfect Plus"") in the US and it is getting mixed reviews. The improved model (""Perfect Ultra"") is better and more durable but not available in the US. Fissler seems to have similar issues as WMF ""Perfect Plus"": its plastic handle is prone to cracking.

The size is perfect for the two of us. It is truly versatile for both small and large portions. I find that it is unnecessary to steam the small amount of rice in a bowl. I just cooked it the pot, 1 cup of rice. No problem at all.A tip for cleaning: I am often too lazy to clean my pot immediately after use. As a punishment, food/sauce dried up and became difficult to clean. In that case, I put some water (say 1/2 cup or 1 cup) in the pot, cook it with pressure for a few minutes. The high temperature and steam always clean up the dried up stuff without fail. Then I just need to wash/rinse the pot.Pictures: the tall one is 8qt, the other 12qt","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5YYON50JNDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001A08VPK#wasThisHelpful","R3K5YYON50JNDV","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to find the best mask for the terrible air pollution in Beijing China. After several days of research, I narrowed the choices down to 3 brands: 3M 95N, Totobobo (Singapore) and Respro Techno (UK).pm2.5 refers to particulates smaller than 2.5um (A hair's diameter is 30 times of pm2.5). They are extremely harmful to lung and heart as they can penetrate deep into the lung and blood. 3M 95N stands out in terms of its technical superiority. It can remove 95% of super fine particulates (down to 0.3um). In comparison, totobobo does not filter out as many particulates according to a fit test done by Hongkong University, and Respro can only filter out particulates down to 1um (according to the very little technical spec.on its website).Any of 3M 95N has the same technical ability to filter out fine particulates. So the key is to find one that fits the best and wears the most comfortable. A basic one would be 8210V (V stands for breathing valve which lets the moisture out). 8511 is a step up that has better elastic band and a bit more rigid form. It is more durable than 8210V.I find the best to be 9211+. It is fold-able and individually packaged (great for travel or storing away). The nose band (made of foam) runs across the whole length. When formed around the nose properly, it provides a very good fit to the face. The mask fits both my husband (Caucasian) and I (Asian) very well.Understandably, the air flow is reduced while one wears the mask, but I don't find the mask overly suffocating or hot to wear. I am willing to sacrifice some comfort to protect my lung. Since I own the mask, I finds it also to be quite useful when doing some house cores.In short, I highly recommend it particularly if you are traveling to countries with bad air or working in a very dusty setting!Update: I recently spent 2 weeks in BJ and wore 9211 daily. It had a snug fit to my face and felt comfortable to wear. In comparison, 8210V is less fitting and also its rubber band less comfortable. In spring, air quality is better than the heating season. Still I found that the mask became blocked after one week and I had to replace with a fresh one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R328FQTK2QUCZS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AEXIS4S#wasThisHelpful","R328FQTK2QUCZS","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I liked my Oxo until it broke. The digital display progressively stopped working. After a lot of research, I chose Soehnle 67080 Page Profi Kitchen Scale and I am absolutely delighted to have found it.Like Oxo, it can return the reading to zero so that you can weigh the next item. It can switch between lb. and g. Though Soehnle's switch button is on the back side, not as convenient as Oxo that has it on the front, it has not been an issue to me.What I like particularly about Soehnle in comparison to Oxo:- Sleek design. It has slightly larger weighing surface which is nice. Oxo is bulkier and heavier.- Tempered glass top that is very easy to wipe clean. Oxo's top plate is stainless steel. Though you can remover the plate to wash/clean, it always looks stained.- The hold function works perfect. You press hold, a beep sound indicates that it is on hold mode. Place item on the scale, another beep sound indicates that the reading is ready. Then you can remove the item and see the reading. With Oxo, you pull out the reading section to see the reading while the item is on the scale. It presents 2 problems: 1) if the item is too bulky and covers the pulled out reading, you still can't see the reading; 2) the pulled out part is connected to the main part by a thin wire that the electronics go through. I can imagine that the connection can easily go wrong with repeated use. Hot sure whether that caused my oxo's malfunction readings.- A minor point: Soehnle uses 2 batteries, Oxo uses 4.The hold function is very useful when weighing bulky items. This is the main reason I chose this model over Soehnle 66171.In short, if you are considering to get a scale, check out Soehnle. It is cheaper and better.

"Liu Sola is not your grandma's garden-variety of type of writer. This novel is short, but packed with content as varied as:- a foreigner trying to adapt to life in London- the cultural revolution and the personal cult of Mao Zedong- the gullibility of teenagers- female sex- the mixed joy of owning pets- bathroom habits and the downsides of drowning in an open latrine- a Chinese family surviving through tough times- ancient Chinese literature and poetry- the role of women in Chinese society and culture throughout history- a lot of other topics that I may have missed or forgottenSo yes, it is both chaotic and irreverent. The writing style changes around as often and abruptly as the subject matter. Thoughts, dialogue and description of events are wildly interspersed with each other and with quotations of poetry and children songs. Time, place, and actors change frequently and abruptly without warning. Reading this novel feels like watching a crass, noisy, and obscene reality show directed by a student film maker who has lost control over the cast and the story line. Occasionally I was tempted to to close my eyes and stick my index fingers into my ears to stop the pain.Yet, I have to say that I am left impressed by the novel and its author. Her literary take-no-prisoners approach is a match to themomentousness of the subject matter. It is a pity that she is so little known outside of China, and that so few of her works have been translated.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L3JNWILUEWZ5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=082481651X#wasThisHelpful","R3L3JNWILUEWZ5","A39JPI41M5Y1RB","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A39JPI41M5Y1RB?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Once upon a time there was this guy who had a good Nikon camera and lenses. But a D800 with a 24-20 lens is heavy and he has wrist problems from an old injury. He picked the camera up and dropped it resulting in a four hundred dollar repair. Then he started looking for a lighter setup and ended up with a Fujifilm X-E1, which he found made photography fun. Now he uses an X-T10, which is also a fun camera fro an old film shooter to handle.Now he ordered this lens from B&H. Lenses are fun to collect, but if they don't get used, well, the boss in the family gets a little testy. That won't be the case with this lens.It is the perfect compliment to his X-T10, small and lightweight, and light is very good for this shooter. The camera seems to disappear in his hands when he shoots. And the quality? Very, very good, even at f/2. At 5.6 it's great. And, for a Fuji lens it's reasonably priced. Also, as he expected from Fuji the build quality is excellent. Oh, and the focus is even faster than his 27mm that got stolen. This is his replacement and he's more than happy with it.Is it perfect? Nothing is. It would be nice if the lens were 1.4, but I honestly the guy is not a bokeh fanatic, wanting everything to have the shallowest depth of field. The focus ring is narrow and hard to use with gloves on. It's kind of a fingertip focus ring rather than a wrap your finger around it one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y6P50S5NHYG8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016S28I4S#wasThisHelpful","R2Y6P50S5NHYG8","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off this is a strange looking camera. My guess is that you'll either love it or hate it. Personally, I think it's so ugly that it's cute.I've been looking for a coat pocketable camera that will give me good quality files. I've tried to like the Sony RX100 cameras. They are certainly small and make good photos, yet I hate the lack of external controls. Canon has put enough controls on the outside of the camera that I don't have to drop into the menu system to change settings. As a Fuji user I'm used to old style controls and the G5 X comes close enough to duplicating that. I don't feel too limited. The controls are small but well thought out and not horribly cramped. Honestly, I doubt that anybody could do better with this size body.I've shot the battery down five times now in a variety of situations. BTW, that's one negative. The battery is only good for about 200 shots, maybe a bit more. I bought one extra and will get a couple more third party ones from Wasabi, which I've had good luck with.Printed at 11x17 inches the photos look good, much better than expected. I printed the same image taken with my Fuji, a Nikon D600 and the G5 X. Up too 800 ISO, and that size, there's not a huge difference in the prints. The Canon doesn't quite offer the subtle gradations or detail, but for most situations it's more than good enough. I think thats excellent for such a small camera. I won't replace my Fuji with it, but can have the Canon with me all the time. It's perfect for travel or street photography.Autofocus is not speedy, but not bad. The viewfinder is a bit small, but no smaller than the Canon Rebel. It's certainly usable. The image it offers is crisp, has good color and is not too contrasty.  The screen on the back is good and has touch focus, which I find I use a lot. I didn't realize that the lens lacked filter threads, that's a downside, but if I'm going to bother with filters, I'll likely use my bigger cameras. I haven't tried so see how many frames per second it shoots, because I don't shoot that way. This isn't a sports camera anyway.All cameras are compromises. Canon made some good choices with this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R321ST2T2334YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167Q0VP4#wasThisHelpful","R321ST2T2334YW","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You probably haven't heard of Marumi. The company doesn't have the high profile that B+W or Hoya enjoy. That's our good fortune, as the filters are  totally on the same quality level and can be had for a lot less money.This works nicely. I don't get the magenta tint that some cheaper variable ND filters offer. There's not any visible distortion or banding. As with any filter that gets as dark as this one, it's necessary to meter at a lower density, then calculate exposure for maximum density. The filter simply makes the view too dark for most cameras to accurately meter. That's not a fault, just physics.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34I3XB4RVJ0IW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0065SOI90#wasThisHelpful","R34I3XB4RVJ0IW","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I got to try a pre-production model for a few days and immediately put my order in to B&H. This is a great camera with a couple of exceptions.Bottom line:If you want an excellent stills camera that compact, light weight and reasonably priced. This is a great choice. It has very good autofocus, excellent color and a distinctive look. The camera is very customizable but can be beginner friendly. Fuji also makes superb lenses, which, in the end, may be more important than bodies. Cameras are improved every year. Those are the plusses. If you have big hands, want to do sport or wildlife photography or do high-end video, look elsewhere.Update after one month:I'm really loving the Fuji. I find it a bit small when using the 55-200 lens and am looking forward to getting the metal grip that Fuji promises. The rubbery coating on the body is great, very grippy and doesn't stain. I picked the camera up after picking blackberries. The grip didn't absorb the purple color that stains just about everything else. It's actually an improvement over the standard Fuji surface.Taking the time to fully customize the buttons really helps. Fuji left off the ISO dial, but by programming that function to the front dial, I can can click in the dial then change ISO without moving the camera from my eye. Excellent.Extended Review:Fujifilm photos look subtly different from those from other camera makers. That makes sense as they use a different sensor. I like the difference, especially when converting to B&W, which I think is one of Fuji's strong points. This camera uses the same sensor as other Fuji cameras so you won't find any revelations if you're looking for something different.Basically, it's a mini-sized X-T1. The shape is the same just smaller. The sensor is the same as are most of the controls. There are four main differences. The ISO dial is gone, but it's not a big deal. The front dial can be set to have two different functions, one normal and one if it's pressed in. I have the ISO set to change on press to ISO, so I don't miss the ISO dial at all. Having a kinda secondary mode dial in its place not only makes sense but is something I prefer. Note: I'm not saying that Fuji is better, just that I prefer it. Any interchangeable lens camera made to day can take excellent photos with a decent lens.The other difference is more substantial. The buffer size is pretty small, only 7 or so frames. That is a big deal to some. Since I don't spray and pray for my shots I haven't noticed. I was a newspaper photog for a few years way back in the stone age, before autofocus and when motor drives gave an amazing three frames a second. We also walked uphill both ways to school, 5 miles in the snow barefoot and powered our cars with coal. So I'm not representative of people getting into the field now. Anyway, that's a long and silly way of saying that I time my shots and don't count on a fast frame rate and big buffer. Your mileage will vary.The camera has great customizability and a lot of external controls, which should appeal to experienced photographers. It also has a switch that will put the camera in total program mode with just a flick, so this is a camera that I'd recommend to just about any person starting out. Image quality is excellent, easily the equal of any APSc sensor camera and honestly so close to my old Nikon D610 full frame camera that I don't miss the bigger Nikon at all. The Fuji has fewer megapixels but we've more that passed the point where any modern interchangeable lens camera is more than good enough for most purposes. Oh, the price is very reasonable for what you get, too. And Fuji kit lenses are better than other's.The only reason I'd point someone away from Fujifilm cameras is if they wanted to get serious about video. Fujis are good enough for most purposes but fall way short of broadcast quality. Look at Sony or Panasonic if you want video.This is a small camera. That's both good and bad. It's bad if you have big hands. You'll find that the controls are cramped. It's also bad if you want to use bigger lenses, like the 50-140mm. The camera doesn't have enough weight or bulk to counterbalance the lens. That brings me to the third difference. The X-T1 has a battery pack/grip available that makes bigger lenses much more comfortable to manage. I've shot the X-T1 with the 56mm and it balances well. With the X-T10 the lens is a bit front heavy.The fourth difference is that the X-T10 lacks weatherproofing. I suppose that if you shoot in the rain a lot or in dust storms that would make a difference. I've only had two weather sealed cameras in over 45 years of shooting and never had a problem, either professionally or backpacking in some pretty wild places. A little care will protect your camera and lenses.That's the negative. Personally, I'm not missing any of the X-T1's features, though I'll still use that for studio work. I won't miss the weight. It's funny that I complain about the weight of the X-T1 when it's so much lighter than the Nikon gear I used to use.An aging back makes weight a big deal to me, and I'm in love with the light X-T10. I used to carry two cameras, one with a 35mm lens and one with an 85mm. That worked for the newspaper and for landscape. You can probably guess where I'm headed. I use the 27mm Fuji pancake and the 60mm closeup lenses for most of my work. That's a hugely versatile pair, very light and compact. They both have the superb Fuji optics and  cover 90% of my needs. I do have the 10-24, the 18-85, the 55-200 and the 56mm lenses, which I do use. They all work fine with the X-T10.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30NRZ02GF5HLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7QTTKG#wasThisHelpful","R30NRZ02GF5HLM","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I are serious coffee drinkers. We have just about every kind of coffee maker available. She has settled on espresso drinks and needs a good quality grinder to be able to pull good shots. I mostly use an Aeropress, so my requirements are not as precise. We have an ancient Breville grinder that just doesn't give the consistency of grind that we need, so when Amazon offered the KitchenAid for review I jumped on it. As you can see, I'm a bit particular about my coffee. Part of that is living near Seattle, but I go so far as to roast my own beans.KitchenAid is not the first name that comest to mind when I think of coffee, but they do make top quality mixers and many of the basic components are similar, a motor and gears and a precision housing. That's exactly what this grinder offers. First off, it's beautiful, made of cast metal, probably aluminum and finished with a nice paint. It has that classic KitchenAid look, which we love. The grinder is a deep cherry red. That doesn't exactly fit in our kitchen but it's not bad. All the parts fit together smoothly and are nicely finished. the hopper and collector are both glass. The only obvious plastic part is the coarseness selector on the front. The grinder looks to hold about 8 oz. of coffee for grinding.The grinder offers 15 levels of coarseness or fineness, depending on how you look at it. Actually, it will grind from super fine powder to very, very coarse grounds, depending on how the internal burr tension is adjusted. The coffee grind consistency is good, which is important in a quality grinder and this is of good qualityOut of the box the grind was unusably coarse. The solution is simple: remove the coarseness adjustment knob on the front and twist a large nylon set screw to adjust the fineness. The external adjustment knob should be turned all the way to 8 before doing this. To make the grind as fine as possible, turn the grinder on (I put some old coffee in the hopper to see how the grind went.) and twist the adjustment screw knob to the right. Don't turn to hard as the part is not metal. The grind becomes a very, very fine powder. That's fine. There are 14 coarser settings. Then re-attach the external adjustment knob with the selector mark over 8 and screw the single set screw back in. I'm assuming that most people who use a quality burr grinder will want a fine grind as that's what's required for an espresso machine. Keurig needs a less fine grind, drip a bit less coarse still. If you're using something like a french press, the a coarse grind is fine. The grinder when set fine for espresso will grind a regular drip coarseness of coffee but not the very coarse grind I like for a french press (close enough though). That's pretty normal.That brings me to my first minor quibble. The screw requires a 4mm allen (hex) wrench which KitchenAid should have provided. They are dirt cheap and even a discount store self-assembly table comes with one. You will most probably need to adjust the burr tension at least once, and probably periodically. It's just silly not too include the necessary tool.My second quibble is that the grinder only has an off/on toggle switch. There is no way to grind a pre-measured amount, which I do. The freshest coffee is ground just before brewing. I grind my coffee after the water boils, using the time to let the water cool to the appropriate Aeropress temperature. I will learn how to time the grind eventually to get just one cup worth. If you are using a drip machine a little bit more or less coffee is much less critical than my one-cup-at-a-time method.If you are going to grind for espresso, you will need to experiment with grind. Your setting will not be some factory standard, nor should it be. Each espresso machine will have a slightly different optimal grind coarseness, which you will have to find by trial and error. This is not a shortcoming of the grinder. That's just how the process works. I'd suggest buying some cheap espresso roast beans to practice. Different coffee roasts create beans of different hardness, which will also affect the grind, so get close to the coffee you want but don't waste expensive beans until you get real close with the grind coarseness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RG4M471A1YFIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XPRQXRE#wasThisHelpful","RG4M471A1YFIX","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The basic premise of this mask is that it doubles as sound insulation. If you want to keep sound out get some earplugs. Hearos makes some good ones. The mask covers the ears with a fair amount of insulation, which is quite hot.The mask initially blocks light well, but the lack of elastic on the back makes it very easy to dislodge it.

"Road trips have provided the fodder for many photographers, especially in America. The Open road offers an excellent overview of the genre and places the major names in American road photography in context, both chronological order and with the major art photography world at the time the photos were taken. So, the book works as a history of road trips, yet it is much more. The photos that chosen for the book make for an attractive and compelling photo book on their own. The introductory essays for each photographer offer a nice introduction to their photography and methodology, though I do have to agree that the typography in those essays is awful. The ornamentation (not technically ligatures, which connect two letters) on the letter s is particularly distracting. Fortunately, that distraction pales when we get a look at the photos.Obviously, no one volume can cover all the good photographer who have published compendium of road trip photos. The classic photographers are covered, like Frank, Winograd, Friedlander, Eggleston,  Meyerowitz and Shore. The selection of current photographers is necessarily more a reflection David Campany's personal tastes. How could it be otherwise?The selection of images representing each photo book that he chose reflects nicely on the original source books, three of which I own. While no short selection of images can convey the breadth of the original road photo books, the ones here do reflect the tone of the originals and give enough of a sense of the photographer's work that we can choose which to pursue further.The printing is excellent. Colors look true to the films the photographers used. Black and white photos display a good tonal range. All in all, the prints are compelling. The binding is of good quality as is the printing.One feature that I love is an unofficial appendix that shows where each photographer made the original photos. There's a separate map for each photographer. This is a book that I will consult often and treasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TRM5JF5RTGZ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1597112402#wasThisHelpful","R3TRM5JF5RTGZ0","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been a while since I've gotten a new Photoshop reference and it changes quickly. Essential Skills came at a good time. It's an excellent manual for teaching basic to advanced skills for photographers. If you're looking to use Photoshop for graphic design look elsewhere. Having a bit of background with Photoshop would be helpful as Essential Skills goes over things like menus and palettes quickly. Descriptions are clear and the illustrations compliment the examples. The book offers access to a companion website that also offers 10 hours of video instruction, making this a good value. You could easily pay $99 for equivalent video instruction.As it should, this book starts photo editing workflow in Adobe Bridge and Lightroom as well as including RAW images in doing so. Workflow from RAW image to printing is covered in detail. Several projects are included along with working images that are available on the website. Current photo trends such as toy camera effects, HDR, and grunge processing are covered. If you are looking to learn Photoshop photo processing this is a great introductory manual.

"This product makes the vinyl of my two year old car look like it has just come from the detail shop, much better than the look I get from Armorall.

The car, a Nissan Pathfinder looks like it just came from the showroom (excluding scratches).So why not five stars? While the surfaces look fine, I had to get the plastic spotless. This does not clean at all. Also, it off-gasses nasty fumes, and requires plastic gloves for application, as well as needing a day or two under cover before exposing to the elements. Better have room in your garage.Is it worth it?  If the mentioned conditions work for you, your vehicle will look great.

"Most photo books describe how to take photos under varying conditions. Bruce Bamabum goes into making personal images, not by learning new techniques but by learning our own inclinations and, to use a currently trendy term, voice (my term - not the author's). Techniques and composition are mentioned throughout but not as ends in themselves. Rather both are put in service to personal vision and voice. As a friend of mine, Ray Ketcham says, ""Anybody can learn your technique. Only you can make pictures that reflect your voice."" For instance, we don't need to learn the rule of thirds to make ""properly composed"" images but because photos composed that way have certain impacts on the viewer. Is that what we want from a particular photo? Composition rules become composition tools in the service of how we want the image to display. Technical knowledge is always put in service to improving our craft not as an end in itself. Throughout the book Bambaum repeats the notion that photography is a skill and as with any skill practice, experimentation and making bad photos are necessary. Bad photos are not a negative, just something to learn from and if we don't make bad photos we haven't pushed out of our comfort zones. He makes the point that many of the worst photos he sees in workshops come from working pros who get into the habit of making commercially acceptable pictures not ones that reflect their vision. They forget how to experiment and take chances.Bambaum covers more than just technique, though. He emphasizes getting instruction from multiple instructors and workshops (we learn different stuff from each), getting feedback or critiques of your photos and how to take that feedback, as well as how to learn from classes and such. Yes, there is a section on technique and gear, as well as a discussion of printing. Yes, again, those are put in service to making personal images not as absolutes or must haves.Much of the book is relayed through the author's personal history. At times it's a tiny bit tedious but I don't know any other way to talk about personal process than personally. Bambaum shows a lot of his own photos. They are not all his most commercially successful images, rather ones that mean something to him and illustrate his points. That means that they may not all wow you, say, the way Joe McNally does. That's part of the essence of photography, too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RW54NRNE4C9ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P71YLD4#wasThisHelpful","RW54NRNE4C9ZJ","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is described as a photo printer. It will print photos, from a phone or camera, from a computer but not economically. And, they look okay. However, It only has one color cartridge, which for a printer in this price range is not optimal. For something under $100, one cartridge would seem okay but the much higher cost of replacing all the color inks whenever one runs out just doesn't make sense to me.The printer has two paper trays, one for 8.5 inch wide paper and another for smaller sheets. That severely limits the quantity of paper that it can hold of either size. I can see that if this was mainly used for a photo printer but I've already described my problem with that use.Other than the major problems, it's actually a nice unit. It prints quickly and quietly. It prints both sides of the sheet and will scan and copy. It even has a fax built in. It's network ready for Wi-Fi or cable and will print from phones or tablets. As long as it sees light color ink usage, its a serviceable full purpose unit. Just watch the ink usage.

I took an extension cord out to our driveway and a hair dryer to soften the shields. It's spelled out in the instructions that came with them. Just soften the plastic so it molds to the shape of the indention behind the handle. Line it up with the door and the other handle on the same side. Then put it on and smooth out any bubbles.

"Okay, it's a cable and it works. That should be enough. I'll give a quick response to other reviewers that complain about the price of this compared to other's available on Amazon. Without cutting it apart I'll have to assume that the cable has wires of higher diameter than the super cheap no-name cables available.

As this cable would mostly be used in a permanent installation that shouldn't be a problem for most people.

"I like the OXO Professional knives. This is the fourth in the series I've gotten. They are decent knives and provide provide good value for the cost. The handle on the 6 inch utility knife features OXO's trademark grippy material. It's nicely shaped to the hand and is easy to hold. The blade came sharp and I expect it to hold a decent edge as the other knives in the series do. It has a full tang, which should keep it from coming apart and is a good all round shape for many jobs. I find the blade just a bit light for my taste. As long as a knife is not too heavy a heavier blade helps cut. This will cut but requires a bit more muscle behind it than I normally prefer. My favorite utility knife is the 6 1/2 inch Santoku, though many might find this more european style blade preferable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZV9JM4FI440Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13ODO#wasThisHelpful","R1ZV9JM4FI440Z","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works for me. I love the combination of protein and fiber. I add it to my morning cereal along with some ground flax and cinnamon. I like the nuttiness that this and the flax add to the cereal. It does leave the sides of my bowl green.When I use this for smoothies I find it a bit grainy. I don't think the protein powder dissolves. Rather it goes into suspension. It all works in the body. If you're looking for a smooth smoothie you might prefer something that dissolves better. If you like the benefits of fiber and protein mixed in one product, I don't know of any protein powder that offers as much fiber. That's an important consideration as we age. I can attest to that.  As with any food, your taste and preferences may be different. As I don't like the aftertaste of whey and egg based protein powders, I prefer to use a plant based product.When I want something that mixes well with fruit and dissolves completely, I go with PlantFusion protein powder. That is a more traditional type of powder that does dissolve. It also works well with dark berries as an after workout drink that banishes muscle soreness.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJ9XNNQ7BTWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012C2GFM#wasThisHelpful","R3HJ9XNNQ7BTWB","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As with most of the series, the Photoshop CC Missing Manual is big. It covers a lot of material, most of what the normal, even power user needs. The descriptions of how to use the various aspects of Photoshop are well written and easy to follow. There could be more screenshots but the text is clear. This is a reference book, not a tutorial. If you would like recipes, books like those from Scott Kelby Or Adobe's Classroom in a Book series would be a good place to start. I find that I often end up with a couple of books for a given program, one that teaches the program in a step-by-step manner and one for reference. The Missing Manual fits in the second category. It can be used to learn the program but doesn't prioritize the elements. With a program as complex as Photoshop you will use different tools much more than others. OTH, if I kind of remember how to do something and want a quick brush-up, then the Missing Manual is just the ticket. Or if you want to explore a feature that's new to you, browsing the Missing Manual would be a great place to start, especially as Lisa Snider's writing is so easy to understand but not condescending.When David Pogue started the missing manual series, he gave us thorough books at decent prices. The prices have inched up over the years to a point that the Missing Manuals are no longer less than equivalent books by other publishers, but the books still provide good and thorough coverage of their subjects. Since Amazon hasn't yet posted a look inside of the book, I'll include the TOC. You'll have to click the read more link to see it all.This is a long way of saying that this book is more than good enough for a general Photoshop reference or learning resource.

"I'm a fan of OXO knives. They offer nice, if unexciting, design, decent steel and reasonable prices. The paring knife fills out my collection of OXO knives. I once ran an dinner house restaurant and have owned good German and Japanese knives, some of which cost a couple of hundred dollars apiece. No, I'm not claiming that OXO knives go head to head with those. I'm just saying that I do understand working knives. Now that I just cook at home I find that the extra production advantages that top knives offer just aren't necessary. As I'm not knife proud, I'll use any tool that does a good job. This OXO paring knife does that.I would prefer a smaller blade as I generally use a larger knife, currently a 6  inch Santoku for my general purpose knife and only use a paring knife when I need a sharp point. However, many people prefer a smaller knife as their general purpose blade and for those people the longer blade is probably preferable as it is more versatile. That said, this is my second copy of this knife. I've been using the other for a couple of years. The blade takes and holds a decent edge. No, it isn't quite as good as a top Japanese knife, but more than adequate for home needs. It is also easy to sharpen. I can be washed in the dishwasher, though that is not good for the edge. Just don't do that and you'll have a tool that should last for years.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPZRCXEAWYC95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13OCK#wasThisHelpful","RPZRCXEAWYC95","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't pay for this knife, but got it free in exchange for this review. I still look at price when evaluating products and this slicing knife is a decent knife at a decent price. I own three other OXO Professional knives that I did pay for, a 4 and a 6  inch santoku knives along with a 3  inch paring knife. I expect this to be the same quality. I used to own a restaurant and had professional chefs working for me. I've owned some very expensive German and Japanese knives. I honestly don't need knives of that quality as my knives don't take the day-in day-out many hour use that professional knives need to stand up to. No, OXO knives are not as good, but they are plenty good enough for the vast majority of home cooks. That is, if they are taken care of.While the knife will survive a dishwasher it is best taken care of with careful hand washing and drying. That's true of any knife, but high end knife buyers know this. This knife is of sufficient quality to benefit from proper care.The knife came sharp out of the package and looks nice. It has a grippy handle that fits the hand well. OXO knives come in a medium grade stainless that will hold an edge for a reasonable amount of time. The steel is hard enough to hold up to use but soft enough to take a quick edge. The handles feature the good ergonomics that OXO is famous for. At this price, I don't know of a better knife.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DXAHR11Y930C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000A13OE8#wasThisHelpful","R2DXAHR11Y930C","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a well built cable. It looks nice and has a nice thickness to the flexible cable. At first I wasn't going to get this cable. The purple color put me off. Then I realized that the color would help me keep cables straight. I keep an old Apple cable for my iPad, a newer Lightning cable for my iPod touch and a micro USB cable for my phone. I was using Amazon Basics cables for all the items in my car. That led to a bag full of black cables. I've switched the Amazon Lightning cable for the Apple one. That's white. Now I have the purple one for my iPad and the black micro USB cable for my phone. No problems separating them when I need to connect or charge a device in the car.My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the actual connector. It's a tiny bit larger than the Apple one and requires a bit more force to insert. That's a lot better than the sloppy loose one I picked up in a truck stop but requires me to use two hands to insert. The other tiny thing to pick on is the side that Belkin placed their logo. I'm used to thinking of the logo as indicating the side to insert up. It's not on this cable. Neither complaint is a big deal and shouldn't interfere with the function of the cable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBLOBQS2NVMSB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EOEAOD6#wasThisHelpful","RBLOBQS2NVMSB","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LED light bulbs have finally become reasonable replacements for the old incandescent bulbs. While the initial price of this is still a bit high, the Kobi bulb does a good job of matching the warm glow of older light bulbs. The color is nice and yellowish, not that blue that older LED bulbs gave off. The bulb is advertised as shatterproof. I won't test that, but it might survive a normal drop as the thing is made of plastic. The only major down side I see is the weight. This bulb is probably too heavy for many lamps. It works great in an overhead recessed fixture.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SIFDN2BEJMMP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K3O1U2K#wasThisHelpful","R2SIFDN2BEJMMP","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I quite enjoyed this book. It's one of those that can be quickly read in an evening yet which invites one back to savor the photos and the narrative. Being more about awareness than skills it can only point the way toward the kind of seeing that Julie DuBose describes. This is on an objection. Getting out of our preconceptions is an ongoing process. There's no way to measure or test it.The photos are beautiful, offering a study in simplicity. Very Zen like. I see the expression of mind an eye. What I don't see is a lot of heart. Line, color, shape, form, even simplicity all jump from the pages. These would be wonderful teaching photos in a study of composition. I don't get that much connection to the subject matter. Oh, I appreciate the photos. I see a lot to learn from the way of seeing put forth in the book. Yet, the images are more abstractions of aesthetics than heart-full.There's a sort of clinical distance, less than in Ms. DuBose's partner and co-teacher's book, ""The Practice of Contemplative Photography: Seeing the World with Fresh Eyes"" As a long time meditator I can see the personal value in learning to see in this way. As an appreciator of photography I find something, a small something, true, missing. We see more of people's feet and legs than faces. As a personal contemplative/meditative practice, I see great value in photographing this way. The photographs that come from this practice have lovely form but seem lacking in compassion or connection.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJPUB2Q66IJLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=098597740X#wasThisHelpful","RJPUB2Q66IJLK","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I typically don't take books for Vine reviews because I feel bad not giving aspiring writers great reviews. When I read the first chapter of Traitor's Blade I felt enormous relief. The book starts wonderfully and the author pulled me in immediately. The page by page, even scene by scene, writing works well, especially for a first book. It's when I step back from the book to review the overall story that I have problems. I'll try not to give any over spoilers but will have to at least hint a plot points to offer a thorough review.First, I hate when the climax of any novel resorts to deus ex machina to clear the protagonists from a seemingly hopeless situation. Without offering specifics I will state that this happens here. Our heros are saved not by their own efforts but by a totally unexpected outside source. Boo.Second, the world building is thin. We are given the Barons as baddies. No problem with that, but after that it's ""other lesser nobles."" We miss on details such at that throughout the book. The kind of details that potentially make a story rich get glossed over, even the great cloaks that figure so prominently through the story. Besides the fact that the described cloaks wouldn't work as thin as the leather would have to be to be a reasonable weight. Well, thin leather wouldn't be bad if the coats weren't also used as a sort of armor that can turn or blunt sword blows and crossbow bolts. ""Thin"" plates of ""some kind of bone"" supposedly enhance the armor capabilities. Again, bone thin and light enough to work in a comfortable and light enough cloak wouldn't provide much protection.This description of the cloaks may seem to be a petty point. I'll grant that. But that leads me to another plotting  hiccup. At the beginning of the book, current action scenes are alternated with back story. That was enough to take me out of the flow enough to notice the little niggling details that a fast plot can sometimes gloss over. There's a reason why the alternate current and previous timelines are not used this way in an action story, and it's the break in reader absorption such as I experienced.Some other picky little points. The story features pistols in the plot. Okay, those existed at the same time as swords. However, there are no longer guns such as muskets or blunderbusses mentioned. It was the rifle length guns that were developed first. Pistols came later. Also, the pistols in this story fire steel shot. That's wrong in so many ways it makes me cringe. For this review's purposes suffice it to say that such was never used, and for good reasons.Finally, I absolutely could not believe the final scene revelations of and about the Tailor or her secret plans. It just doesn't come close to hanging together. I'd say more but that would be a real spoiler.If this were a submission to a publisher, I'd say that there's enough good writing and plotting to send the plot to a story editor. As a finished manuscript, no way.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LKOFVLH9W76O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623658098#wasThisHelpful","R3LKOFVLH9W76O","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:* The pen works as advertised. It allows for hand writing files that get transferred to an iPad or iPhone via Bluetooth.* The files can be sent automatically to Evernote, which makes them available from any networked computer, phone or tablet.* Accuracy is very good.* The included leather folio is classy* There's a spare pen tip included* The pen looks nice, if a bit big.* The pen will record thousands of pages when not synced to a device.* A one year subscription to Evernote Pro is included.* The pen writes smoothlyCons:* The pen only syncs with recent versions of iPhones or iPads. It won't work with my Android phone, even though the phone has the right Bluetooth radio built in and supports Bluetooth 4.* The pen is slick and shows smudges almost instantly. It would be easier to hold if there were a rubbery grip and smaller.* A couple of times when I turned the pen on it caused my Logitech Bluetooth keyboard to disconnect. This is not a consistent behavior.* Even though the pen will work without a device to connect to and store lots of pages, that fact isn't stated in either the quick start guide or the downloadable online PDF manual.* The pen has a clip but is too long to fit in a shirt pocket.* While the pen can be used to sync audio recordings to written notes, there's no microphone built into the pen. The recording is actually done via a synced iPhone or iPad. That's not stated in the description and doesn't work the way other Livescribe pens do.* Ink refills are small and have limited capacity. They are also pretty expensive.* The pen lacks a USB charger and cord, though most of us already have that from other devices.Some thoughts:I got this as a Vine review product, so didn't pay for it. After using it for a couple of weeks, I'm finding that the Livescribe Smartpen is very useful, and would buy it, though not the Pro Edition. I love being able to take notes longhand. I just didn't grow up using my thumbs for text input and I like to mind map ideas and projects. The Livescribe lets me to that and have the notes available to carry around in my iPad. I can even access the notes with my Nexus 5 phone, after I've entered them via my iPad.Even though the pen has a micro-USB hub for charging, it won't sync to a computer or Android device via USB and has to sync over the very latest version of Bluetooth, which limits its use to those who have newer iPhones or iPads. So, it's basically an iOS input device. That makes me want to rate the pen 3.5 stars. I drop one star for the lack of Android or laptop connectivity and a half star for its less than great ergonomics. I'm rounding down for the other small annoyances, none of which are deal breakers.I said that I wouldn't buy the Pro edition of the Livescribe 3. That's not because there's anything wrong with it. The difference in price is close to a year of Evernote Pro, so there's almost real down side. My concern is for the very nice leather binder / notebook. Simply put, it's heavy and bulky. I use my iPad as a laptop substitute because it is light and thin. I end up leaving the leather notebook at my desk, as I don't want to schlep its weight around. I got some Livescribe spiral bound notebooks that are much lighter and thinner and that fit in my Targus iPad bag.Bottom line - this is a useful tool for iPad or iPhone owners that has good but not superb implementation and design. If a decent Android app comes out, I'd gladly give the device 4 stars.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SJ8GO1TIZ7K5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FONJDZ6#wasThisHelpful","R2SJ8GO1TIZ7K5","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having read Crown Duel I was eager to read more about the Marquis of Shevraeth. There's some good stuff here but I'd have to say that this book has more of a narrative than a plot. The people are well drawn. The setting is well fleshed out, but there's little if any tension, simply description after description of what Shevraeth is doing and sometimes others.Shevraeth as he becomes known is an appealing character but he really doesn't do anything other than be conscientious and capable. There's no plot in the typical sense, just a series of scenes in which Shevraeth keeps applying himself to the situation and gets through. He follows other's direction and initiates not much of anything. He attends the command academy in Marloven Hess and does well. He really doesn't excel in anything but knife throwing. He isn't the best at anything else. He doesn't initiate any action. He does nothing to try to hold the girl he loves. He doesn't win contests. He just plugs along. When he comes home, he follows his parent's direction. He does it well, but again doesn't do anything other than go along and do a good job.

"I'm not an audiophile. I'm not willing to pay the premium prices that true audiophile gear commands, nor are my baby boomer ears capable of hearing the subtleties of music I could once discern. I've found that my needs can be met by earphones/earbuds in the $100 range, give or take. While, I got these earbuds from the Vine program, they are something that I'd now pay for.They are not perfect, though they are very good. Real bass lovers should look elsewhere. The XBAH1s have very clean and distinct bass, which is fine for me, but it is in no way enhanced. Actually, that's a pretty good description of how these things deliver music. The entire frequency range is very clear and crisp without any particular range emphasized. I'd say that they are similar to my favorite over the ear headphones the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone, which are used for studio monitors and have a very flat frequency response. This makes them very nice for a wide range of music. Classical and jazz are great on the XBAH1s, as are well produced vocals of sufficient audio quality. Having such clear sound reproduction makes low quality MP3 recordings sound pretty awful. Unlike some earphones that offer such clear treble and become fatiguing after a while, these are very listenable, though I wouldn't call the sound in any way warm.I don't like the foam filled silicone covers. The foam makes them too stiff for extended comfort and the silicone doesn't allow the foam to fully conform to my ear channels. Others have recommended the Comply TSX-200 earbud tips. I had a pair of Comply Tx tips in a drawer, I think the 200, that I tried and which make the XBAH1s very comfortable. Bottom line, very good earbuds with mediocre tips.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R178ONOJQIJ4T4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJISZFK#wasThisHelpful","R178ONOJQIJ4T4","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Obviously, a guidebook that covers six large states in 340 some odd pages is going to only offer brief descriptions, so I would consider this book to be a starting point for some interesting road trips, not a definitive guide. As long as one doesn't consider this to be definitive, it can be a very useful book. It is focused on road trips not long stays in any one place.I was actually surprised that there are many reasonably out of the way trips mentioned and some fairly obscure destinations. There are also some very busy spots including Grand Canyon, Zion and Bryce National Parks and Santa Fe, NM, as well as Sedona, AZ. As someone who went to high school only 40 miles from Zion National Park in Utah and who has a vacation condo in Prescott, AZ, this is home country for me. I'm an avid landscape photographer and there's an immense number of stunning locales covered in this book that I've visited.Some personal favorites include the Georgia O'Keffe country trip in New Mexico, The ""Loneliest Road"" on Hwy 50 across Nevada, and Utah's Scenic Byway 12, which includes the single most spectacular section of road (The Hogback) I've ever driven. A close second for spectacular views is also included, the Million Dollar Highway in Colorado. The latter two are not for those afraid of heights. This is just a start as there are enough beautiful trips here to last an avid traveler for decades. Don't forget that there's a lot of history here, too, from ancient native cliff dwellings to old Spanish towns to the American Old West of mining and cattle towns and the hideouts of fabled outlaws.On the down side, there really isn't enough information on any one place to do more than start one on planning, and some of the things mentioned are very touristy, such as the concrete teepees shown on the front cover. Also, there are a few inaccuracies I've caught such as the caption for the photo on page 99, which labels a photo of a bighorn sheep as an ibex and the photo of the Grand Canyon shown on page 80-81 that is outside of the described route. All in all, it's a useful place to whet a travel appetite for some great trips.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OE7IM9NGPEZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1741798124#wasThisHelpful","R1OE7IM9NGPEZJ","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have my Macbook set up to run Windows through VMware's Fusion. There are three programs that I use that don't work as well on a Mac as they do on Windows. Since I've retired, I really don't have a need for Quickbooks or Microsoft Office anymore. There are simpler Mac apps that will handle my personal needs just fine. The final holdout is Dragon Naturally Speaking.When Dragon bought the existing Mac dictation program and incorporated its voice recognition into it I was thrilled and went out and bought the first Dragon Dictate. I was immediately disappointed. Oh, the actual accuracy was good enough but the features for editing document simply didn't come near to matching the Windows program.Now, at version 4, Dragon Dictate has come closer, but unfortunately it's just not up to Naturally Speaking. Accuracy, when speaking through an entire section is excellent, actually better than my typing. That's the good news. The problem is that Dictate has a tendency to insert random extra spaces and isn't terribly smart at guessing when sentences are complete if the dictation is interrupted. I also have problems with Dictate not selecting prior words to correct. It's not consistently wrong, which is even more frustrating as errors are not predictable.OTH, using Dragon Dictate for system control works well, though that functionality is built in pretty well into OS X. I wish that I could replace Dragon Naturally Speaking on Windows for Dragon Dictate. Maybe next version.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C9NVCOLWWZKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IP93PV4#wasThisHelpful","R1C9NVCOLWWZKG","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this box of tea more or less on a whim.  When I looked at the ingredients I was a bit hesitant as I'm not a big fan of licorice in teas. It didn't cost me anything so why not? Well, I'm pleased to report that the I enjoy the flavor of the tea and the licorice flavor is very much in the background and adds a bit of sweetness without the strong licorice aftertaste.As to how it works - it does a nice job at being a mildly relaxing infusion. It's not going to knock anybody out, but it does provide a gently relaxation, which is perfect before bedtime.

"Sony makes some great cameras in the NEX series. They even make some pretty good prime lenses up 50mm. That's okay for portraits as it comes to the same angle of view as a 75mm. However, it still has the same neutral compression as a 50 that it really is. The NEX 55-200 is not something I'd use for portraits, so it comes down to third parties to provide portrait lenses.The Voigtlander 75mm comes out to 112.5mm in effective focal length. That's not a standard of any kind but I've used a both a 135mm and a 105mm for portraits in full frame so splitting the difference is just fine, and perfect for tight head and shoulder shots. And this is still a 75mm lens with that very slight compression that can flatter facial features. The Sigma 60mm is a nice lens, too, and probably the best lens for the money I've found for the NEX system, but it only opens to f/2.8 (4.0 full frame equivalent), which doesn't always provide a shallow enough depth of field.The Voigtlander Heliar 75mm is sharp wide open and very, very sharp at f/5.6. It has wonderfully smooth bokeh, which I'd expect from its 10 aperture blades. It can also make nice starbursts when aimed at a light source and stopped down. Contrast is wonderful as is saturation. It seems extremely well built and all the focusing ring moves smoothly, the aperture ring has nice firm tactile clicks.  I think that it's a great lens for the money.Obviously, this is a manual lens and needs to be shot with manual settings and manual focusing. Since Sony has put excellent focus peaking in the NEX cameras, that's easy.I've ordered an M-mount adaptor for a recently purchased Fujifilm X-E1 and am looking forward to using this lens on that camera, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D5TQT5XZ5IJD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0046EDB84#wasThisHelpful","R2D5TQT5XZ5IJD","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From a purely functional point of view this works very well. It makes the camera much easier to hold, especially as the Fujifilm camera lacks a good grip on the front. The set screw pushes against a pad that holds the grip in the flash shoe. That works well. Other makes of thumb grip that don't have the set screw can easily slide out and get lost. The one down side of the set screw is that it requires the allen wrench to remove the thumb grip whenever using a flash in the hot shoe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUX4KA2XW2Y72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GUGL3HM#wasThisHelpful","RUX4KA2XW2Y72","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First off, this lens is sharp, sharper than my copy of the Fujifilm 60mm macro or the 35mm f/1.4 that I borrowed to test. It's sharper than the X-100s. To be fair, you can only tell the difference at a pixel-peeping 100% zoom, but I've looked at dozens of shots of the same subject with each of these and the results are consistent.The 27 also produces very nice contrast and saturation. It's very light and compact. On my X-E1 it makes a package about the same size and weight as the X100S, which makes a very nice carry around unit.Is the lens perfect? Of course not. It's slightly slow to focus, however, if I were looking for super fast focus I would have a different camera than the X-E1. The field of focus isn't quite flat. That means if you're shooting a brick wall or poster the edges will be a tiny bit soft. Shooting in a three dimensional world it just means that objects a bit closer than the center will be sharp. I don't find that a problem.F/2.8 is a bit slow for a prime, though not bad for a pancake lens.  Images are ever so slightly cooler than my other Fuji lenses. I've made a custom preset in Lightroom to handle that at import.The other concern is cost. This is a very simple lens at a not inexpensive price. I got the lens during Fujifilm's lens sale at about half the current Amazon price. That was a bargain. At over $400 Fuji may be marking the lens up based on reputation rather than production costs. Still, know the lens as I do now, I'd buy it retail if I had to replace it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R332RBUJBE74JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DCM0DUU#wasThisHelpful","R332RBUJBE74JE","A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2UWPPU5GZLMQZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked this up on a whim, as a lightish read to pass time on the metro commute -- wish I hadn't. From the very beginning, it reads like a highly derivative attempt to update the classic Hitchock plot of an everyman who gets swept up in some intrigue that he has to unravel as the audience watches along. In this case, the everyman is a Los Angeles loser, a 30ish bro-ish telesales dude with a weekly basketball game and an anonymously good-looking girlfriend.He's whisked off by some people claiming to be US Marshals and claiming to put him in a witness protection program based on Catalina Island (off the coast of LA). Although what he's supposed to have witnessed is a mystery to him. There are some decent set-pieces where he tries to escape the Marshals a few times. There is a kind of lame subplot involving his relationship with the fake family that's part of his cover.The book seems to be trying to generate a sense of paranoia and surrealism, because the character doesn't know who's really who they say there are, and just what exactly the government is expecting of him. The writing just isn't very compelling, and when the veil is finally lifted and the big secret is revealed, it just all falls kind of flat.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAWXMC5UMH179/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399171649#wasThisHelpful","RAWXMC5UMH179","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The real Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este forms the backdrop for this hyper-violent action thriller graphic novel. Hats off to the creators for picking such a fertile setting for, what is essentially a very well-worn story of a mercenary hired to rescue an attractive young woman. The city is less than sixty years old, but due to its location on the border with Brazil and very near the border of Argentina, has blossomed into a commercial hub with more than 300,000 people living there. What makes it really interesting, however, is the mix of the population -- in addition to Paraguayans, there are loads of Brazilians, Argentines, Koreans, Taiwanese, Lebanese of all religious stripes, Iranians, and more. This mix comes alive in the extremely bloody story, which has the mercenary and girl on the run from several different factions of gunmen. The whole thing is kind of mash-up of The Professional, The Warriors, Terminator 2, Escape From New York, The Bourne Identity, and so on. Kind of fun if you like that kind of stuff with a high body count. The stark black and white artwork -- no greyscale -- fits the action perfectly, kind of reminded me of European comics from the '80s.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KOETUE26XUZ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620101467#wasThisHelpful","R2KOETUE26XUZ1","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This sequel to Hobbs' astonishingly assured debut, Ghostman, picks up the story of ""Jack White"", a cipher who wanders the world pulling off heists and killing time until the next job. Ghostman introduced us to Jack in a whirlwind 48 hour job in Atlantic City, intercut with flashbacks to a job gone wrong in Kuala Lumpur five years earlier. That narrative structure is repeated here, as Jack is jolted from his downtime by an urgent call -- this time from his mentor Angela, whom he hasn't seen since the Kuala Lumpur job. In the blink of an eye he's flying halfway around the world to help her get out of a tricky situation in Macau (as featured in the recent James Bond film, Skyfall).Echoing the first book, this one is 48 hours of hotel break-ins, boat chases, twists and turns, and all manner of underworld details. It's these details that made the first book so engrossing (although to be fair, I have no idea to what extent all the details are true). Once again, Hobbs has crammed all manner of criminal process into the fairly basic story, from how to break into hotel safes, the proper use and disposal of burner phones, repurposing a limousine as a roving hideout, self-surgery on one's eyeball, the different levels of counterfeit dollars, triad godfathers operating out of hole in the wall food stalls, taping a gun to your body so that the tape won't interfere with the firing mechanism, and on and on.It's a fun ride, but it would benefit from a bit more character development. Jack appears to be motivated purely by thrills, and Angela is a just as shallow a character. Their relationship is key to the plot, but it's never given its due -- there's a flashback to their initial meeting which is kind nice, but there needed to be a bit more to build up their apparently non-romantic dynamic. Still, if you like thrillers with lots of procedural detail, you'll definitely want to pick this up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AFLIYMPVI3KM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385352646#wasThisHelpful","R3AFLIYMPVI3KM","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lewis is certainly best known for writing the novel that was made into the iconic Michael Caine film Get Carter (and, less well known, the blaxploitation film Hit Man). Apparently a very lonely and depressive person, he drank himself into the grave at a very young age, and it's hard not to see evidence of those demons in this, his final book. Brought back into print some 35 years after its initial publication, it's stiff stuff.The story revolves around a successful London gangster whose empire has just collapsed due to betrayal from within. The book opens with him hiding out in his beachfront safe house on the Lincolnshire coast about midway between Grimsby and Skegness. We then flash back to a few weeks or months previously, when his enterprise began to unravel. The book alternates between brief chapters titled ""The Sea"" (set in the present) and ""The Smoke"" (what went down in London). It's made clear that something terrible happened to his wife in London, but the details that have driven him to drink aren't revealed until near the end.""The Smoke"" chapters unfold in a semi-procedural way, as he strives to figure out which of his henchmen is the traitor, and whether or not a rival gang is involved. Meanwhile, ""The Sea"" chapters show a man going stir-crazy and slowly off the rails. Each set carries its own tension, and the writing is crisp and purposeful throughout, with crackling dialogue. Central to the story are the pornographic (and snuff) films the gangster trades in (and producers), which serve as his hobby, income source, and existential undoing.This is a page-turner, but not of the pleasurable variety. There is no one here to sympathize with, and one reads on with dread.

"I've read a lot of noir fiction, and read a lot of translated fiction, and I have to say that this Czech book, now available in English some thirty years after its original publication, just didn't do much for me. That might be because it's heavily grounded in the author's own terrible experiences in post-WWII Prague, where she had a pretty good life until her husband was swept up in a Stalinist show trial and executed. She'd already written a memoir of those times (Under a Cruel Star: A Life in Prague 1941-1968), but apparently inspired by her work translating Raymond Chandler into Czech, she took a stab at fictionalizing her plight in the 1950s.It's kind of noir taken to an absurd extreme, as the book opens with a murder investigation leading to the projection booth of a movie theater. Over the course of the book, we discover that one usher (the author stand-in) has a political prisoner husband, another is involved in espionage as a courier of sorts, another is a serial mistress, another is an informer (and is implied to be a pedophile lesbian), all of which culminates in political blackmail that leads to another death, and then another murder. The confluence of corruption is too relentless to really buy into, despite some moving scenes of domesticity and struggles to connect. More of a curiosity than anything I would really recommend to genre enthusiasts, and those interested in the era are probably best served reading the author's memoir.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNCUU9ST1CZO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954965#wasThisHelpful","RNCUU9ST1CZO","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This first in a graphic novel series hits a bunch of notes that I typically enjoy: police procedural, near-future sci-fi, gritty urban setting, and graphic storytelling. So why didn't I enjoy it more? The story more or less follows a German detective who's willingly transferred to an undesirable posting on The Fuse. Built as an orbiting energy platform, the five-mile long structure has somehow evolved into a city of half a million people. (I don't really get how energy is supposed to be transmitted between The Fuse and Earth, nor do I understand who would build such an expensive device so inefficiently that you could fit a major city inside it, but I'm more or less willing to suspend my disbelief on those points.)The detective has a body literally fall at his feet on day one, and he's immediately thrust into a murder investigation with a foul-mouthed older female detective as his partner. The story then unfolds in a series of familiar plot beats and twists and turns, including mayoral politics, secret siblings, infidelity, homeless victims that no one cares about, and the like. It's not that it's bad, it's just far too familiar -- it's like the plot points were taken from a 1950s potboiler and tossed into space. Somewhat predictably, the story ends with a large twist that sets up the next in the series.Unlike some reviewers -- I really liked the artwork, in fact, I'd say the artwork and coloring were my favorite element. On the whole though, I'm not sure it's one to rush out and pick up. By all means, check it out, just keep expectations in check.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC55S13GS3XLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632150085#wasThisHelpful","RC55S13GS3XLQ","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The modern conception of World War I is dominated by images of horrific trench warfare, poison gas, and swarms of men being mowed down by machine guns in the fields of France and Belgium. But it's always been the war's other arenas that grabbed hold of my imagination, especially the English and German skirmishes in East Africa (a good novel about the war there is William Boyd's An Ice-Cream War). About a decade ago, I read a highly autobiographical novel (Sardinian Brigade, by Emilio Lusso) set in the lesser-known front of the Italian Alps.This graphic novel covers that same arena, where about a million soldiers died over the course of about three years of fighting.Much as I was looking forward to this, I found it kind of muddled and hard to engage with. To be sure, there are some haunting panels of faces locked in horror and pain. But the book suffers from a lack of story, lack of context, and frankly, a cast of characters who are very hard to distinguish from one another. Admittedly, one of the themes of the book is how malleable nationality was in northeastern Italy, where territory shifted back and forth between Italy and Austria every few decades. But this is a more fundamental case of artwork and storytelling not communicating well. This becomes literal in one section where the lettering is done in a script in order to represent a letter, and its so tiny and hard to read that I almost stopped reading the whole book at that point. I kept going until the end, mainly because every few pages there was a striking image, but by the end I didn't feel like I read a story or been presented a message beyond a kind of ""war is hell"" cliche.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQPHJKW13A9V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1632151421#wasThisHelpful","R1IQPHJKW13A9V","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the urging of several people, I haven't checked out Nesbo's wildly popular Harry Hole series. I picked this one up partly because it's very short (even though it's been padded out to hit 200 pages you could easily read it in about two hours), and partly because I had conflated it with another Scandinavian book with the same title that I had heard was good (that one is a true crime book about the assassination of Swedish Prime Minster Olof Palme in 1986).In any event, this is a sparse story about a hit man working for Olso's leading heroin boss in the 1970s. As in almost every single book and film with a hit man as protagonist, the story sits lumpily in a broth of morality and existentialism. We get a backstory filled with predictable elements that ""explain"" how he became a hit man. And we get the story of the big job that forces him to confront what he's become, also full of predictable elements. There are some moments of comedy and some nice details sprinkled here and there that save the book from being a total loss. But it's also not one brimming with freshness and invention, and the ending is sure to confuse and/or annoy many readers. Totally skippable.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RNKMSDYRHLDI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385354193#wasThisHelpful","R3RNKMSDYRHLDI","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The ""Southie"" Boston crime story has been told plenty of times, by big time authors like Dennis Lehane and George V. Higgins, and big time directors like Martin Scorcese, not to mention lesser films like The Town (based on Chuck Hogan's Prince of Thieves). I was skeptical that this book would give me anything new on that world -- but it had been sitting on my bookshelf for almost ten years, so I figured I should finally either give it a shot or get rid of it. I'm glad I did, because it's a very keen and colorful example of the genre, likely to appeal to any fan of big-city crime fiction.Set in what appears to be the mid-1990s, the story revolves around ""Wacko"" Curran, the elder of two brothers who wholesale coke on behalf of local mob boss Marty Fallon. Wacko has his eyes on replacing Fallon in order to take a big step up the food chain, but to do this, he's going to need a war chest to pay off the right people when the time comes. Fortunately he's picked out a nice armored car to rob. Unfortunately, the police are clamping down on gang activity, and the Italians are causing trouble.What makes all this familiar territory fresh is the writing -- which comes from a guy from South Boston who went to prison for a decade for armed robbery. This keeps the story from being soupy and sentimental, or faux tough. The dialogue is real and the rhythms of daily life as a ""boyo"" are well-captured. One thing that's striking -- and true to life, from what I understand -- is how little money these guys actually make dealing drugs. For a crime novel grounded in reality, and not romance or pulp conventions, look no further.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Y9GZMWB2OZGZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1932112421#wasThisHelpful","R2Y9GZMWB2OZGZ","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up on an impulse, intrigued by some of the elements in the description: phosphorescent mushrooms, twins, runaway Russian au pair, contamination, zany actress, etc... These certainly sounded like the right building blocks for what the publisher describes as ""part screwball comedy"" (the other part being ""horror story""). But the author simply doesn't have the ear for screwball dialogue, nor the ability to capture the zest and pace of the genre. Instead, the book is far more modern-day horror -- not in the sense of spores from outer space. But rather the kind of horror that comes from unexplained events derailing one's comfortable existence, and the complete lack of recourse, and, to get really simple, lack of ""fairness"" in life. Hence the title of the book, which refers to both the insurance clause that negates any possibility of restitution for the victims of the glowing 'shroom infestation, and the general theme of the book that any of us can fall prey to the whims of fate. The execution of the story is really just kind of plodding and gloomy, in prose that entirely unmemorable. The book is set in Brooklyn and Manhattan, and I suppose those who enjoy books set in the NYC area might enjoy some of the New Yorkishness of some of the characters. Personally, I found nothing compelling in any of it, and would be hard-pressed to recommend that anyone try it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CTYXX9N5Q938/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307911705#wasThisHelpful","R2CTYXX9N5Q938","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Vietnam war novel comes from the pen of a former Special Forces soldier who apparently spent part of the war working with US-allied hill tribes to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The protagonist of the book has a similar task, leading elite long-range units in murky operations directed by shadowy men in Saigon. And when one of these shadowy men recalls ""Wingo"" to Saigon to assassinate a suspected northern Vietnamese spy, things start to go sideways for the special ops soldier.Without giving too much away, the plot drifts a little too deeply into sensationalism as it tries to pack too many themes and threads into the story. Wingo grew up on the Pine Ridge Reservation (of Wounded Knee Massacre infamy), allowing for lots of too on-the-nose parallels to be drawn about colonial oppressors, as well as explaining his skills in the field. There's also a running bit about a vision he had a youth that comes and goes throughout the story. The plot takes Wingo from jungle warfare, to urban murder mystery in Saigon, to prison escape from Poulo Condore island, to political thriller, and back to the jungle -- oh, and there's a romance thrown in.All of this is tossed together with attempts to underline the moral vacantness of the Vietnam war, resulting in a book that's trying to do way too much. When it sticks to the jungle scenes, the writing is pretty amazing. It's also quite good when in the back alleys and slums of wartime Saigon, areas not typically shown in the movies, as well as the scenes on the prison island. But on the whole, it's all a little too potboilerish to work for me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NIA3EVKU5KTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765307766#wasThisHelpful","R2NIA3EVKU5KTP","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Italian novella has the aspect of a thought experiment or writing exercise, more so than a traditional story with an arc, and as such, readers seeking a tidy progression to resolution will be frustrated. It reads almost as if a professor in a graduate creative writing or child psychology seminar had given the assignment to consider what might happen if a child raised by a single mother discovered his mother dead in bed one day -- and the result is this lengthy story by a gifted student.The first third of the book sets up the life of 10-year-old Luca, who lives up seven flights of stairs in an unnamed Italian city, with his depressive mother (his father was never in the picture). The other two-thirds detail his realization one morning that she died in her sleep, and the two weeks that follow, as he attempts to hide the fact that he is now an orphan. The book is concerned less with what he does, than what he thinks -- and in that sense, is a swirling piece of psychological horror.Since I was drawn to the book wondering more about ""what he does"", this left me a little disconnected. I've never been able to fully buy into fiction that is as interior as this is. There are basically a hundred pages where he gets up each morning, goes to school, comes home, potters around the apartment, plays with the cat, and has wild daydreams. I suppose to a certain extent, the book is going to fail or succeed with most readers based on how believable they find Luca's thoughts and reactions to be, as he rapid-cycles through denial, rage, hopelessness, and all the other stages, all while dreading the social stigma and practical discomforts of becoming an orphan. Personally, I needed more plot and story to draw me into Luca's plight.","2.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22XRA5E7QC3SH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770436854#wasThisHelpful","R22XRA5E7QC3SH","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read one of Link's collections years ago and really enjoyed it, so thought I'd give this new one a whirl. She's got a distinct voice and sensibility, but for some reason, the mix of nine stories didn't work as well for me as I recall with the earlier book. The sense of inventiveness and wit is there, along with plenty of interesting characters, but the execution is turgid and flat.It probably didn't help that my favorite story in the collection is the first one, ""The Summer People."" Its heroine is a contemporary teenage girl living mostly on her own in the countryside near a summer resort. Ever since her mother ran away, she's had to be the caretaker of a nearby home that is the lair for a tribe of capricious fairies. When the girl falls ill and is being nursed by a new friend from school, she realizes that she might be a able to take a break from fairy-caretaking... The other strong story is ""The New Boyfriend"", in which the friendships of teen girls is dissected as one gets a kind of animatronic gift that another had craved. Jealousy kicks in plays out in cunning and unsettling ways.In ""I Can See Right Through You"", an actor whose entire career rests on his appearance in a famous '80s vampire film goes to meet up with his old flame, who is shooting a ghost-chaser documentary series at an abandoned nudist colony. Weird, but not necessarily interesting stuff happens. ""Secret Identity"" recounts a teenager's trip to New York to meet up with a fellow online gamer -- again, not interesting enough to sustain the fifty or so pages it takes up. ""Valley of the Girls"" has a good premise, mashing up the Ancient Egyptian elite with Gossip Girl-like teens. Some fun stuff there, but the ending has the wrong feel, too much of a classic Twilight Zone vibe. ""Two Houses"" is a riff on classic ghost stories set on a drifting spacecraft, but is lacking in any kind of spark.""Light"" has a lot of potential, its protagonist works at a Florida warehouse full of people who have fallen into a coma-like slumber of unknown origin. It's a recognizable present, but one in which  alternate ""pocket"" universes have been discovered, and are travel to them is commonplace. Again, some interesting possibilities that never cohere over the 40+ pages. If you're a big fan of strange short fiction, you could definitely do worse than dip into this book -- but you might do better trying one of her earlier ones.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E3KSLYTRM21K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804179689#wasThisHelpful","R2E3KSLYTRM21K","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Heard good things about this author's spy novels, so I picked this one up. Wish I'd done a little research first, as it builds upon an earlier book (A Foreign Country), set about two years previously. That book introduces the protagonist and a number of the relationships that prove pivotal in this one. It's not that you have to have read the other book first, but this one would have been much richer had I had the earlier experience with the characters.The story involves the death of an MI6 agent based in Turkey, and the subsequent investigation. It's a little soap-operaish, as the dead spy had a long-term affair with the woman now running MI6. Since she doesn't want that relationship dredged up, she turns to a sidelined disgraced agent whom she is friends with, trusting him to keep mum on that aspect of the dead man's life.What follows is a plot that's quite heavy on the tradecraft of investigating, tailing, and uncovering a traitor, woven in with the redemption of the disgraced agent and his falling in love with a beautiful younger woman. It's a kind of uneasy mix -- not quite as deep as the classics of Le Carr, but not as fun as the entertainments of Fleming and the like. Smoking and drinking seem to serve as substitutes for character development, with the exotic backdrops as window dressing. It's not a bad book, but it's not particularly good either. Maybe if I'd read A Foreign Affair first, I would have been more invested in all the goings-on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19FVQWOTY4A4J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250020611#wasThisHelpful","R19FVQWOTY4A4J","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's long been my contention that workplaces are underutilized material for fiction, considering the ripe array of characters and intricate psychology that they usually contain. This short (you can read it in under two hours) Swedish book takes a modern white-collar workplace and by introducing one extreme character, mines veins of dark comedy. The story revolves around some kind of government agency known as ""The Authority,"" where some kind of files or forms are reviewed and coded. Bjrn is a new member of one unit, housed on a floor in an open office plan.He's an irritating, officious, (possibly sociopathic) prig, with zero social skills, who immediately makes all his colleagues uncomfortable. As an early example, when he sees a child's crayon drawing tacked up by a colleague's desk, he can't fathom why anyone would display such an inept work. Indeed, he finds himself so distracted by his the mere presence of other people and their individual tics, that he can't get his work done. That is, until he discovers a mysterious empty room in the hallway, a room that instills inner peace and mental clarity unlike any he's had. In that room he can perform great deeds of bureaucracy, becoming a shining star.The rub is that the room may or may not actually exist -- a question that throws the entire office into chaos. I suppose one could read this as an interesting treatment of ontology and the nature of truth -- but I'm not convinced it's actually that interesting. Most of the time ""Kafkaesque"" is used as a lazy $10 shorthand substitute for ""odd"" or ""strange."" However, in this case, the author is so deliberately invoking the tone and themes of Kafka that it's actually a fair usage. So, if that's your pleasure, definitely check this iteration out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LF5LCI0TP0YA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804139989#wasThisHelpful","R2LF5LCI0TP0YA","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no idea of where, when, or why I picked this 40-year-old sci-fi book up, but as I've making my way determinedly through my stacks of unread books, it came to hand the other week, and I breezed through it in a few hours. Actually, I'm not sure if calling it sci-fi is quite accurate, since it it has some features of fantasy (swords, warring queens, barbarian Norsemen, a bloodthirsty dwarf, an order of knights, etc.), but since it takes place on what seems to be a far-future Earth, millennia after some kind of post-industrial ecological collapse, and ancient technology figures prominently in the plot, sci-fi seems appropriate. I'm sure that if I were more well-versed in sci-fi, there's a precise label for this particular flavor of subgenre.In any event, the story concerns a warrior-poet who has retired from the elite brotherhood of knights he once rode to glory with. However, when the young queen is threatened by a rival from the northern lands, honor compels him to wearily strap on his sword and ride forth. The upshot is that the invaders have managed to find and activate some kind of ancient warrior-bots that give them supremacy on the battlefield. The old knight must seek out some of his old fellow-knights and embark on a quest for the ancient knowledge required to counter these terrible devices. A lot of the basic elements feel familiar, and I'm sure those more well versed in fantasy and sci-fi could embark on a great deal of ""reference-spotting"" of where certain things were borrowed from as well as what it influenced. For me, it reminded me of the classic Dungeons & Dragons module ""Expedition to the Barrier Peaks,"" which has a similar mix of swords and lasers.The book is a little unusual in that it's told from the perspective of the old knight, whose best days are long behind him. So, there's a whole history to the land and him and the other characters that gets alluded to, almost as if the book is actually the last in a series (Harrison would go on to write a number of books and short stories set in this world). The other thing that's distinctive about the book is the writing -- it's written in a very particular style, one that combines the florid and archaic with the modern and idiomatic. But instead of its feeling pretentious or forced, it feels fresh and of its own style. It's also kind of existential in a Blade Runnerish way, as the heroes refer to great past deeds and things they've seen, but also speak often of having wasted their lives.Finally, one of the key virtues of the book is its brevity. While some of the characters were a lot of fun, and others were left undeveloped (such as the main villain), it's nice to read a sci-fi book that's on the short side. I feel like every new sci-fi book I'm interested in is in the 400-500 page range, and suffers from bloat. It's distinctive enough that I'll probably read another in the same setting, just to see how it compares. Worth trying by those with an interest in the sort of new-wave sci-fi of the late '60s and early '70s.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3T3EC4M3U2AFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0380197111#wasThisHelpful","R3T3EC4M3U2AFH","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This debut novel about an Air Force fighter pilot in the Korean War was heavily based on Salter's own experiences. He flew a hundred F-86 missions during his 1952 tour and kept a detailed diary, which he drew heavily upon for the book. The story revolves around a seasoned pilot with a good reputation who is assigned to a combat zone for the first time. Although confident of his abilities and eager to prove himself, it's hard to become an ace (a designation awarded after five confirmed ""kills"") when the enemy doesn't come out to engage. As the story progresses, he grows more and more frustrated when his missions fail to result in enemy contact, and a brash younger pilot starts racking up the kills. (One of the most interesting aspects of the book is how the bureaucratic aspects of confirmation of kills plays out, and the PR benefits of fudging the truth outweigh all others. It's hard not to draw parallels with the ""body count"" legerdemain that became prevalent a decade later in Vietnam.) In many ways, the book can be read as a reflection on how life can sometimes be unjust in denying able and willing people the opportunity to prove themselves. Although I doubt this was intentional (Salter was only thirty when he wrote the book), it is a potent running theme. In that sense it's a ""war"" book in setting only, and is worth rediscovery. NOTE: There was a film made of it starring Robert Mitchum, but it's apparently quite different from the novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PS3GOAT880U3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375703926#wasThisHelpful","R2PS3GOAT880U3","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"-----------------------As with so many nonfiction books, the subtitle of this wide-ranging guide to soccer club teams from around the world is more hyperbole than accurate description. It is hardly an ""essential"" guide, there are few ""stats"", and many of the teams discussed are far from being ""among the greatest in the world."" Which is not to cast aspersions on the author -- everything I know about publishing makes me confident that the subtitle was massaged into place by the book's editorial and marketing teams. Just don't let it set the wrong expectation for you.What the book actually contains are nicely crafted 3-5 page overviews of major soccer teams from around the world. These generally include the club's origin story, brief history with special attention given to any glory years, and perhaps a story or two revolving around a particular well-known player or incident.Thankfully, the book avoids the temptation to concentrate too heavily on the major leagues or countries. For example, there are only about twelve English teams listed, and these include some not currently in the top tier (Wolverhampton, Notts County, Leeds). There are as many Brazilian teams covered as Italian, and only a smattering of Spanish and German sides. Most European countries are represented by a team, and there is a solid range of teams from South and Central America as well (plus six from America), and a smattering of Asian teams. Unfortunately, there are only two teams from all of Africa.Hardcore soccer fans who are well-versed in the top leagues may find much of the material old news, but I'd definitely recommend this for a teen or adult who is just developing an appreciation for club soccer and is interested in learning a little about the various teams on TV. Especially useful as a companion for international competitions such as the Champions and Europa Leagues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKNFQ8L5T2KV7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393349306#wasThisHelpful","RKNFQ8L5T2KV7","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I hate to use ""the Q word"", but this debut novel is indeed lightly quirky in tone, while also being sentimental in a way that's just the right side of mawkishness. At the heart of the book is 18-year-old Odeline, a hugely sheltered girl whose mother has just died, leaving her a chunk of money and no ties to anything. Since her goal in life is to become a world-class mime, she quite naturally uses the bulk of her money to purchase an old houseboat on the London canals.Moving into her new home, she quickly establishes herself as prickly, difficult, and wholly lacking in social skills. And while this makes her a somewhat unsympathetic protagonist, the larger issue I had was with the level of her naivet and unworldliness. At many point, Odeline's expectations and reactions read like someone moving to the big city in the 1950s, not the 2010s. If the book had been completely her story, I don't think I would have finished it.Fortunately, it's also the story of the people Odeline meets around the canal, from the dashing tattooed gypsy boatman, to the illegal Eastern European immigrant tending the cafe, to the alcoholic canal warden, and various other minor characters. Their stories are welcome interludes and interruptions to Odeline's story. The other main character is the boat she's bought -- as we get chapters devoted to its construction, use during WWII, abandonment, subsequent restoration, and ill-considered remodeling.The mix of all these elements was enough to keep me reading through the rough patches. One of these involves Odeline's quest to track down the father she never met, a reunion whose outcome is immediately obvious the moment he appears on the page, but the reader must suffer through nonetheless. In the end, it's a fine example of a feel-good, heartwarming story about regular folks of wildly different backgrounds making community and connections amidst the hustle and bustle of the big city. Cynics and misanthropes should avoid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IP21AKEB5DBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0871407442#wasThisHelpful","R1IP21AKEB5DBC","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up because it's about Palestinians and soccer, both topics I have an interest in. However, I was a little leery of it being a book pitched at teenage readers -- I was worried that it would either be too simplistic, or didactic, or mawkish. Fortunately, it is none of those things -- rather, it is a nuanced story with a Palestinian boy at its center that any reader can relate to.Karim is a pretty typical 12-year: obsessed with soccer and video games, constantly annoyed by his younger sister and older brother, and chafing at life under constant threat of military occupation and curfew in Ramallah. The story follows his new friendship with a refugee boy in parallel with his close friendship with a Christian schoolmate. Their antics are both entirely plausible, and utterly chilling in the stakes that are involved. What the book does best of all is portray the difficulty of trying to live a normal life, let alone build a future, in a place where an outsider's tanks might roll down the streets and destroy your school at any moment. To be sure, I suppose most would consider this a ""pro-Palestinian"" story -- but it's really a pro-humanity story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KD58SWE27PJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1931859388#wasThisHelpful","R1KD58SWE27PJ1","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked this up while on a trip to Indiana, mainly because when I travel I like to read fiction set in the area I'm visiting. The book's premise also caught my attention -- various colorful characters make their way to a famous annual bare-knuckles cage match tournament where the winner takes home $100,000. Unfortunately, despite it being a quick read, it's boring -- mainly because there is little to differentiate any of the characters or their actions.I have no issue with violence in film or fiction, and have enjoyed plenty of pulpy bloody action stories on screen and page. However, this book is and endless succession of hard men beating the living **** out of each other (and sometimes shooting, stabbing, clubbing, etc.), when they're not buying, selling, or using crank, or engaged in some other equally ""shocking"" activity (the lone female character of significance is meth-fueled sexpot). Various people have grudges against others, owe each other money, need to mete out revenge, and soforth, but there's nothing remotely engaging about any of it.Actually, what it sometimes most resembles is a video game where one can select from one of about six or seven characters and has to fulfill a series of missions in order to make it to the big showdown. The guy running the titular tournament even has a lair, minions, and associates, just like a video game ""boss"". The amount of punishment people can take in this book contributes a lot to the cartoony feel -- this is the kind of book where people who are shot will start yelling stuff like ""You <effing> shot me -- I'll <effing> rip your liver out and fry it for breakfast!"" (not an actual quote, but you get the idea), rather than scream in pain.I guess some readers could be fascinated by the portrayal of the hopeless poor underclass of modern America, but to me it came across more as poverty porn than anything else. (You could, I suppose, read it as all a big allegorical critique of modern capitalist America, but that's a more generous interpretation than I'm willing to give.) The prose style is also kind of abrasive -- there are a lot of sentences and turns of phrases that are ostentatiously ragged. Every now and then, there's a nice turn of phrase or twist of vernacular, but for every one of these, there are nine others that feel overly calculated.The book also features a very light line of the supernatural via one character, and references to this being just the start of something bigger. So I guess there's going to be a sequel, but I certainly won't be reading it.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18WACZ1J4QNCL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0374532893#wasThisHelpful","R18WACZ1J4QNCL","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up on the strength of its setting -- a retrofuturistic canal-chopped Arctic city called ""New Venice."" Ten pages in and I was enjoying the author's keen imagination, stage-setting, colorful elements, and playful language. Fifty pages in and I was getting a bit weary of the meandering introduction of the two main characters, a college professor and a city bureaucrat, both of whom may or may not be involved in some kind of underground dissident movement. And by 100 pages, my initial enthusiasm had completely petered out -- nothing was happening...I will grant that when crafting a trilogy in a fantastic setting, authors often need to do some world-building. However, the start of this book suffers from too many details and not enough action. To be sure, there's lot of cool stuff involving mind-altering drugs, Eskimos, secret police, crazy music and crazier fashion, technology, and whatnot. But it's a jumble of elements rather than a story, and I just don't have the patience or time to read the remaining 300 pages to see if anything happens.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A3CPVZ64WLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040SY392#wasThisHelpful","R2A3CPVZ64WLQ","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This uneasy mix of small town portrait and crime novel never quite settles into something truly satisfying. Set in a small Alaska coastal town, where supplies need to come in via seaplane, it features a pair of brothers supported by a cast of colorful characters. Miles is an ex-Army medic who just wants to live the quiet life after service in the Middle East. As the only person with medical training for hundreds of miles, he knows the community inside and out. Meanwhile, his brother Clive is getting out of jail after seven years, and heads to town with a duffle-bag full of cash.Who rightfully owns the cash is a matter of interpretation, and as with all stories featuring such bags, someone comes looking for Clive and the cash. But that's only one of several threads -- there's Clive's attempt to build a bar for the tiny town, Miles' attempt to carve out a meaningful place in the world for himself, and even a lengthy digression into a minor character's quest to travel to Seattle to meet the Dalai Lama.Only recently published, the book was actually written many years ago, and it has the feel of a first effort -- straining heavily towards being something of an Elmore Leonard joint. But but by trying too hard at doing several things at once, it never hits its stride with any of them. Still, worth checking out if you're interested in fiction set in Alaska.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20IRJAYCE5FMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616953063#wasThisHelpful","R20IRJAYCE5FMM","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like your crime novels with a heavy does of social commentary, this one set in early 1980s NYC is just the ticket. The book introduces Filomena Buscarsela, a NYPD patrolwoman who, as a female Latina immigrant, is the ultimate outsider. Responding to a toxic incident at a food bank, she stumbles into a strange plot involving a potential environmental coverup by a real-estate developer, coupled with the possible murder of an artist. The story takes her in and out of the seedy East Village punk/new-wave scene as she pokes around for information, conducting an investigation that's way above her pay grade.Although she contains elements typical of the hard-boiled genre protagonist (heavy drinker, self-destructive, sarcastic/cynical cracks, etc.), she remains a refreshing character to follow down the mean streets of Reagan-era America. It's kind of a fantasy plot in a way -- the brown lefty heroine standing up to the corrupt capitalist gentrifiers. The story is OK, nothing special -- the real reason to read the book is for its unabashed politics. Those who have only experienced the cleaned up New York of the last 20-25 years may find much to astonish in these pages, while those who lived it will be reminded of just how bad it was.I'll definitely be seeking out the next in the series -- Soft Money.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2V2UL0PVLTD64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1604865873#wasThisHelpful","R2V2UL0PVLTD64","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've never heard of World Fantasy Award-winner Joyce before, but the coming-of-age plot of this (more or less) non-fantasy book caught my attention. It's a quasi-autobiographical story narrated by an English teenager who has just finished his first year of college. The year is 1976, and instead of working as a laborer for his stepfather's construction business, David takes a jack-of-all-trades hospitality gig at a seaside resort in Skegness.Lounging on England's east coastline, about 150 miles north of London, Skegness has all the charm of a third-rate destination. The resort is a fading institution, catering to the outmoded variety-show holiday tastes of the working class who are soon to be ground under the heel of Thatcherism. As one might expect from such a setting, David is thrust into a colorful and bewildering cast of coworkers, including a jabbering Mancunian roommate, an Italian tenor, some terrifying kitchen workers, a beautiful dancer, a jolly impresario with a dark side, and dangerously dour cleaner married to a much younger attractive woman. Adventures with all these people ensue, and David learns a bit about life while the reader gets a nostalgic portrait of a bygone time and place.Meanwhile, David is also being plagued by momentary glimpses of a mysterious man with a small child. This is the ghost of the title, and the reader discovers early on that his natural father had some connection to Skegness, and that the man in the suit has some connection to his father. The light comedy and romance of David's adventures complement the heavier tone of the more supernatural storyline, and the combination succeeds. Definitely recommended for those who enjoy coming-of-age plots or fiction set in 1970s England.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34XY27V0P4ZD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0575115327#wasThisHelpful","R34XY27V0P4ZD3","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This novella (you can read it in one sitting) is a satirical take on what would happen if the second coming of Jesus happened today, in America. The gimmick is that no one in our narcissistic digital era would take him at face value, and so after months of drifting around the country and being arrested for vagrancy, he stages a bank robbery in order to gain media attention to draw the attention of someone who might actually believe.The story is told in short sections by the various people he encounters in the course of this scheme. There's Neil, an average guy whose wife and kids place ever-increasing material demands on him. The small town police chief who locks up the ""Jesus Bandit."" The bank teller he robs, who believes he is He. The atheist New York Times reporter who flies in to capture the story. And even the evangelical President, who secretly meets with him/Him. Given the brevity of the book, they all come across more as types, than a fully-realized characters.The overall effect is more cutesy than provocative -- but then again, as a nonbeliever, I suppose the basic premise lacks dramatic stakes for me. It feels kind of like the story someone might put together as a final short project in film school. There's no real depth of engagement with the questions it raises.

"At this point, there are certainly hundreds, and possibly thousands of Sherlock Holmes pastiches published. They're kind of like junk food of a sort -- hit the spot when you're in the mood for them, but most are unsatisfying on any deeper level. I picked this one up because it had been sitting on my shelf for a number of years, left behind by a houseguest and I can now see why it had been abandoned...The case revolves around two murders at Queen Victoria's Scottish lair of Holyroodhouse, which appear to have some connection to the centuries-previous murder of the titular courtier in the presence of Mary Queen of Scots. Mycroft -- who is apparently a confidante of the Queen -- sends for his brother, lest anything befall Victoria. Before long, we're knee deep in bomb-throwing Scottish nationalists, butlers with glass eyes, and hidden passages in a haunted castle. It's certainly got all the feel and color of a Holmes tale, but it lacks flavor and substance.The book feels like a short story/novella that's been padded as much as possible to get to 300 pages -- lots and lots of dead, talky scenes. It also doesn't have any really great reveals or twists -- and few memorable scenes. The characters are there, the period language is there, and the pages turn, but it's flat.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21EJS45H4BNBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312352042#wasThisHelpful","R21EJS45H4BNBX","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The box has 8 packets of apple, 4 of Asian pear, and 4 of tangerine. I took a bunch of a hike with some other families, figuring they would be good snacks for adults and kids. The apples were fine, tasted like generic apples, nothing much to them. The Asian pears were slightly better in my estimation, a nice subtle flavor, but I was the only person who liked them. The tangerines were a universal disaster -- six different people tried them, and all six spit them out! Something about the freeze-drying process amplified the tartness and taste to the point where they were just overwhelming. The packets are pretty small, so if you really wanted a proper snack, you're gonna need two of 'em. All in all, not worth it from a taste and value perspective.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R73KWO4JISJG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F6MFXCW#wasThisHelpful","R73KWO4JISJG4","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always known Cristy Road to be a multidimensional artist, playing in bands, writing and publishing zines, and producing amazing artwork. I even commissioned her to do the cover of a one-issue zine I did years ago. However, other than knowing she's a bit of an icon in the queer punk community, and must be a big Green Day fan based on her nom de plume, I didn't really know anything about her. This short-but-striking memoir of her life at ages 11-13 chronicles not only her home and school life, but her raging inner turmoil as she tries to work out her identity.It's a classic story of a kid from a loving, but somewhat repressive cultural context -- she grew up in a Cuban-American family in Florida with traditional Catholic attitudes toward homosexuality. School life is no better, as the misery of middle school in the early 1990s (cruel girls, idiotic boys, hormones everywhere) is further complicated by her inner sense of being different. Like so many alienated kids, Road finds consolation and connection in music -- in her case, the pop-punk of a Green Day tape loaned to her by another outsider at school.As someone who both also found connection through punk (in my case The Clash), and bought Green Day's debut EP, 1,000 Hours, when I was still in high school in 1989, I can completely understand the depth of her passion for her new discovery. So, even though I'm a middle-aged straight white guy and didn't face her agonies about sexual identity and otherness, her memoir still strikes a chord. And of course, her trademark illustrations and text is amazing as always. She's got such a bold, confident and distinctive style -- here sometimes deployed in ways that are more imaginative and grotesque than usual. Highly recommended for teens and tweens everywhere who don't feel like they belong.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMLLCG4E1BSK6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1558618074#wasThisHelpful","RMLLCG4E1BSK6","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For legal razzle-dazzle crime novels, the Mickey Haller series is hard to beat. I loved The Lincoln Lawyer and have been on board for the rest of the series, but this fifth entry left a little something to be desired. In it, Haller is hired by a scrawny man accused of killing a prostitute. It seems he was a kind of quasi-pimp to her -- he set up her web presence as an escort, managed her bookings, and took a cut of her fee. Soon enough, though, Haller has identified another suspect and managed to tie this murder into a whole series past events, including the framing on a mid-level cartel member.More so than in past books in the series, the story really becomes a detective tale, as Haller and his investigator trawl these past cases for connections, and a legal basis to tie what they find in the past to the current defense case. Meanwhile, he also works on trying to salvage his relationship with his daughter and starts up a new romance with a yoga instructor.Connelly's strength is not his writing, its his plotting. For some reason, it's not enough for him to lay out situations so that the reader can very easily infer why people do or say things, Time and again in this book, he has to stop and take a sentence to spell out each and every motivation, as if it hadn't been made obvious in the preceding paragraphs. It's kind of insulting to his readers and I'm surprised his editor didn't go through and fix these.But as complex as the plot is in this case, Haller's success hinges almost entirely on his tricking the villains into doing something very stupid which he gets on camera. It's awfully hard to buy that these guys would take such a large risk over something that, even if brought forward, wouldn't have won the day for Haller. I dunno, maybe I need to go back and reread that section, because it just didn't seem that plausible. One other plot point that was problematic for me is that the case against Haller's client is at least partially built on his having an argument with the dead prostitute about getting his share of the money. It seems like someone savvy enough to build nice online sites would be able to figure out a simple way to do all the payments electronically so that the services being purchased are cloaked.Issues with the writing and plotting aside, it was generally pretty enjoyable, and fans of series will get their Haller dose.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26D6H85D8M7ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316069515#wasThisHelpful","R26D6H85D8M7ZB","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I picked this up because I've always enjoyed Stevenson's fiction, and I'd heard this account of his trip across the United States in 1879 was an outstanding example of travel writing. It is indeed that, but not quite in the way that I expected. His trip was originally documented in three separate publications: The Amateur Emigrant, Across the Plains, and The Silvarado Squatters, which were originally published out of sequence. The Amateur Emigrant wasn't published until after his death due to its potential to bring Stevenson into disrepute. Even then, was controversial due to what was then perceived to be too frank and graphic an account of the lower classes.The version I read is the DaCapo Press 2002 paperback, which includes The Amateur Emigrant, Across the Plains, but not The Silvarado Squatters. The first section takes up about 60% of the book, and covers his ten days of sea passage from Scotland to New York. The second section covers his train trip from New York to San Francisco. There, the story abruptly ends, without the section of his time in California. So, what one gets is a highly detailed picture of what a typical emigrant to America of the time might go through to get there. It's an interesting portrait of shipboard society and train etiquette  but not quite what I was expecting. He has much to say on his fellow travelers, and displays a sharp eye for the mannerism or words that betray a person's true character. But on the whole, I'd say it's probably of limited interest to the modern reader, save those with greater than average interest in immigration to early Gilded Age America.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26I7D43CKLM6C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001NPD73S#wasThisHelpful","R26I7D43CKLM6C","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lottie is a rich, bratty, brand-obsessed London teenager who dresses (and is drawn) like a goth porn star. When she is arrested for trying to get into a club with a fake ID (has anyone, in the history of ever, actually been arrested for this?), her parents pack her off to the grandparents in the Lake District. Naturally, she has utter contempt for the locals and their town, and recoils in horror at the prospect of being a salesclerk at a small golf store.When a local lady turns up dead in a golf course water trap, with a possibly occult symbol on her arm, Lottie somewhat inexplicably suddenly decides she's Nancy Drew. Unfortunately for the reader, the mystery is somewhat clumsy, and the red herrings far too obvious. And when things take a turn for the supernatural, the book spirals into out of control silliness. The art is fairly simple and mundane (unless you're a 12-year-old boy), and Lottie is completely annoying as a protagonist. Can't recommend this to anyone.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTW5GLU1QDGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401203701#wasThisHelpful","RVTW5GLU1QDGH","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great concept -- when Korean-American teenager Grace Kwon turns 18, something rips in the time-space continuum, and all of a sudden, she's got three new companions: her 6-year-old self, her 29-year-old self, and her 70-year-old self. They aren't the imaginary products of a splintered psyche, they're real walking, talking people, throwing pies at her nemesis, coming on to her drama teacher, and filching her dad's cigarettes.Each is a manifestation or warning to Grace about the choices she is, or might make, but in the mean time, she has to figure out how to keep them secret from her parents while also making sure they are fed and sheltered! The other running storylines are the production of the school play, of which Grace is the lead, and the silent longing of her longtime friend. All of this plays out in a somewhat predictable, but fun nonetheless, version of a teen romantic, coming of age, comedy. There are one or two wobbles, for example, the rather sudden detente between Grace and her lifelong enemy, but nothing too problematic.Definitely worth recommending, and I'm surprised it hasn't been made into a kind of Michel Gondry/Spike Jonez/Charlie Kauffman style film.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NM409BFLKCV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401213812#wasThisHelpful","R1NM409BFLKCV","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In 23rd-century Seattle, 14-year-old Telly spends the bulk of her time in virtual reality, whether its learning in school, or in her online ""lair."" In this imagining of our future world, we are all members of lairs (essentially MMOish ""Second Life"" type virtual worlds) catering to our particular interests. Telly's lair is a kind of Tim Burtonesque gothy-steampunky place, where she has two close friends (one of whom is kimmie66). When kimmie sends a virtual suicide note, Telly embarks on quest to find out if the note was real or just roleplaying.The themes of real world vs. virtual world, and the differences and distinctions between them, have been worked and reworked countless times in science fiction. This book, which is presumably aimed at teenage girls, does a nice job of covering this turf in an accessible manner. Telly's search for kimmie66 and her possible haunting by kimmie66's ghost is engaging and feels true. What she uncovers is pretty interesting, and triggers even more questions about consciousness and reality. It's not particularly deep, but it's accessible for young teens and the art is distinctive.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UDJMRG6KZC58/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401203736#wasThisHelpful","R1UDJMRG6KZC58","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I picked this up because I'm always on the lookout for funny fiction, and the sad truth is that much of what is marketed or described as humorous fiction rarely tickles my funny bone. This debut collection of 60+ ""stories"" definitely hits the mark in terms of humor, but misses in the area of fiction. That's not to say the contents aren't all made up or fictional, just that it's more like a compilation of situations or premises, ranging from a few sentence to a few pages. In glancing through the acknowledgements, I noticed that the author mentioned being able to test a lot of the material as comedy clubs, doing standup. And that's kind of the feel a lot of it has, very smart, and sometimes dark, longish form standup. There's really only two or three pieces that are of the length and depth one would expect to find in a traditional collection of short fiction. This falls more into the category of microfiction, and there's nothing wrong with that, just don't expect anything that's going to stick to your bones. It's definitely a nice book to have by the bedside table, or perhaps that other room in the house/apartment where one can grab a few moments of quiet to sit and read..., since you can dip into it for a quick hit of quirky (I know, I know, terrible word) humor, and then put it back down and walk away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13PNRP9J0MGSG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385351836#wasThisHelpful","R13PNRP9J0MGSG","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite the cheesy cover (c'mon Oceanview, you really need to work on your covers, they're awful), longtime crime reporter Michael Krikorian's first novel is a rippin' and runnin' trip down LA's mean streets. With more than fifteen years covering LA gangs for the Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly under his belt, Krikorian is about as inside the gang world as an outsider can get. The story told here is a fictionalized account of a middle-aged vigilante stalking those he feel are complicit in a failure of justice. The protagonist is a very thinly fictionalized version of the author, sharing the same first name, profession, and general interests as Krikorian.When fictional Michael gets shot by an unknown assailant, it sets off a police and media investigation that quickly leads toward Bloods set leader Cleamon ""Big Evil"" Johnson -- currently serving life without parole at Pelican Bay. The cops and the reporter race to try and make sense of the series of attacks and how they fit into Big Evil's past. The result is a fast-paced procedural with sharp patter among cops, journalists, and gangsters. Plot-wise, it's good stuff, especially for readers with an interest in Los Angeles. Prose-wise, it can get a little clunky at times -- it's evident that the author doesn't have much experience writing fiction.Which raises a kind of interesting point. This might be the first non-historical crime book I've read where basically every character is based on a person in real life, sometimes right down to the same name. For example, you can search the internet for ""Big Evil"" and read all about him -- including the crime that led to his incarceration, details of which vary only slightly from those in the book. The lead homicide cop in the book is also a real person, as is at least one of the other reporters. It doesn't really hurt or help the story either way, it's just kind of striking how closely Kirkorian hewed to reality.In any event, there's definitely enough to the book that I would read more in the series. This is the first in a projected quartet (Northside, Eastside, Westside) that would continue to create a rich portrait of Los Angeles through the eyes of ""Michael"" be he real or fictional.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYYVSIE2WCFN1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1608090558#wasThisHelpful","RYYVSIE2WCFN1","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to admit I snack quite a bit at work, and one of my favorite snack is nuts. So I picked these up to try something different from my usual almonds. These are ""glazed"" cashews, which means they have that slightly strange dry surface texture you get from certain kinds of candied nuts you get from street vendors in some parts of the world. And these definitely are candied! I have a bit of a sweet tooth and like a ton of sugar in my tea, but even I found these to be borderline too sweet. What worked best for me was to take a package of these and mix them with an equivalent measure of unsalted, plain cashews. That still gave nice flavor without the overwhelming sugar hit. Just to be clear, those little hunks red aren't pomegranate, they're apple infused with pomegranate juice.

"I didn't love the plotting of the first book in the Leo Haggerty series (Embrace the Wolf), but I did find Haggerty a compelling enough character to pick up this second one. As in the first book, the private detective is hired to find a missing person, this time a 13-year-old girl from an affluent neighborhood near Alexandria, Virginia. Also like the first book, it follows a very traditional procedural path, as Haggerty follows standard methods to trace the girl's whereabouts. This takes him from the innocuous settings of teen life: a high school, a shopping mall, homes, to the sordid: seedy strip-clubs, hot-sheet motels, a bars of Route 1. What's harder for him to discern is why the girl ran away from home, although I suspect most readers will have a pretty keen idea fairly early on.Haggerty's sidekick, a Medal of Honor-winning ex-Green Beret with a personal arsenal rivaling that of any survivalist, is a big presence in the book. One that allows him to tangle with some pretty nasty and violent characters throughout. Haggerty is one of those private eyes who isn't shy of getting his hands bloody if it means getting the job done. One thing that makes this series a little more interesting than others is that there's a nice level of introspection to Haggerty, it's both well written and realistic, not perfunctory navel-gazing. That's probably a testament to the author's day job as a clinical psychologist, and there's real insight there.Another thing I like about the series is that there are consequences -- people get hurt, and sometimes quite gruesomely. The one main quibble I have is that one of the main villains is a huge African-American ex-football player named Leroy, and the combination of details leaves a tinge of racism in the mouth -- but maybe that's just me. The book also has a subplot involving a budding romance Leo has with a freelance writer, which is also handled quite well. All in all, an slight improvement from Embrace the Wolf -- I will now seek out A Tax in Blood to see what happens next.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33RYKRDDYMI4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553263358#wasThisHelpful","R33RYKRDDYMI4A","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Don't be misled by this debut author's uptown credentials (New York Times Magazine culture editor, This American Life, GQ), or the hyperbole of the publisher (""genre-busting"" and ""I promise you've never read anything like this"") -- this is basically a competently executed work of cyberpunk. All the tropes are there: the hard-boiled style, the dystopian setting, the antihero protagonist, the immersive virtual reality, the class commentary, the hackers, the dive bars, and of course, the mean streets down which we must travel. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent version of the genre, but from William Gibson's Neuromancer (and even Philip K. Dick before him) to Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon, this is well-trodden territory.The story takes place in a very near-future New York City, which has seen about half it's population and wealth flee in the wake of a Time Square dirty bomb and ongoing spate of subsequent car bombs. (This was actually kind of a problem for me -- I couldn't quite figure out how the economy of Manhattan worked in the book, since the financial sector has completely vacated the premises, wiping out all the supporting economic activity as well, and tourism has gone as well. The city is essentially lawless, but meanwhile the rest of the country seems to operate more or less normally. It works as a metaphor, but not as a plausible setting.) An ex-garbageman known as ""Spademan"" (nod to Dashiell Hammett) who suffered some kind of loss (no points for guessing what or how) now drifts through life as a hitman. The kind who doesn't ask any questions or care about circumstances, as long as the client pays and the target is 18 or older.As he puts it several times in his deadpan first-person narration, ""think of me as a bullet"" (a nod to the classic ""I am a bullet"" line from the amazing film Performance?) -- he is just a tool, and makes no judgement. Of course he is presented with a target which confounds his straightforward rules, and so the story kicks off. Soon enough, he becomes the protector of his target (a trope from the thriller genre this time), and has to enlist the help of his friends to battle the charismatic leader of a mega-chruch (and in another trope, is predictably evil). There's really not a whole lot to it -- some decent action scenes, some decent, terse, hard-boiled writing, a few interesting supporting characters. I guess people who've never been exposed to cyberpunk might find this book eye-opening or refreshing, but I found it kind of predictable and the blend of grimy future with hard-boiled characters and a thriller plot didn't take me anywhere new or interesting.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TEYW12O3A3WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385348991#wasThisHelpful","R1TEYW12O3A3WF","A1RAUVCWYHTQI4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RAUVCWYHTQI4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I absolutely love the style of this tissue weight cardigan.  It is 100% rayon, soft and comfy to wear, stretchy and versatile.  You can wear it open or tied and get a totally different look.  Since this is so light weight it is not going to do much in the area of keeping you warm, but it really is cute!

The 60% cotton, 40% polyester blend is lightweight and comfortable, stretchy and easy to wash.  Unfortunately it was way too small for me so I had to give it to my mother.

"This Salad Spinner works fine. I had no problems with it getting the water out of the lettuce.  The strainer fits perfectly into the spinner and it is very easy to use.  Simply put the lettuce, fruit or whatever it is you are washing into the straining basket and add water.  Don't add too much or it won't drain properly.  Put the lid on and hold it down tight (because it does not fasten) and then start turning the crank (this is the fun part).  My kids actually love this part.  Spin it as much as you see fit and then either let it stop on its own or press the stop button.  Pull the strainer basket out, dump the water that is in the bowl and repeat.  The bowl and strainer basket are easy to clean but the spinner lid is not.  Well, you can rinse it well but it is hard to get dry since the water gets inside of it.  The storage lid that I received did not fit.  I contacted the company and they wanted me to send a video showing them what I meant.  I didn't have time to do that so I guess I will just live without the lid, although I really hoped to have a lid for storage purposes.

They will look so cute when the weather is warm enough to sit outside.

This foot massage roller is right up there at the top of my go to list.  Not only is it lightweight and portable but I can use it on both feet at the same time.  It also will massage the arches and the entire foot at the same time.  BONUS!  The rollers feel great on my feet and really help relieve some of the pain as well as increase circulation in my feet.

If my son wants to take these to school for testing time I am sure it would be fine with the teacher and they would definitely help him concentrate by eliminating all of the small distractions that really add up.

" 0:36 Mins This is by far the greatest thing to hit my house in years.  My kids are fighting over it every single day...and that is NOT an exaggeration.  It was delivered and easy to use right out of the box...it was even fully charged so my kids didn't have to wait to use it.  I am very impressed by how sturdy and durable it is.  It is very well made and easy to learn.  Even my 68 year old father has ridden it a couple of times.  Granted, he's not as smooth on it as my kids but he didn't fall (a definite bonus for him).  The booklet says the safe highest speed is 12 km/h but we haven't gotten it that fast yet.  It goes up hills easily without losing much speed and goes around corners without missing a beat.  At first my kids were very protective of it and preferred to ride it inside because they didn't want to scuff it up on gravel and the pavement.  They are over that, however, and have been riding it around the neighborhood.  I would recommend wearing a helmet with it for ultimate safety.  It takes about an hour to fully charge and that will get you about 3-4 hours of riding time.  This thing is awesome and is going to be one of the hottest items on lists this Christmas.  I highly recommend this model.  We love it!

"I love this faux pearl necklace.  The beads are larger than my other pearl necklaces so they are very noticeable.  Not as small and dainty as some pearl necklaces are, but just as pretty.

"This is the second massage candle I have owned and hope to have many more of this kind. It is made of soy, so it burns cooler and cleaner than regular candles. The fragrance is so intense and lasts a long time. Since the soy burns cooler it is not hot too touch, therefore can be used for massage.  The oil really soaks into my skin and doesn't leave it feeling too greasy (although it does take it a little longer than lotion to be absorbed).  That is why it is so good for massages....it doesn't dry out too fast.  It is thicker than baby oil in consistency and very moisturizing...feels amazing and smells even better. I am very impressed by this candle and would recommend it to anyone. This would make a great gift for someone that loves candles or for your special someone.Product purchased at a discount in exchange for testing and honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ZHLCTYFUWLAN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PW2KR0E#wasThisHelpful","R2ZHLCTYFUWLAN","A2YWTSNIZUP6ED","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2YWTSNIZUP6ED?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOVE THIS!  I have an iPhone 5s and sometimes can't really see the screen...especially at night.  My eyesight is getting worse and I have even resorted to using a magnifying glass when certain items won't zoom for me.  (Man, that makes me feel like my Grandmother.)  This product is great!  I am able to mount my phone on it and see things so much clearer.  The magnifying screen is larger and helps more than I thought it would.  I didn't expect much out of this product and I am very pleasantly surprised.  My only complaint is that the magnifying screen doesn't lock in place too well.  I mean, there is something that holds it in place but it doesn't really ""lock"" in place....and the same goes with the phone.  Not a problem if I am keeping it on a flat service but if I want to lay in bed or anything like that I just have to hold it.

He has never been a good brusher but his teeth seem to get cleaner with this brush and that is all that matters to me.  As far as adults go, however...I don't really see the benefit.

"Excellent set of resistance loop bands.  They are portable and easy to take along with me anywhere I go.  They came in a little bag but I carry mine in a make-up bag...that way I don't have to completely fold them up each time after use.  With these bands I can do my exercises anywhere.I recommend these bands for anyone interested in low impact resistance training.  They have really helped me strengthen my core as I've tried to recover from a lower back injury.  I like the 5 different resistances (light, medium, heavy, extra heavy and extra extra heavy).  It's great for any level but it is also good for growth...you can start low and as you get stronger you can work your way up to the harder resistances.  My son also uses these to help recover from bicep tendonitis.  It is nice to have something to exercise with that is so effective, yet takes up little space to use.

"This is a watch that can be worn on many occasions with many different wardrobes. The look is classy, with a slightness of showy. It is an above average sized watch with a larger-than-normal leather band. The look, needless to say, is very good.The second hand operates as a stop watch, if you want, being able to go back to the 12 numeral and start a countdown. The date dial is not a roller, rather sweeping hand style.For the quality, the leather band is very nice. Not a shiny, plasticy type leather, instead a large, slightly stiff (at first) leather calfskin material. There is a metal clasp that extends on the last part of each band (usually found on more expensive time pieces) that needs to be used in order to latch on your wrist. This is not the typical band clasp that goes in a loop like a belt.The crystal is 'synthetic sapphire'. I believe the wording for this was 'permitted' to be used in the last few years, because watch makers never advertised it before. Synthetic sapphire is another name for 'flame fusion' really and is not the same as a sapphire crystal in other watches. While the hardness is extremely close, and may have 99% of the same chemical makeup as a sapphire crystal, they are not the same. It is a high quality crystal to be sure, however don't confuse it with what the luxury watch companies put on theirs.The lug is a shiny, chrome-like metal and is not the highest of quality. It feels like and a little hollow. Although this is not a huge deal, there has to be some trade-off in quality because of the fairly low priced paid. I believe it is in the lug. The movement is japanese (quartz) and so far has kept excellent time--as it should. Note that the second hand has a slight 'sweep' and is not an obvious 'tick' like many quartz. It is not as fluid as a rolex...for example (whose automatic movement beats at 8 bps), however it is similar to a watch of 4-6 bps, thus jerky sweeping second hand.**Usually when you buy a watch in this price range you have to replace the band because of the lack of quality on this part. However, know you absolutely do not have to do that here. The band is better than most you will buy aftermarket (not taking into account you would buy a very expensive band).--------------------------Overall, this is a very fine watch at the current price. If you like the look you will be getting a good value. It can be worn as casual, swimming, dressy, or in business situations.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WMDZNVVOXFQ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013JXHLUQ#wasThisHelpful","R2WMDZNVVOXFQ6","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a bottle opener in the shape of part of a deer antler. While you may buy this for the hunter in your family, or because you simply like the look, the other reasons why you pay this much for an opener are apparent when you first open it:1. It comes packaged in its own distinct box, wrapped in paper and sealed with plastic -- much like a fine dish, or figurine you might buy.2. It is much heavier than other openers because it is made of solid metal. The metal is thick and does not bend with stubborn bottles.3. The 'chrome' like finish has not chipped and doesn't look like will with prolonged use.While the look of the opener is attractive, the price is on the upper end.

"** I received this product in exchange for my opinion of it **This water bottle is 'almost' there. The Glasstic 2.0 is what I am waiting for.The design, in general, is fantastic. Clear...glass...and fairly sturdy. While you cannot drive over this or really hit it hard on something, it is for the most part shatter resistant for many uses -- including sports, hiking, biking, running, or everyday use. They even ship you a sponge cleaner that allows you to clean deep inside the bottle. All nice touches.However, here are the parts that need to be improved:1. Water spout. The spout that you drink out of is...tiny. If you mouth the entire spout, you won't get any water because no air can escape, it just fills your mouth up. If you 'half-mouth' it, you are doing your best to imitate blowing a trumpet. Drinking should not require you to pucker your lips to the size of a pea to get a continuous stream of water. This needs to be made larger, and/or add some type of air hole so that you can 'mouth' the entire thing.2. Size. Yes this is 16oz, however it is a bit small for me. While the extra plastic covering makes the bottle appear large, the glass portion (that holds your water) is not big. Need more size options for me to use this on a daily basis.All this being said, it is a fantastic bottle...idea. When it is improved, this will be my only water bottle.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XEVDL4MWJTEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EDS3P0C#wasThisHelpful","R2XEVDL4MWJTEJ","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Maybe...however sometimes surprises come when you aren't expecting them.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23QNVKWR4RNO0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GRXWCO#wasThisHelpful","R23QNVKWR4RNO0","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this product in exchange for my opinion of it **These slip over your ankles to give you support, whether preventative or during injury rehabilitation. I wear a large size Mens shoe and these are a bit too tight for me.I would say they will fit Men's shoe sizes from 7-11.5 US. They will also fit women of any size.While on, they give moderate support however they are not quite as good as my department store bought ankle supports. The price is a bit lower and that helps a bit to not make this a bad buy.If you wear these for long periods of time, they will make indentions on your foot and may become a bit uncomfortable. However, you likely know this if you are familiar with these types of support. Wear socks to help with this effect.The quality is equal to my store bought ones, and the seams are sewed very well. Even stretching them over my big feet, they did not give the impression of tearing or ripping. Well-made.For those in the size ranges that I listed, they are perfectly adequate sleeves to support your ankle and to keep them a bit more protected than without wearing them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y5TG21BWAPJM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XVZHDEC#wasThisHelpful","R1Y5TG21BWAPJM","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this product in exchange for my opinion of it **This is a review about the 10 pack assortment. The sleeves come in a variety of designs -- all very good and unique. The designs are very intricate and resemble many tattoos that you would see on other people.Each sleeve stretches to fit from your wrist up to about just above the elbow or mid bicep (depending on the length of your arm). The 'skin' color that is the backdrop of these sleeves is a peachy skin tone. From a distance, they look real. However, if you look closely they look fake -- not by much however. To really sell the idea, you will have to wear something on your wrist to cover the end of the sleeve (I used a sweat band), and wear a longer type t-shirt.They fit small arms up to large, muscular arms. The side benefit is that they keep your arm warm (and able to breath as well because of the material).I recommend these sleeves for fun or for trying to really fool people into thinking your arm is full of tattoos.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PZEAKUMDY7KZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZI8J276#wasThisHelpful","R2PZEAKUMDY7KZ","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not impressed. My main radar detector before this was the Cobra SPX 5500. The latter worked well for a bit, although many many false alerts, however it begin misinterpreting signals (i.e. giving Train signals in the middle of the highway). So far, the DSP9200BT has not given false train alerts, it does seem to give the same amount of false alert readings while driving in town.I currently live in a place that has many radars begin given off everywhere--from traffic monitors, speed detecting Speed Signs, and the multitude of vehicle equipped radars for various purposes. When I drive down the street or highway with the SPX 5500, it is almost always on. Guess what? The same happens with the DSP9200BT. I was initially excited to test out this detector because of the reduction of false alerts. I can say, it appears to be fairly equal to my old SPX 5500, with a slightly better detection range.The display is OLED. While other reviews have said it is difficult to read in daylight, I don't have that view. My SPX 5500 was LED and is almost impossible to read during the day. The DSP9200BT can be read during the day fairly easily (I have bad nearsightedness mind you). The only differing aspect is that the display is washed out a bit--nothing too bad.Detection trigger is minimal -- it sounds out by voice the type of band detected, and shows a 'signal strength' similar to cell phone monitors (increasing vertical bars), where red is the highest strength. It is loud enough to be heard driving with the windows down with the volume up.To truly get all the benefits of the detector, you will need an app on your phone. Personally, this is currently needed to embrace new technology otherwise, it would not be cost effective to include all of the memory, and technology in a self contained radar unit. Thus, to save GPS location red light/speed traps, you will need the phone app -- and it will ALWAYS need to be on. This does not add anything in particular to the detector, itself, as this sort of 'pairing' could be used for potentially any detector. While they make it seem that the DSP9200BT is 'special' because of the integration with the Application, it is not because the app should be available for all detectors.What, then, are you paying the large extra bit of money for? Not much, unfortunately. While the advertisements like to marquee 'Digital Technology' and 'Efficient Algorithms' for 'deluxe' signal processing and semi-intelligent filtering, you can simply test this by your experience. My experience, then, tells me it much similar to my  SPX 5500, which was already giving its fair share of false alerts.I will add that this unit does work, meaning that when there was a cop that appeared to be using radar, it picks it up. Moreover, I will say that the distance detection on this is very good.---------------------------------From the title, you know that I was letdown a bit as the price is high, however the function seems closely equal to my existing, much less expensive detector. I cannot recommend a purchase at face value, without truly dissecting all of the competing detectors. Know that now, you are getting a detector with the 'potential' to maybe become more, however out of the box currently, it is simply my old detector with a higher price tag.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2N2BFPI6HKWYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010B6EJQS#wasThisHelpful","R2N2BFPI6HKWYR","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You are inundated with many hiking/camping/touring backpacks out there. From short to long, to waterproof, to heavy duty, they are made in different materials and all come with differing prices. The first reason why you will go with this Kelty pack is because of the comfort. The second is for everything else it does right -- construction and compartments.The pack comes with an adjustable waist band, which slides up/down the metal bracings of the pack. The latter will be able to adjust to where the natural curvature of your back is--thus ensuring proper support when you latch the support waist together. Other backups really don't go this far to ensure a 'precise' level of fit. This reason is why the Kelty is different and why it is comfortable to wear, even under heavy loads. Even loaded with 30 or so pounds, the added weight feels seamlessly connected to your back.The advertisement does not mention that the material is waterresistant, however it is. The material feels exactly like gore-tex--though I would say if it was made of this material, it would be advertised as such. Nevertheless, when having rain on the bag, it does not seep through on the main compartment, keeping all your goods dry.For the compartments:1. The large main one down the center of the pack--holds many things--clothes, blankets, snacks etc. There is a synch tie down to keep everything fairly sealed, along with a main flap to add extra covering security that goes over the entry hole. The flap snaps down so that it won't come undone if climbing/hitting a large gust.2. Waist side 'fanny' packs. On the waist support band, there are two water-resistant pouches to hold keys/phones/wallets.3. 2 side pouches for water bottles made out of mesh material (not water resistant). For my bottles, I was able to hold 4 total (2 on each side).4. A water resistant pouch in the flap itself (that goes over the main entry hole)The overall bag is very lightweight, even with the metal support bars. The quality is very good--zippers zip smooth, snaps go in easily, and everything holds together when fully loaded up. The pressure points are mainly on the shoulder straps which have *3* connections to the pack...so the straps are not attached by just a line of thread. All clasps are made of plastic, as well as are the zippers. I would prefer to have had metal however they don't see to affect anything.----------------------The bag is well made and is comfortable with a lot of weight. Add to this a nice water resistant material and you have a quality pack to do all of your outdoor adventuring needs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EP9DKQAMBDQ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NFCEZ56#wasThisHelpful","R2EP9DKQAMBDQ7","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Aside from the obvious usage of snorkeling trips, you can also use these sets for teaching someone how to swim. That being said, if you are traveling or have a pool near by, a snorkeling set is a must have for variety of reasons.This particular set has the same gear as you would expect -- goggles, breather tube, and flippers. The look makes this appropriate for any gender and is very good. My set had a slightly red outer edge with everything else mostly black.When snorkeling, the goggles sit comfortable and no water seaped in after adjusting the straps. Strap adjustment is a big plus here because of an easy access button that allows seamless adjustment.The breathing tube clips into a harness that snaps in with your goggle straps so you can easily remove the breather tube by 'unsnapping' it from this mini harness.The fins offer the same ease of adjustment (with push button adjustment) as the goggles and are very sturdy and well made. There is a piece inside the fin that makes them slightly uncomfortable when using however.------------------------------This set is the best I have used for looks and quality/ease of use.

Very attractive mouse--can be queued to display a lighted red ambiance, or be completely light free.2. Very well made -- no rattling parts inside, compact, buttons are flushed and mouse wheel rolls seamlessly.3. Easy install -- plug and play USB bluetooth receiver.4. Completely silent clicking.

"** I was given this bag in exchange for my opinion of it **Firstly, the bag is made of faux leather (it says this in the description). However, the quality of the 'faux' and overall bag is better than most bags you will find in department mall stores (of course compared to a similar faux bag). While the company could take shortcuts in some areas of the bag, there are no apparent 'cheats' in quality to be found. The clasps smoothly lock, the belt straps adjusts fluidly, the button snaps snap with little effort and hold strong, and the zippers on the inside zip smoothly without snagging.There is a slightly sheen on the outside of the entire bag which makes it hard to pass off as real leather. However, the bag exhibits taste because it has a subtle classic, antique look to it. It comes off as a carefully designed bag that has purpose--the mark of higher quality manufacturers.Since this is produced from an Asian country, where petiteness is the hot market, this bag is fairly dainty. It is about 8-9"" across and is suited more for looks and style than actually carrying ability. It will certainly hold your wallet, phone, and various accessories though it will not hold paper, magazines, books, or laptops. It will hold a smaller sized tablet, though it will not fit an iPad well.-----------------For the price paid, and knowing that it is faux leather, you are getting a good value. When comparing it to typical department stores, you will be impressed with the overall construction. Know if you like the color and style, you will not be disappointing with the craftsmanship.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FNU0F0MWSENS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V5ZM44O#wasThisHelpful","R3FNU0F0MWSENS","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I was given this bag in exchange for my opinion of it **The first couple of things that will stick out to you about this leash are the neon-type colors, and the weight of the leash. The cord is a light neon yellow and the base is baby blue. This allows for easier finding should the dog zip off with it--snatching it out of your hands. The weight of the leash, hopefully means better quality innards.The length of the leash is very long and has a silent unwind/wind mechanism. It does not 'snap' back if extended out all the way, thus saving any potential collision with your face. The leash material is a light weight canvas--not thick, and not thin--would say average to below average. The quality of the leash is the weak point, and is probably best for dogs 50lbs or under. Although, if you have a heavier, subdued, dog...this will suit fine.For the price, and compared to store bought leashes, this is a very high value. The leash looks different in a good way and is made well, and is perfectly suited for small to medium dogs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J3HY8FO2Q7JY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KKV27H8#wasThisHelpful","R3J3HY8FO2Q7JY","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Firstly, there are roughly two types of lace curtains you see -- the thin kind and the slightly heavy/thick ones. The DII is the former. It is very light weight and thin. As long as you aren't moving objects with rough edges around it often, or using pointed objects where it might contact the curtain, the durability is of no real concern. Durability is in proportion to the amount of handling this will take. Sliding the curtains open/closed will not wear it down however.Since this is a lattice lace curtain, there is not real 'covering' for your windows, it simply adds decoration to a normally bare window frame. Much light passes through and you can easily see in the window at night. I suggest using a solid curtain on the outside so that you can cover the window at night, and leave the lace on during the day.The pattern is a linked 4 leaf flower that repeats over the entirety of the curtain. The pattern is vertical, not horizontal.Overall, this is very comparable, and in some ways worse, than the quality you would expect at a normal department store. If you like the pattern and convenience of shipping, you would do well here if you don't expect heavy lattice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10CQJ1NGKZAMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PXYDN0W#wasThisHelpful","R10CQJ1NGKZAMK","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a variable height pet stand. There are two stainless steel bowls that rest on the platform. Two legs snap in/snap out of the base in order to raise the platform or lower it.There are only two heights:With legs - around 12"" highWithout legs = 5"" highThe entire base and legs are made of average quality plastic. While the bowls are good quality, the base is not particularly. For the price, however, this is not necessarily a bad thing. The overall unit is not heavy and easily transported by anyone.The few problem areas are:1. Flimsiness. The dog platform, when raised, is not completely stable. If you have an aggressive eating/drinking dog, this likely will not stand for long. Of course, without the legs the base is perfectly secure.2. Leg attachment. The plastic legs have to be 'snapped' in place. If you plan to snap/un-snap a lot, the plastic tabs will likely wear.------------------We own another dog stand meant for feeding and it is made out of iron.

"This is a bag that is made of thick, slightly stiff, plastic. The plastic makes this entire bag water proof, which is more appropriate to use as a 'wet separator' rather than a bag that can be submerged in water and expected to be kept dry. Meaning, when you 'close' the bag (you do this by rolling up the top and attaching it by velcro) it is not completely sealed.Sounds like a simple bag...and it is. A big sack of plastic. The smell gives off a fairly strong scent of plastic overall and doesn't really transfer to the things inside--after a small airing out time. The thickness of the plastic also prevents any punctures from small-to-medium points (like, say, tree branches, dropping, or heavy objects sitting on top). While this big would rip easy with the appropriate very sharp point, it is not likely to happen by accident, so you can be somewhat rough with it and come out ok.Although you could think of many uses for this bag, I used this for only separating wet items from dry items. For this, it works great. After going swimming, I put swim trunks/towels in it without the need to carry extra plastic grocery sacks around. Know, though, as with any 'somewhat sealed' plastic bag, you must take the wet items out as soon as you can lest mold start to arrive. However, for trips to and from and a general holding place, this bag works well for keeping wet items to themselves.The bag I reviewed was 23L and it is enough to hold many large beach towels, swimming suits/bikinis, and scuba gear (goggles and flippers).One warning is that you should not leave this in a spot directly under the sun and where which the bag can get very hot. Depending on the type of density this bags Polyethelyne plastic is, any temperature range of 230-260 degrees Fahrenheit (110 - 130 Celsius) will cause this bag to melt. Not much of a worry however, if you catch a hot day, on hot pavement maybe it gets to that.------------------------------------What this bag advertises is what you get: 100% waterproof (the material--not when being submerged), sturdy, and portable.

"I have oily skin and not all face creams are meant for every type of face. With the Nia 24, it's common ingredient is really...oil. Oily skin plus more oil is usually not recommended. Since I was testing the product , there was nothing I can do about this.Firstly, it is a fairly oily product. When applying you will have a bit of a sheen to your face. After a while (30 min - hour) the sheen fades so it's not completely shiny, however you are left with a slight luminescence--'glow'. The glow is lighter than my normal skin tone so it is not a darkener.Secondly, the product somewhat plumps your skin a bit so you do have a somewhat noticeable 'youthful' appearance. Whether this is from the retinol..or moisturizer, who knows. However, when you use it, there is a difference in your face = Slight glow + slight tightening + slight plumping of face.I said above that I have an oily skin type, however I my skin is also very sensitive to alcohol based products. The latter makes up the majority of facial creams. The Nia 24, i'm happy to say, did not flare up any of my usual 'sensitivities'. For sensitive skin types, then, this will likely go on easy.----------------In general I would recommend this product for those who feel they have a tired, dry, face with somewhat 'lifeless' skin.

"This is a book for everyone--those who are not science majors, but see their curiosity peak of any mention of Quantum 'states', and those that do have a background in science. There is not the usual 'dumming' down, nor are a packing of technical jargon and mathematical formulae. If you are interested in Quantum technology, especially in the emerging field of Quantum Biology, I highly suggest you start here.The first chapter begins with a background of Quantum Theory and hits on the most popular phenomena associated with it -- Quantum Tunneling, Super position, and Quantum Entanglement. Thankfully, because this allows you to get the overall summation of why Quantum Theory...or simply Quantum Science is one of the most important topics of science today.The later, and bulk, of the book deals with the author's backgrounds--Quantum Biology. This is a fairly new, and often times neglected field of Quantum Science. This material subject is not something you would easily find in random newspaper articles or magazines--this will likely be your first introduction to the details of it. Know that the possibilities of as equally exciting as with non-trivial Quantum theory relating to particles in space. The content goes into these nascent areas.Writing in the book is a pleasant balance between too short and too wordy. It reads quick, though it is concise enough that there a large amount of material within single sentences--enough to invoke thought throughout.

"For the price you are expecting a functional necklace--one that is above average compared to what you would expect at a normal warehouse-department store. If I were to pick this up anywhere I would guess it was very similar to customer jewelry.While the stones are scratch free and have a subtle shine that is above average in quality, the clasp and necklace feel poor and wear poor. Having yet to wear the necklace, the gold plating had already worn off the back of the clasp leaving the silver innards to shone through a bit. The necklace itself feels fairly cheap with no real shine or 'slick' feel. Feels like very very thin metal.The overall look of this is classy. The gold and 'earthy' stones give it a natural subdued look which will go well with white, brown, or black blouses. For wearing brief periods it gives a classic 'elegance' to a wardrobe however watch that the front facing part of the necklace doesn't interact with many materials i.e. coats because the plating will wear fast.The quality of the stones here warrant the mid-range price however expect to replace the necklace soon if you plan on having this as your daily/weekly wear.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TWZWYVIAR7UI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LB3YXZS#wasThisHelpful","R3TWZWYVIAR7UI","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Good enough to see if they shaking or awake.5. Built-In ambient thermometer -- inconsistent because ambient air reduces its accuracy.Video streams well all around the house with a low resolution display -- thank clear but pixelated. Not much interference even through walls. Color is accurate however it is washed out a bit. As mentioned above, certainly good enough to spot any foreign substance/object on your baby.This picks up audio very well. Surrounding sounds and noises from your child will blend together however you can even hear the nuance of the baby 'grunting' at themselves (the soft voice babies usually make). You can place this by your bed at night and will be awoken with the slightest increase in volume from your baby.Adjusting picture from the remote is slightly delayed however it works well if you want to see a little closer than what the current view is.Night vision performs as you would expect--brightens the baby up to a washed out 'white/green' color and makes their eyes luminescent.Thermometer, as mentioned in other reviews, is inconsistent because it picks up so much ambient temperature. When only 2-3 degrees matter when taking our body's temperature, it is not very accurate. If you place it on the skin it is usually within a degree or two however, this is not good enough for serious temp taking.------------------------------This offers more luxuries than competitors and is very functional for what you would expect--able to monitor your baby day and night. The MBP27T offers a strong 2.4 GHz signal to eliminate a lot of possible static/interference and allows for portability that others do not. If you want to safely monitor your baby from afar this is a product that will do that well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NDVV0JIHBI2R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IM8FXP4#wasThisHelpful","R3NDVV0JIHBI2R","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For a complete ease of use get this particular George Foreman grill. You will not get a particularly good cooked piece of meat or fish however it will make cooking straight forward and easy.Here is the breakdown:[---Cooking---] 6/10You plug in the grill and it heats up within 5 minutes. There is no heat adjustment. You turn this unit on and intermittently check the food for your preferred wellness of cook.Using an infrared thermometer the heat went up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit or 260 Celsius--it gets toasty.What the benefits are for this grill is that there is a place where grease flows from the meat while cooking. This is slightly healthier and makes cleaning easier. Moreover, there is little steam because the grease runs down. In addition to this, the fact that you can cook really in piece of meat wherever there is an inlet adds to the simplicity and functionality.For an apartment, dorm, or household with little space and/or time the George Foreman will add benefit to your cooking.However, where the grill slacks is in the ability to cook. Cooking meat is not necessarily a straight forward thing. Many people have different preferences and certain meats need to be cooked differently. In this Foreman grill there is not option to adjust heat. While you should know this when purchasing, it does limit what you can do. You cannot sear and blacken the outsides while leaving the inside rare--a steak for example. You cannot slow cook to have meat that is moist and thoroughly browned.The outcome while cooking with this grill is that the bottom piece of meat (I tried steak and salmon) is hard and dark brown while the top is light brown and moist. Many people ate the meats I cooked in this grill and commented that they were hard--which was true.The New York Strip I cooked (1"" thick and fit perfectly) did not turn out well. It was shrunken and half-hard half-soft. Although, it did retain its moistness.For the salmon I cooked, again, the bottom was hard and the top was...near perfect. Cooking fish on this Foreman grill is above average--it makes it easy, does not 'break' apart the fish and generally turns out well.[---Cleaning---]9/10With light scrubbing from a sponge and running water every bit of residue was wiped away without using much force. Cleaning goes very well with this grill.-------------------------------------------------This George Foreman grill is sparse on options because it does not have any. Its only setting is basically Medium-High setting (500 degrees), which forces you to monitor the meat being cooked to get a desired outcome because the bottom is hotter than the top. It is an average cooker with great portability and simplicity.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37CA8K8WM9AN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2HXOS#wasThisHelpful","R37CA8K8WM9AN8","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this product from the manufacturer in exchange for my opinion of it **Putting these side-by-side with my 30$ speedo goggles, there was plainly no difference in the quality of the rubber seal around the eye caps or the caps themselves. That's a start.Goggles only suit a couple of functions:1. (the biggest) Sealing properly not allowing water to get in.2. Being comfortable - this does not have anything to do with 'adjusting'. When you have to smash the eyecaps in order to seal (which is normal I'm afraid), any extra additives for comfort help.3. No fogging. I have not personally found goggles that don't fog up unless you use third-party products (a spray or... a naupaka plant--this was mentioned to me when I was in Hawaii, and it works exceptionally well).Based on these points, here is how the Ipow stands.For the first point:These have a bigger seal ring than my speedo glasses and do not suction as much as the Speedos. I did not, however, notice any obvious water getting in. After I took off the goggles they were dry in the inside. I had to really press them in though to get any kind of seal because the eyecaps are quite large. My Speedo goggles have somewhat small eyecaps that really suction on.I would rate this adequate for sealing and not as good as my Speedos.Second point:The Ipow goggles are much more comfortable than the Speedos. The seal ring on the Ipows are thick and cushioned. My Speedo goggles, in contrast, have a small seal that depresses down to the hard edge of the eyecaps--always causing soreness.Excellent for comfort.Third point:Same as any other goggles I have tried. At first they do not fog up however, the more you swim the fog creeps in. Not much creep however I would say around 40%.Again, average and typical for what I have experienced before.Note that goggles are not a universal fit for all. It is better to be 'too small' around your eyecaps than too big because this will let in more water. If the eye caps are not sealing properly and the bridge looks too wide, make sure to change out the nose piece accordingly. For this, just snap the old ones out--this requires moderate pressure.----------------------------These Ipow goggles are function and slightly above average. They are very comfortable and offer a slightly inconsistent seal however, they will be better quality than most goggles you can find in the stores that are less than 20$.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35AUOCW3L7JED/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M3NFLCE#wasThisHelpful","R35AUOCW3L7JED","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"** I received this product from the manufacturer in exchange for my opinion of it **Extended selfies. Extended portraits. An angle over a cliff that you certainly couldn't perform yourself. The previous three elements are what you can do with a phone extender. I laughed when I first saw people using these...until I thought about it for a few seconds. Needless to say they are extremely useful for any setting.Now to the review:[---Quality---]7/10The handle is rubberized which is very good for not being slick or moving the camera around too much. The actual extendable part is made of a moderately thin metal. The latter does not 'glide' like higher quality extendable products I have used. It has a 'rough' feeling extending it, however after repeatedly moving it up and down very fast numerous times, I can say in general it is decent quality.[---Holster---]For the holster (the part that holds your phone), it has very lightly rubberized feet on the bottom held my iphone 5s perfectly in place after installing the orange rubber clip on. To explain more of the latter, it is rubber 'cap' that fits over the top part of the holster that 'clips' on the phone. It helps to keep it more secure. When I first tested this, I didn't use it at all. While the phone did not slide around, after heavy shaking the phone did fall out. With the rubber clip on it did not--even after the heavy back-and-forth.[---Bluetooth---]The handle has a switch where you can turn on bluetooth so that you can 'snap' the picture with the button on the handle. This product will periodically need to be charged as the bluetooth requires a battery -- that is built into this. Note, there is a supplied micro usb cable for this. The bluetooth, moreover, was easy to connect to and comes up as 'jstar'. It was as simple as turning the unit on and connecting. A few seconds for this at most.There was minimal latency between clicking the button on the handle and actually having the iPhone snap the picture. It is close to instantaneous and I don't see this being much of a problem.[---Sizing for Other Phones---]As I mentioned above, I used an iPhone 5s and it fit without any adjustments. The holster, however, has adjusted length and height. I am confident that it will fit any flat smartphone out there, including HTC, Galaxy, and the Note. Also the new iPhone will fit as well. If your phone is smaller than the iPhone 5s then it might not fit if you do not have a case on it.[---Potential Worries---]When I extended this product all the way, there was a little flex at the end and slight instability. While I don't see the potential to break, if your phone is heavy you might have a slightly difficult time getting a 'still' picture. When extended all the way, with the iPhone, even though it was slightly shaky, I was able to take in focus pictures fairly easily.-------------------------------With this product you will get an extendable handle that keeps your phone very very secure. There will be no worry to lose it unless you are using a jackhammer alongside. If you were mountain biking and taking a selfie, I would say the phone would stay secure however, I would keep the handle towards a minimum expansion length. The latter will give you an idea of what it can do for your phone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HRU6NSK0SY8V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJKQ1QW#wasThisHelpful","R1HRU6NSK0SY8V","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You can cross off leaking as something potentially stopping you from buying this water bottle. No real life situation would put this bottle through what I did trying to get one little water droplet to peak it's head out.Shaking, twirling...even making those little upside-down tornadoes in there..., slamming, flipping...juggling. Nothing came out.There is a rubber ball (similar to what is in a whistle) that suffocates the mouth opening whenever you are not depressing the button down. This rubber ball is the only thing stopping the water from coming out unintended. The little ball works.All this being said, this water bottle is exceptional in every area I could see. Firstly, I strongly not prefer to drink out of *any* plastic water bottle. My go-to water bottle is the Klean Kanteen stainless steel bottle. As far as function, aesthetics, and ease of use the Contigo beats the Klean Kanteen easily.The color of the bottle is a very calming sea green that makes the water seem like a crystal-clear paradise drink.The top portion is a engineering feat in its simplicity. Ergonomics were not looked over with this. The button you depress when you want to drink fits formly to your finger and is easy to press. When you press the 'drink button' the water comes out gradually and the volume adjusts to how you suck in the water--very similar to sports type water bottles. So as not to accidentally depress the drink button, there is a locking lever that will keep the button locked in the 'off' position. There is also a lid that goes over the drinking spot to shut out any outside particles.------------------------------How everything goes together in this bottle adds to my impression that nothing is wrong with it. One of the best looking water bottles and one where everything works perfectly. Although it will be hard to turn me away from my bottle-o-steel with the Klean Kanteen, because I do not trust plastic in general whether BPA free or not...you might just see me swinging the Contigo around.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1UQ8B7H2R95/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MVODHO4#wasThisHelpful","RH1UQ8B7H2R95","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, I can make use of this battery charger many times. My habit of leaving interior lights on does not make me friends with batteries. Because I am usually operating on a tight schedule, i.e. leaving for something at just the right time not to be late, those moments when my battery died forced me to arrive 'fashionably' late. Either I find someone near, knocking on random doors to see who is home, for a jumpstart (this takes about 10 minutes) or I take the battery out and go to a local auto parts store for them to fully charge it (this takes around 1 hour).A battery dying is an easy fix however it is almost always an inconvenient one.With the Forney, you are not going to get an ultra portable carry-on device you can stow under the car seat as it's not meant to be that. It is meant to be your central battery maintenance machine that can keep your car and battery running under situations with time constraints or none at all. Add wheels to this machine and, while it is a marginal size, it is very portable and rolls around easily.[---Construction---]Heavy unit, around 40 lbs, and strong metal all around. If left outside (which is not recommended) I could see this rusting fairly quickly. The cables on this look to be around 8 gauge, however I could not find any documentation on what exactly they are. 8 gauge, if that is what they are, is a good all-around cable however not the most 'optimal' for large trucks/SUVs on a cold, raw jumpstart. It would still likely work however it will probably be better to charge the battery separately outside of the vehicle.[---Charging---]There are many options to charge on this unit. Here is a quick explanation of what you should use (most of this information is also inside the manual as well):2A slow, trickle charge -- the slowest, lightest current. Generally would take around 4-6 hours to fully charge a battery. If you have the time for this, this setting is best for your battery as it does not heat very high as to destroy or 'fry' any components of the battery. Be careful with your time on this setting however because the meter cannot 'read' this low of a charge so you will not know based on the machine whether your battery is fully charged or not--and you do not want to overcharge.10A/40A charge -- In most cases the 40A charge is the best 'medium' out of all of them. It likely takes around an hour to full charge your battery if it was almost fully depleted. This is a fairly safe amperage and finishes fairly quickly.40A/100A for 6V batteries -- Generally only used for antique cars from the 30's. Probably won't use this at all.200A - the 'full' blast charge. This is for a quick jumpstart on a cold engine and cold depleted battery. You should absolutely not overcharge with this setting, or continue to charge for long as it can easily heat up your battery and/or destroy electrical components in your car.Very versatile options available for most situations.[---The Extras---]- There is a timer that you can use that goes up to around 2-3 hours which will shut off when completing its cycle. You will use this feature when you find out more details on your battery and calculate how long it will take based on the particular setting you chose (the chart and calculation is in the manual in full detail).- Auto-Shut off if the charger senses anything 'abnormal' coming from you battery--especially 'cross charge'--where you accidentally hook up the positive cable to the negative terminal.- As mentioned above, a meter. When the meter shows high this means that your battery is low and is taking a lot of the current for a given setting. While charging the battery, and if the meter is showing low, then your battery is almost charged and the Forney will automatically cut back the charge to compensate. Fantastic feature here.[---Assembly---]Yes, you have to assemble the charger when taking it out of the box. For this you will need a hammer and a few common socket tools. Quick and easy to put together however the instructions are 'slightly' lacking when explaining how to put it together. You will easily figure this part out however.---------------------------------------------Because wheeling this charger out to your car (if it isn't very close to your garage) will likely take a long extension cord, I recommend taking the battery out and charging it out of the car. This allows for you to enclose safely the battery and charger. Nevertheless, a portable battery charger is for those that do not have accessible neighbors for a jump start whenever their battery dies or simply wants the ability to quickly, and thoroughly, charge their battery at their convenience and have it as quick or efficient as they like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6A6P69MQX465/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00880SAGU#wasThisHelpful","R6A6P69MQX465","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not your usual 'picture' book you can throw on a coffee table to kill time or entertain guests. The book is part encyclopedia/part art collection. Except the 'encyclopedia' part is not written as a dry edification--it is written from the perspective of the author--all his subjectivity included. While you get a heavy package of information that spans the beginnings of capturing light on material to where photography is today, you get the author's thoughts--sometimes angry, sometimes reveling--about the evolution of cameras and photography. This allows you to view another's strong opinion--a subject Tom Ang is passionate about--where you can agree or disagree. Nevertheless, reading the whole book through will be educational and entertaining.The book itself is big, heavy, and very high quality. The pages are semi-gloss, heavy weight, and in high resolution color. A lot of production went into this book.Visually, you get a book full of large and extremely clear pictures. One of the first 'photos' (in parenthesis because it was more like a 'tablet sensitive to light'--which you will read about)  taken in the early 19th century is in here and although it is somewhat hard to make out, the clarity of it is astounding. Consider perusing through this book as a substitute for an extensive museum tour, which you can do in the comfort of your lap.The organization of this book is simple. It goes from the beginning of when scientists and inventors first discovered how to get minerals sensitive to light. As it progresses through discoveries, cameras, and modern day photography you get snapshots of the representation of the technology and capabilities of the respective era. It will do well to make anyone a pseudo-expert on the history of capturing light to make 'time stand still'.-----------------------------On first glance, I took this book as your common book of photos as it gives brief statements of what occurred during the period. Throw that idea away. This is a definitive book on the history of photography that can be a reference guide in universities, libraries, or museums. It is the perfect bond of informative text and compelling visual aides.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q3QLIMK8X674/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465422889#wasThisHelpful","R3Q3QLIMK8X674","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"* I received this product in exchange for my opinion of it *Have used this product for a while now and can you give a very good picture of what it does to slightly sensitive, and dry skin (these are my qualities). I don't have many wrinkles on my face however I do have 'laugh' marks between the nose and upper lip. They are more like 'creases' and this is what I mainly used them on. Vitamin C Serum--among other nutrients found in this bottle--is supposed to plump and tighten your skin as well as reduce wrinkles.The experience of the product is that it feels slightly cold going on and it dries very quickly. It feels like a very light facial mask in that it tightens the area that you apply the serum on. After applying the skin feels slightly 'plumped'--it performs as advertised in this regard. For this experience you only need '1' drop to do this.After a while, I want to say I noticed a slight change in appearance for the laugh marks but it certainly didn't 'vanish'. When applying to wrinkles it would certainly aid to make fine ones very faint as it really does 'plump' up your skin around the area you apply the serum on. Sort of a 'mini' spot-facelift. This doesn't mean that your skin will look swollen because it is more in the 'feel' than the look of the 'plumped' skin.------------------As advertised, the product shines up the skin slightly and expands the area that you choose to use it on--for fine wrinkles it will help reduce visibility.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I6AK1RRC9L42/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GLEK9DW#wasThisHelpful","R3I6AK1RRC9L42","A1VFX417XDNWIU","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VFX417XDNWIU?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a good way...Picture yourself going to your everyday department store. Maybe you end up buying some cleaning tools there, that will help or aid your job of scrubbing and...scrubbing.

Whether its entirety is made of plastic--all of them are usually--or works marginally well for one time only.I have never seen this OXO product in a store. If it was I surmise it would be around 30$.

It is thick, not 'fluffy' i.e. a lot of filler to make it look thick, and will clean equal to if you scrubbed by hand. I see no signs of wear on this after multiple uses. The scrubber fits perfectly in the corners of a shower and can be multipurpose in your bathroom--I use it to clean tiles, the shower floor, and around the commode.-----------------------------------------Good products deserve to be known about and exceptional products need to be reiterated so that you always know where to look for when searching for the 'standard' by which other products should be basing their capabilities on.

"For a universal car cover, this cover actually fits my Kia Rio hatchback quite well.To use, the cover first needs to have the velcro strips attached to the inside car trunk, cover outside.  Close the hatch & roll the cover over the car.  Covering the car takes no time at all.  The cover comes with weight bars sewn into the front & back to give weight & keep the cover in place.  There is a way to ""tighten"" the cover so the bars are hooked underneath the car, but they don't tighten completely, so a hard, hard wind can take the front portion of the cover off of the car (the back portion is velcroed in, so the cover isn't blown away).The cover itself is a fairly heavy fabric & it feels like it should hold up well - time will tell.  It is bulky and I cannot get it folded back to the way it came, though.  Stuffing it inside of my car takes up most of the trunk space.

"I own a GoPro Hero4 Silver & use it both for action video & stills.Pros:  The PolarPro Power pole is well built, handles solidly and holds a charge.  You have be make sure the extensions are locked in or else you may experience slippage.Cons: The PolarPro pole doesn't fold up compactly, and is still a little ""weighty"" as compared to other sticks.  Additionally, you cannot use the PolarPole as a ""battery extender"" (on the go) when your GoPro is in its GoPro case (& in use)**.  And last, the PolarPro is not suitcase friendly both because of its size & weight. I travel light, so suitcase space is premium. Extra batteries are less ""weighty"" and take up much less space.I have played with this PolarPro powerpole for a little over 3 weeks. It is just not an accessory that I grab each & every time I use my GoPro.  I cannot put it in the ""must have"" accessory category (like extra batteries, which are easy to carry/travel with).**Apparently, there is 3rd party case that exposes the GoPro's ports so the camera can be charged while in its case, but camera exposure is a weakness while action video-taping - way too much possibility of infiltration & damage to the ports/camera.I wanted to love this combo extension/power pole, but it isn't a device that I go ga-ga over.

"THE DOOR & INSTALLATIONWe installed this garage door opener on a single door garage. It was a replacement installation, so we used existing mounting brackets. We have installed multiple garage door openers (replacement & new installations) & found this unit easy to manage & easy to install.Installation (for entirely new & replacement): FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. There are pictures throughout that give you specific locations for assembly. 60% of the assembly clips together without hardware. The sensors clip on to the rail track (or there are flanges for optional attachment) & the only thing you need to be aware of is that the sensors need to ""see"" each other - there is plenty of adjustment. All of this is explained in the instructions.For NEW installations - Wiring: the opener comes with little staples, but these staples aren't very user friendly for attachment to sheetrock (they are short & small & you'll end up hitting your hand because there is no room to hold on to them). We used bigger electrical clamps with longer screws to hold up the wire (where there was more tension) & just used the staples to keep the wire attached to the ceiling. In our opinion, unless you are attaching to wood, the kit staples will not keep the wire secured to the ceiling.Estimated Assembly time for replacement installation: 1 to 1-1/2 hoursEstimated assembly for new installation: 3 hours, depending upon what you need (may need to reinforce garage door)Quiet factor is Good. The opener motor seems to be quieter than the basic Chamberlain units we've installed.MY-Q TECHNOLOGY/SMARTPHONE APPIf you want to be able to open/close your garage door using your cell phone, this opener is equipped with Chamberlain's MyQ technology.

"** I do not take hormone replacement therapy.  I do exercise regularly & eat a healthy diet. **Prior to taking Doctor's Best Estrog-100, I was regularly experiencing minor hot flushes. About 2 weeks before starting Doctor's Best Estrog-100, I started experiencing long-lasting hot flushes followed by cold shivers, minor, but noticeable vertigo & a little nausea. About every other day. That was enough to bring me to try Doctor's Best.After 20 days of daily use, I do notice a difference.  My more extreme symptoms vanished after taking Doctor's Best (coincidence?) & my more familiar, regular hot flushes are not daily anymore & are hardly noticeable when I do get them.My sleep (interference) has not changed, and I still wake up at different intervals during the night (not due to night sweats - so perhaps this symptom is unrelated).Over the counter herbs and vitamins are always a question because they are unregulated.  I decided to try the Doctor's Best simply to see if they worked as claimed, but I do not take any prescription medications or have any health issues (other than menopausal symptoms), so I did not have to worry about drug interactions.  For me, Doctor's Best seems to work fairly well. The fact that it is 1x/day is a bonus too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11Z3CHTO6WRVC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9OIFFW#wasThisHelpful","R11Z3CHTO6WRVC","A2SZLNSI5KOQJT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SZLNSI5KOQJT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE (8/14/15): It looks like the replacement filter lasts about 3 month with light use. Light use: filling coffee pot daily, filling steam mop reservoir 2-3x/week, and a daily glass of water (approx. 10-16 ounces).UPDATE (6/1/15): have had to order a replacement filter ($27). Use is minimal - a couple of times/day for water glass fill-ups and coffee pot water reservoir fill-ups (approx. every third day).  There is a noticeable taste difference in the water with/without the filter, so when it was time to replace, a replacement WA ordered.I have to admit that when I first received this Verbatim Water Filtration System, I was stumped as to what faucet to attach it to. Then I realized that my commercial kitchen faucet had enough of a straight spout that the filtration system might be attachable.Following the instructions was easy enough until step 3. I needed 2 people to screw on the attachment because there needs to be lots of pressure to seal the faucet spout to the system nozzle. This is not explained well in the instructions (which make it seem like you just screw the nozzle on and the seal is good).  An installation video showing installation instructions would be helpful. Still pictures of acceptable mounting faucets and what adapters to use would be good too.Once installed, the Verbatim system is mostly sealed - I do have some seepage at the connection to the faucet, but it isn't significant. The system works as described with 3 choices for water. All work well and there is no flow restriction. The display is nice to have because I'm not good at tracking replacement times. If you are, the display isn't a necessary feature.The filter slips easily into the system and there is no seepage between the two. Price the replacement filter before you buy so you know your commitment. The fact that filtered water is a choice rather than always on should extend the filters life.Overall, a nice compact system that has a bit of seepage around the faucet connection. This Verbatim system is definitely worth strong consideration if you are in the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R181696T2K5GNV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QC715J0#wasThisHelpful","R181696T2K5GNV","A2SZLNSI5KOQJT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SZLNSI5KOQJT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My original BP machine is an Omron BP742N.  It has all of the bells & whistles of this Omron BP761 except the easy wrap cuff & Bluetooth Smart.The Omron BP761 stands out for two reasons: (1) easy wrap cuff is truly easier to put on your arm, and (2)  the display is large & very easy to read without glasses.  The Bluetooth is a nice feature to have for tracking progress, but it isn't compatible with all devices.For some, the cuff may be a little too long, but this is designed so there is minimal misalignment, thus more accuracy.  I have a thin, average length arm & the cuff fits fine.  It is much easier to put on & secure than the BP742N cuff (typical BP wrap cuff).

"I have not tried earlier versions of the LG Electronics Bluetooth headset, so cannot compare this HBS-800 to previous models.  I have used Bose QuietComfort 20i (noise cancelling) headphones, so can compare this HBS-800 to the Bose QC 20i  (borrowed for a trip).Noise-cancelling on the Bose is better than on the LG, and one would expect that given the price-point of both headsets. However, the LG's noise cancelling isn't bad, and, when you use them with music, the performance is not too bad, especially taking the price point into consideration,  The limits on the Bose QC 20i is the 20i is specifically made for iPhones (& has the talk/answer feature), while the 20 is made for Android/Windows & doesn't have the talk/answer feature.  Consequently, Bose headphones are more for a music aficionado (of course, they are Bose) rather than an all-around user who likes all Bluetooth functions, including music.The LG headset paired easily with my phone's Bluetooth. My main phone is Windows & Cortana comes over loud. & clear (Bluetooth functions are dependent upon your phone's capabilities).  The connection stays solid as long as I'm within about 30' of my phone.  Voice seems pretty clear to folks on the other end of my line whether in a quiet room or not so quiet car.  No one ever asked me to repeat myself, which in & of itself gives the LG headset a star.Charging is quick & easy using a micro USB cord.The only drawback on the LG headset is that the buttons are small & not real ""tactile"", so it is hard to manage them while the headset is around your neck.  The headset's capabilities override this annoyance, but it is an annoyance nonetheless.Overall, I'm very happy with the LG headset.  I had planned to buy a Bose, but think that this LG will be a fine choice instead.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R239RKCRNW2JX2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D2CRXKI#wasThisHelpful","R239RKCRNW2JX2","A2SZLNSI5KOQJT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SZLNSI5KOQJT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The remote portion of this product was DOA upon unboxing.  I charged it on a wall charger overnight & then on a USB computer port on a separate night.  Nothing.  The green light in the battery lit up while on charge, but when disconnected, the light wouldn't come on - not even flicker.Next step was to call Petsafe customer service.  Their number is printed in multiple locations in the instruction manual, which is nice.  The instruction manual gives hours of operation, but does not state which time zone.  The company is located in KY, so it is probably safe to assume the hours of operation are EST.The fact that the customer service number is printed in the instruction manual is about all that is good about Petsafe's customer service.  As a reviewer of a Vine/Free product, customer service was not helpful at all.  They refused to accept the Amazon sticker as proof of purchase and they insisted they were not part of Amazon's review (Vine) program.Upshot: If you purchase this product, make sure you keep your receipt or customer service will not be helpful at all.Design Issue:The micro plug portion of the USB plug is slightly narrower than standard micro plug bases, so if you try to substitute a different micro USB, you may not be able to fit it properly into either the remote or receiver's micro slot.  Don't lose the charging cables that come with the product.

"While I've always wanted a GoPro, I've never used one or even played around with one until purchasing (justifying the purchase)this GoPro HERO4 Silver. I am a casual user.  I cannot talk/compare in 4k or that kind of description/comparison.  My review is intended for the casual user who wants a waterproof action camera that is easy to use without having to read a thick instruction manual.I chose the Silver 4 because of the 12mp still images, the video quality & the Touchscreen LCD back.  I like the LCD back because that is what I'm familiar with using my digital camera. The touchscreen back is not super sensitive & I have to press hard (through the case) for the screen to respond.  Just remember that the display will lock if left untouched, so you will have to go through the unlock procedure again if you want to change from camera to video or access the screen options (touch top middle of screen & slide finger down - that will get you to the unlock feature, which is a slide down & hold feature).Unfortunately, my digital camera is not waterproof, so I decided that a small, waterproof/water resistant camera should be added to my collection.  Since I was about to embark on a trip that involved ziplining, rafting, parasailing & a rainforest, I decided that a GoPro would be an ideal camera.The HERO4 Silver is a great little camera.  I am still not completely using all of its features - the remote being the next item on my ""to-learn"" list - but the features I used - camera & video - produced beautiful, clear pictures & video.  I used the clip to place the GoPro on both my zipline helmets & rafting helmet, and I used a homemade modified strap to wrap around my hand while parasailing.  On all, since I wasn't submerging in water below 10', I used the camera housing that allowed for Touchscreen use.Camera battery lasted about 1-1/2 hours because of using the LCD screen off and on.  As stated earlier, I still have to get use to using the remote app. I chose not to with my last adventure because I didn't want to carry my phone on a zip line, a white water raft or while parasailing.I will update this review as I go, but I'm very happy with the camera & video quality of the HERO4 Silver. Downloads to my tablet & computer were simple and no special software is required to view since the files are mp4.Overall, the HERO4 Silver is pretty easy to understand & use - even for those who are not photography experts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK1HNL6JO4X6P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIYJF6U#wasThisHelpful","RK1HNL6JO4X6P","A2SZLNSI5KOQJT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SZLNSI5KOQJT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

While there is an enclosed paper to write you information on, I folded a business card & my name aligned perfectly with the opening (business card name is on the bottom right of the card).The loop is made of plastic & while I haven't used these particular tags for a long time, my old luggage tag used the same type of plastic loop & that loop held up for years on both domestic & international flights (I replaced the old tag because EVA Air managed to crush my plastic tag).Overall, I love these luggage tags.

"Small & fairly lightweight, this cable lock works as a deterrent for the casual thief.  I also use it to lock luggage in hotel rooms - more for a visual that the bag hasn't been tampered with (the reality is that a serious thief would either cut the lock, break the zipper or slash the suitcase).I use the lock on my carry-on roller suitcase & I have never been stopped by TSA in the States. I was required to open my suitcase in a Latin American country, but they had me open the lock myself.There are a couple of downsides to the lock:(1) I found it a little difficult to push the button (with a pointed object) & set the code. The lock is small, the button is small & setting the code required one hand to hold the lock & keep the button pushed down while the other hand set the combo. It wasn't impossible, but I had to find the right tool to push the button.(2) My lock is silver & the lock dials are silver.  The small numbers are black, but not a dark, dark black.

"This external battery pack has 2 great features not found in most battery packs - (1) it can swiftly charge 2 devices at once & (2) the charging cord's design has 2 connectors (micro USB & iPhone lightning adaptor) combined so you won't lose an adaptor.Charging the external battery is pretty quick. It has 4 indicator lights showing the charge level.  Once charged, the external pack does a fairly quick job of charging devices & putting 2 on at the same time doesn't impinge upon the charging of one versus another.The unit is compact, but it is weighty. I would use it for car trips rather than airplane/suitcase travel.

"UGH THIS BOOK WAS SO BAD!I read the first book in this series (Rush) and I kinda liked it. Then I read Fever (the second book) and pretty much felt like ""WTH AM I READING?"" the entire time. Jace comes across like a creepy stalker and Bethany is pretty much a doormat. I read the blurb for Burn and I was intrigued by the whole concept that Josie has the cajones to tell Mr. Rich Billionaire NO. That's she's not interested in being a doormat for him like Bethany was for Jace.QUOTE FROM BLURB: ""Then Ash meets Josie, who seems immune to his charms and his wealth.""See?QUOTE FROM BLURB: ""He never imagined the one woman to tell him no would be the only woman whod ever drive him to the edge of desire.""Yeah, a feisty woman! One who isn't going to let Mr. Rich Guy walk all over her and command her EVERY MOVE.Unfortunately, that's not what happened.The romance part of plot of this book is nearly identical to Fever.Ash sees Josie and falls in insta-obsession. He has a brief conversation with her where he questions her about her collar (apparently she's already in a dom/sub relationship). He's so obsessed with her at this point that he hires people to follow her and stalk her.When he finds out she pawned some of her jewelry, he's SO MAD that her dom isn't taking care of her. He buys her jewelry from the pawnshop and uses it to blackmail her in to going on a date with him.Man, this is so romantic!During the date he tells her all about how he wants to own her and be her dom and she'll have to agree to let him run every aspect of her life. She is a little wishy washy about it and tells him that she needs time to think about it (OMG YOU THINK??).Then she never calls. (YES, GO GIRL!)A week later, Ash is still having her stalked and finds out that someone punched her in the face.He takes it upon himself to burst in to her apartment and tell her that she's moving in with him. (UH, WHAT THE EVERLOVING HECK??)Josie, who is supposedly able to tell Ash ""no"" and is ""immune to his charms"" doesn't tell the creepy jerk to get out of her house. Instead she feels ""relief"" that someone else is there to make all her decisions for her.Hmm... this all sounds familiar. Insta-obsession? Stalking? Girl gets roughed up and guy forces her to move in with him and take over her life? Yeah, repeat of Fever.And all this happens by around page 90-100?I really liked Rush. While Gabe was a little bit neanderthal, I felt like there was a much more equal relationship between him and Mia. I also felt like Mia had a little more freedom, despite the contract.In both Fever and Burn, we get absolute doormat women who can't have a shred of independence. The men are people who would be considered stalkers in real life. Their actions would end up with them in jail. This is just not romantic. This isn't a dom/sub relationship. It's a rich billionaire forcing his will on a homeless women and a completely broke woman getting out of a rough relationship, but calling it a ""love"" story.This book is CRAP.This isn't love, people. I'm scared for women who think it is. Looking for this type of man will end up with you being controlled and abused.Hell, this isn't even good BDSM!UGH.(Side note: The fact that each girl in each book ends up going out with Mia and her ""gaggle of girlfriends"" was so eyerollingly stupid by the third book.Mia: ""TEEHEE! We all get drunk and then go dancing at a club! Then afterwards we go home and our men will sleep with us in just our heels! IT'S SO AWESOME!!""Bethany:  ""HEEHEE!  In my book we all went out and got drunk and I slept with MY man in just my heels too, after Mia told me about how AWESOME it is!!""Josie: ""OMG I want you guys that I just met to tell me all about how you sleep with your men wearing just your heels and then I want to get new heels so Ash can sleep with me in just my heels too! TEEHEE!""Men: ""You women are too pathetic to do anything on your own, so one of us will babysit you every time you have a Girls Night Out.""Girls: ""OMG SO ROMANTIC!! Please sleep with me in just my heels!"")","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VXQO92GCP0K8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009NY859M#wasThisHelpful","R2VXQO92GCP0K8","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I won this book via a Goodreads FirstReads Giveaway - THANK YOU!I'd rate this one a very weak 3 stars. Probably 2.5ish, but I'll round up to three.I love the idea of the plot. I'm a big fan of the childhood friends falling in love later in life trope. And the brothers fighting over the same girl trope. And the sneaky matchmaking Grandma trope.HOWEVER....This book just made it all a little awkward. I really think that Rachel Van Dyken tried too hard to be funny and instead made things over-the-top and weird. For example, Grandma is not just a feisty lady, she wears SIX INCH HEELS (at 85 years old) and brags about her lover.As far as the main characters...Kacey is pretty well written and interesting, but I got tired of her flip-flopping around between Jake and Travis.Jake is horrible. He's supposed to be this womanizer who sleeps with sluts and strippers all the time (ok, perhaps semi realistic for a millionaire 21 year old playboy), but he is also supposedly super charming and Kacey can't help falling for his charm over and over again. I just didn't see it. He comes across like a complete jerk. And I did like when Kacey called him out on his bad behavior, but then she kept doing whatever he wanted her to do anyways - including pretending to be his fiance so that the board of directors would think him serious enough to run the billion dollar company (at age 21).But then Kacey starts screwing around with Travis (Jake's brother) behind his back. I did like the dynamic between Travis and Kacey, where they ""hated"" each other and pranked each other all the time. I found their banter to be amusing and that's the only thing that held this story together for me. Well, except for the scene where Travis is spitting on Kacey's face. That grossed me out beyond belief and I almost stopped reading right then and there.Another huge issue I had with this book is the AGE of the characters. Kacey and Jake are 21, Travis is 23. The premise of this book just doesn't work with characters this young. If they were late 20's/early 30's I would have bought it. But Jake and Kacey are 21 and supposedly had a fling in college and the timing is just not right. Assuming most people graduate high school at 17-18, they would graduate college at 21-22. Jake is BARELY out of college and his dad (who has to be what, 45-50?) has already retired and left his billion dollar company in the hands of a 21 year old who theoretically has ZERO work experience? Just not logical.Also, Travis has supposedly owned ""one of the biggest ranches in the area"" for ""years"" but he also has to be barely out of college. And he did go to college because it's mentioned that he was a college student when Kacey and Jake were in high school.Like I said, the timing is just awkward and off.Last major gripe - the reunion. First of all, other than tiny schools where everyone knows everyone, who does reunions every year? Also, Jake is all super excited about going to his 4-year high school reunion... why? He's a millionaire playboy banging strippers and models. He was a millionaire during high school and grew up rich and popular (so there's no need to shove it in people's faces). So why is he so excited to go? Also, it's only been FOUR YEARS, yet the women are all described as pregnant and desperate while the men (their husbands) are all fat and balding already. These kids are all 21 years old! I'm sorry, if it was a 20 year reunion, maybe those descriptions would make sense.AGAIN, the timing is bizarre.  I feel like this was written as an adult novel, but the publisher (or author) decided to try and capitalize on the New Adult trend and just changed all of the ages.All that said and done, the book flowed well. I read it quickly and kept reading. Lately I've had such bad luck in books and I hate when a book is a chore, and this one wasn't. I even have some interest in reading the sequel (Jake's love story, I believe).I'd say this one is about the quality I'd expect from an e-book $2.99 or less.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LXQFKXORI3JE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DB7RCD2#wasThisHelpful","R3LXQFKXORI3JE","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"*I was provided a free copy of this book from Netgalley.com (thank you!!) in exchange for an honest review*This is another I have mixed feelings on. I think my hesitation on liking it is based on the fact that when I got to the end, it didn't feel like a complete story. I was left unsatisfied. :(The author did a lot of telling instead of showing. A main example, which drove me nuts, is that Rose is constantly telling us how she uses big words all the time in dialogue. I can't even think of one example where Rose used big words in dialogue. Most of Rose's dialogue consists of ""um"" and stammering.Jamie was another odd character. I couldn't like him, and I tried. I kept hoping that he would redeem himself. That the whole relationship between him and the mean girl was a fallacy. But it kind of wasn't. He pretty much was dating her and leading Rose on on the side. While the mean girl was stereotypically mean and probably deserved all the bad stuff, but what does it say about his character when he's playing two girls like that?I did appreciate that Rose was willing to stand up to the mean kids and do the right thing, especially like at the party where the girl was passed out, possibly not breathing, and she called 911, knowing that she would be ostracized for it later.  It's commendable and I appreciate that she was willing to do that, knowing there would be backlash from it.I couldn't stand Rose's best friend. She was an awful person who treated Rose terribly all for the sake of being popular. I could see this happening in real life, though, so I can't really mark down for it. I just thought she was a horrible person and I wanted Rose to kick her to the curb and find a real friend. I did like that Rose tried her best, despite risking her own reputation, to help her friend do the right thing (which she never really did).MINOR SPOILERS AFTER THISThe ending was what really left a bad taste in my mouth. Jamie 'kind of' redeems himself by telling off the mean girl, but does that excuse his behavior the rest of the book? I don't think so.I don't want to spoil the end for anyone who plans on reading this, but the end is just... unsatisfying. I can't think of another way to say it. There's no resolution to the Jamie/Rose storyline at all. I guess there are going to be more books, but I feel like each books in a series should feel complete.I'm not sure I will continue reading this series. It wasn't the most awful book ever, but it just wasn't that good either.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZU622F610D4M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373210485#wasThisHelpful","R1ZU622F610D4M","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read ""Her Best Worst Mistake"" (the companion novel to this) and LOVED it. Unfortunately, Hot Island Nights just didn't appeal to me at all. I had trouble buying the progression of Elizabeth and Nathan's relationship.The sex started immediately and seemed to come out of nowhere, and the ""feelings"" between them also seemed to come out of nowhere. We get some glimpses in to Nathan's mind, and he was not seeming to want anything to do with Elizabeth outside of sex, then suddenly he's confessing all of his fears and life story and crying in front of her? I don't know, it just seemed forced and fast and Mayberry is usually SO much better than this.I also just didn't like Nathan much as a character. I didn't find him interesting or attractive. I liked Elizabeth in ""Her Best Worst Mistake"" and she really was a complex and compelling character, but Nathan was just kind of a beefcake with PTSD over a car crash. After completely falling in love with Violet and Martin, I was really really hoping that Elizabeth would find someone just as amazing for her and Nathan just bored me to tears. I also hated the constant use of ""Betty"" and ""Lizzy"" as nicknames for Elizabeth","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31AJ1A79CS39L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ZK5M4G#wasThisHelpful","R31AJ1A79CS39L","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got Reached from the library and it sat here. And sat here. And become overdue by a week. And finally I opened it up and started reading and it was pretty boring.It starts off with all of the main characters split up, working on their own parts of the upcoming ""rising."" I never found Cassia to be particularly intriguing, but she was downright yawn inducing here. The entire concept of trading poems like they are some kind of rich commodity is downright ridiculous. The entire time we're in Cassia's head, she's waxing poetic about Ky and trading poems (!!!).Ky and Xander both are mooning over Cassia, at least until Xander runs in to another female. The love triangle was not much of a triangle. There was never an option of Ky and Cassia not ending up together, it was just a matter of what would Condie do with poor Xander. Would she kill him off? Would she make him end up heartbroken and alone? Or would she do the ultimate love triangle cop-out and find him his own love interest?I'll give you three guesses and I bet it will only take one!As far as the ""Rising"" itself... talk about an uninteresting takeover. We spend pages and pages going OMG THE PILOT! He's COMING! THE RISING IS STARTING! Then boom, flip a page and the Rising has already taken over. There's no war. It's just done. And I sat here going 'what the heck?'I'll be completely honest, after that point, I ended up skipping huge chunks of the book and I missed absolutely nothing important. If I can skip 50-80 pages in one huge chunk and I'm not completely lost when I start again, something is wrong with your novel!This series was never that amazing to begin with, but this conclusion is far from epic.

"I love this series! Girl of Nightmares was a perfect followup to Anna Dressed in Blood. Sequels often fail to match the hype of the original, but I have to say this one came pretty close.While I liked Girl of Nightmares, it didn't hook me nearly as much as the first. I found myself skimming occasionally and I think that's partially because outside of a few quick visions, Anna was mostly absent in this book. The majority of Girl of Nightmares is Cas trying to get to Anna once he finds out she's in Hell (or what she thinks is Hell).When I started this series, I was a little weirded out by the ghost/human love story, but it totally made sense. I was also nervous about how Blake would end it, but she blew it away. I won't spoil it, but the ending was perfect, absolutely perfect.Parts of Girl of Nightmares bored me, as Cas spends a lot of time traveling around. A new character (Jestine) was introduced, and I didn't connect with her as much as with the other side characters. Outside of these minor issues, the book was great.Definitely will be checking out more from this author in the future!","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7M01OKQYIHBJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007IM0PX0#wasThisHelpful","R7M01OKQYIHBJ","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was so terrible I couldn't finish. I made it through about 200 pages, so I think I gave it a good try! Between the juvenile characters/writing, completely nonsensical plot, and the author constantly breaking her own rules, I just couldn't do it.Xavier and Bethany are so wooden and terrible and boring. Bethany is supposed to be an ANGEL who has SPOKEN TO GOD. Like, to his face. I'm an atheist, but I don't mind reading about religious things in novels. There are some great angel novels out there, but this is NOT one of them. Bethany is awful. She and her angel friends are supposedly on a mission to battle evil forces by doing good deeds. Gabriel tells her she is not to make friends or get too close to humans, but apparently part of Bethany's mission is to go to high school. I have no idea why, because we're told that the evil forces are doing things like killing hundreds of people in the Middle East... and God sends Bethany to high school in what is described by the author as a 'sleepy' small town?Bethany of course, instantly starts making friends, going to parties (WHERE SHE GETS DRUNK), having sleepovers, going to the mall, whatever. Basically acting like a normal teenager. Apparently teenage angels are the same as teenage people. I guess I would expect more from a minion of God who is on Earth to battle evil. Bethany instantly falls in love with Xavier, but I don't really get why. After a couple meetings, she just decides to reveal her big secret. Xavier then is all ""OMG MY GIRLFRIEND IS AN ANGEL!""  I'm pretty sure she wasn't supposed to go flashing her wings around all willy nilly....That's about where I quit, because I just couldn't take it anymore. For an angel supposedly on Earth on a MISSION FROM GOD, Bethany is surprisingly selfish. She also did NOTHING to further her mission. From what I gather, her entire mission is to do good deeds and so far, she hasn't done even one.I can't remember all the instances of the author breaking her own rules, but the one that sticks out is where she makes sure to mention how angels don't get tired. They could run marathons without breaking a sweat or breathing hard. But Bethany decides to run over to Xavier and starts talking ""between breaths"" like she's winded. Literally a handful of pages later!Ugh, absolutely terrible.

"I REALLY wanted to like this book. REALLY bad! I love the rock star bad boy romance/erotica books, but this one just fell short for me.I liked the main characters, but everything seemed so rushed. The first time Nick and Lauren meet again he starts making out with her. He hasn't seen her in 15 years, he dumped her to become famous and have groupies, and she doesn't really fight it at all. The book is 90% sex, 10% plot and the plot is weak. I guess I just prefer my erotica to be slightly more deep.If the sex was actually sexy, I could deal with the plot being a little less than stellar... but the sex was kind of weird. Couper uses a lot of awkward terms during sex scenes that are jarring and completely ruin it for me. Anytime there is gushing, it kind of destroys the scene.I probably would have liked this better with toned down and more well written sex scenes, and another 100 pages of character development and plot. For a a short novella, it wasn't terrible... I just think this author's style is not my thing.  I also can't justify paying $3+ for a novella when there are a LOT of amazing full length self published novels on Amazon for $2.99 and under.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFD0SRDP6PIUV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007C6YYSO#wasThisHelpful","RFD0SRDP6PIUV","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book was almost as much of a roller coaster as the first.When Avoiding Responsibility starts, it's a year later and Lexi isn't speaking to Jack or Ramsey. She's dating some unknown mystery guy and is surprised when Ramsey calls to ask her to Jack's wedding. She is a strong woman and says HELL NO. At first.Then we start flashing back to see what happened over the last year, and we find out about the relationship that started and ended between Lexi and Ramsey.I admit, I was left feeling unsatisfied at the end of Avoiding Commitment. Not because it was a cliffhanger, but because I felt like Lexi just got totally dumped on by the end (by Jack and Bekah) and it felt like the ""bad guys"" won. The only part of the ending of Avoiding Commitment I liked was Lexi finally standing up to Jack and realizing how poisonous he was to her.Then Ramsey asks her to the wedding. She says no, of course, but then she finds out Ramsey is in New York WITH JACK for Jack's bachelor party. Somehow, Lexi ends up at Jack's party where a drunken Jack begs her to come to his wedding.Of course, Lexi agrees. This part bugged me. I hated that she would agree to go to his wedding to Bekah. There was absolutely no reason for her to go, other than to make herself feel like total garbage. Again.But she does go. And there is a bunch of the same sort of underhanded passive aggressive conflict between Lexi and Bekah, ridiculous sexual tension between Lexi and Jack, and the hint of something really special between Lexi and Ramsey.At the end of Avoiding Commitment I was completely Team Jack, hoping and praying for some sort of redemption in this book.**SPOILER ALERT**That redemption doesn't come. However, I was okay with it. While the end of this book has some loose ends, I felt better about things. I felt that Bekah finally got a tiny bit of what she deserves. I felt like Jack stooped so low that I didn't even want him to redeem himself anymore. And Ramsey stepped up and I'm really hoping that things work out for him and Lexi in book 3. I'm really hoping that Bekah and Jack both end up alone, but I'm starting to realize they deserve each other and will probably make each other miserable.K.A. Linde has a real talent for creating these realistic and flawed characters that you can't help but feel SOMETHING for. Her books also flow so well that you just lose yourself in the pages and suddenly it's two hours later and you're done and you're wondering what the heck just happened.I'm really looking forward to seeing what else she comes out with and she's going on my auto-buy list for sure.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O71VX209D9IZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AG3KPR4#wasThisHelpful","R3O71VX209D9IZ","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not very good at writing spoiler free reviews, but I'll try here.Opal starts off right around where we left off in Onyx. I hadn't touched this series since I read Onyx, but I was fortunately able to remember enough to not be lost when I started Opal.Katy has finally accepted her feelings for Daemon and they've started what could be termed as a ""real"" relationship. And I LOVE it! Daemon is so sweet here, especially with his adorable date nights. He's still Daemon, and Katy is still her same snarky self, but together they're just so cute. I don't generally fangirl over book guys, but the Daemon in Opal is really starting to bring it out in me!The plotline with the government and the other aliens is pretty tumultuous here and just keeps getting better and better! There is plenty of action mixed in with all the romantic Katy/Daemon time.Jennifer Armentrout also will absolutely KILL you with the ending. As soon as I finished I immediately went to look up the release date of Origin (the next book in the series) and whined profusely when I saw how long I'd have to wait. UGH KILLER CLIFFHANGER ARMENTROUT! EVIL EVIL WOMAN!If you liked Obsidian and Onyx, you'll like Opal. For me, Opal was like a combination of all the good stuff in Obsidian and Onyx - sexual tension and romance between Katy/Daemon, crazy alien action scenes, government intrigue and mystery, an ending that will leave you absolutely clamoring for more... what else could you ask for?","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38DG5XJO0T5Y8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AAH7Y5C#wasThisHelpful","R38DG5XJO0T5Y8","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"SPOILERS in this review!At first, I wanted to like this book. I liked that Natalie Sterling was going to be a strong female character who was proud of getting good grades and being a leader. But as you get in to the book, Natalie becomes more and more unlikable. She treats her best friend, Autumn, poorly throughout the book and I was surprised it took that long for Autumn to ditch her. Natalie comes across like a man-hating, slut-shaming feminazi and until the last 2-3 pages I really hated her.We never really get a reason for WHY she acts that way either. There is a prologue telling a story about a freshman girl who dated a popular senior guy for a few months but when she wouldn't put out, the guy dumps her and tells everyone that her vagina smelled like fish. But, we learn this didn't even happen to Natalie. It happened to Autumn. And Natalie uses this traumatic event to keep Autumn away from everyone else at the school but her. She constantly reminds Autumn of the event and reminds her that SHE (Natalie) is the only one who stood up for her. She refuses to allow Autumn to forgive anyone because she is afraid Autumn will find other friends and leave her.Connor was great, but I wonder why he even liked Natalie. She treats him like garbage throughout the entire story. He brings her a bunch of wood from his family's farm for a bonfire. When it rains, he takes it upon himself to pack up all the wood and get rid of it for her. Instead of thanking him, she acts like a witch and tells him she doesn't need a man's help and could do it herself. After they sort of start seeing each other in private, he brings her a bunch of stuff for Thanksgiving baskets (that she's putting together for student council) and she acts like a complete witch again. Even when they're together in private she is terrible to him. I just don't see the appeal.Spencer was an interesting character. She is the counter to Natalie's uptight feminist ways and she wants to prove to Natalie, and everyone else, that slut shaming is bad too. She does this by calling herself a ""Rosstitute"" (mix of the school name and prostitute), letting a boy take a naked picture of her, and otherwise acting like a slut. While I agree with her overall point, I think she goes way overboard. If my 14 year old was acting like that, I would be very disappointed in her.I think the overall moral of the story was good. I like when a book has a bigger meaning and purpose other than the typical YA romance (will they or won't they get together?). I think the point was supposed to be for Natalie and Spencer to both realize they were going to extremes, and that meeting somewhere in the middle is probably a better option for both of them. I think that point got across.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 18, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3THQ1OIDL9ZLA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054516916X#wasThisHelpful","R3THQ1OIDL9ZLA","A2IF5C0I5BH11F","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2IF5C0I5BH11F?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Eau de Toilette comes in a very cute heart-shaped bottle.  The bottom is glass and the top, the lid, is plastic.  I had no trouble at all getting the top off - just takes a twist.  I did have a bit of trouble getting the bottom of the bottle out of the clear plastic inserts that nestled it into the box because it was quite tight, but I only had to do that once.  The box itself if clear red plastic so that you can see the red bottle inside.Okay, this is an attractive spray, but scent is what is important.  I do like it, but with some caveats.  It is floral, as I expected.  It is also kind of sweet, an old-fashioned scent.  I reminds me of those boxes of talcum powder women used to use.  For my sense of smell, it is a little too sweet for everyday use.  However, it is nice for those days when you're feeling romantic and frilly rather than cool and sophisticated.  This is a light-hearted fragrance, bringing to mind butterflies and gardens rather than woods and musk.It takes only a spritz, and it lasts quite a long time on my skin.  My husband likes it on me, perhaps a bit more than I like it on myself.  It is not going to be my everyday fragrance, but it is a nice change of pace.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UTVDJSW77PNO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QHS18Y#wasThisHelpful","R2UTVDJSW77PNO","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From the first page, I loved Elsa's grandmother.  And I loved the very precocious almost-8-year old Elsa.  So why does Elsa have to tell people her grandmother is sorry?Lots of different people, all somewhat odd people, live in the apartments where Elsa lives.  And, as in all good fairy tales, and this is a fairy tale intertwined with reality, some are not quite what they seem at first impression.The writing, as in Backman's A Man Called Ove, is gorgeous.  The story is imaginative.  There are monsters and superheroes and everyday heroes and not-so-normal people.  Of course, Elsa is way too bright to be almost-8, but I don't care.

"This review is for the antler alternative from Nylabone.  I was concerned about getting only one bone when I have two dogs, but I needn't be.  Unfortunately, the reason is that neither dog seems to like this antler very much.  They were pretty excited when I opened the package.  I gave it first to the bigger dog,  The front of the package doesn't state what size dog this is for, but the back, once I got the product, stated ""Recommended for dogs:  Up to 50 lbs/25 kg.""  A photo of the back of the package would be helpful to see on the product page.My larger dog is pushing 50 pounds.  My smaller dog is a little less than half that.  So, I gave the treat to the bigger dog, and he was happy to get it.  I gave a different treat to the smaller dog, and the bigger one immediately dropped the antler to go see what other treats were on offer.He didn't go back to the antler, but when I handed it to him, he chewed on it for maybe 30 seconds at the most.  When he abandoned it, I gave it to the smaller dog.  He chewed on it/played with it for maybe 15 seconds.  Since then, it has been ignored.This is a hard chew-type toy, not a consumable.  If your dog manages to chew a piece off and swallow it, you are supposed to contact your veterinarian.  It can be hand washed with warm soapy water, and then rinsed, according to the instructions.  It is ""WITH CALCIUM AND MINERALS!"" but no ingredient list, probably not required because it is not meant to be consumed.  But I would like something a little more definitive than ""WITH CALCIUM AND MINERALS!""But that is moot if my dogs won't chew on it.  Unfortunately, they give it two paws down.  Your dogs may have different opinions, but in this house, it is just another thing to step on in the middle of the night when I'm barefoot.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNMGZVF73AR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X591CH8#wasThisHelpful","R2BNMGZVF73AR9","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I ordered these sports bras, I admit that I thought I was ordering a different style, a racerback style I'd bought in the past.  So I was disappointed when I opened the package, that is until I tried them on.  I like these better.They are a nice, heavyweight fabric and they fit very well.  They give moderate support to the well-endowed among us, perhaps not enough support for jogging, but good for most activities.  If I were young and skinny, which I am not, I'd have no qualms about wearing these without a shirt over them.  Alas, that would not be a good look now, but the coverage these provide is quite good.These regular straps look better under most of my tops than the racerback style does.  I'm going to order more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HHHYJ4YHNCRL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E8OOCD0#wasThisHelpful","R1HHHYJ4YHNCRL","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband often grills fish, and I thought these pans might help with that task.  And they do.  They are lightweight, and hold a fillet or two, or a relatively small whole fish.  And they are nicely no-stick.  However, I'm not sure it is worth getting a special product for grilling fish.  Until we got these pans, we made a little tray out of aluminum foil with the sides turned up, and buttered the bottom.  That works just as well as these pans, and is more versatile because you can make whatever size you need.  And of course, that is cheaper.These are handy for grilling, for camping, and when you don't want to blacken a pan over the grill.  For inside cooking, I don't see much advantage over a reusable pan.  The instructions say to ""place the Reynolds Bakeware Fish Pan on a permanent baking pan with 1-inch sides.""  For light fillets, we don't do this, but doesn't that kind of defeat the whole purpose?  You still have to use and wash a permanent pan.These don't come shrink-wrapped, just have a band of plastic around the 3 pans, holding them together, and with a label sticky-glued to the top pan, so I did lightly wash them before use.  However. be aware that if you wash these, be very gentle because the non-stick coating does wash off.These pans don't fit into my toaster oven, which is quite a small one.For this household, we're going back to buttered aluminum foil.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DW9IJ0VYQBAC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UN3AE0#wasThisHelpful","R1DW9IJ0VYQBAC","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this product for review.These lights are tiny, but very cute.  The solar is nice so that you don't have to mess with electrical outlets.  You do want to put them in a place where you are going to keep them, because like all tiny lights on long wires, they do tangle easily.  However, for permanent fairy lights, they are quite nice.  I prefer the steady light rather than the optional blinking.I have a similar set that started losing ability to hold a charge after less than three months.  This solar setup looks the same, just with a different style of light, so I am going to have to wait to see if these start failing to hold a charge.  If so, stringing them only to have to take them down and replace them is going to be a disappointment.

"I was given this product for review.There are lots of reasons to wear a faux diamond ring instead of a real diamond ring.  Diamonds are ridiculously expensive, and their mining is exploitative and eco-destructive.  Maybe you don't want the good stuff stolen when you are on vacation, or maybe you just can't afford the good stuff.At any rate, if you want the bling of diamonds without all the negatives, this is a good alternative.  The set is quite attractive and nicely made.  The bands are somewhat squared off rather than round.  The size fit me as I expected.  If you want all-out bling, wear both rings,  If you want something a bit more subtle, just wear the single band.

"I've heard about A Town Like Alice for years, and finally got around to listening to it.  While it was interesting, and while I liked it, I don't sing its praises as many do.The story was intriguing, starting off with a misogynist attitude disguised as protection.  The attitudes in this 1950 book were rather startling  the casual disregard of the abos, the indigenous Australians, and the acceptance of cruelty  stealing animals and leaving them penned without food or water for days to break them.  Of course, there was the brutality of war, but our attitudes  toward that haven't changed much  brutality is still acceptable.  Women, except for the lead character Jean Paget were too much portrayed as spineless simpletons.  Jean though was tough.  Very tough.  I liked her entrepreneurial spirit.I got really, REALLY tired of the phrase, Oh my word!  Over and over and over....But what caused me to like this book less than I would otherwise was how it devolved into a hasty romance.  I expected better.  While this novel was based on real people, there was historical inaccuracy, so read it as a novel, not as fictionalized fact.  Entertaining, but not a favorite.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZ57TB9BSKJ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0024705K2#wasThisHelpful","R1EZ57TB9BSKJ6","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eating a jelly-filled doughnut takes concentration.  That's our introduction to the protagonist, a private investigator, Sam Blackman, who has trouble getting to court with a clean shirt.  This mystery, set in Asheville, North Carolina, is full of local atmosphere.  A ghost tour of Asheville's famous hauntings is supposed to raise money for two tragically orphaned children.  But things, of course, cannot go as planned.There are lots of red herrings in this story.  There is also an underlying message, or at any rate, a question about justice.  Is winning more important than justice?  Apparently.The characters are fun, the mystery is fun, and I really enjoyed the atmospheric settings.  I had to admit I got a laugh out of one chaplain's description of what he called the Prosperity Gospel:  Jesus is my boyfriend and he's going to buy me presents.  But no, this isn't a religion-bashing story.The book is relatively short, and an entertaining, easy read between those longer, heavier stories.I was given an uncorrected proof of this book for review.

"The first time I sprayed this solution onto my tongue, I thought it tasted horrible.  I didn't mind it on subsequent uses, so perhaps the first time was a bit shocking and I just got used to the taste.  The solution does seem to work very well.  The active ingredient is cetylpyridnium (sp?) chloride, different from the active ingredients in the mouthwash I have on hand.I have a fairly high gag reflex, and I can't use this too far back on my tongue without triggering that reflex, but it doesn't cause a problem for the front 2/3s or so of my tongue.The little nubby head works well, too.  Used on the Philips Sonicare handle, it vibrates just as the toothbrush head does, of course.  Is this head more effective than gently using the toothbrush head?  If this head is better for some reason, why don't they just include a similar area on the back of the regular toothbrush head, and sell the solution separately?  I used another electric toothbrush that did include the tongue scrapper on the back of the regular head, and that means I didn't have to switch out heads all the time - just use the other side of the toothbrush.  Switching heads is inconvenient, and I imagine very few people have two handles so they don't have to do that.The instructions that came with this state that you should rinse and repeat for a total of three times.  If you routinely clean your tongue, I don't think 3 times is necessary.  I didn't see the instructions until I was putting the box in the recycling bin.  The purple paper at the back of the box, which I thought was just part of the packaging, is a little instruction pamphlet.It would also be nice if this came with a little protective cover, as the brush heads do.  I don't want to just stick it in a drawer with no cover.At the time of this review, I can find replacement heads on Amazon, but not replacement solution on its own, just this kit.  To me, it would be wise to include the tongue scrubber on the back of the regular toothbrush and sell the solution separately.  That would eliminate all the negative aspects of this helpful but not entirely practical product.  If the company is afraid that the solution wouldn't sell if done this way, they could include a small sample of the spray with the original handle and head, so people could have a chance to try it, and buy replacement solution as desired.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16FETIWGMV3YO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012AFJDVE#wasThisHelpful","R16FETIWGMV3YO","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you want to read this Jame Smiley trilogy, the Last Hundred Years trilogy, you'd better hunker down and get read for a long story.  None of the book are short.  And you'd better bookmark the family tree pages.They really should be read in order.  Some trilogies have second or third books that can stand on their own without reading the previous book(s) but this is not such a story.  It builds on the others to an extent that you would lose much of the importance of this book without the others.The series is about family, mostly a farming family that branches out.  But it is about much more than that.  It is also about the issues, the politics, the concerns of each era.  Golden Age convers 1987 through 2019  so a little look at the future, too.I loved the first book, Some Luck.  I enjoyed the second, Early Warning, but not as much as the first.  This latest one is a complex and lovely end.  I didn't love it quit as much as the first book, but more than the second, and even though I didn't love it is much as Some Luck, it is still, in my opinion, a five-star novel.However, it was a challenge for me to read.  There are so many characters, a cast of thousands.  Well, that is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem like much of a stretch.  I bookmarked the family tree and had to keep referring back to it.  Is so-and-so a cousin or a sibling?  Who did Cousin Whatshername marry?The characters are complex and interesting, if not always lovable.  None of them are flat, one-sided.  Some were unlikable, one of them especially so, some were charming, but they were all different.What I liked as much as the story of family was the way the story of that age was woven into the story.  This one covered politics, of course, and climate change, and GMO crops, and Monsanto practices.  Housing market collapse.  Corruption.  Lots of corruption.  And references to real people in the news these days, or over the last few decades.If you like long, involved family sagas, this one is excellent, and worth the time it takes to read it and its two precursors.Jane Smiley's writing is wonderful, mixing the sometimes esoteric with the mundane.  One of the more likable characters, Henry, is thinking about the Justinian Plague, the Dark Ages, the Battle of Badon, and several other deep subjects in a long paragraph, and the next paragraph is, in  its entirety,He found a parking spot.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book for review.

The settings are sturdy and even, not sloppily done.  The only reason these are 4 star instead of five is because they are completely flat, something I couldn't tell from the illustrations.

"For those who like disposable dusters, this one is very good.  The 360 design means there is lot of surface for dusting, an improvement over the older, blue refill Swiffer duster I have.  The yellow part is exceptionally soft.  It doesn't just move the dust around; it picks it up.  The handle is like the old one, not exceptionally sturdy but certainly adequate for light dusting.  The refills are easy to slide on, but of course, they are also easy to slide off.  If you are an ""enthusiastic"" duster, you might find yourself sliding the duster back onto the handle after it starts to slide off.  At least I do.This seems kind of a lightweight for heavier duties, like dusting wood blinds.  It does work, but just seems a bit on the flimsy side.  And I still am going to do polishing, wet-dusting, oiling the old fashioned way now and then.  Where this really excels is a quick dusting between the heavier chores.  I can do the whole house in almost no time, and give it a fresher look, certainly good for when that unexpected company drops by.This starter kit contains one handle and two disposable duster pads.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JWY2TMV9UJEI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZLUOM1W#wasThisHelpful","R3JWY2TMV9UJEI","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These puzzles range from simple ones to tough ones, and I like having that variety - the easy ones for when I want a quick break from doing something different and the harder ones for when I have time to work a bit longer.  There are some ""Samurai Sudoku"" puzzles, too - 4 9X9 grids with a 5th grid intersecting part of each of the others.  I'd never done those before, and I like them.The binding is quite good.  I usually tear out the pages as I am done with them, and the binding holds up well for that.  The paper is good for writing with both ink and pencil, and it is sturdy enough to stand up to erasing.When I first got this book, I thought that perhaps the puzzles, two to a page except for the Samurai ones, might be too small.  I admit to sometimes jotting numbers in the bottoms of the squares when I am stumped.  I can still do that with this book, despite my initial reservations.I use those little Post-It arrows to mark the first empty page of each section so it's easy to find the degree of challenge I want at the time.  Little built-in tabs would have been nice but that would probably have made this not such an easily affordable book.

"I've had the more traditional type of Nylabones in my dogs' toybox for years, and I've had many dogs, my own and foster dogs, over those years.  Sometimes the dogs like to chew on Nylabones, sometimes they don't.  At any rate, I thought these dental chews sounded like a good idea, so wanted my dogs to test drive them.On the plus side, the dogs really seemed to like them.  And the ingredients don't seem to contain anything bad,  And perhaps they are really good for their teeth.On the negative side, they disappear in an instant.  There are only three treats in the package, each with three prongs, for ""up to 9 treating occasions!""  There is no obvious marking on the front of the package about what size dogs these are for, but in tiny print on the back, it says ""For dogs up to 30 pounds, feed up to two medium chews per day.""  These tiny treats are apparently ""medium,"" but it would be nice if that were marked on the front of the package.I now have one dog several pounds under 30, and one dog several pounds over 30.  I would not give only one ""prong"" to even the smaller dog.  One prong is tiny, and I can't imagine it working well for the average ""small"" dog, like mine.  I actually am afraid he would swallow it whole because it is so small.  So I gave both dogs a full treat, three prongs, leaving one treat left in the package.  And I immediately started breaking down the cardboard box the product was shipped in, to put it in the recycle bin.  The larger dog was done with his treat before I got the box broken down.  Okay, he is too big for these treats , even though that is not obvious from the packaging.But my little dog should be just the right size as long as I give him the whole treat instead of just one third of it.  It took him only a few seconds longer than the larger dog -- all gone within less than two minutes.While these are treats that my dogs appreciate, they are not practical for keeping their teeth clean.  For the vast majority of us who have dogs, we simply cannot afford to give a $3+ treat, or two of them, to our dogs every day. At current prices, giving two treats a day to each of my two dogs would be over $400 a month.  Just one treat - still over $200.  And as treats, there are more reasonable options.  I'm afraid this won't be a staple in our household.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEB6NE42M1X8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012DH4LRK#wasThisHelpful","R1AEB6NE42M1X8","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The first time I used this hand cream, I thought the scent was too strong, and not one I especially liked.  Now that I've used it many more times, the scent has kind of grown on me, and I don't find it objectionable, although I'd prefer if it were unscented.Despite that, this is a truly excellent hand cream.  It takes just a little bit to make my hands feel soft and protected, and that effect lasts!  I like that it contains NO parabens or phthalate.  It is not unreasonably priced, especially considering that it seems concentrated, so it doesn't take as much as with some more watery products.  It is not so thick that it is difficult to spread, just not watery feeling.  I can feel it on my hands, but they don't feel greasy or oily, just soft.This hand cream is a keeper!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZPS140K7LR4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPO4T7U#wasThisHelpful","R1ZPS140K7LR4R","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first chose this book to read, I didn't realize that it is the second in a series, but it doesn't matter  it worked quite nicely as a standalone.  However, I am going to read the first one, Caught Dead, to get more background.A woman commits suicide.  Or is it murder?  Rick Van Lam is a PI, but he is also a dust boy, a mongrel, a maligned mixture of Vietnamese and Caucasian blood not much accepted by either race.This is not a gory mystery at all.  It skips the violence of so many mysteries.  The woman whose mystery Rick is hired to solve is not especially likable; even her niece who wants her death investigated is ambivalent about her.I liked that the characters were not all good, not all evil.  As mysteries go, I was more curious about the resolution of it than empathetic with the person who died.I loved the Vietnamese references  the culture, the mouth-watering descriptions of food, the rituals and attitudes, especially as practiced in the U.S.  The protagonist, Rick, is self-effacing with a sense of humor, mostly directed at himself.  I appreciated reading about his early life, abandoned at a Catholic orphanage when he was 5.The explanation of frozen men, those souls so damaged by what happened during the war that they are just waiting to die, tugged at my heartstrings.For me, the end was wrapped up a little too neatly, too much explanation came too easily, but I still enjoyed the story.This book has a nice combination of intrigue and heart, and doesn't rely on violence to tell its story.  It's a series I'm going to keep on my radar.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book for review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FZ8652JLMFOA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1464204284#wasThisHelpful","R3FZ8652JLMFOA","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Although I love reading Shakespeare, his works are not easy for me, and I spend a lot of time thinking, hmmmm, I wonder what that means.  And I keep my trusty guide to Shakespeare nearby.  When I learned that there is a modern retelling of The Winter's Tale, the first of a new series, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.The Winter's Tale is one of the plays I haven't read yet,  The Gap of Time starts with a synopsis of Shakespeare's story, and was quite helpful to me.  (I do have The Winter's Tale in my to-read stack now.)Except for the plot, this retelling is thoroughly modern.  There are cell phones and video games and iPads.  Everything normal.  The characters, with slightly modified names, and the plot are straight from Shakespeare.And I loved this book.  Absolutely loved it.  There was a violent, brutal, graphic bit that was hard for me to read, but S. himself certainly didn't shirk from violence and occasional raunchiness.  I started out reading this book.  I ended up savoring it.How can you not, with Interval writing like Perhaps it began when the moon splintered off from the earth, pale, lonely, watchful, present, unsocial, inspired.  Earth's autistic twin.Although I had heard of some of the author's other books, I had not read them.  Now I'm just going to have to, not because of the Shakespeare but because of her writing.Apparently, Hogarth is going to have a series of Shakespeare plays, retold by modern authors Margaret Atwood, Tracy Chevalier, Gillian Flynn, Howard Jacobson, Jo Nesbo, Edward St. Aubyn, Anne Tyler, and of course, this one my Jeanette Winterson.  If this first one is any indication of the quality, I'm going to have to get my hands on every single one of them.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book for review.

"I am more of a novel reader than a short story reader, but I loved the author's A Constellation of Vital Phenomena so much that I couldn't wait to read these stories.And to me, it read more like a novel than just a collection of short stories.  The stories are all interconnected, and loop back and forward through stories of characters I've come to love.Mr. Marra's writing is extraordinary.  Without being flowery, it is remarkably, beautifully descriptive.  The characters are both hopeful and resigned.I didn't mark passages as I was reading, so I flipped the book open at random to look for an example.  The first thing I read:Back in my room, I scanned my modest belongings.  Bottles filled with dusk light stood in the corner.  The long-rotting carcass of my academic career sprawled across the desk.  And then, There I was, Napoleon's height and I couldn't even conquer the apartment WC.  I slipped the two pickle jars into the duffle, the Polaroid into my pocket, and then slipped myself out the door.There is a painting that keeps reappearing, censors who fail to properly censor, and a mix tape to be used only in case of emergency.  Ballerinas and brothers.These stories are not a straightforward telling of a story, but tell a story they do, in a winding, meandering path, sprinkled with humor and soul, and all the more beautiful for the journey they take.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book for review.  The quotes may have changed in the published edition.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35X1O0ZD1DVC6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RKO3UOM#wasThisHelpful","R35X1O0ZD1DVC6","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was given this product for review.These kraft paper tags are heavyweights.  I was afraid they might be lighter than they look, but no, they are quite sturdy.  I was also afraid that some inks, especially felt tips like fine line Sharpies, but cause bleeding on the paper, but that has not happened.They are very cute for homey-type gifts, and on gifts of homemade foods, adding a nice down-to-earth touch, especially when used with the enclosed jute strings.  If you want to fancy them up just a bit,  try using a bit of thin velvet or satin ribbon for a touch of class.  It does have to be thin, because the holes are relatively small.  However, there is room to punch a bigger hole in the tags.While I have just written on mine, they would be fun with stickers, especially letting the kids decorate them, or with glitter pens.

"This novel, which has received quite a bit of attention, almost lives up to its hype.  Characters come and go, and you are never quite sure if any character might make an appearance later in the book.  Well, except for one little girl.  And the food is always a star player.The beginning was wonderful, with characters that immediately drew me into their story.  I got a bit bored when some teenage romance went on a little too long for my taste.  And I hated the deer hunting part, but I know that doesn't bother most people as much as it bothers me.Some of the characters morph into different people, at least superficially different, when we meet them again.  Most are kindhearted if not always wise.In the beginning, there is quite a bit about lutefisk:""...caught one, pounded it, dried it, soaked it in lye, resoaked it in cold water, and done the careful cooking required to make something that, when perfectly prepared, looked like jellied smog and smelled like boiled aquarium water.""And a character, being bulled, ""...reminded herself that all of these boys would be changing her oil someday.""""[....], in her brain, pushed [....] out of a window onto a stone courtyard, and watched as dogs ate her body.""To counteract that, ""After decades away from the Midwest, she'd forgotten that bewildering generosity was a common regional tic.""There are some fun recipes in here, most like dishes one would take to a Lutheran potluck.This is one of those novels that when I put it down after the last page, makes me sigh with contentment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PZAH6B605V3F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OZ0TO80#wasThisHelpful","R1PZAH6B605V3F","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For people like me who love stories about old books, old libraries, old tales, this novel is delightful.  The beginning, a tiny abandoned child, drew me in immediately.  His story is interspersed with a modern-day story about someone who was unexpectedly sent an old book that may have something to do with his family.There are mermaids who drown, carnivals and hustlers, tarot cards, people more than a bubble off normal, a touch of curse and supernatural, and too much water.  There is a lot of love and caring, and a little hate, some sadness. I cared about the characters, I cared about the slowly revealed story, and the writing is lovely.

"I've used Granite Gold daily cleaner and Granite Gold polish in the past, and have been reasonably happy with both of them.  However, lazy sod that I am, I didn't like having to go over my counters twice.  Well, actually three times because I'd first wipe them down with a wet cloth to get any crumbs and detritus off.This product combines the best of those two products in one easy step.  Well, two - I still wipe off any crumbs first.  This product is easy to apply and easy to buff.  Water drops bead up on the surface, as they should.  I use the polish as much to protect my stone as to polish it.My countertops are made of a slab of quartzite, a natural stone (different from the quartz countertops that are manufactured from ground quartz and resin), and I'm a little paranoid about damaging them.  They are not polished to as high a shine as some granite is, and I don't expect this polish to create a shine that is not there.  I do expect them to ""freshen up"" the shine, and to provide some protection.  This product does both.However, this two-in-one product does not provide quite the protection of a different brand of heavier polish I often use.  It is a thick liquid, and is applied with a cloth, and then buffed.  And buffed, and buffed.  It really works well, but it is also a harder, more time consuming job.  I am going to continue to use that heavier polish occasionally, but like this Granite Gold Clean and Shine for my more frequent cleaning and polishing.

"This is a story of a poor little rich girl, Rosemary Kennedy, the hidden Kennedy.  Being rich isn't going to solve all your problems, and could just contribute to making them worse.Starting with a horrific birth practice, Rosemary's life was never easy.  Especially in a family that honors competition and winning above all else.This is also a story of a girl, and then a woman, whose life should never have been as it was.  Even after her traumatic birth, it could have been so much better for her.  But we certainly don't want to be embarrassed by a child who is ""dull"" when her eight siblings shine.  My gosh, it was hard to live up to the Kennedy name.The story is straightforward in its telling.  Rosemary's story is anything but straightforward.  The poor child was bounced around so often that even a normal child without mental disabilities would have trouble coping.  And then there was the traumatic and ill-advised surgery, barbaric.Some of the children were very good with Rosemary, especially Eunice.  It seems Joe, Sr. threw money instead of love at the problem.  Rosemary adored her father, and would do anything to please him.  And Rose, Rosemary's mother, was not very honest about her daughter when she sent her to different schools, and was not honest in her memoirs.  When things got tough, it seems her first action of choice was to take a vacation.Some of the people who took care of Rosemary sound wonderful, and I'm glad Rosemary had those people in her life.This book caused me some anger, and much sadness.  I lost some respect for some people.  Fortunately, things have become better when working with people with mental disabilities, but we're far from winning a gold star.I was given an advance reader's copy of this book for review.

"I was given this product for review.I, personally, think these bully sticks are rather disgusting and stinky.  My dogs beg to differ.I have the 12"" thin sticks, thinking they would work for both my small and my larger dog, and they do.  I was hoping that I could break them in two, giving the larger dog the larger pieces, but these are not to be broken.  Or cut with kitchen scissors.  Or cut with a knife.  However, my hedge clippers work just fine on them.  These things, even the skinny ones, are tough!My dogs love them.  They last quite a long time, lots of chewing time in them.  The only other things I've given my dogs in the past that last so long are rawhide chews, and I no longer will give them those.  Treats are usually one-bite, 3-second things, and plastic-type chew toys are not as interesting or satisfying to them, and I can't blame them for that.They do come in a resealable bag, which helps with the odor, but I keep them in a utility closet, not in the pantry with other foods.  Not a necessity, just the way I prefer to do it.I've resisted buying bully sticks in the past (you do know what part of the animal they're from, don't you?), but now knowing how much my dogs like them, I will continue to get them for them despite my squeamishness.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1POT76IC7NKNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TK4NGY#wasThisHelpful","R1POT76IC7NKNP","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a fan of IZZE soda, so was excited about trying this flavored sparkling water.  And it is quite nice - lightly flavored, just a touch of sweetness, and great ingredients.  The only ingredients are carbonated water, cane sugar, natural flavors, and citric acid.  And a measly 10 calories per bottle, with no artificial sweeteners.  And it's organic.I like the mandarin/lime flavor best, and then the blackberry pear.  While I like the raspberry/watermelon flavor, I thought the raspberry overpowered the watermelon, and didn't like it as much as the other flavors.  I was wanting a stronger watermelon flavor.While I am not a big soda drinker, when I do drink soda, I like IZZE or the occasional old-fashioned root beer.  I am more of a water drinker, and I do like lightly flavored waters or fruit/veggie infused waters.  This brand satisfies my tastes but I'm afraid that it generally is too expensive to drink much of it, at least on my budget.  I don't mind paying more for a good soda, but one soda now and then, big taste and flavor for the money, does not have a budget implication that drinking these sparkling waters for hydration have.  While I will continues to drink IZZE soda now and then (and it's delicious), I think I'll stick to other ways to add flavored water to my water intake.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PSOZW12MBTA5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YSW3AQW#wasThisHelpful","R3PSOZW12MBTA5","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In war, as in this book, reality bumps head-on with perceptions, and a skewed reality.  There are some parts of this book that I really, really hope are the author's imagination, but I fear they are not.Part autobiographical, part fiction, real characters, whatever this book is, it is brutal and unsettling.  It is not an easy book to read unless the reader is a sadist who enjoys cruelty.Despite that, I am glad I read it.  First published in 1990, 25 years ago, it is still a valid look at a brutal war.  And a look at how that war changes soldiers, how it sometimes steals their souls and replaces it with cruelty.  Or perhaps, for some of those soldiers, the cruelty was already there, looking for a socially acceptable way of practicing it.The author can write, no doubt about that.  And there are many examples of the things these characters, these people carried, physical and emotional.""He carried a strobe light and the responsibility for the lives of his men.""""They carried all they could bear, and then some, including a silent awe for the terrible power of the things they carried.""""They carried the common secret of cowardice barely restrained, the instinct to run or freeze or hide, and in many respects this was the heaviest burden of all, for it could ever be put down, it required perfect balance and perfect posture.""The story about a flight towards Canada, dodging a draft for a war the author didn't believe in, was as touching as the stories of the fighting, the death, the despair in Vietnam.""I passed through towns with familiar names, through the pine forests and down to the prairie, and then to Vietnam, where I was a soldier, and then home again.  I survived, but it's not a happy ending.  I was a coward.  I went to war.""""In many ways he was like America itself, big and strong, full of good intentions, a roll of fat jiggling at his belly, slow of foot but always plodding along, always there when you needed him, a believer in the virtues of simplicity and directness and hard labor.""There are so many other quotable parts of this book, but you get the idea.

"I am a fan of essential oils, and I love lavender essential oils.  I've bought several bottles over the years, and this one is my favorite so far.The oil is organic and the flowers are from France.  The smell is lovely, more floral than the lavender oil I last used.  I find it very relaxing and comforting.  I use it mostly for aromatherapy in a little diffuser and for using when cleaning house.  A few drops sprinkled on my mop pad before I steam mop makes the whole house smell good.  My husband was told to use a bit of it for his allergies, just dabbed under his nose, and he says it seems to help, but I can't vouch for that.  He also used it before going to bed, and he said that he slept well, better than usual.  I could smell the oil, too, and it was so nice as I was falling asleep.A 15 ml bottle is quite small, about a U. S. tablespoon, but that is the nature of essential oils.  The current price point of this bottle seems very reasonable to me.  A little oil goes a long way.  And it can be combined with a less expensive carrier oil when you need a less concentrated oil.I have not used products from Sabai Wellness before, but if this little bottle of organic essential oil is typical of their products, they have a new customer.I was given this product for the purpose of review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQKIU06QX1MUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N78I6HQ#wasThisHelpful","RQKIU06QX1MUB","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It took several uses for me to decide what I really think of this product.  On my hair, it does offer minimal increase in shine, the main reason I wanted it, but not as much as I had hoped.  The upside of that is it doesn't make my hair feel dirty as do some products meant to add shine.  Perhaps I would have different results if my hair were color-treated, permed, or especially dry.It does offer some help in styling, although not as much as products meant specifically for styling.  I find I prefer other products when styling my freshly washed hair.I do like the way this gives some extra oomph to my already styled, dry hair.  If my hair has lost some of its style during the day and I want to freshen the look but don't have time to wash & style, this product works well.  It helps me pull my hair into little separated strands without using anything as heavy as a gel or wax - I want separation, not spikes.Also, it seems quite similar to a product my stylist uses, but is much more affordable.  And the scent is quite nice.While this isn't a favorite for my hair, I think the differences in makes would be more visible on hair drier or more damaged than mine.If you like this type of product, I'd suggest giving this one a try before spending much more at your stylist's shop.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHB73KTKJJ3O7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJRNW#wasThisHelpful","RHB73KTKJJ3O7","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a love/hate relationship with the Southern United States, so not surprisingly, I have a love/hate opinion of this book of short stories, mostly very short stories, most if not all previously published.  One of my very favorite is the author's introduction, a love song to the South.  Many of these stories, true stories with maybe just a touch of exaggeration here and there, are relaxing and casual and as comforting as an old pair of shoes.Having said that, there was too much repetition, too much sameness to too many of the stories.  If I had to read about cracklin's one more time, I would have wanted to do someone bodily harm.  (Figure of speech - I am not out to harm anyone, cracklin's or not.)Some of the stories were saccharin sweet, too sentimental for my tastes.  The stories were not usually serious, but there was one about the BP oil spill that was dead serious, and oh so sad.The author and his family are white, and the stories were about mostly white people - there is very little here about racial conflicts.  Well, except for one story that was about football.  Too much football for me.The ones that caused me the hate part of my opinion had to do with casual cruelty.  I hated some of the fishing stories, I hated that telling me about ripping the lips off a red snapper is supposed to be entertainment for me.  I didn't think that going into ""the defining element of great Southern literature,"" the dead mule, was entertaining.  And I hated the expression, ""enough money to burn a wet dog,"" even if it was just used as an expression.So, while some of these snippets of life in the South were wonderful, there were some that I would have preferred skipping.I was given an ebook copy of this book for review.

"Both of the adults in this household are fans of good mustard, and neither of us like this one.  It is too sweet without enough mustard kick to it.  The sweet/hot combination can be great, but only if it is done right.  The texture was a little strange too, like natural peanut butter that has been stirred but not refrigerated.Unfortunately, this bottle of mustard will probably make its way to the back of the refrigerator in ignominy, only to be eventually rediscovered and discarded.(I bought my bottle at the local grocery store.)","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS74T0O94IINR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000EY5TA8#wasThisHelpful","RS74T0O94IINR","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Despite not being especially naive or uninformed, it never ceases to amaze me how incredibly cruel, cowardly, and monstrous humans can be.  It also amazes me how brave and generous they can be.  This book showed both sides of that human-nature coin.The author writes of the time of the German invasion of France during WWII, and of the avenue of spies, a very affluent neighborhood in Paris where some of the worst of the worst that Germany had to offer took over the homes.  And the story of an amazingly brave American, Sumner Jackson, and his courageous wife, Toquette, and son, Phillip, who lived cheek by jowl with these same monsters, and who were unflinching part of the resistance.It is always appalling to see how easily France at that time just rolled over and showed their underbelly to the Germans invading their city, and how many of their political and governmental leaders collaborated with the enemy.  ""That night the lights did not go on in Paris. The unthinkable had happened.  The Nazis had taken over without a shot being fired.""  DeGaulle ""implored patriotic Frenchmen to join him in London and continue to fight the Germans.""  In London.  And yet on D-Day, when the Allies were saving France, ""From Vichy, Marshal Petain called for all patriotic Frenchmen to remain neutral.  French blood, he stressed, was too precious to be wasted in this fight.""  ""The French were to play no part in liberating themselves.""The bravery, cunning, and perseverance of the members of the resistance, both French and non-French, is in start contrast.  Phillip, as re reminisces, was a boy and then a man with never a chance to be an adolescent.Author Kershaw pulls no punches in describing the horrors of the time.  However, this is a relatively short book, not drawn out, and it packs a wallop in less than 250 pages of text, not counting notes and bibliography.<spoiler, if there can be a spoiler in historical nonfiction>  Phillip who went on to live a long life and continued to enjoy hunting, amassing big game ""trophies.""  It also amazes and saddens me that someone who has seen so much death and cruelty in his life can inflict the same on animals who want nothing but to be left alone to live their lives.I guess we never will learn.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QX86BEF935P9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PEPR6QW#wasThisHelpful","R3QX86BEF935P9","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want deodorant only, no antiperspirant, this is a decent solution.  Like all AXE products that have made their way to our household, this one has a strong scent, that familiar pine tree+ scent, but it is rather nice, and not so strong as to be overwhelming.  My husband has been using it for a few days, and I tried it too, just so I could get a firsthand feel for it.It's not an antiperspirant, so it is not going to protect against wetness, only odor, and it seems quite good at that.  The deodorant vs. antiperspirant/deodorant is a personal choice, and most people know which they prefer.  The stick is somewhat translucent, not as solid-feeling as those white sticks, and not as soft as a gel.  It glides on very easily, not draggy at all.It has a slight stickiness when it goes on, but not as sticky as some other deodorants. The stickiness takes a few minutes to go away, but it does go away.The reason this is not going to be a keeper in our house is that it makes my husband's underarms itch.  This is probably some sort of allergic reaction, but he is not generally an allergy-prone person and has never had a reaction to any other deodorant, so this is very unusual for him. He continued to use it to see if the first time was just a weird coincidence, but no - itching after every use.This seems a good product for those who like the scent (and you never know until you try it personally), who want only deodorant, and who don't have an adverse reaction to it (which is probably the vast majority of users).","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20VPHYLJGF747/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UBX99S0#wasThisHelpful","R20VPHYLJGF747","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both of my dogs like this weight management kibble, but then they like about anything.  What is especially nice is that I can give a little more of this to my chunky boy than if it were regular food, and he doesn't feel deprived because he has finished his breakfast/dinner while Perfect Weight Dog is still chowing down.  Those ""Why don't you love me - you gave him more"" puppy eyes are hard to take.I mix my dogs' kibble with home-cooked chicken and rice or canned food, and add water.  This kibble does have a lighter feel to it, and gets soggier faster than the non-weight management kibble.  However, if you have a dog with a weight problem, if he is anything like mine, the food doesn't stay in the bowl long enough for sogginess to be an issue, and it probably wouldn't bother the dogs anyway - just the humans feeding them.In my opinion, Nutro foods went downhill for awhile, but they have made improvements, and I trust them again.  The product description states, ""The very first ingredient in this nutritionally complete, low-calorie, natural diet dog food is U.S.-farm-raised Chicken,"" and that is reassuring.  This does have quite a bit of grain product in it, but I think that is what makes it more filling.This is quite a good product for the chunky dog in your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R0CSVH3S4UDC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQRL9T4#wasThisHelpful","R2R0CSVH3S4UDC","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's interesting that some users think this provides heavier coverage while others think it is too light.  It's all in the eye of the beholder.  I think it provides moderate coverage, a bit heavier than the foundation I was using before I tried this.  I think the coverage is perfectly adequate for anyone who likes that moderate amount of coverage.For me, the finish was too matte.  It seemed to emphasize little wrinkles and flaws rather than disguising them.  For me, this one by the same manufacturer works better: Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Radiant Firming Makeup, Creamy Natural 200, 1 Fluid Ounce.  While I don't like a foundation to look oily or too shiny, too much matte effect is not flattering.As far as the Superstay claim, this foundation really does last.  It doesn't melt off and disappear as foundations tend to do in the Arizona heat.  When I put it on in the morning, there is still plenty to wash off at bedtime.Although I usually use a moisutrizer under my foundation, I first tried this on freshly washed skin just to see how it works.  It felt a little ""draggy"" to me, and didn't go on as smoothly as I would have liked.  After than, I tried it several times with my normal moisturizer, and it went on just fine, and had more even coverage.This particular color (Natural BEige) is about one shade too dark for my skin tone, and a bit too orangey for me, but of course, that all depends on the tone of your skin and whether you know what color works best for you in  this line.While I will use this product when my skin is a little tanner than normal, I won't get it again despite now knowing what color to get.  It's just not right for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HTWMN3PRC2NQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YJJXJ06#wasThisHelpful","R2HTWMN3PRC2NQ","A1OPZ3BUTEL47R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OPZ3BUTEL47R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The two adults in this house have both tried this product, and neither of us especially like it.  We both used it on moderately dirty hair, the day after shampooing for one of us, two days for the other.  Neither of us noticed a cleansing effect.  I thought it actually made my medium-length hair look dirtier.  It didn't seem to do much of anything for my husband's short hair.It did provide a little volume and lift to my hair, but there are products specifically for that that can do a better job.The scent is masculine and could be pleasant, but much too strong, and it lingers for quite awhile.

"I don't like to know too much about a book before I read it, but knowing that this was about some secret, strange library or book sounded like it would be right up my alley.My first clue that this might not be quite what I expected came with the table of contents, and the chapter names.  Some funny, some irreverent, some just odd.  For example, Chapter 2 is called ""Buddhism for [Donkey Butts - different word to prevent robo-censorship].  I wasn't offended but some might be.It started out creepy and just got creepier.Although this is not, thank goodness, another zombie book, there are dead ones who are still functioning, at some level anyway.  There are gods, gods in disguise, and battles for supremacy.  All of that could have been quite interesting.I couldn't empathize much with the characters except for perhaps badluck Steve, and Erwin, and I liked them quite a bit.  The characters under control of Father...not so much although I did like Michael.And, of course, the lions; I liked the lions.The students had lessons to learn, each with a specialty, and dire consequences if they tried to find out about someone else's specialty.What I didn't like about this book was the high level of violence and cruelty.  Towards people, towards children who were still children despite their age in years, towards animals.  And torture, too.  Nope, not my cup of tea.  I like creepy; I don't like explicit violence and unrelenting cruelty.Despite that, and trying to overlook that, the story was somewhat interesting but too drawn out for the story it was telling.

"Note:  This review is for the shampoo/conditioner dual package.I've used shampoos before that don't strip my hair of all oils but also don't leave it feeling as clean as I would like.  While the not stripping part is important, so is the having clean hair part.  So, I was somewhat skeptical when this shampoo didn't leave my hair ""squeaky clean"" fresh out of the shower.Those concerns disappeared after my hair was dried. My hair, fine-textured anyway, is quite soft and shinier than it has been using other shampoos.  Very shiny.  I love that.I use both the shampoo and the conditioner.  It doesn't take much of either to get the job done, so these bottles last a long time.  The products both smell wonderful - kind of minty plus other scents, very pleasing but not overpowering.  There is good lather, even with my very hard tap water, and the products rinse out well.  I assume some of the helpful oils are left behind, which helps make my hair so shiny and soft, but it did not feel at all oily or greasy.  It's still clean and shiny on the second day, and I could go a third day but I don't like washing my hair that infrequently.This is the nicest shampoo and conditioner I've used for quite some time, and it's the one I'm going to stick with.

"I often drink fruit smoothies for breakfast, and this hemp powder is a great way to add some extra protein and fiber.  I don't use whey protein powders, and I get enough soy in my diet without adding that protein powder either, so this hemp powder is a nice alternative.It actually tastes good.  I've even tasted it straight out of the bag, and although that is not the way anyone would choose to routinely eat it, the taste is pleasant.  It does add a nutty taste to my smoothies, almost almond-y.The powder is very fine, and it blends well.  I prefer to use only a half serving in my relatively small smoothie, but I think a full serving would work for those who use a full 8 oz. liquid, plus whatever else they choose to add.The only drawback for me is that there is a slight powdery feel to the powder when it is in smoothies, not quite gritty, but still a texture against the tongue.

But that comes at the cost of a slightly sticky feel.The similar product gives good style while still leaving my hair feeling very soft.They are both very good products, from a company that provides good value, and I would recommend either.

"We are into the downsizing part of our lives now, but still sometimes need to staple a LOT of sheets together. Previously, we've used a Acco 131 heavy duty stapler for big jobs, but it's a foot long, 2 inches wide, and 7 inches high, so my wife hates the space it takes in our office.This stapler, by contrast, is almost exactly the same size as our much-loved Boston Model 55 staplers, and works as easily, just with a 5/16"" deep staple rather than the usual 1/4"" ones.If necessary, this stapler could entirely replace all of our other staplers. It works fine for stapling up to 50 sheets, and also works for stapling together only 2 sheets, although in that instance the ends of the staple overlap, so we'll likely continue using our Boston Model 55s for stapling only a couple of sheets together.The Rapid S50 ""SuperFlatClinch"" staples supplied for review are very well made, and work easily and reliably. They are required for the 5 year warranty on the stapler, so do plan on ordering some with the stapler.Definitely recommended for any use where high capacity is needed and storage space is limited.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V1ARYZOCWU1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VBZVMKK#wasThisHelpful","R3V1ARYZOCWU1V","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having once broken a Kindle by dropping it, I was eager to try out this protective case for my Kindle Voyage. On arrival, the initial challenge was figuring out how to install my Voyage in it. Unhelpfully, the instructions are packaged INSIDE the sealed case, meaning you have to first figure out how to open the case without ruining it BEFORE you can read the instructions on how to open and close the case. Here's the key bit: there's a wide spot in the upper right corner of the case, By twisting a dime there, you can start opening the case, and then work your fingernails around the rest of the edge. The second problem is that the instructions say to clean the case and Kindle with the included microfiber cloth before putting the Voyage into the case, but no microfiber cloth was included. Oh well, didn't seem to be a problem getting the Voyage into the case without doing that, and everything still works, so perhaps that doesn't matter.The next thing I noticed is that the front screen cover still works as a touch screen, but is too flexible to have prevented that other way I killed a Kindle once - by unknowingly leaning an elbow on its screen under a piece of paper. I'm not sure that problem can be solved and still have a touchscreen, so let's all just be careful with our elbows near Kindles.Finally, the case doubles the weight of the Voyage. It's nice that I can now read in a hot tub, should I ever wish to do so, but I'm undecided thus far on whether I'm really willing to hold twice the weight every time I read, just to avoid replacing a broken Kindle. It occurs to me that a 3 year warranty against such disasters costs the same as this case, but adds nothing to the weight of the Voyage, and covers breakage by errant elbows.For now, I'm leaving the case installed. If I decide to remove it later, I'll update this review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3X3L9FOIFXHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU7CN0U#wasThisHelpful","R3X3L9FOIFXHF","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife recently requested a clock for our yard, so on arrival I mounted this in the shade of our patio fence, and we are both very pleased at the result. This very affordable clock is extremely legible, includes a red sweep second hand for added precision and for timing events shorter than a minute. We can easily read it from any room facing the patio, and from anywhere in our back yard. Is the clock waterproof? Who knows? The box says there's a manual inside, but I couldn't find one. It rains here only very rarely, and never snows, so we're giving it a try. Apart from the specs, I can't see why a manual would be needed. There's the usual thumb wheel to adjust the current time on the back of the motor mechanism, and a place to insert a AA battery. That done, it just works.Update: Dropping to 4 stars because the clock occasionally loses track of time, perhaps once a week. Fixing it is a simple matter of using my thumb to spin the hands back to the current time, but it's now happened several times, and would be a problem if the clock is either inaccessible, or must be relied upon for accuracy.The clear plastic dial cover will provide a lot of protection, but I still expect to have to occasionally vacuum out dust, spiderwebs etc., which won't be a probem. Everything seems sturdy and accessible.As for accuracy, the label on the back goes out of its way not to promise any (no jewels, and no adjustability beyond current time), but it's a quartz movement, so should be fine for our needs.The warranty is only for 6 months, and requires a $6 fee and proof of purchase, so if you have any problems, I'd suggest returning it to Amazon within the 30 days allowed instead.In short, a well designed very affordable clock that is working very well for us.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FQWJFFXE7W2Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSYXGWG#wasThisHelpful","R3FQWJFFXE7W2Q","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my third set of FRS/GMRS 2-way radios in 2 years, not because the others have failed, but rather because they have been so useful at an orphanage where we volunteer that we donated both other sets for use by staff. As radios, all were ""35 mile"" versions, which means they really work up to a mile away in an urban area, and all three had about the same range. The differences I've noticed are mostly in how they feel in the hand, how well they hook to a belt, and how many buttons have to be pushed to get anything done - with having to pull out the manual yet again an all too common problem with my two earlier radios. Of the three models, these new radios are my favorite.This pair of radios feels good in the hand, has a much improved belt clip that: 1) works, 2) does not get in the way when using the radio hand-held, and can be removed easily if unwanted. That means I actually use the belt clip, unlike on either of the two previous radios. Battery life is improved: 12 hours, rather than 8 on the similar Motorolas I bought 2 years ago, and water resistance is now up to IP-54 from IP-51 (but still don't dunk it in a bucket.) The built-in LED flashlight has its own button and works well.Another improvement is that I can activate everything I care about without having to dive into menues. That was the kiss of death with the radios I bought last year. They had a handy ""dualwatch"" feature to monitor 2 channels of interest, but made it almost impossible to activate, and turned the feature off every time I turned the radio off and on again. My favorite improvement on this radio is that getting into and out of NOAA weather mode takes only one keypress of the Mode button.The other big improvement is debatable: USB micro plug charging. Both my earlier pairs of radios came with a charging base that worked fine. Even so, I prefer the USB micro plug charging, as it eliminates my having to carry an extra charger for them. I already have a Photive 50 watt 6 port USB charger with lots of short charging cables ending in USB micro plugs. That lets me charge both of these, 2 cell phones, an iPad, and whatever else we have along, all from a single device. I can also leave the two tiny chargers that came with these radios in other locations where they might be needed, and also use them to recharge almost all my other small electronics (by adding a Cozy brand USB Micro to Lightning adapter as needed.)The one feature these still lack, that the professional radios at the orphanage have, is the ability to quickly and easily switch between a primary and a secondary channel. The orphanage uses one channel for calling and brief messages, and then switches to the secondary channel for extended conversations. None of the radios I've owned can do that well, but this pair comes closest. To change channels from 16 to 18, just press the menu key, then press the up key twice, then hit the menu key 9 times. It's still a lot of key presses, but takes only a few seconds and no need to find the manual. Even so, if anyone ever offers an FRS/GMRS radio with the easy one button switching between 2 channels of the pro radios, I'll happily upgrade again.Note: these radios also have all the other usual ""nice to have"" features, such as squelch codes, call tones, hands-free use, scanning, keyboard lock, vibrating alerts, Qt noise filtering, ""Roger"" tone, emergency alert, and a battery saver mode.Overall, well improved over prior radios, and not just for hunters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IW32U7TM78M7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W75BL1S#wasThisHelpful","R2IW32U7TM78M7","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I recently bought a new brake noodle, to replace one that was rusted, and then discovered I'd also need a new brake cable and housing. Amazon to the rescue with this convenient cable and housing kit. I particularly like that it covers all the bases - including two cables, one for a front brake and the other for a rear brake, and both included cables have both road and mountain bike tips. All other needed trim parts are also included.The only hard part of using this is making a clean cut of the unwanted tip on the brake cable, and to shorten the housing. Bike shops have special cutters for this, but I had no trouble using Craftsman cut-off pliers, just making sure to rotate them around the cable and housing a bit as I cut. Bike shops also have a special pin tool for opening up the housing after cutting, but I was easily able to do the same by opening up a large wire paper clip. One more special tool can be used for crimping on the cable tip cover, but again I was able to make do with a good pair of needle-nose pliers for that, just making sure to clamp down in two different parts of the tip to lock it in place.Overall, I can't imagine how this could have been any better for my purposes, and I am a delighted customer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N2BX1FRVW6UO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0050LUBZ8#wasThisHelpful","R3N2BX1FRVW6UO","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a seriously big griddle: 29.5 inches wide (including the control), 11 inches from front to back, and 4 inches high. Its ceramic cooking surface is 24 inches wide and 11 inches front to back. On the bright side, all this space makes it easy to cook a full meal on it at once. For supper tonight, I cooked 4 Jumbo eggs in the flat middle portion, and 5 strips of bacon on each of the two tilted and ridged side portions. That turned out very well, for the most part. The eggs were possibly the best I've ever cooked. No issues at all with sticking when it came time to flip them. As for the bacon, that too turned out very well,with two caveats: 1) the strips of bacon tended to slip down the tilted portion of the grill toward the drain channel on each side, and 2) there's less heat at the side edge of the griddle, making it necessary to move the bacon slices nearest the sides into the middle of the griddle to finish grilling them.Cleaning the new ceramic surface was a breeze, except that there's no way to immerse it. Fortunately, the two grease catchers can be removed and cleaned in a dishwasher.I can definitely see using this as an extra cooktop at a big event. And thanks to the variable power setting, I expect another use will be for keeping things warm at such events.Overall, I like this griddle, but would like it even better if its ceramic surface were removable for cleaning in a dishwasher as in our favorite Foreman grill, and if it somehow folded for storage when not in use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FZ3SFDQ6GXXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIZL38#wasThisHelpful","R1FZ3SFDQ6GXXY","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There was no outdoor grill in our new home, so we bought a George Foreman CF0240TGM electric on sale locally in March. Had this grill then been available for its current price here, we'd likely have bought this one instead.The key advantage of this model is its ceramic (claimed to be 5 times as durable) grill surface, rather than the Teflon of our other grill. The overall shape is also an advantage. This grill (at 23"" x 11"" x 12""H) sits far more comfortably on a kitchen counter, in a double sink, or on a small patio than our other grill (21.5"" x 18"" x 16""H.) Officially, its' cooking surface is only 201 square inches, rather than the 240 of our other grill, but that works out to holding the same number (6) of Costco 1/3rd pound burgers on either. This grill is also a bit more powerful, pulling 1800 watts rather than1600, and the red cover is definitely more attractive than the gunmetal gray of our other grill lid.Disadvantages of this new grill include: 1) it lacks the other grill's adjustable top vent; 2) it lacks the other grill's temperature gauge (though the power dial on both also serves as a thermostat); 3) its grill plates cannot be detached for cleaning; and 4) although it is possible to jam the lid into the rear of the handles as a way of storing it when open, that doesn't work nearly as well as the hanging hook on the inside top of the other grill's lid.Both grills sit on an almost-identical outdoor base, and both have done an excellent job of grilling steaks for us.Overall, I prefer this grill over our other indoor/outdoor Foreman grill, but wish this one had the vent, temperature gauge, and removable grill plate of our other grill.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YDI7K86DCKC4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUUYI#wasThisHelpful","R2YDI7K86DCKC4","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Much as we love our 4 year old George Foreman GRP4 Next Grilleration 5-Burger Grill with Removable Plates, White, it's sometimes a bit too small for us: holding only 2 of our Costco 1/3rd pound frozen burgers, and no way to cram on a third for a guest. For that reason, I very much looked forward to reviewing this newer and slightly bigger model. Though the specs don't say so, the cooking surface on this model is up from the 72 square inches (12"" x 6"") of our old grill to about 104 square inches (13"" x 8"".) That's enough to easily hold a third big burger.The other key new feature is that its non-stick removable and dishwasher-safe plates are now 5 times more durable than on prior models. That hasn't been a problem with our current grill, but is the reason we had to buy that one after only a couple years use of its predecessor, so we've been babying it.Other new features include a variable temperature control, 1500 watt output instead of the 1,000 watts we had on the old model, a 3 year limited warranty (2 years on our previous grill), and the removable grill plates on the new model are noticeably lighter in both weight and color than on the old model. There's a handy way to wrap up the power cord under the unit, though the supplied cord is so short I can't see that ever being necessary.Both models do a great job of accommodating either thin or thick items to be grilled (though not both at once.) The limit is supposed to be one inch thck, but the new one did well with 1.5"" steaks tonight. (I will give it at least a minute longer next time than the 4-5 minutes for medium after preheating suggested by the manual.)The one possible negative is that on the old model the heating wires were embedded, whereas on the new model they are visible right under the grill plates, where it might be a bit of an issue to clean them if that ever proves necessary.Overall, this new model has now replaced our previous favorite. The new features definitely seem worth the slightly-higher price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9VGRHQZWFYLZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TQIUWVE#wasThisHelpful","R9VGRHQZWFYLZ","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Our big user for this so far is our grandsons' mom, who doesn't like bugs loose in her house, but also doesn't like to harm them.Making this look just like a 6 shooters (except brigthly colored to avoid neighbors or police mistaking it for one) definitely ups the play value for kids, plus actually works to ease aiming its vacuum at a bug to be investigated.The critter barn is also well thought out, offering a safe way to store living creatures briefly for study without harming them.One might wish for a stronger vacuum action. We (and our grandsons) also use a much more costly 18 volt Makita vacuum to remove bugs found inside our house. But this unit's gentle action is kinder to its victims, and just as fun for the kids, aged 7 and 3. It's also VASTLY kinder to them than the salt-powered bug shotgun I was given for Christmas last year that the kids were eager to use until this arrived.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JV2503T9GGFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UUS460C#wasThisHelpful","R2JV2503T9GGFH","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My Spanish is getting good enough to carry on a short conversation and communicate needed information. I even found myself dreaming in Spanish several nights last week while volunteering in Baja California. However, it still isn't good enough to catch most of the jokes I hear in Spanish language church services. To fix that, I decided to buy this book.And therein lies its only fault - very few of these jokes could be told in church. The author seems to go out of his way to be sure we learn all the colloquial terms used for swearing and body parts rarely mentioned in church. (My favorite definition of a good preacher is that they are able to talk about sex in church without using any bad words or offending anyone.)That said, I expect the author expected these jokes to be told in more bars than churches, and I really liked the way he not only told each joke in both languages, but also included extra notes as necessary to be sure puns and other difficult concepts are communicated clearly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZF3GUR1WVJXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M335912#wasThisHelpful","RZF3GUR1WVJXC","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This new Blu-Ray player is amazingly improved over our 2010 model Samsung 1080p player. About half the overall size, much faster to control (no long waits for menu choices to be processed), and many more built-in apps for accessing premium on-line content.Playing regular DVD or Blu-Ray discs through this works fine, and all look great on our 1080p TV. What turned out to be the killer app for us is that this player supports Amazon Prime Video. That's very timely, as we just this month lost the ability to play Amazon movies through our Tivo HD, and never could through our other Blu-Ray player.I also appreciate the ability to connect this player to the Internet via either wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Both work fine for us.I expected to keep the Samsung player for use with our Samsung LED TV, because they communicate automatically for such tasks as starting the TV when we insert a DVD, but I was wrong. My wife strongly prefers this player, so the Samsung has now been retired.Thanks to Amazon Prime through this player and our new Amazon Basics TV antenna, our cable TV service can also be retired, saving us $25 a month.Our unit arrived fully updated, and has not had any problems with skips or locking up as noted by some earlier reviews.All in all, we are extremely pleased with this player.

For instance, sitting in the front row of a Kindergarten graduation, I was still able to fit ALL of the kindergarteners into my photos of them. Similarly, when I needed to take a photo of a building that is behind an ugly chain link fence, I was able to stand just inside the fence and still see the entire building with this lens.Surprisingly, it was also handy to be able to zoom this lens in for subjects that did not need quite so much of a wide angle.The resulting photos from this lens also turned out extremely well.

I did manage to get a small blister with it yesterday, after an hour of use, but reflected afterwards that I would never have used any other garden hoe for an hour just for fun.My one wish is that it had a way to telescope down for storage, as it's shorter than many garden hoes, but still too long to fit in the storage box in my garden plot like my shovel and pitchfork.

"I already had two Howard Leight range earmuffs, one plain (Howard Leight Leightning L0F Super Slimline Earmuff, Black) and one electronic (Howard Leight Impact Sport OD Electric Earmuff, Green), both well rated and top sellers here. Both have served me well and store very compactly (which matters a lot to me), but are both hard to open and adjust for wearing. That's the key thing I like better about this pair of 3M Peltor earmuffs - though it stores just as compactly, it opens and adjusts much more quickly and easily. I also like that the foam in its earcups is softer, making it more comfortable to wear for hours with glasses.The three earmuffs are almost the same size when folded, except that the 3M Peltor is a half inch shorter top to bottom. (See photo of the three together.) The 3M Peltor is also an ounce lighter than the Howard Leight electronic earmuffs, and almost three ounces heavier than the Howard Leight plain earmuffs.The 3M Peltor is MUCH easier to change batteries on, than the Howard Leight, and works fine with 2 AAA Eneloop rechargeables.As for noise reduction, the Howard Leight plain earmuffs win with NRR 23, followed by the Howard Leight electronics at NRR 22, followed by the 3M Peltor at NRR 21. Interestingly, the electronics appear to work by amplifying ambient noise such as voices, muting during loud noises, rather than actively noise-cancelling all outside noises like our Bose earbuds. That's good for safety, ensuring you hear the range officer, for example.Both the Howard Leight electronic and the 3M Peltor electronic have a 3.5mm audio plug for music, and both shut off automatically after four hours of non-use.Personally, I consider the added ease of adjustment and added comfort on my head well worth the $5 extra the 3m Peltor currently costs compared to the Howard Leight electronic earmuffs. But if cost is very important, the plain Howard Leight earmuffs remain a bargain.I haven't been to the range with the 3M Peltors yet, so will update this review once I have. Meanwhile, they are now my favorite earmuffs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35L4NZQNT4TBC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R35L4NZQNT4TBC","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We've had a big ugly adjustable-height aluminum cane in our car for years, just in case my wife needs it. I've recently been hiking more, and had been thinking of getting a walking stick to do so. Turns out this cane is a solution for both of us. At 36"", it fits easily in the trunk of our car, and is the right height for both of us. (If it were too big, we could remove the rubber foot and use our hacksaw to shorten it.) I like that its sturdy wide aluminum head unscrews to allow storing something inside, such as some spare cash in a tough neighborhood. I also like that it is made of sturdy steel, in case I ever have to use it to fend off an angry critter.From what little reading I've done about using a cane for self-defense, one with a shepherd's hook on top, such as the  Ka-Bar Aluminum Cane, Black one might be more effective, and wood or aluminum wouldn't set off a metal detector as this will. But the Kabar at 39"" is enough larger I'd have to cut it down both to fit me and to fit in our car trunk.

"Let's start with the important vote - that of my eager reader 7 year old grandson. He looked at this Bible briefly the day it arrived, and never again since, even though he reads The Action Bible every single day, and also occasionally enjoys the Adventure Bible for Early Readers, NIrV.To me, this is because the other two Bibles are entirely designed for kids his age, whereas the Kids part of the Deep Blue Kids Bible is just an overlay on a regular adult Bible. Further, on reading how the underlying Common English Bible was developed, it seems clear gender neutrality and cultural diversity were higher goals than readability. For instance, the introduction mentions a lot of effort went into ensuring the phrase ""Son of Man"" is replaced by ""human one"", e.g. ""The Human One is Lord of the Sabbath."" Mt 12:8. I cannot imagine a 7 year old caring. Similarly, the cover shows, and added text focuses on three kids, none of whom are a Caucasian male, and that's fine, as Jesus wasn't either. But is race and gender really the most important thing to get right about the Bible, especially in a version intended for kids who aren't old enough to care much about either yet? It certainly isn't important to my grandson yet, even though his own heritage is cross-cultural.The beauty of the NIrV over the CEB is that the Bible text itself is specifically simplified for young readers, replacing 3 and 4 syllable words with 1 and 2 syllable words. That carries over well to the added features, all of which are easy for kids to read and understand.For daily reading, both my 7 year old grandson and I both much prefer The Action Bible in English, and la Biblia en accin, The Action Bible (Spanish Edition) in Spanish.The one weakness of the Action Bible is that it is organized by stories, rather than by book, chapter and verse. That makes the Adventure Bible for Early Readers, NIrV more useful in church services and classes, and for studying specific passages.Sadly, I'm not coming up with anyone I'd recommend read this Deep Blue kids Bible over either of the other two kid Bibles we have, unless they are in churches using the CEB for worship and adult study.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PUYEQBAQIDA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609260813#wasThisHelpful","R3PUYEQBAQIDA7","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In many ways, this is a book about leadership, in various forms, and what it takes to form an effective team. It's also a mystery, trying to figure out and understand who each of the characters is, why they are as they are, and what's going on. The author specifically requests no spoilers, so there's not much more I can say, except that even if you don't like mysteries, and don't like books about leadership development, you may still very much enjoy this book. Also, if you like to understand everything that has been going on by the end of a book, you also will in this one. Another thing I liked was that everyone involved had well-intentioned reasons for being as they were and doing as they did, and growth and development definitely occurred in several characters.Although it's been compared to The Hunger Games, it doesn't seem that similar to me, except that both feature a strong female protagonist who grows through her experiences. It has also been compared to The Lord of the Flies, but to me only in the sense of a group of teens having to figure out strange surroundings.Alive should be fine for teen or adult audiences. It does some mocking of religion, in case that bothers anyone.Personally, the start of the story didn't seem like my kind of book, but it became more so as it went along, and I was happy at the end to have read it. From the title, it appears to be the start of a trilogy, but also stands well alone.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKUB6CFKNMKMY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553393103#wasThisHelpful","RKUB6CFKNMKMY","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm very interested in this book's idea of how future soldiers might control a remote robotic body, much as current pilots already remote control drone aircraft. The biggest problem is the time lag in passing control signals from the human soldier to the robot being controlled up to halfway around the world. The solution is to map the soldier's brain onto an equivalently-complex computer, allowing it to essentially become the soldier, able to act and react in real time. For the purposes of this story, the human brain doesn't work while the robotic copy is in use, though with my computer science background I find it difficult to believe any such system would lack backups or damage originals. So consider that the one necessary willing suspension of disbelief to make this story work. All the rest seems very feasible and logical within the claimed time if technology continues to advance as we expect.The author sees a hard future world: one in which the U.S. is still the world's policeman. How this is to happen when no one is paying us to do so is unexplored, and also troubling to me as an Economics major back in college. Apparently we're doing it just out of our own sense of national interest, though somehow that includes bringing forced peace to every hellhole on Earth, regardless of whether any American interest is involved. Naturally, that makes opposing us the one thing everyone else on Earth agrees about, and given enough time, our opponents develop a plan to defeat us despite our robots, at the cost of also destroying all other developed technologies worldwide.Once we get past all the angst of a president from Massachusetts having to talk himself into acting as world hegemon, for the good of all, even though he doesn't think America is worthy of such a role, the story develops in more interesting ways, such as an unlikely friendship developing between the American and Russian Presidents as they fight their way out of a G20 meeting in which all the attending world leaders are targeted for destruction.The story takes place in multiple venues, each with its own subplot, eventually coming together via an epic journey. Characters grow and develop along the way, leading to at least a somewhat-happy ending, though along the lines of discovering only part of your family died in the fire along with losing pretty much everything you ever had.Overall, a good read, though I'd love to see what Robert A. Heinlein might have done with the same premise.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R4366ALYTJOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=034554885X#wasThisHelpful","R2R4366ALYTJOT","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was initially intrigued by the title ""Virtues of War"", as war is not often described as having virtues. Perhaps its use here is a reference to the 2004 book of the same name about the rise of Alexander the Great The Virtues of War (which I've not read yet.). Wikepedia comments about that book as follows: ""Throughout the novel, Alexander is portrayed as a benevolent king who only ever wanted to be a soldier, attain military glory, and treat his enemies with honor in the hopes of eventually making them his friends."" Having now read the Astral Saga book of the same name, it occurs to me that the story of Lt. Katja Emmes and of Sublt. Jack Mallory could be summed up in much the same way, except that neither of them is yet in charge of all that much by the end of this volume, which is apparently the first volume in a trilogy to be published over the next two years.I particularly liked the characters of both Katja and Jack, and that their relationships are professional and friendly, rather than romantic. Two other main characters are obviously out for whatever they can get, no matter who else gets hurt. One of them was humbled by the end of the volume, and here's hoping the other will be in a future volume as both their stories also continue.The book does a good job of explaining how a major war can erupt from what at first seems a minor incident, and realistically shows the characters growing in their roles and experience. I particularly liked that Jack was able to think outside the box and come up with new solutions, plus get those considered by highers up. I also like that Jack is living with scars and disappointments, but not defeated by them. Similarly, Katja starts out small in stature, with ""famous daddy"" issues, but her efforts grow in importance over time, both getting her in trouble, and helping the mission. By the end of this volume, Katja has proven her apple hasn't fallen far from the tree, and perhaps she'll hear praise from her dad in a future volume.For those who like hard science, the book makes a strong effort to realistically describe the science behind its faster-than-light travel and how that affects related topics such as stealth ships.The culture of the opposition is well-described, and given its own virtues, such as environmentally sustainable development and heavy use of robotics. It is realistically allowed to win battles, setting up a multi-book story between a future Earth and some of its colonies.As usual in real wars, sometimes civilians don't fare well, and characters make hard decisions. I'm not sure I could have made some of them, but can't fault their logic in doing so, especially the resulting unpleasant consequences for them personally.I'm not happy to have to wait another full year to see how the story continues, but expect I'll be eager to continue reading when it does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVIKY8U957WN8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1783294205#wasThisHelpful","RVIKY8U957WN8","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are a really great step forward in reading glasses. I love that I can just leave them on all the time and see well enough at any distance.However, two things would make them much better, in my opinion:1 either having no correction at all in the top of the lens, or being able to peer over the lens to see at distance. For that reason, I prefer Clearview Single Vision Half Frame Reading Glasses, Antique Gold, +2.75 another pair of readers that arrived today even more, as I can peer over them to see at distance, even though they are not multifocus as these are2 these fit a bit too tightly to my head, unlike the Alumineyes series 2.75 Strength Foster Grant Tech Aluminum Rimless Lightweight Reading Glasses with Spring Hinges also offered by Foster Grant. It would be great to have this lens in the Alumineyes frame (and better yet if I could peer over them to see at distance, as I can with the Clearviews.)One other great option is a pair of Tifosi Tyrant 2 sunglasses with Night Light photochromic lenses, Tifosi Tyrant 2.0 1120306430 Dual Lens Sunglasses with Hydrotac Stick-on Bifocal Lenses (OPTX 20/20)- +2.50 Diopter added to make them into bifocals.

"Although the item sent to me was packed in an envelope labeled as the S35 model, the actual contents of the envelope were the S25 model. The only difference I see from their descriptions is that the S35 model swivels, whereas the S25 model retracts. For me, having the drive retract is preferable, as it takes a bit less space that way - allowing it to fit into a USB port that is right next to another already-occupied USB port on my desk PC. Even so, small as it is, this S25 drive still takes four times the space of my previous flash drive, a 16GB Sandisk only slightly longer than its USB 2.0 port. Trying to keep track of that one convinced me there IS such a thing as TOO small, so it now has a tether tied to it. The S25 comes with the same tether, useful for hooking onto a keyring.The other key difference between this new S25 and the earlier Sandisk is the 4x faster USB 3.0 speed, which happily remains compatible with USB 2.0 devices (at slower USB 2.0 speeds, of course.) The S25 feels a bit flimsy and flexible, which is only reasonable, as it is mostly made of plastic on all visible exterior surfaces. It is holding up well, however, and won't conduct any unwanted electricity, so I'm not faulting it for that.Finally, the S25 is very well priced - about half what I'd expected. In sum, unless you prefer your USB 3.0 drive to swivel, I'd go with this S25 rather than the S35.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PQBO1HWLCQ3M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S5V62VW#wasThisHelpful","R2PQBO1HWLCQ3M","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good news is that this magnifier is made of plastic sturdy enough to work well as a Fresnel lens, unlike others I've tried that are softer and more flexible. The 6x dot is also a plus for closeup tasks like digging out a splinter. As others have noted, this plastic is brittle enough to break when bent, so don't plan on keeping them loose in a pocket.The included plastic covers are welcome for keeping the lenses clean, but too thin to pad it much and may not last long in active use. So for me, these are kept in my bike bag and in my car, for emergency use in reading after cataract surgery, and (if need be) to start a fire on a sunny day if there's ever a need to do so and no better way handy.

"We live in a NIMBY (not in my back yard) town, where everyone wants a good cellular signal, but no one wants a cell tower nearby. As a result, NONE of the 4 major carriers has a good signal here: maybe 2 bars tops outdoors, and 0 to 1 bar indoors. It's bad enough that we just bought an iPhone 6 Plus for my wife just so she could use T-Mobile's new 2-way WiFi calling feature supported on that model. (That did, by the way, work to give her an adequate signal wherever there is WiFi, which is most places we spend much time here.Therefore, it was with great hopes that I ordered this cell phone booster kit. On arrival, I was astounded at how easy its installation was - literally ""plug and play"", five minutes tops. Place the outside magnetic antenna in the middle of the car roof, at least six inches away from the sunroof, pass its cable through the door opening (under the foam weatherseal would lessen wear on the cable, but isn't necessary.) Then stick the Velcro-attached flat inside antenna to the central side of the driver's seat, 18-36 inches from the devices to be boosted. (Avoid installing on the seat's outer side that contains an air bag.) Finger tighten the two cables to the main unit: the roof cable to the side labeled Outside, and the inside cable to the side labeled Inside. Finally, plug the 6v 2amp DC power adapter into the power plug on the main box, and its other end into a 12v accessory outlet. And that's it.To use the booster, turn on accessory power to the car (or just start it), make sure lights light on the front of the main unit. (If not, flip the switch on the back of the 12v accessory plug.)And the result? An extra bar of signal on everything I tried, both separately and all together at once. This included a Verizon Samsung Galaxy S4, a T-Mobile Apple iPhone 6 Plus, and a T-Mobile Apple iPad Mini Retina with 4G LTE. Adding one bar may not seem like much, but when you are starting with an unreliable 0-2 bars, it's all the difference in the world. And to confirm it worked, all you have to do is switch off the booster and watch how much the signal declines, and improves again when you switch it back on. (Note: T-Mobile recently gave my son a similar device to improve his home 4G cellular signal in our town, and that unit also yielded a net signal gain of one bar, which again is just enough to make his cell phones usable on the first floor of his house, rather than always having to step out into the yard to take calls.)Note: Though only labeled as a 4G booster, this weBost Drive 4G-M Cell Phone Booster also boosted 3G signals. It supports all four of the usual US signal bands: 700MHz, 800MHz, 1700MHz and 1900MHz.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9AH0MZWK5MKH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RHMFPEU#wasThisHelpful","R9AH0MZWK5MKH","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a deep one, even by the standards of earlier books in this series. And it still isn't quite the end yet, with one more to come in 2015.It's really interesting to see how an artificial intelligence in full development might be able to essentially fulfill all the Biblical promises of a heavenly afterlife, and what that life might look like, fulfilling many of our expectations of such a place. It's also interesting how such an outcome appears incompatible with freedom and individualism as we remember them in American historical lore.""Omnius"", the AI, seems to be a pending victim of ""pride goeth before a fall"", both in this volume and presumably in the one yet to come. It's also perhaps too cynical by half, going way out of its way to create the appearance but not the actuality of personal choice. It also seems surprisingly upset by humans who persist in believing in the possibility of any other creator or afterlife than itself, which in a Christian fiction novel might end in a deus ex machina moment of Jesus arriving on the clouds to settle everyone's hash. Here, however, the surviving believers in another afterlife may be descendents of Jews, as their symbol is a six-pointed, rather than five-pointed star. Either way, it reminds me that in our philosophy of religion class back in seminary, deciding whether God exists is not the same as deciding God is good, and we end this volume wondering if Omnius too is somehow in need of redemption and humility, and what that might look like in the final volume.I've enjoyed getting to know all these characters through many volumes, and all the many plot twists that eventually make some kind of sense. I do hope it all has a happy ending in the end, even more so than appears to exist after this volume, with only a few loose ends to tie up that I expect will turn out to be harder to do than Omnius expects.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R134TZ7OUS49CO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R4WX2WA#wasThisHelpful","R134TZ7OUS49CO","A2JNI9V0X3YHK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2JNI9V0X3YHK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"From time to time, I like to go back and reader older mysteries.  The type of books that do not throw all of the characters or side parts at you at once.  Books where there is no jumping to conclusions or where the sleuth actually takes their time to get the reader from the beginning to the end.  I admit that I picked up this book because of the title and the time of year, but to be honest, other than the book beginning at a childs party, it has nothing to do with what the tradition has turned into.Featuring Hercule Poirot, his friend mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver has called upon him for help when a young girl at a Halloween party recounts her witnessing of a murder.  She claimed that at the time she did not know that it was in fact a murder and that it had only come to her later on.  When this young girl, Joyce Reynolds, is later found murdered at the party, Ariadne relies on Poirot for his insight as to what could have happened.As it turns out, thirteen-year-old Joyce has a tendency to lie.  Not just a little bit, she is well known for her fibs.  To Poirots mind, just because this young girl has a history, does not mean that there is not some truth to her story.Calling on his friend retired Superintendent Spence, Hercule Poirot is getting a better idea of residence of Woodleigh Common and it turns out that there was an au pair named Olga Seminoff that had disappeared under suspicious circumstances and now Poirot is starting to put the puzzle pieces together.Some claim that this is not Agatha Christies best work and I think to each their own.  I find all of her books fascinating and enjoy them each time I pick one up.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJEN2MSYSQC5E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062073958#wasThisHelpful","RJEN2MSYSQC5E","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not know if it is possible for a book to be too southern, but for me, I think that the mystery got lost somewhere in the quirks of this southern tale.  From the names to the people to the odd situations, this was almost too much to handle.Granted, I have come into this series in the middle and after having a conversation with Michelle Babb, the narrator, I agreed to take a listen. She did a wonderful job in separating the characters and making each voice their own person  which was necessary since they are all new to me.  I am not sure if author Linda Kozar intentionally made this book or series an exaggeration of the south, but I went with it anyway.  There is a simplicity and innocence that confused me from the beginning. What year did this book take place?  I am sure that it is modern day, but at the same time, it felt like 1950.  The characters are that quaintly nave and simple.What begins with an apparent accidental death of a contractor working on Sue Jan and Monroes home quickly goes downhill when Monroe is considered the prime murder suspect.  Small town politics are thrown into the mix and money is missing from the high school band fundraiser.  Add to that a new woman is in town and wants to open up her own beauty parlor that just might put Lovita and Sue Jan out of business.  Plus troubling relatives that have moved in, complete with their own trailer, and have dug a swimming pool without permission.From the outside, the town of Wachita is in a mess of trouble.  Lovita has no plans for this to ruin her wedding day so with the help of Sue Jan, she sets off to set her town and her friends to right.  It may involve the reinforcement of seven types of ribs from the Chinese restaurant, but that is all doable.Once you get past the exaggerated southern-ness and quirky characters, the small town of Wachita does begin to grow on you.  This is a place that takes care of their own and when you have two women that are best friends for life looking out for you, no one stands a chance of ruining their plans.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NOERJOFPNTN5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWGPVX6#wasThisHelpful","R3NOERJOFPNTN5","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Midway through this book, I did not want to continue.  I did not want to see the beloved figure Mark Twain denigrated in this way.  What I came to realize is that this is not about the Mark Twain that Americans know; it is it about a caricature that Samuel Clemens created and could not rid himself of.  Granted, they are both the same physical person, but in temperament, they are very different.  One that wants to be love and one that you will learn to despise.Author Lynn Cullen will tell you that this is a fictionalized imagining of the personal life of Mark Twain, a man that kept a room in his home for his Angelfish.  Which came across to me as something akin to Heffners mansion.  A little club within his home for young women whom he cared about and gives them angelfish pins to show their membership.  A humorist that rarely laughed and whose own daughters despised him.  A man that loathed himself and everyones adulation only made him loath himself more.Isabel Lyon came to the Clemonss household as a secretary to Olivia Langdon Clemens, the sickly wife of Samuel. In time, Isabel was beguiled by Sam.  She was lonely and he showed attention.  This was a recipe for disaster since the more Mark Twain loved a person, the harder he was on them and in turn, they tried harder and harder to please him.  Between Twains dying wife, his daughters and Isabel, there was a constant struggle for his affection.  Someone has to lose, but in the end, it seems that they all did.At heart, Samuel Clemmons was just a salty Mississippi steamboat pilot who became Mark Twain. A persona that he neither liked nor could live without.  He was a lonely man that needed every bit of love thrown at him, but yet he could never give any back.  He was volatile and with little provocation, he could become frightening.  A controlling man that was not happy unless everyone loved him and only him.At Isabels breaking point, Ralph Ashcroft, Twains business manager, began to show his affection for her.  Mark Twain had no intention of marrying her when his wife died and in that time and place, it was unseemly for a single woman to be living in the home of a single man.  She was a friend that was more than a friend, a secretary that was more than a secretary, but in her heart, she knew that she was nothing.  It was time for her to leave and Ralph, twelve years her junior, allowed her the escape.What neither Isabel nor Ralph knew was the extent to which the worlds beloved humorist would go to destroy them.  He even went as far as writing a letter calling Isabel Lyon ""a liar, a forger, a thief, a hypocrite, a drunkard, a sneak, a humbug, a traitor, a conspirator, a filthy-minded and salacious slut pining for seduction."" He was a cruel man that was not going to let someone like Isabel ruin his story.Mark Twain wanted to own people.  He would not let suitors around his daughters and actually hated the idea of any man, other than himself, in their lives.  He needed control.  He was a man that was nothing but a tyrant and bully in his own home.Lynn Cullen did a remarkable job in trying to separate the two personalities that made up the same man.  At times, the book seemed long and unnecessarily drawn out.  I am not sure if that was due to the subject matter or Ms. Cullen wanting to make her readers feel the same kind of entrapment that Isabel felt.  There is a lot of material to their association, though rejected by the man that she loved, Isabel refused to speak publically about their relationship and his hateful turning on her.  This was a deeply troubling book to read and I do hope that if you do delve in, that you take your time and do some of your own research into the central characters presented here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15B9M8REG24L8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UDCNJ44#wasThisHelpful","R15B9M8REG24L8","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These will be your definite go to jeans with their true to size comfortable fit due to the spandex that allows you to not feel strangled by your pants.  With the dark color, they have more of a dress up look than your standard clean the garage looking jeans.  Unfortunately, the nature of spandex over time may not hold its shape and you do run the risk of a baggy bottom look.The pants come with a sticker that tells you that they are deep- dyed which means that unless you launder prior to wearing, you will run the risk of the dye rubbing off onto light-colored fabrics or upholstery.  The washing instructions state that you need to turn them inside out and always wash separately.  I guess that means that the pants will continue to lose color over time.Available in long, medium and petite you will have to decide on how you wish to wear them.

"The bars came well packaged, but they still melted.  It is very difficult to buy chocolate online when you are not in the middle of the winter months.  It is just too hot to maintain the integrity of the product.Taking the product right off of the delivery person, I opened up the box and felt the bars.  They were squishy so I threw them into the refrigerator to firm them up.  Not sure if this was the best option, but it was the first thing that came to mind.  The thin bars stabilized quickly.The taste was incredible.  The dark chocolate is intense without the bitter taste that other bars have.  Do not know if you would call them gourmet since they are a Nestle brand, but it does taste substantially better than their commercial lines and with no artificial ingredients, you can literally taste the quality.What is unique about this bar is that it almost feels like it was made in layers and instead of crumbling like other bars, they tend to flake. I am sure that the sustainably-farmed cocoa beans is important to some, but to me, the overall taste is what would bring me back  it literally melts on your tongue.Good choice for a chocolate bar if only there would be a better way of keeping them from melting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R124MK0QRC1W5S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014UAGKRW#wasThisHelpful","R124MK0QRC1W5S","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Well, that was frustrating.  I was settling in to read a short story that evolved around Agatha Raisins beginnings and just when I thought that I was going to get a full glimpse of her life before The Quiche of Death, when she arrived in the Cotswolds, the story is over and I come to realize that this was just a marketing ploy to introduce the first two chapter of the book Dishing the Dirt.This book begins when Agatha is twenty-six and still sensitive.  Having fled the Birmingham slum where she was raised and the life of her drunken parents; she is currently employed by a horrible woman in a Mayfair public relations office.  Jimmy Raisin, her first husband is out of the picture and quite by chance, Agatha stumbles onto the life changing moment that she has been hoping for.The overall story is bumbling and choppy.  Parts do not make sense, sensationalism is thrown in and conclusions are reached without enough story building.  What does come across are Agathas dreams for the future  her own agency and a cottage in the Cotswolds.There are parts of the series that will never change such as Agathas way of solving cases by apparently blundering about like some demented wasp and Agathas way of ferreting out peoples weak spots and ruthlessly gaining inside information.Agatha is one of those characters that you either love or hate and since I am well vested in this series, I find myself reading whatever comes out with her as a main character. I do not know what the future plans are for this series, but I do hope that M. C. Beaton steps up her game.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KLRW3M6D4PJF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XTW2A5E#wasThisHelpful","R1KLRW3M6D4PJF","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pretty sure that this product is designed for men, their own advertising states Thrive helps guys (and gals) look better and live healthier.  If it were truly designed as a unisex product, there would be no need to place women in parenthesis.To me, out of the bottle, the scent is too harsh with too many ingredients coming together at once.  Made from a variety of oils and essences that only lubricate your skin to help your razor glide over wet skin, which is no different from my usual baby oil.  Granted, one or two ingredients might help with irritation, but this is not a problem for me so I cannot comment if that works.Wet skin with warm water, spray on oil and rub in to create a very light milky sheen.  Shave as usual.  When you are finished, rinse well and the scent seems to dissipate quickly.  I did feel that my legs were on the dry side after use and I followed up with my usual lotion.Backed by a crowd-funded enterprise, their product model will appeal to many, but I am not fully convinced that this is any better than what I am currently using.  Granted, mineral oil is a petroleum product and that does not fit the market that Thrive is appealing to, but when it comes to price and overall affect, they both do the same thing.  Which now makes me wonder if I can just use olive oil  that will give me both the oil and the natural product?  I will have to try this out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V7D47SBJQ74B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOZ8WS#wasThisHelpful","R1V7D47SBJQ74B","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I gave up reading the book about a third of the way through.  With 25-ish characters, I had a hard time keeping everyone straight.  Knowing that I needed more of a visual approach, I switched over to the video.  Granted, keeping the characters straight was easier, but still, the overall story was not that entertaining.Pagford is a village in turmoil since the push to move the lower classes out and a high-class spa in.  The village council is divided, but when Barry Fairbrother dies and his seat on the council becomes available through a casual vacancy chaos ensues.  To complicate matters further, the town explodes when videos and gossipy blog postings run rampant exposing what the members of the council would like to keep hidden.Multiple stories abound with the towns people fighting amongst themselves, children battling their parents and at the same time, central character Krystal is trying to save her mother.  Add in strong women trying to man-up their husbands and a second stage has been set with nothing is as it seems in this idyllic village.Abigail Lawrie is a fantastic actress and to be honest she is the only reason that I continued with the second and third episode.  She carries the whole series with her honesty and vulnerability.  Julia McKenzie is a deliciously evil mother-in-law with her snide comments and pixie smile.  Then there is Michael Gambon, how could you not love his pretentious character; he is what drives most people to do the most awful things.Based on a 500+ page book, I am sure that much was left out of the series, but what was included showed a very sharp picture of how things are never what they appear.  Not a miniseries that I would recommend, but if you do chance watching, do it for Abigail Lawrie alone.  She is the one shinning things in this adaptation.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LBJEGOH6S85Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WGHUPAA#wasThisHelpful","R1LBJEGOH6S85Q","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Years ago, I read West with the Night by Beryl Markham and the feel of it has always stuck with me.  I could not quote specific parts of the book just that it was a remarkable read and both the feel and the woman have stayed with me.After bringing Ernest and Hadley Hemingway to life in The Paris Wife, I could not wait to see what Paula McLain could do with Beryl.  A woman most notably known as the first woman to fly a solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic from east to west in 1936. There is so much more to this woman.  Beginning with the fact that her mother abandoned her when she was just four years old only to return sixteen years later assuming that her daughter would take care of her and ending in her final years in her beloved Kenya.Growing up an ex-pat in colonial Kenya in the early 1900s on her fathers horse farm in the Rift Valley, 100 miles north of Nairobi, taught Beryl about the people and the place that she would always call home.  It taught her courage and strength and to know that she was her own person.  She never limited herself by thinking that a woman could not do something; she just had to find her own way and prove that it could be done and that she was the best choice.  Whether that be the first certified female horse trainer at the age of 18 in Africa or a record breaking aviatrix  she was a feminist before the word was even invented.There was a rivalry with Karen Blixen aka Isak Dinesen, the author of Out of Africa, when it came to Denys Finch Hatton.  The ex-pat community was small and insular so affairs and rumors were part of everyday life.  Unfortunately for Beryl, people were more interested in her personal life than her public accomplishments.  There were husbands, there were affairs, but that should never undermine her achievements as an individual.Beryl Markham never fit into the world that was designed for the women of her time.  She was too determined and too unwilling to be held back by the limitations of her class or gender.  She was a fascinating woman growing up in a fascination time that she was determined to make all her own.  Paula McClain brought Beryl alive a second time for me showing once again the courage a woman can have when the other options do not feel right.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LDDJ2A1SV5OC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345534182#wasThisHelpful","R3LDDJ2A1SV5OC","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit I was curious as to how four ingredients could create a simple main course that would be palatable.  Not that I am a food snob, but I like to cook and rarely do I find simple recipes that pack enough flavor.Kim McCosker reinvents easy main courses, but for me, they are lacking in flavor depth.  Granted, the beginning of the book states that salt and pepper are not included in the four ingredients, but then again rarely are there any other seasonings listed.  You will have to dress up each according to your personal likes.  For instance, her version of Sloppy Joes includes ground beef, onion, bell pepper and ketchup.  That is it.  For me, even with salt and pepper, there is no flavor.I would consider the recipes here as a starting point.  There are some very good ideas and the pictures really give you a feel of how they should look, but it will be up to you, as an individual, as to where you want to take them.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL1928VGA95R1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451678037#wasThisHelpful","RL1928VGA95R1","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Veronica Speedwell is attending to the funeral of Nell Harbottle, a woman that was not her aunt though that was a title that she had claimed for herself out of convenience.  Both Nell and her sister Lucy had taken in Veronica and reared her though she was a foundling, orphaned and illegitimate.  The small family moved a great deal when the gossip became too much and if it were not for the kind and loving nature of Lucy, now deceased, Veronica would have been the victim of the resentment that Nell had felt at the exclusion from the Christian folks that she had so longed to be a part of.Veronicas wit is biting and a bit crass for the time, but I am completely entertained by her.  She never intends to shock anyone, it simply happens.  She speaks her mind and lets the cards fall where they may and from the looks of it, it is a habit that she does not tend to curb.For a woman of her time, she is direct and determined to be a mistress of her own fate.  Being an obstinate and willful child has prepared her for her future  lepidoptery and her next butterfly expedition where she has found that men can be just as interesting as moths.  Making it a rule that she never got involved with English men, foreign trophies were collected and quickly forgotten once she returned to England.Baron Maximilian von Stauffenbach comes to Veronicas aid and in doing so, she has embarked on the single most significant decision of her entire life.  She is a woman in search of an adventure. Little did she know that this adventure would culminate in death and finding out her true heritage.With Max now unable to continue helping, she has been placed in the care of Stoker (Revelstoke Templeton-Vane) a man with his own troubled past.  They are quite a partnership  when one sees the forest the other studies the trees.  This does not mean that they are constantly battling.  There will always be a feisty discussion and a battle of wits, there is a strange connection that is not yet finished.The first book in a continuing series will have you wanting to read more.  From the main characters on down, they are well drawn and quite colorful.  You will find yourself laughing at the banter and at a point or two gasping.  This is the first book that I have ready by Deanna Raybourn and I am so glad that she has created a world that I look forward to returning to.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28ERD4ZTJURP0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451476018#wasThisHelpful","R28ERD4ZTJURP0","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To this day, I am still not sure how this filter works and how the flashing light knows when it is time to change the filter.  At no time does the water, indicator light or filter touch, but still it seems to know.The last filter I purchased I swear that it said to change every three months but this new and improved filter says two months, but the same 40 gallons of water.  That is not something that I keep track of but when the green light turns red, then I know it is time for replacing and that usually happens every 2  3 month.Do not believe the directions.  They now say that you do not have to presoak the filter, just rinse it for 15 seconds under running water.  This made the water taste horrible.  I went back to soaking it for 15 minutes and the water is much better.Every time I replace the filter, I tend to run into the same issue of it not seating correctly.  This time I took the reservoir out and spun the filter until it grabbed correctly. Not sure if others have this same type of issue, but this made better sense to me.  I also ran into the issue of the blinking light not turning green with the new filter.  It was not until I presoaked it that the light turned green.  Now I am finally back to the clean tasting water that I am accustomed to.I am on city water and from time to time, the chlorine taste is unbearable and the hard water deposits have ruined two coffeemakers.  I have noticed that with the Brita pitcher and filter I am receiving consistently pleasant tasting water and no problems with my coffeemaker.I guess my takeaway with this latest filter is to go back to the original directions and realize that new and improved is not always better.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RTJ8EB128F0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006J6WX#wasThisHelpful","R30RTJ8EB128F0","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unless the reader is completely daft, they do not need the author to excessively describe the situation or to overdraw the picture, or to even repeat the situation to you.  This book was superficial and did not add to the first book or make it a series that a reader would run to.The title had absolutely nothing to do with the storyline.  Other than the fact that Georgia Kelly creates stained glass art in her apparent spare time.  This is a story about a town, Wenwood, New York, in flux since a new building project on the marina could mean big changes for their small town.  A law office that has been torched, the ex-wife of one of the law partners having her own antique shop rifled through, another law partner murdered and an old photo album that holds a secret  pretty much that is the book.  Add in the requisite heroine with curly hair, her cat and the two men that are suddenly smitten and you have your typical cozy mystery.I enjoy series books, I enjoy cozy mysteries, but this book is just not very good.

"Out of the plastic bag and my first impression was that it felt more like plastic than I was expecting.  The new 2015 Kindle Paperwhite slid right in and that was when I noticed that the front cover slid back and forth over the face of the Paperwhite like a worn bookbinding.  It still closed correctly, but I had to wiggle it a bit to get the right hand side to line up.The magnetic clip keeps it closed and protected and the screen springs to life when I open it.  I do recall reading a previous reviewer saying that he had a hard time opening it without wedging a fingernail or another object in. I do not think that it takes that much effort just a slight poke of your thumbnail and you will be fine.It easily stores in my bag without the extra bulk that I had with my prior Kindle Fire and the cover.  Very lightweight and with the ability to fold it back on itself allowing one-handed reading there is no problem at all.I did find that the cover is too smooth to prop up the e-reader if you are wanting to read in a hands free landscape mode.  Maybe if you are using it on a textured surface where it can grab, you will have better luck.The cover fits snuggly along the top and the bottom corners of the Paperwhite leaving plenty of space to turn the device on and off (which is not necessary since the cover does this for you) and to use the included charging cable.  The inside has an almost felt like feel that will not scratch the screen, so for me, the additional expense of a protective sheet was not necessary.Other than the slipping binding feel, I like this cover.  The red is a very classy color that tends to lean to more to a cranberry tone than orange.  Most importantly, when it is sitting out on my work desk, it looks like a pad folio instead of an e-reader, which is always handy when someone walks by.I have also found that the cover is not easily removed.  I guess that is good in that it will not slide out. The secret is pushing on the two corners that line up with the inside fold.Overall, this lightweight attractive cover will be able to stand-up to my daily use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U8Q0E06GTTEE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RYJDTEE#wasThisHelpful","R3U8Q0E06GTTEE","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In their last collection of essays, Have a Nice Guilt Trip, Francesca Serritella the daughter part of this mother daughter writing team was droning on and on about her boyfriend.  Jump to this book and the droning continues but with a slight variation.  My ex-boyfriend, my ex-boyfriend, my ex-boyfriend  we get it Francesca, relationships are difficult and though you are in your late 20s you are still sounding like a 12-year-old junior high school girl.  Time to move on.I do not mean to totally dis this book, because there are several touching and laugh aloud parts.  It is just that each time a Francesca story would come up, the reader knew that there was more than a 50-50 chance it would involve the ex.The writing team did address the recent death of Lisas mother  Mother Mary.  It was sweet and loving and you could feel the admiration and respect that was felt for this remarkable woman.I am not sure where the title came from.  There was a story of the joys of the correct Scottoline foods to bring to the shore, but other than that, I would say that the title might be just an eye grabber since this really is the perfect book for your summer vacation.  Quick easy memoirs that have you connecting them to your own life and your own relationships with your adult children.I liked how Lisa ended this book.  To me, she sounded as if she had a new understanding of life.  She was somehow at peace and she knew where this next part of her journey is going to take her.  She will still have dog problems and house problems and life problems, but she sounds more readily able to handle them.  Good for you Lisa  I look forward to reading where you are going.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R259VOWGA58CXG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250059941#wasThisHelpful","R259VOWGA58CXG","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have no idea how anyone gets through cold season without Emergen-C and MucinexDM.  The combination of these two products taken as soon as you feel the first tingle of a cold tends to head that cold off right away.  What used to be a solid week of feeling awful now only lasts a day and I am back to my usual self.There is some controversy as to how much Emergen-C to take but your body actually lets you know since it releases what it does not need.  Not to be too graphic, but your fluid output will turn an almost neon color when you no longer need the extra vitamin C.This is definitely a product that I keep on the shelf and it does not hurt to use an extra boost of C when you are going to be out in a crowd or traveling on an airplane.

"When I finished this book, my only thought was  now there is a book with inconsistent writing.  Parts come across as very amateurish and then a couple of chapters later, the writing has tightened up and the story flows then only to fall back to sloppy again.Lindsay Norris, the head library in Briar Creek, Connecticut has her hands full with a coworker that she refers to as the Lemon, Milton the Yogi, and her new lover Sully.  Though she is not ready to make any declaration of love, she is moving that way until her ex-boyfriend, John Mayhew, shows up in town and rumors of Captain Kidds treasure map being discovered set everyone in a frenzy.With a salvage company chomping at the bit to start their exploration, things get a bit messy when Trudi Hargrave starts forcing her way into the project and wanting to open Pirate Island, a treasuring hunting park that will bring tourists to the area and put a couple of dollars into her own pocket.  Unfortunately, the discovered map shows that it is really Ruby Island, another one of the Thumb Islands, which was the location of the mass murder of the Ruby family several decades before.  It appears that the island has not yet claimed its final victim when Trudis body is discovered at the bottom of a shaft.Sometimes you have to trust the universe to take care of things, but then again, in cozy mysteries, it is usually the amateur sleuth that has outwitted the local police and everyone else to come up with the exact strategy to foil the criminal and right all the wrongs in the world.There are odd little dangling parts of the storyline.  Characters introduced but seem to go nowhere  Herb being injured at city hall trying to foil a break in but yet he is never seen again and when Lindsay had the opportunity to ask him who had pushed him, she does not.Maybe I had missed it, but did the ultimate culprit actually kill Trudi?  When asked he laughed if off, much like the reader does since there is no plausible explanation.What was the point of the explosion on the island and the ultimate fire that almost destroyed everything?Most of this book does not make sense.  I am not sure what Jenn McKinley was after, but insulting her readers should not be part of it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REAQH3ZYAV1PW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425251764#wasThisHelpful","REAQH3ZYAV1PW","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Since I change my liner frequently due to hard water, soap deposits and that funky smell, I am glad that I finally found the liner that I have been looking for.  Made of a slightly thicker commercial weight vinyl that is not the usual thin plastic that you find in the mart type stores.Twelve metal grommets means that the ends will not rip when someone tugs a little too hard. Magnetic weights on the bottom hem that will stick if you have that type of tub.  Since my tub is fiberglass, I just like the extra weight on the bottom that prevents the curtain from dancing all over the place.Even though the photo shows it to be opaque, this vinyl shower liner is very clear and can be used either as a traditional liner or as a standalone curtain if you have a fear of someone sneaking up on you.There is the usual plastic smell when you first take it out of the packaging but that soon dissipates.Overall, I was very please with the quality, from the simple sliding of the grommets over the shower rings, to how it hung along the inside of the tub.  I know that it is just a simple liner, but finding one that is not made from inferior plastic with little punch holes for the rings can be a very rewarding experience.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37RCG74MAHJME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00200JQQ2#wasThisHelpful","R37RCG74MAHJME","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I admit it; I did not like the Paperwhite when I first took it out of the box.  It was too lightweight and looked like a toy that I would easily loose if not break.The set up with extremely easy with a simple walk through.  All you need to know is your Wi-Fi and Amazon passwords.  The device did freeze up while connecting to my Amazon cloud, so after ten minutes of waiting, I just turned it off and then on again and everything was there.  Books remain on the cloud until you add them to your device and once you are finished with that book, you can easily send it back to cloud.  I like this since I then can keep straight what I have read and what is next up.I have been using the original Kindle Fire for years with no problem but I decided to try the Paperwhite solely for the ease of portability.  It is very light compared to the Fire and is less of a weight burden in my bag.After using it for a week now, I can finally say that I love it.  What was holding me back was the lack of color, no fancy book carousel and the ability to have a black background with white lettering.  I loved the colors of the book covers.  The Paperwhite is strictly black and white.  In addition, the Fire allowed you to have a black background with white lettering, but Paperwhite is only a light-colored background with black type.  To be fair, the Paperwhite allows more flexibility in brightness and with a no-glare screen I find that I can read longer without experiencing eye fatigue.An additional thing that I did have to get used to was the page changing.  The new page seems to flash in instead of a slow roll over.  It might closely resemble the changing of pages in a real book, where your eyes flash off one page and on to another, but it does take some getting used to.On the positive side, with the Paperwhite you are aware of where you are within a book since both the location and the completed percentage are clearly visible at the bottom without your having to click and search.  Also, the highlighting option is much better on the Paperwhite than on the Fire.  The Paperwhite allows you highlight over multiple pages instead of having to set different highlights with the Fire.  The battery life with the Paperwhite is much better than the Fire even with the Wi-Fi on constantly.  I am sure that there is a way to turn off the Wi-Fi other than putting it in airplane mode, but I have yet to find it on the Paperwhite.All display controls are on the top of the screen and though I am used to tapping on the bottom, all I get is page changing when I tap there.  Which is another good point.  You do not have to just tap the right of the screen to get to the next page; you can easily hold the device and tap the bottom.  It makes the ergonomics much easier.Another curiosity is when you highlight or makes notes; the Paperwhite creates a book cover called My Clippings where you can find your information.  They are also listed under notes within the book, so I am not sure why there is a secondary location.  There is a section within the settings that allow you to share this information, but with an easy swipe you can turn this off.  There is an additional Vocabulary Builder that will remember your dictionary look ups but this too is easily turned off within settings.Depending on your personal preferences, the Paperwhite has many different controls that you can either incorporate, disable or just ignore.  Anywhere from sharing your books and notes to parental controls.  You can either list your books by cover or by title.  Change light settings.  Shop.  Tie into your Goodreads account.  Create your own book collections.  You can decide on the number of books on your device versus just keeping everything in the cloud.  This option was perfect for me since I only like to have the few that I am currently reading and then push the others to the cloud when I am finished.  For me, this creates a lot less confusion.  With a simple touch of the screen and a Wi-Fi connection, you can bounce books back and forth.There is no wall adapter included, but you can use any generic adapter that you have.  Just be cautious the first time or two to make sure that there is no overheating and remember that some adapters can take longer for your device to fully charge.  There is a computer to e-reader cord included that works well, but sometimes that is not convenient.I will be ordering a case since I need a little bit more to hold onto than this small plastic device.  Overall, I am now very pleased with the Paperwhite.  If you are on the fence about ordering, just remember that if you are looking for an e-reader without all the color and 3g capabilities, this will fit your needs very well.  Once you get into the actual book parts, there is very little difference between the two devices and with weight being a deciding factor; this just might be what you are looking for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HEK9YKRWBC72/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQVZDJM#wasThisHelpful","R1HEK9YKRWBC72","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not sure if this book could be any more boring, drawn out or redundant.  I understand that when it comes to certain authors and certain genres that the reader has to suspend belief, but Nancy Thayer has taken that to a completely new level.Picture if you will, a thirty-six year old woman with two children that has been in a loveless marriage for years, who just happens to rent the same cottage for the same summer as a recently widowed man with a troubled young son.  Of course, they are both attractive but yet the woman could not possibly be interested in a thirty-year-old man because he is so young.  Really?  A six year difference and that is her first concern.Doing the obvious dance around each other and making up excuses to be apart and yet doing everything within their power to make the other jealous, they inevitable fall into bed together with only days left on their vacation while of course having to sneak since they do not want the kids to know or heaven forbid her mother finding out.  Geez.I love a little mindless summer reading but this book was awful.  Nancy Thayer kept throwing in people and situations that were supposed to add depth to the story but it only made it more ridiculous.  I see that she is a well-liked author, but this book did not do anything for me and to be quite honest, I have no desire to check out anymore by her.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LAIMBX8UCB05/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545516#wasThisHelpful","R1LAIMBX8UCB05","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that I surprised myself with this product.  I have been using a liquid Moroccan oil to help protect my hair from the dryer and flat iron, but did not like how my hair felt by the end of the day.  Taking a chance on this product, I was looking for that light just from the salon feel and I think that I have found it.It took a couple of tries before I got it just right.  Think Goldilocks  not too much, not too little.  What I learned is it is very important to keep the fine mist spray away from your roots.  Spray on towel dried hair  apparently you can also use on dry hair but I have not done that.  I make sure that I get a little on the underside since my hair is a little thicker.  I also do an extra little spray on that one patch of frizzier hair that I have.  Comb through with a fine tooth comb, let it air dry a little, then finish up with a hair dryer.  To this stage, my hair looks nice and I do not need too much finishing with a flat iron.  Five more minutes and I am out the door.No additional touch ups and my color treated hair feels light for the entire day.  This is exactly what I have been looking for.  Great price, great product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WFT0AUHSA8R3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PATJH0A#wasThisHelpful","R1WFT0AUHSA8R3","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do not have a connection with To Kill a Mockingbird that others have.  I do not remember reading it in school during a time when such things make a lasting impression.  I vaguely remember parts but could not tell you if it was from the book or from the movie.Without having an emotional tie with the classic book, I went into Go Set a Watchman with open eyes and a deep curiosity as to how a book could be so derisive.  What I was greeted with was a woman that had a strong up-bringing, a curiosity for life, a life altering moment in her younger years, a handful of decisions to make and in the blink of an eye, the realization that the man that she thought she knew was a stranger to her.There is nothing more earth shattering then when a woman learns that her father is not the man that she thought he was.  Though it was not under the same circumstances, I could relate to Jean Louise Scout Finch at this exact moment.  The moment when you world crashes and you begin to questions your whole life.Flashing back to her past, Scout reminisces about her growing up and the times and situations that helped her to be who she is.  As she states, she was blessed to be color-blind, so the realities that she must face when she returns to Maycomb County are harsh.  Henry, her almost fianc, tries to explain how you have to be in the middle of something, no matter how horrible it is, to see it from all parts and change it from within, but Scout is having no part of that.  With Jem now gone, she is confused.  Calpurnia and even her Uncle Jack have tried, but when times change, there is no going back.I love southern humor.  There are long drawn out parts of this book, but the humor is what kept me focused.  Not to say that this is a funny book, the subject is very serious, but the south has a way of telling a story and peppering it with humor. Your heart breaks for Jean Louise, she has been gone a long time and home tends to change when you are not there.  Home can even change when you are sitting at your fathers knee, but we cannot always see it when we are living it.As others have said, this book is not To Kill a Mockingbird; it takes place almost twenty years later.  The people are the same, but the time is different.  I cannot say if it is better, but to me, it is lasting.  The heartbreak is palpable.  The frustrations are real.  The realization that everything is bearable when you become your own person bounces off the pages.Scout had to become a separate entity from her father.  He was her God and when he descended to human level, her world was rocked.  It was time for her to return to Maycomb, she was on the cusp of maturity and humbleness of mind.  As the tide was turning, she now had to run to meet it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AF0VR25T4F57/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062409859#wasThisHelpful","R1AF0VR25T4F57","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sorry, but I do not feel or see any difference with this product over any other drug store moisturizer.  When you first see this container, you think that there has to be a mistake.  It is the size of the small sample bottles of product that you receive at hotels.  .5 ozs is a very small quantity given that you are expected to use a dime size amount per application.

"What started with a cordial luncheon with her brother and sister ends with a F3 tornado hitting the surrounding area and Chief Kate Burkholder springing into action with John Tomasetti at her side. Kate was excommunicate from her Amish family and her remaining siblings have a hard time with her decisions to live with John with no plans of a wedding in sight. They only slightly accept the fact that she is the police chief of Painters Mill, but living in sin is harder to tolerate, that goes against all that they believe in.Right now that has to take a backseat as Kate rushes to aid the people of her community. A local trailer park has been decimated and in a split second decision, Kate rushes to the aid of a baby only to later question her actions. She loves her job, but days like this she second-guesses herself and wonders if there is something better out there that doesnt hurt as much.This tornado has not only destroyed lives it has also unearthed a skeleton. Since the bones had been disposed in a garbage bag and found in what was once a crawl space, Kate is unsure of the cause and/or manner of death. She now has a mystery on her hands. A mystery where she knows that if she cannot name the victim, finding his killer will be next to impossible. The forensic anthropologist has given her a few clues including a surgical implant and a diamond ring that ties in with the books prologue. What Kate was not prepared for was the autopsy findings that showed that both the hands and feet are missing and not just carted off by wildlife. The markings show that they had been chewed off. Is she now looking at a homicide or an accident that was covered up anywhere between ten and thirty years ago?As Kate searches through the missing persons database from Holmes County that fits the vague perimeters that she has been given, two names jump out at her. They are of Amish families that have remained in the area. As she digs, Kates life is at risk. What was once covered up now will have a bright light shown on it and Kate is going to be paying a heavy price when all is said and done.Years have passed, and when a life has been based on deceit, secrets and sins, the powder keg will blow and everyone standing in the way will eventually pay for the decisions that they had made. Each person has their breaking point, that one moment where they will right the past. That they will have to amend for their sins. It is at this point that Kate finally sees the full and clear picture of what a family has done to protect a loved one and to save their sole.By the end, three cases were closed and none entailed a happy ending for anyone. Linda Castillo wove a tight story that kept the reader on the edge of their seat. From the beginning, the reader might have been able to guess at how one would end, but the depth of all was so intertwined that the full outcome was volatile. If you have a queasy stomach, I might veer away from this one, but if you can handle it, this is one of the best books that the author has written.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R270Z7NUTB7Q1O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250061563#wasThisHelpful","R270Z7NUTB7Q1O","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has taken me forever to get around to writing this review. It is not that I did not like the book, I loved it, but for most of it, the book was completely obvious. A good versus evil, that will play well with preteens and those that like a bit of dry snarky humor with their paranormal fantasy.From the first pages, I was enthralled with the life of Peter Whistler. In 1918, a boy with no name was taken in by Mrs. Hart and given a good life. When each new child came into the Little Angels Home for Orphan Boys, Mrs. Hart worked to find them homes. Peter was different, she kept him close. He may have had run-ins with the local kids and the local law enforcement, but there was still something special about this boy. There is a loyalty between these two and that is challenged on the night that Dr. Pike arrives. With his burning eyes and mind befuddling trickery this conjurer is about to change everyone's world and it is up to Peter Whistler and his Rules for Lying to help his new family.Rule #1: A lie on the fly will surely die. Lies must be practiced and when you fully believe what you are saying so will the receiver of this lie. This turns out to be the most important one of all. If Peter did not believe that he had to power to save Esther, a blind girl that Pike is determined to use to get past the fiery demon from hell, then all would be lost and the world would forever be at the whim of evil.Lie #2: Lies prevail with few detail. Once again, keep it simple.Throughout the book, the reader learns about eight rules that keep Peter and his band of misfit, from the children of society to the families that live in the bayou, from the evil clutches of Feu De Lenfer (The Fire of Hell).There is a burgeoning story of young love that is awkward and adorable at the same time. This part will make the parents smile and touch a sensitive giggly nerve for younger readers.As I said earlier, this book is not for everyone. You have to suspend belief - this is a young adult paranormal book and there are a few undertones that could possibly not sit well with your personal religious beliefs and you may have to explain a few things to your younger children.Most importantly, there is humor and strength and bonding and a sense of family that carries throughout the book. You might not want to read it to younger children that might decide to come up with their own rules, but for older kids that know the difference, you could use this as a family read-a-loud to get everyone laughing and exclaiming at the same time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VIX2RZRONDPL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628308621#wasThisHelpful","R1VIX2RZRONDPL","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Opening the bag, the first aroma is of nut oil.  Which is not surprising since this muesli contains canola, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and almond pieces.  I was not a fan of the product right out of the bag, the combination of ingredients tends to stick to your tongue and you proceed to spend the next couple of minutes digging it out of your teeth.Adding cold almond milk just makes it chewy so the final key was to make it hot.  Equal parts unsweetened almond milk and muesli, microwave for a little more than a minute, let it sit for another minute or two to soften it up and then top it with a little honey and finally was able to achieve the right texture and sweetness.It is a good product with natural ingredients.  A bit on the pricey side so hopefully Nature Valley will reevaluate the price to make it more competitive with other brands on the market.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2G8J7JJLAHACX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSFNXJE#wasThisHelpful","R2G8J7JJLAHACX","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Of course, this book had me guessing the whole way and of course, I got it wrong.  By the middle of the book, I was sure who the sociopath was.  The voice that was introduced in the first pages and kept rearing up throughout the chapters.  One character was too obvious and I knew that Lisa Scottoline would not let me down with something that simple, but as the book went along a new contender appeared.  Of course, that person would make an interesting adversary, but no, I was wrong again.  By the end, Lisa gave the reader a one-two punch that had me wondering what I had missed.It has been awhile since I have read a Lisa Scottoline novel and now I am wondering what has taken me so long to get back to her.  I have enjoyed the books written with her daughter, but her series and standalones have not made it back on my radar until now.This book was amazing.  Layer upon layer that has been heaped on Dr. Eric Parrish, chief of the psychiatric unit at Havemeyer General Hospital, would bury any man, but his training as a psychiatrist has engrained in him a precise way of handling lifes situation.  Now his perfect world is crumbling and he must face it head on. He is in a battle with his ex-wife over custody of their seven year old daughter, he has been called in to consult on a case with a dying grandmother and her 17 year old grandson, a sexual harassment case has been brought against him, a teenage girl has been found murdered, there are financial shenanigans at the hospital, upset psychiatric patients and their families, a hostage situation at the mall, conspiracy charges, a fire, a new woman in his life, etc.  I would call this another week in the life of Eric, but this is too much for anyone to endure.This book grabs the reader from the very first pages and does not let go until the end.  Which I thought had ended a couple of chapters before it did, only to read a couple more and wondering why the end was dragging on.  It was not dragging, Lisa was just allowing the reader to catch their breath before the final crushing blow.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q143RMWYCTBL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=125001011X#wasThisHelpful","R3Q143RMWYCTBL","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

There is some strange goings on and it all seems to be tied to marijuana that has recently been found around the island.Add to that, Natalie has two guests that are on the island investigating the dead of a minister whose bones have recently been discovered.  One of the guests is a distant relation to this priest and it turns out that he himself seems to have been tangled in some interesting activities.Cranberry Island is a unique place where the locals look out for each other, but each seems to have a unique piece of the newest mystery puzzle and it is up to innkeeper Natalie to sort it all out. The stories are simple and from time to time farfetched, but that is what they are designed to be, a little whimsy and a little mindless diversion from your day. The writing is a slightly frustrating with repetition within the same paragraph and a couple continuity issues, but this series is designed for fun and if you do not let the flaws distract you, you will enjoy visiting with Natalie and her friends.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXXK9NFACCMZ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0738734608#wasThisHelpful","RXXK9NFACCMZ8","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the price, this is a nice set.  I do agree with previous reviewers who stated that the bracelet was not as thought out as it should be.  The small heart does not have enough weight to stay in place and tends to flip over showing an unfinished backing.  Making the heart a solid charm would have been a much better idea.The necklace is very appealing.  The rose gold pendant with silver chain allows it to be worn with a variety of outfits from everyday simple to a dressier night out.  The writing on the necklace, ""Take My Heart And Make It Yours"" is adorable without being too obvious and bothersome.Overall, a nice set perfect for gift giving that would ideal for any young woman in your life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TZK5FJWIFWHT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFRSX1M#wasThisHelpful","R3TZK5FJWIFWHT","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Almost 400 pages and an anticlimactic ending.  By the end, I was wondering if John just got bored and decided to put us all out of our misery.In 2008 during the financial collapse, attorney Samantha Kofer is given the choice, either be terminated from the Wall Street firm that she is currently with or take a one year nonpaid sabbatical at a nonprofit.  Out of curiosity, she heads to Brady, Virginia in the heart of Appalachia.  Thus begins her indoctrination in Big Coal, Big Lies and real people with real problems.Her background in Real Estate law did not prepare her for the daily problems that enter the legal aid clinic and Samantha is hitting the ground running.  She is trying to draw the line between what is legal and what is in the best interest of her clients.  Those lines get a bit murky when coal companies choose to hide documents.What Sam gets during her time at the clinic is a crash course in humanity.  What she chooses to do with it will not surprise the reader.  You could tell from the first twenty percent of this book how the story would play out.  There is a surprise or two and a couple of harsh realities, but still this book is only slightly to Grishams usual standard of writing.  I do wonder if this was supposed to be a legal thriller or John Grishams personal attack on the coal industry.Since the ending was so blas, I am questioning if this is a standalone or if Grisham has further plans for Samantha and the Gray Mountain Legal Clinic.  More could have be told of this story so I will see how Grisham wants to play this out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGSIWLT56MOCF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=038553714X#wasThisHelpful","RGSIWLT56MOCF","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have never read a Joyce Carol Oates book before, I had no idea what I was getting into and if this book is any indication of what her past works have been, I will tell you that this author perplexes me.Throughout the entire book I could not tell you who the most peculiar person was, was it Andrew J. Rush who goes back and forth between using the first person narrative but yet refers to himself in the third person a split personality?  Was he an alcoholic battling his demons?  Was he demented all along and just happened to find an alternate personality that was able to write novels that he paralleled to better known authors.Was Irina, his wife an accomplice to his darker half?  Did she stay in the background to view from afar the demise of her husband?  Did his sons back away or was Andrew J. Rush unapproachable even to his own family?Then you have C. W. Haider who set this whole macabre dance in motion.  I do not know where to begin with this character, was she truly gifted but battling her own psychosis?  I am sure that this character alone could have a group talking for hours.Up until the very end, I was not sure if I liked this book that read to me as an homage to Edgar Allan Poe, or if I was terrified to let go once I was inside the mind of Andrew J. Rush.  What I do know is that as Andrew J.

"There is way too much repetition in this book and I am not sure if it is poor writing or the fact that on a small island stories seem to be repeated too often. Either way, it became very annoying and had me rushing through the chapters so I did not have to hear the same story repeated to the next person entering the room.Mackinac Island is known for its fudge and small tourist hotels. Allie McMurphy is now the manager and chief fudge maker for her familys establishment. With her dog Mal (who seems to have her name mentioned way too often  by Kindles count over 300 times) they tend to find their way into too many sticky (see what I did there) situations.This time there is an arsonist and bomb maker on this tiny turtle shaped island and as Allie is scrambling to get the fourth of July fireworks situated. One fire after another seems to pop up and it is the heroic puppy that always seems to save the day.After ignoring a couple of phone calls from the pyro technician, Allie rushes out to the warehouse where the fireworks are being kept to see what all the commotion is about. As she see what she believes to be the dead body of Rodney Rivers, fireworks start going off in the building and she gets out just before the explosion takes place. This is only the first in a long line of increasingly dangerous arson incidents around the island and Allie and her band of hapless cohorts take on the search for the culprit or culprits. They have narrowed it down to ten suspects and now someone is on to their investigation and the attack has hit too close to home.As far as cozies go, this is a humdrum series. The writing is too simplified. There is too much reiteration without moving the story forward and the characters all blur together. Situations are too inane (do authors not think about the names they give characters, finger printing a message board, bringing a cat in a carrier to a fireworks display) and I truly wonder how a series can be so wrapped around a small dog that appears smarter than the adults around her. To narrow it all down, Allie, who is the mastermind behind finding the perpetrator; literally caught him red handed in the middle of the book and did not put it all together. Too many hints were dropped and by the time I reached the end of the book, it was a relief that it was overWhy do I continue with this series  your guess is as good as mine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J15ZT6BMWHI2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0758287143#wasThisHelpful","R1J15ZT6BMWHI2","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not all high school bullying books are created equal. Some actually add a couple of twists that have the reader bragging to her friends about how awesome this is and should be read not only for the awareness but for the idea of how change could be incorporated within their school districts.Seventeen-year-old Regan Flay is your typical straight A cheerleader, student council, center of attention girl that picks her friends for their social value and her activities based on how they will look on her college resume. She will tell you that her life is hard, caffeine to wake up and Xanax to calm down, that being perfect and the daughter of a Congresswoman just puts her in a spotlight that she could not always control. Anxiety attacks are a sign of weakness and if anyone caught wind of this, her perfectly created world would be over. She did not understand that her actions toward others could have lasting effects. That is until the tables are turned and she becomes the victim of the bullying that she had showered down on others.When she walks onto campus, she is consumed with thoughts of her cheerleading tryouts. She did not do as well as she had hoped but knows that she must make the squad again this year; this will guarantee her place in the campus hierarchy. She senses that something is different, it is common for people to be looking at her, but people are now looking at her with contempt and not the usual envy.She never trusted Amber, the head cheerleader, but knew that she had to remain friends if she wanted to be on the squad. They each kept the others secrets. They shared too much. This was her down fall. Every text that they had shared has been printed out and now they were plastered on the lockers. Everyone that they had been mean to saw in writing what had been said. How did their private messages get out? Was she hacked? Was someone out to ruin her? How was she going to contain this and turn it around?Regans best friend Payton is nowhere to be found. She is not answering her phone or responding to messages. How could her best friend abandon her like this? Is social preservation more important than their friendship? She was not going to show tears, tears were a weakness. With the tables turned and her now being the victim, how was she going to last a week let alone the rest of the school year? She was alone. She was broken and had to learn how to fix herself.When you reach your lowest point, it is surprising who comes to your aid. For Regan it was the boy that she despised. She had two options  either allow Nolan to be her only friend or use her anxiety pills as a way out. It was not as if others did not think that that was a better idea. They even suggested it on Facebook and it had seventy-six likes.There were a couple of hints along the way as to who was behind this. The why was not at first apparent, but as you read along the pieces started to fit together. There are the grab you in the solar plexus moments and the grab the tissue moments, but by the end, you have understanding. You will know that words spoken and typed will forever be written on someones heart and it is up to you what another person carries with them.One book may not change anything, but it is a start. How this school chose to transform what is written may put ideas into the minds of parents that are struggling with a way to make positive changes within their own schools.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R189FY0UZ8T013/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1622663969#wasThisHelpful","R189FY0UZ8T013","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Why does Lori stick her nose into things that are none of her business?  That is what I was thinking throughout this entire book.  She is becoming a character that is more annoying than endearing.Early in the series, she was zany and found herself in one madcap adventure after another but now she has either become a stale characters or I have become bored with her.  Nancy Atherton needs to broaden out this series and focus on the side characters more.  Not necessarily lose Lori all together, but bring the people of the village more into the forefront.A great deal of this book rehashes who each of the villagers are and their odd quirks.  If you have been reading this series, all nineteen previous books, you already know who they are and there is no need to repeat what has already been said.  Her twin boys should be about eight years old, but Lori constantly treats them as if they are four.  Lori and Bill have recently become parents to a daughter and the weary reader will be told repeatedly how singularly fantastic this child is.  By the way, thank goodness the word diaper was not being used in a drinking game since it would have involved taking approximately sixty-two shots.Lori takes it into her own nosey ways to find out why two cottages in the village have not been sold.  She is determined to find out whom or what are driving the buyers away.  As she tries to unfold this mystery, she is also stressing over the arrival of her husbands dreaded aunts.  They are coming to Finch for the upcoming wedding of Willis, Sr., and their arrival is putting a damper on the festivities.  Apparently, these women are awful, but by the end of the book, the table will be turned on these two and it does not involve extra strong martinis.Deciding to take her daughter on a jaunt up a craggy trail, Lori meets the elusive Summer King.  Arthur Hargreaves, the owner of Hillfont Abbey comes to her aid when the wheels literally come off the pram.  They spend time together and this Hermit of Hillfont Abbey and his hoard of children and grandchildren that inhabit his familys home enchant Lori.  The Hargreaves have stayed to themselves ever since a feud began a century ago between Finch and neighboring Tillcote and Lori is finding out how deep this feud went and how Quentin Hargreaves, the original owner of Hillfont, was the puppet master behind the village of Finch.Loris eyes may have been opened, but she loves Finch and its people so maybe she will be able to forgive what has happened in the past and love the Summer King for what he has created.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CDGDE4WE10DR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670026700#wasThisHelpful","R2CDGDE4WE10DR","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Elizabeth Alexander a poet, essayist, playwright and teacher best known for her Praise Song for the Day delivered during the inauguration of President Barack Obama was married to Ficre Ghebreyesus of Asmara, Eritrea. An artist and photographer that put the best and the worst on canvas, a chef that walked across the killing fields at age sixteen and landed at the Caffe Adulis in New Haven, Connecticut. A man that loved hearth above all else. A man that at the age of fifty left this world too soon.Light of the World is an ode to their life and love. A final embrace with a man that was loved and had loved deeply. At its core, Light of the World is a love story. A way to work through the insurmountable grief that a woman holds. An expression of a man so the world will not forget. A man that she was supposed to share the next 100 years with but only spent sixteen.The strongest parts of them were united in their children. The days are long but the years are short goes a saying quoted by many. Two children a little less than 18 months apart that were the center of their world. Two children that were taught their familial rituals and blessings, and always felt the unwavering love of their father.I do not want to admit my ignorance, but I will confess that I had to read this book with a dictionary on my lap. Ms. Alexanders vocabulary usage is a step or twelve above my usual casual reading level but I did not find this to be a detriment, I actually enjoyed it.There are parts that are rambling and repetitive. I will forgive the author for this since it is quite obvious that this memoir is cathartic. She is the holder of the stories and needs to remember the feelings. She needs to have Ficre in her life again. She needs to stay put and move on at the same time. She needs to create a place for herself and her sons again. A place that might have tattered edges, but they are shared edges.I am not sure if this book will resonate with everyone. There are some parts that seem never ending. You can tell that Ms. Alexander does not want to let go. She was blessed, by love, by family, by community but mostly blessed with a heart that could take it all in and share it with others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YD41ZHGNOVD1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1455599875#wasThisHelpful","R2YD41ZHGNOVD1","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I tend to have a love hate relationship with James Patterson. I am finding that I am enjoying a couple of his series, but at the same time, I am embarrassed if anyone sees me reading one. I do not think that I am a book snob since I read a variety of books, but apparently, I am.NYPD Red is a unique division of the New York Police Department that handles only high profile cases involving the wealthy and influential.Zach Jordan and Kylie MacDonald have a past of their own, they had a hot and heavy month long romance during their academy training but both have moved on. Occasionally they rub open the scab and old feelings surface. More on Zachs side than Kylies, but Kylie knows how to play this fiddle and she tends to play Zach when it suits her. She may be beautiful and intelligent, but underneath, I am not sure if I like her and I just wonder when she will go a bit too far with both her career and her partnership with Zach.Now they are detectives and have been assigned to the disappearance of Hunter Alden, III. Jordan and MacDonald will tell you that the wealthy are their own version of odd, but when Hunter Alden, Jr., the father of Trip (H.A. III), seems reluctant to find his own son and derails the investigation at every turn, the two detectives are even more determined to solve this case.Of course, it would not be a Patterson if there were not a conspiracy of some sort. However, what is behind the reasoning for the fathers reluctance is disgusting. Telling your son that it would be easier to make another child than make another billion dollars even had my skin crawling. Granted, the son is not without fault, but even though Trips plan went amuck, his intentions to expose his father had merit.From time to time, Patterson and his co-authors push the envelope, but what is behind this is still a little too raw for some people. There is no pretty little bow at the end of this book and many readers will not like the conclusion, but it is what it is. Zach and Kylie must come to terms with what they cannot change if it can help more in the future.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14DNI2PEJP9QK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316406996#wasThisHelpful","R14DNI2PEJP9QK","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are many characters in this book and over the first 50 pages, you will be introduced to most of them.  So you are either going to have to keep notes or have an excellent memory as to whom they are, who they are related to and how each piece fits into the puzzle.Ridgedale, New Jersey, is a small college town.  Molly and her husband are recent transplants with Jasons new teaching position in the English department and Molly is branching out as a reporter for the local newspaper.  She is still grieving the loss of their second child, a daughter that was stillborn.  Filling in for another reporter, Molly has been called out to a body that has been found by Essex Bridge, adjacent to the college.  When she learns that the body is that of a newborn baby girl, she must once again confront her demons so she can report this story.Characters that do not at first appear to be part of the overall picture play vital roles as the circumstances unravel.  Pay attention.  Little snippets are dropped and it is up to the reader to put the parts together. As each chapter concluded, I was beginning to wonder if these people could be anymore intertwined.Then you will hit the part where you literally say aloud, what the heck, that wasnt discussed before, only to see the next part of the story unwind.  You have to stay focused on this book and most definitely need to read it in big chunks - no picking up and putting down with this book as you can so easily with others.Molly is in deep and as Sandy, a life worn teenage girl, reveals what she knows, the story becomes riveting.  No one is left unscathed.Most books have a definite peak in the storyline.  Where I thought this book peaked, was only a blip on the map.  Up until the last pages, the reader continues to be dealt final blows and final twists.I had enjoyed Ms. McCreights previous book  Reconstructing Amelia and I have to say that I think I liked this one better.  She has a way of constructing a story with tidbits of information that has the reader wondering what was missed, but then you realized that you did not miss it, it was only a teaser for what was to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q17GAG5P1EB7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062225464#wasThisHelpful","R2Q17GAG5P1EB7","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am in the slow process of replacing my cookware.  Out with the nonstick-coated pans and in with stainless steel.  This has been a cooking learning curve but so far, I am happy with my purchases.This is a heavy pot that disperses heat evenly and can be used on a variety of cooktops.  Gas, electric flat and rings, Halogen (which I did not know existed) and induction.  This saucepan is dishwasher safe but I still prefer to hand wash.The metal handle stays cool to the touch so an extra silicone type sleeve is not needed like other cookware.My one concern, after the first use, was the bottom outside of the pot showed burner marks.  This is not a complete drawback since I do not mind that my pots looks used, but just surprised.  After a second cleaning of the pot, the marks have not returned.  I wonder if there was a manufacture coating left on the pot.Nice weight to the lid and have not had a problem with it wobbling like you can get with ill-fitted lightweight lids.This is currently my go to pot for small batches of soups and stews  love the ease of use and the simple clean up.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ISVN36XI2E6A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L0ZO5C#wasThisHelpful","R3ISVN36XI2E6A","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Installation is very easy.  Pop one of the included LithiumLife batteries into the charger to see how that worked only to discover that the batteries came fully charged.  The charger will light up blue when charging and all lights will go out when completely charged.  Red light means there is an error.The low profile head and full swivel capabilities are awesome.  I was able to vacuum under dressers and beds without too much trouble.  With the main unit as flat to the ground as it can go, you will be able to reach in about 8 inches.  Side suction (if that is what it is called when running the machine against the baseboards) is very impressive.  Other manufacturers claim they do a good job, but this machine actually delivers on that promise.You can lift off the canister when using it as a mobile device and it even has little legs that allow it to stand on its own.  Looks like a little blue and gray Star Wars R2D2 standing next to you.Included is a short attachment to be used for stairs and upholstery.  It can ride on the main vacuum unit but I kept knocking it off so that will live in the closet until I need it for a specific job.The first time I attempted to empty the dirt cup I did it wrong  thinking that I had to empty it from the top by taking the part that holds the filter and its supporting parts apart.  Another look at the manual shows that in fact it has a bottom-emptying button that making emptying a snap.Though I did the emptying incorrect, I did find where the filter is and saw the notation that is stamped on the machine that you should clean it every 4 to 6 usages.  All this entails is rinsing the filter for a couple of minutes under warm water and letting it air dry for a day.  One comes already in the machine and an extra in the bag with the attachments.As for battery life, I live in a smaller home with both carpeting and hard floors and was able to vacuum from one end to the other without even affecting the indicator lights on the battery, so I assume that I will be able to get very good usage prior to my next charge.Needing to replace an aging upright vacuum and a hard floor sweeper that is just too temperamental when it comes to charging, I was able to replace two items with this one and gain easy maneuverability and ease of care.Good job Hoover.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TB9NB3ONMUR9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SWCU1HU#wasThisHelpful","R2TB9NB3ONMUR9","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I just switched over to the male-to-male stereo connectors (not included) and the music sound quality did not change.Next challenge  classic iPod with my audio books.  Since I cannot Bluetooth this, I am back to the cables.  This is where the speaker stands out.  Nice vocal tones with better sound quality over all.  That surprised me.With only one positive, I am not impressed.  I was expecting a better from RNC.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OSA3SLZQFPJ1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OUEO4BI#wasThisHelpful","R2OSA3SLZQFPJ1","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like others, I figured why spend money at the salon when I could buy the same thing and do it at home for a fraction of the cost.Facial waxing is not difficult.  You just have to be patient, get the wax to the right temperature, a thin layer, let it set for a moment, place the muslin over the wax and take a deep breath when you pull.  Do remember that the wax will not get every hair and you will need to invest in a magnifying mirror and a good pair of tweezers.The unit takes about 30 minutes to warm up the wax.  On the lowest setting, you will still have a clump of unheated wax in the middle but that is no problem.  Just stir and use the outer most liquid. At this temperature, you will not have to blow on the stick to cool it before placing it on your skin.I do not use all the prep lotions that were included since my salon did not and I was comfortable with that.  Simple baby oil and a quick washing with your regular mild facial cleanser will take care of any residue that you were not able to blot off with the muslin strip.Even though the wax included is for sensitive skin, I experience itching and a slight discomfort around my eyebrows but that goes away within a half hour.Though not stated on the box or the description, there are a couple of the collars included so before you add them to your cart, wait until you receive your box and check its contents.  I had ordered them not knowing and would have much preferred to order extra muslin or sticks for the same money.I have not had the problem that others have had with the included strips leaving fuzz (not sure if they meant fuzz from the muslin or fuzz as in fine baby hairs) and found them to be very useful with just the right amount of grip.This is a great investment and had paid for itself in just two usages.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PFGISQXUVXKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BJ1CGQ#wasThisHelpful","R3PFGISQXUVXKY","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The last of the Odd Thomas series is a revisit of sorts with the characters in the previous six books.  There is not as much humor as the prior books, but the rhythm and place are the same.  The reader knows that they are saying good-bye, but that does not make the adventure any less captivating.Odd still calls himself a simply fry cook with a psychic magnetism that brings bad guys to him, a man that is destined to be with Stormy Llewellyn forever and a man that does not look for trouble but trouble has no problem finding him.Odd is traveling back home to Pico Mundo, the carnival is back in town, the carnival with the gypsy mummy that gave him and Stormy their very first fortune that said that they were destined to be together forever.  He wants to know what is in store for him now that Stormy is dead and he has missed her for far too long.Going back to the mall where she was killed reignites his troubles.  The cult members are back and they have even more deviation planned.  With the help of previous characters, Odd sets out to save the town but what he remembers from his dream is more of a riddle and with the help of those around him, he will put the pieces together.The plot of this book did not matter to me.  It was all about the people.  Characters both real and metaphorical that had helped Odd to become the man that he was.  That treated him like a son and who helped him to not feel so alone.I liked how Dean Koontz said his farewells with this book.  Brought back old characters with just enough nudging for the reader to remember who everyone was and how they had been a part of Odds life.  There was no heavy handedness and long drawn out chapters.  Questions that you had in the past were finally answered and people found their peace at last.The reader knows that they are saying good-bye, but that does not make the adventure any less meaningful.  We have seen Odd grow and mourned with him when he has to make decisions that do not sit well with him.  They are not his choices, just the choices that had to be made.  I will miss his spirit and optimism and know that he and those that he helped are in a much better place.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UJZLOQ5DLRPR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345545877#wasThisHelpful","R1UJZLOQ5DLRPR","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Funny how you can read one book by an author and not like it only to find out that another of their pseudonyms is behind a series that you are actually looking forward to continuing.Roberta Isleib also writes under the name of Lucy Burdette in the Key West Food Critic Mystery Series.  Though following the usual cozy mystery format, main character Hayley Snow, a recent Key West transplant, after following her boyfriend to this sunny local, has now found herself without a boyfriend, job or a place to live when said boyfriend has moved on to another woman.Haley may be a bit stranded in the boyfriend arena, but she does have a friend with a houseboat and a love for food that was instilled in her by her mother.  That is what she is going to rely on until she can get back on her feet.There is one job prospect, the food critic position at Key Zest, a local magazine.  The only problem standing in her way of getting this job is one of the co-editors who will make the final decision.  Kristen Faulkner is the woman that her ex-boyfriend had replaced her with.  To further complicate the matter, Kristen is found dead and Hayley is the prime suspect.Not that Hayley was not saddened by Kristens death, but she really wants this job and if she has to find the killer to get her name off the suspect list and onto a byline, she will do what she has to.The reader is treated to a foodie travelogue of Key West with a couple recipes on the final pages.  I am not sure if any of the places exist that Haley wrote about, but even if they are only a mere likeness of what can be found in this tourist town a trip just might be in store.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R173F2IELKWJV5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451235517#wasThisHelpful","R173F2IELKWJV5","A186ZAYP2L4CDZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A186ZAYP2L4CDZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I really tried to like this charger but it made it difficult. First of all, it barely ever stayed connected to my phone. So if I lost my phone or the charger, there would be no way to find it.

"I have the original XWay for vents and I love it. I bought this because I need additional clips due to changing phones all the time. The separate clip set is that is for sale on Amazon does not look good and has unnecessary large clips. I ordered two of these items to have a total of 8 clips. Instead I only received 2 same size clips in each box. The clip size is probably 14mm, so you will not receive the 2 x 11mm listed in the product description (See Attached Picture). Overall the fix that the clips come with is strong and should hold my phone in place. I did not mount it because I have the Xway.

This computer is a must have for anyone who wants a simple desktop for everyday use as well as other advanced tasks. It is not for gaming or video editing. The power supply is too weak and a high powered graphics card won't work with it.Key points to remember:- The computer may not come with a hard drive depending on the options that you select- It does not come with an operating system.

"I bought these from Costco for around $40 and they work great. I saw similar 2200 Lumens at Home Depot for around $130. At $50 they are still cheaper than many other LED security lights.

They do not feel heavy duty but they do not feel cheap either. They are light but not wobbly at all.  I had no issues with distance, you can adjust the motion sensors up and down to suite your needs. Mines turn on when people are about 20 feet away from my house.

"You are probably interested in buying a new phone but having a hard time choosing the right phone because of all the choices that are out there. After researching the best phones that are available or soon to be available (HTC One M8 and the Samsung S5) for weeks, I pulled the trigger on the M8 and picked one up when it was released to Verizon. The LG G3 is too far away to be considered. I can't tell you how awesome this phone is without writing 10 pages but I will try to keep it short and straight to the point. I hope this review helps you decide if this is the phone for you and why this is the best overall phone available right now. Honestly do not get the S5, because you will regret it. If you want a plastic phone that is powerful and probably the best in the Spec department, just wait for the LG G3. It is coming near the summer of this year and it will have amazing performance and the best display. It will probably outperform all phones including M8, but I will be happy with my HTC M8 because there isn't or will be any better looking phone that also has competitive specs this year.Why and who should get this phone?People who want a phone that:-Is well crafted and probably the most beautiful phone ever made (yes better design and materials than iPhone)-is one of the fastest phone currently available-Can live without having the best camera-Simply works without buggy software crashing and want a smooth android experience-Is one of the best phones available this year-Is a solid phone that is 90% metal and feels elegant to hold in your hand-Has very good battery life (not the best) but most people will be satisfied-Makes other people wish they had a sexy phone like it, even iPhone users-Has many ""cool"" features like motion launch, dual camera, step counter, IR blaster to be used as a remote for TVs and more, double tap to wake up, few other tricks that make it fun and easy to useWho should buy something else?People who want a phone that:-Is an iPhone (Apple lovers)-Is a Windows Phone (Microsoft lovers)-Is slightly faster but mostly plastic-Has an amazing camera and loves taking highest quality pictures with a phone-Has the best battery life and does not have a car charger-Is ugly with amazing performance and unnecessary specs.Skip this paragraph if you don't care to know what type of person is giving you this information:It is very difficult to choose a phone today because of all the choices that are available. But I finally found the ONE without compromising much. I want to give a little background about myself before you think I am just an average smart phone user. Like many of you I always want the hottest gadgets and especially the best phone. I honestly love iPhone's design but I hate their software and that is why I have always used Android phones. A few of my previous phones include: HTC EVO 3D, Galaxy S3, Droid DNA, Galaxy S4. I also had the Nokia Lumia for a very short period of time and I was not impressed by the phone or the Windows software. The only reason I did not get the original One (M7) is because of the lack of microSD slot.HERE I WILL LIST THE POSITIVES AND NEGATIVES OF THE PHONE WITH RATING COMPARED TO OTHER PHONES THAT ARE AVAILABLE OR WILL BE SOON:Overall Rating 9.6/10Positives:Design 10/10 : Arguably the most well designed phone available right nowPerformance 10/10 : One of the, if not the fastest phone currentlyDisplay 9/10 : Easily the top 3 displayExtra Features 9/10 : Missing few extras (fingerprint, heart rate monitor) but it has other features that makes up for it.Storage 10/10: Finally a microSD slot that supports up to 128GB and it has a 32GB model.Software 9.5/10: HTC Sense UI is the closest OEM software that is as awsome as the stock Android UI, I personally like the HTC sense more, it is smooth and not buggy like the Samsung TouchWiz. It has useful apps such as: BlinkFeed, Sense TV, and FitBit can be downloaded serperately and the sensors provide very acurate step counts.Negatives:Battery 8.5/10 : The battery life is above average but could have been a little better. Overall it's better than 92% of other phones. Not bad at all. A new update called ""Extreme Power Saving"" is soon to be released and it will help save a lot of battery when you turn it on, almost 70% increase. It basically turns off useless services and will probably increase the rating to 9/10.Camera 8/10 : Kind of disappointed because so many other phones have better cameras (iPhone 5s, Galaxy S4, LG G2, etc). There was no upgrade to the camera from the previous model. But I give it a 8 because the camera is decent and it has other interesting features that make up for the slightly low resulution. The camera is not bad by any means, its just not excellent. It is the first phone with dual camera and it can do some breathtaking and useful trick to the pictures using the depth information captured by the second camera. Overall I am happy with the camera.As you can see the phone is just too good to have extreme negatives, the negatives are just slightly below what is expected of a smartphone in my opinionBelow are more specific details of the phone, read if you pleaseDesign 10/10: ""This is the best looking phone in the world right now"" and that's a fairly accurate statement. Some might disagree but not many. The pictures does not do enough justice, it is truly gorgeous to look at and to hold. It feels like holding a metal artwork. It feels very solid and premium in my hands. I am only 5'3 and I have fairly small hands and I honestly think it is the perfect size, maybe 5% longer than I hoped for. Overall it's hard to find a well-crafted and more beautiful phone than the HTC M8, yes it is more elegant than the iPhone. Don't worry it is not all about design, it packs some serious power.Performance 10/10 : Let's just say it is the fastest phone available right now according to the benchmark tests I have done. The phone is amazingly smooth, everything just opens up instantly. I have not experienced one bit of lag or any errors. The Sense UI is closest as you can get to the stock Android UI experience with any OEM UI. The Samsung Touchwiz and LG UI is a mess compared to the Sense. The Qualcomm 801 processor is a fast and efficient processor. I can almost guarantee you that performance will not disappoint you.Display 9/10: The phone gorgeous inside out. The picture quality is extremely sharp and vibrant. It is easily top 3 in the graphic department. It is very bright and crystal clear. But there are a few phones currently out that outperform the display. My brother's LG G2 has a slightly better display. I hoped for it to be number one in this department but overall its nothing to complain about.Battery 8.5/10: With all the advances in technology I am not sure why there has been such little innovation in the battery field. It is not just cell phone batteries but all batteries in general. Some manufacture like Motorola has done decent job with providing large batteries in recent years. HTC has always disappointed me in this department and this phone is no exception. But I have to admit it is above average and I am fairly satisfied so far. I am able to go through an entire day without a problem. My day starts at 6 and ends at 7. My normal usage include: Frequent texting, 1-2 hours of talking, 3-4 hours of surfing and email, 30-45 minutes of games and the rest standby. I am able to get through the entire day but honestly most of us have chargers at work and in our cars. So overall I am not too obsessed over battery but the M8 does provide fairly decent battery life. Most of the tests reported a full day of normal to somewhat heavy use and I can confirm that. It was supposed to come with a setting called ""Extreme Power Saver"" but apparently it will be provided soon with an update. It supposed to limit the phone to only email, phone, text and few other basic things to save a lot of battery. Supposably up to 70% more battery. I can't comment on it until I receive the update.Extras 9/10: What's a flagship phone without some tricks? The M8 has some cool tricks up its sleeve.Camera Affects: I will complain about the camera quality later but let me state the positives in this section. Basically the camera has some tricks that help me deal with the moderate quality of the images. My brother has a$1200 DSLR camera that he uses to take cool pictures and I can do the same now with my $600 new phone. My favorite feature is the U-Focus which blurs the background and focuses on the object, like your face. Obviously the DSLR camera does an exceptional job but most people can't tell the difference with the first glance. The second camera on the device captures depth information and you can add cool affects to the pictures after you take it using that information. There few other ones like Sketch and Cartoon and Zoom effect but I find the U-Focus to be the most interesting one. But most people will use all of them because they work very well and are very easy to customize a picture.Motion/Sensors Stuff: My favorite trick is double tapping the screen to wake it up and turn it off. It's amazing how this simple feature can be so useful. I hated pressing the power button to turn on the display and now all I have to do is tap the screen. I can also swipe from the bottom to top in order to unlock the device and go to the last app I had open. You don't have to go to the lock screen, you can directly go to the home screen if you don't have a passcode setup. Swiping from right to left take you to the awesome BlinkFeed screen. Swiping from top to bottom brings up google now (voice command). Swipping from right to left take you to the home screen. The final motion trick is answering the phone by simply lifting the phone to your ear. Thre is also a feature where you hold the phone in landscape orientation and press the volume up to activate the camera app.FitBit App: The phone has a built in barometer and bunch of other sensors that can track your steps very accurately. Most phones have some of the sensors but only the iPhone and Nexus 5 has all the sensors like the M8. As a result the M8 and the few other phones can track your steps very accurately without buying a pedometer like the FitBit Flex or Force. The FitBit app was supposed to come preinstalled but you can easily download it from the play store for free. I am currently using it to track my steps and its about 96% accurate.Remote for TV and more: The M8 has an IR Blaster built in, you can control all your electronics with your phone. HTC has this app called ""Sense TV"", it's very interesting and useful. You basically select your cable provider and select the channels you have and the app gives you show times and what's currently playing based on your favorite stations and shows. Basically it's a smart guide on your phone and you simply click on the show and your cable box will bring up the show. The setup is easy, you simply select your cable box model, TV model, home theater model and you can control all of them using your phone. But I highly recommend getting this app called ""IR Smart Remote"", it's about $6 and it is the best remote app for your phone. You can basically throw away all your remotes and use your phone to control everything; it does a very similar job as the Harmony remotes. Do some research on it, you may like this app.Camera 8/10: Compared to all the other phones available, I am very disappointed at with the picture and video quality of the main camera. It is the same exact camera as the previous model except it has an extra camera. The picture quality is not bad but it is not excellent like many other phones. The main problem is the lack of resolution and bright light pictures. If there is too much light, for example capturing the sky in a sunny day might be hard; the picture doesn't capture blue sky properly. Overall it's a decent camera but I was expecting more. It is an average and maybe slightly below average camera.Final Verdict: If you want a beautiful, fast, elegant and a phone that simply works, then just get this phone as soon as you can. I know many people are comparing the Galaxy S5 and honestly the S5 has several advantages but the HTC One M8 is the clear winner to me. If you don't mind the plastic and somewhat of a bland look, then get the S5. If you want the most elegant phone that is available, then get the M8.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C4RDP8YWJZUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IZ1VNZ2#wasThisHelpful","R1C4RDP8YWJZUW","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this before it was released and I paid $9 including shipping and the current price is way too high. It is worth $7-$10.The screen protector itself is very high quality, its almost like a thin glass. It is crystal clear and does not interfere with the display quality or the touch screen capabilities. Installation was very easy and surprisingly I had no bubbles, just make sure not to touch the glue part at all, otherwise it won't stick to the glass properly. It may not be for everyone because it is very noticeable but provides superior protection. I don't use a case for my phone, so if it falls, the screen protector will most likely prevent it from cracking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30WPWW4TR8H3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00II97MJ2#wasThisHelpful","R30WPWW4TR8H3","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:-RELIABLE-Long Warranty-FastCons:-PriceI fix computers for a side job (hobby) and I came across at least 100 dead hard drives in the past 6 years. Most of them being Toshiba and Hitachi. Others include Seagate, Samsung and even Western Digital. I have seen a lot of different models but I have yet to come across a dead Western Digital Black Drive. The warranty speaks for itself; there is only couple of hard drives offers this long of a warranty. I have bought a good amount of 2.5 and few 3.5 inch WD black drive in the past which were under 500GB. Some of them were for customers and two were for me. I still have one that is 4 years old and still running strong. None of my customer has called to tell me theirs is broken. I recently bought the 4TB to use a reliable NAS drive. This drive is probably the fastest 7200RPM hard drive without being an SSD, I have yet to come across another 7200 RPM drive that is faster than this. Some people may complain that it is loud but for a 7200 RPM, I think it is normal and quieter than others that I have tried. If you want something that will last you well over 5 years and a well-crafted fast hard drive, then buy this. The price is a bit steep but it is definitely worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RA1J0S4ZVFHMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FJRS5BA#wasThisHelpful","RA1J0S4ZVFHMI","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Yorkie Terrier that I have to bathe once a week and it was tough because my showerhead pipe was too short. Bathing him was a struggle every week; he would run away every time i grabbed the towel.I started to look around for a simple solution and of course Amazon is the first place I looked. I was a bit skeptical to buy this because the price was so low and it was plastic and I thought it won't work properly. I was also thinking the pressure of the showerhead would be too weak based on the pictures that I saw. I was wrong about all of that and it is an amazing product. The best thing is that I can still use my shower head and simply remove this in 2 seconds. I am able to bathe my dog with ease.What is it?It is a plastic removable showerhead with a long pipe to reach the floor and it works flawlessly with your existing shower head. It is the best showerhead to bathe your dog.Here are some positives:-Long plastic pipe that reaches the floor-Easy removable mechanism-No leaking-Cheap-Strong enough water pressureNegatives:I can't think of one, I did not have a problem with it after 3 months of use.In conclusion, this is a must have for people who bathe their dog.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26KK0HZ5WYJUU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00272AB76#wasThisHelpful","R26KK0HZ5WYJUU","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this game for free when I purchased my Controller for Fire TV. I am not a intense gamer but I do play light to moderate games. I used to have a PS3 and I enjoyed playing shooting games such as Call of Duty.This game has surprisingly great graphics and I did not notice any lag. Its almost same as my PS3 graphics and it runs very smoothly. I palyed it for about 2 hours and I think I may get addicted. It is similar to Halo game for Xbox. It has some advanced weapons and its fun to kill aliens. I think I may have to get a Kindle Fire tablet because you can play with another player to help you if you have that.Overall its a game that you must try if you like shooting games.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK6H75W24868W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E0SZZIA#wasThisHelpful","RK6H75W24868W","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my HTC One M8 and I am faily happy with it. I use it when running outside or on the treadmil. It is too wide and too tall, my device has a little room to space on the side and the top. But the phone does not move around or fall off. Its well made and seems durable. Overall its good because there isn't much option for my phone right now.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9LSE3EK2F0M3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A5UFOQU#wasThisHelpful","R9LSE3EK2F0M3","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 9:49 MinsBefore I get into a detailed and technical review, I would like to review it for a non techie person. If you are looking for a device to replace your cable, this may be the one. Unless you enjoy live news and TV shows daily, there is no reason to keep paying for cable. There are some other devices that work very well but Amazon Fire TV is by far the simplest solution there is.  You simply plug it in and in few minutes you are ready to speak to the remote to search or simply browse for content. No complicated setup required, you can use WiFi and that is easy as typing your wireless key in. There is no need to download anything, Amazon has thousands of movies and TV shows and it is constantly growing. You could use Netflix or Hulu but I ended up cancelling my subscriptions for those because Amazon's video library is continuously growing. I expect it to surpass all other streaming services very soon. The voice search is simply amazing, it is way too accurate. After it finds the result, it is a matter of seconds before the video starts playing. The device is very small and elegant and simply fast. Everything responds instantly and smoothly. This is by far the best device available for a non techie person and it maybe for most techie people.After using the Fire TV for quite some time I have discovered a lot of positive aspects of it along with some negatives. There are endless possibilities for this device such as Sideloading Apps, Rooting, XBMC, PLEX, Keyboard & Mouse Support, External Hard Drive support and more, most of these features are obtainable at this moment for somewhat advanced users. But for the basic users who want those features might be out of luck. Google has announced Android TV and it most likely will address most of the Fire TV problems out of the box. So it may be worth waiting for. I am downgrading my rating to a 4 star because the device has a lot of potential but Amazon didn't include it all with the device.Quick Summary: I have used the WD TV, Roku 3, Apple TV (for a short time) and now the Fire TV. Of course I have a Google Chromecast but to be fair, it should not be compared to these media devices because of the price difference. Amazon Fire TV is by far the best one yet. Roku 3 has some advantages such as the ability to plug in headphones in the remote and microSD memory card slot. But Fire TV's performance and features like ASAP and voice search easily burns them all. If you have an Apple TV and you have a lot of media on iTunes, then I don't think Fire TV is the right choice for you, unless you want are an advanced user who can use third party software to make your iTunes content work. There are alternatives like used PS3 and XBOX 360 (in the same price range) if you are more into gaming, I will discuss that at the end. Amazon must have been taking notes on all the problems with other devices and this Fire TV addressed most of the problems that I experienced with the other devices and added much more features. Some of the notable problems with the other devices are: poor sound quality, slow OS interface, steaming problems, limited content, lack of advanced features and few other issues. This device is a no brainer for a person who wants to enjoy thousands of TV shows, movies, games, music and more with ease and without any problems.What is it and what is it used for?It is an Android based media player/ entertainment system that supports a various media types including movies, TV shows, music, apps and games. Most of the media is free if you are an Amazon Prime member and others are fairly cheap. Here are some of the things you can do with it:***Watch thousands of movies and TV shows in 1080P resolution using Amazon Instant video as well as Netflix, Hulu, etc.***Listen to music using apps such as Pandora and iHeart Radio***Play games such as Asphalt, Sev Zero and Minecraft, few choices now but more to come***Use Apps such as PLEX or XBMC, few choices now but more to come***You can play all your files that you have on external hard drive or computer. Movies, Music and Pictures using third party Apps like PLEX and XBMC. Almost all formats are supported.***Other things will be possible with this device over time, it is an open platform OS (Android) and there are many possibilities (Currently many USB and Wireless Keyboards and mouse is supported along with Firefox browser)Also to address those who must have the feature of playing your own video and music files, you can with the app called PLEX. You can also use XBMC if you are more of an advanced user. It is very easy to setup and you can watch MKV, MP4, WMV, AVI, FLAC, MP3 and other files from your computer or network drive. I have tried MKV, AVI, MP3 and FLAC files and they work perfectly. You don't have to leave your computer on to access these media if you have a NAS drive that is supported by the third party apps.As for people who are not happy about the fact that Amazon does not have their App available for Fire TV, please give it a few weeks and they will have it. I have already noticed new apps showing up in the market daily. HBO GO is already available through ADB install. Also there will be a way to install apps from Google Play store soon. The low rating of the Fire TV is misleading; the rating is between 4 to 5 stars from people who actually used it.Setup was very easy; I just plugged in the power cable, HDMI cable, Ethernet cable (you can use Wi-Fi too) and turned it on. A quick 3 minutes update was required, I am a Prime member and it came with my account already logged on, and that's it. There was a nice 3 minutes animation at the beginning after updating that shows you how to use the voice search feature along with other features of Fire TV. Please don't buy this for gaming alone, it is not intended to compete with gaming consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox, it allows you to play android based games and that is enough for light to moderate game lovers. It is very FAST; everything responds instantly, absolutely no lag. If you have bought any amazon products before, you know how excellent the quality is and you always get more for your money. Continue reading for more basic details and some advanced technical details.By default the Dolby Digital Plus is disabled, so make sure to turn it on under settings when you first set it up.One major flaw I realized recently is that the device has around 5GB of space to install games and apps. I only have 3GB remaining after installing Asphalt 8 and Sev Zero game. I am very disappointed at the fact that Amazon intended this device to play games but it has no space to store the games. I hope there will be an update to allow games to be installed on a separate hard drive plugged into the USB port. This alone can be a deal breaker for many. I will keep you guys up to date if anything changes.Positives/Notable Specs:***Quad Core Processor - The device is incredibly fast, everything responds instantly. NO LAG. I was able to navigate through the menu very quickly and apps work seamlessly.***HDMI 1080P - Crystal clear display, some might wish it was 4K capable but I think it's a good move not to have it. Having 4K would increase the price of the device and most people won't have a 4K TV for at least 1 more years. Then there probably will be a newer version of Fire TV with 4K support.***Optical Audio port - This is a huge plus for many people that care about sound, including me. This allows you to enjoy surround sound without worrying about your TV limiting you, simply plug it in to your home theater system using the optical port and get the full surround sound. No more worrying about HDMI not outputting the full 5.1 or 7.1 sound. The sound quality is amazing, it is much better than any other devices that I used before; my 5.1 system really comes alive.***Certified Dolby Digital Plus Sound - This is a bonus and it does make a difference if you have a 5.1 or 7.1 surround systems. I have the Fire TV plugged in directly into my 5.1 Bose system and it sounds amazing for HD movies and music***2GB Memory - It is more than triple the amount of RAM compared to other media players and it increases the speed a lot, this helps the gaming performance***ASAP (Advance Streaming and Prediction - Although I had a short time to use this feature but I am already in love with it. ASAP allows videos to start playing within a second of clicking play. It learns what shows you like and pre buffers the shows and movies. It gets better the more you use the Fire TV. ***Surprisingly great gaming graphics and performance - I did not expect great gaming performance, but I was wrong. This plays many basic games such as Asphalt and Minecraft flawlessly. It will probably support many advanced games but not as advanced as PS4 or Xbox one would. You can't expect that from a device that costs $100. There are several hundred games available now but thousands more are coming. This is Android based open platform, so there are many possibilities and many more things to come. You will need to buy the $40 controller if you intend to play games on it. I will have to wait until April 8th to try the controller.***Mimo Wi-Fi and Ethernet - This is one of the faster Wi-Fi cards and I no longer have to rely on Ethernet. It also has Ethernet if you desire to use it.***Voice Search - I have used this feature for a short period of time and it is fairly accurate and returns very results quickly. You can search all Amazon movies and TV shows and Apps that are on your device or in the Amazon Market. I searched for ""Person of Interest"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"" and it returned the results instantly. It's as accurate as my HTC One M8 Android phone. You simply say what you want to watch and it will bring it up.***Bluetooth remote - This is a very convenient feature. You don't have to worry about pointing the remote at the device; you can have your Fire TV hidden and still control it. Since it has Bluetooth, it is possible that there might be a keyboard available to use with it soon. A Wi-Fi remote would have been better but this is almost as good.***Optional Controller - The optional controller is a must have if you want to play games on it but it does cost $40. It works flawlessly with all the games***Android Based OS - This is a huge plus because there will be a huge amount of apps coming soon. Android is an open platform and one of the hottest platform right now.***Tons of Apps for multimedia - Many apps such as Netflix and Hulu***Hundred and thousands (coming soon) games - If you are not a gamer but you still like to play some games then this is the perfect solution. If you are like me, you don't want to spend $500+ dollars on a gaming system and hundreds more on the games themselves to enjoy some games. The Fire TV is the perfect fit for me because it satisfies my needs and much more. It also provides a real controller similar to Xbox controller. On another note, Amazon has hired some well-known game developers to develope games for them. So stay tuned.Negatives:***Price - I honestly don't think the price is too high but most people will complain because the gaming controller is separate and costs $40. I think the price is fair based on the amazing hardware that it contains.***No HDMI or Optical Cable included - Many people will complain about the absence of HDMI cable, which I think should have been included. The HDMI cable is a very cheap cable and I think it should be included because you can't use the device without it. Since you will need an HDMI cable to get started, please remember to order one with the device. The optical cable is not a big deal because most people don't use one.***No Infrared(IR) sensor - I can't use my Harmony remote, this might be a big deal for some because Harmony remotes are awesome and now I have to use two remotes.***Limited HD Space/ NO SD Card - After using it for more than a day, I ended up downloading many apps and two games and I only have 3GB left. I hope some kind of update is provided soon to fix the problem and allow external drives.***Headphone jack for the remote should have been added, similar to the Roku 3***Not all functionality is available when launched and will not be- The controller is not available until a week later, the parental control app is coming later, more games are coming later. Also many features such as playing your own media content are not supported natively. I kind of wished they had waited until more of these ready at launch. But it's not a big deal because it already has a ton to offer.***Wish it came out sooner - I spent too much money on other devices.The device itself is very slick and light. It is similar to an external DVD player for laptops, a little smaller. It does not feel cheap, very good quality materials and seems durable. The menu bar is on the left hand side which includes: Search, Home, Movies, TV, Watch List, Video Library, Games, Apps, Photos, and Settings. It is very fast and easy to navigate through. The picture quality is very clear. I use Ethernet cable to connect but I have used the built in Wi-Fi to connect too and the video had absolutely 0 lag. It was very clear and it did not freeze once. There are around 200 apps and games available but Amazon promises to bring thousands more soon and I am sure they will keep their promise. I didn't know how to turn off the device and I contacted Amazon and they told me the device never needs to be turned off. When not in use, it goes to screensaver and after about 30 minutes the led light turns off.Searching for content was very fast and everything showed up instantly. The voice search made it so easy to find what I wanted. I could search for apps and movies in the Amazon Market and it brings it up almost instantly. Netflix and Hulu apps were somewhat slower than the Amazon Instant video. It wasn't a lot slower, just slightly slow enough to make you notice the difference. But I still consider it to be fast compared to anything else that's there. Amazon has little control over performance of third party apps; a lot of it is up to the developer. Very often the apps are updated to fix lagging issues. As I mentioned before I love the ASAP feature. Videos that I searched for played instantly, it predicted what I wanted to watch and very accurately. So I tried to trick it by selecting something at the end of the search results and it wasn't as fast to play but it did play faster than my other devices. It took about 4 seconds compared to the 1 second, but that will depend on your internet speed and connection strength if using Wi-Fi.Overall, there are some downfalls but the other positive aspects of the Fire TV makes up for some of it. I think version 2 should be in the works to address the negatives and to compete with Android TV which should outperform this device. Even with some of the annoyance, it is still the best media player available right now.So what other alternatives do you have?To get all the benefits there isn't any alternatives, especially if you like the complete multimedia experience. If you lean towards gaming more then there are two routes that you can go and spend around the same amount as you would with Fire TV. You can either get a used PS3 or Xbox 360. They are similar in many ways and choosing one would depend on your preference of Microsoft or Sony system. They both provide a good amount of multimedia such as Movies, TV shows and music but they do not present it in a great simple way as the Fire TV does. I will explain the PS3, but Xbox 360 would work similar way. A good condition used PS3 slim costs around $140 on eBay, which is the same price as Fire TV with the controller. PS3 has many of the apps such as Netflix, Hulu, Pandora and other streaming apps. One advantage that PS3 and Xbox have over Fire TV right now (Fire TV may support this soon) is that, you can play your own music and movies that are stored in the hard drive. You can get a subscription for PlayStation Plus for around $5-$6 a month to get access to a good number of free advanced and basic games, Amazon doesn't have a monthly fee. Xbox also has monthly fee for their LIVE subscription. After you get a subscription you can purchase hard core games such as BioShock but they can cost a lot more than Android games. Fire TV has games for average of $1.50 vs. average of $20 for PS3 or XBOX games. But as a result you get a much (a lot) better game from PS3 or Xbox. Remember this solution is only beneficial for moderate to serious gamers who does not have money for PS4 or Xbox One. Over a year you end up spending a lot more than you would for Fire TV and its gaming experience. The monthly subscription and the purchase of game can add up quickly. So as you can see these are very good alternatives, it all depends on if you want a gaming system with multimedia or a multimedia system with games.I do not own a Kindle Fire tablet, so I can't comment on the ability to pause a movie on the tablet and just flick it to the Fire TV. It supports it and it should work easily.I downloaded Asphalt and played it for about 30 minutes using the remote and it played flawlessly. I didn't notice any lag and graphics was good.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKH9X2BUOYCUQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","RKH9X2BUOYCUQ","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this mainly to apply liquid glass wax to my car but I use them for a lot of different things now. I use them to apply tire shine, dry hard to reach places, wash car, clean leather seats and even apply uv protectant to my interior. These can be washed and reused several times without messing up.

I am 21 and I kind of want to do everything possible to keep my hair without spending thousands on Bosely or similar treatments.

"I bought this from Tiger Direct and the sound was very good like many of the reviewers stated. I received an unit that was made after November 2013, so I did not have the Bluetooth problem. The sound system is almost twice as heavy as other competitors. But overall the wooden casing is nice and it seems to be a solid product. Pioneer designed the casing well but not the interior parts. After a slight pull, my Optical port broke, the cable would not stay put. Very poor quality connector board, and the placement of the connections make it difficult to mount it to the wall. The sound it self when it worked was great and the bass was deep. The bass would get muddy at times but overall pretty good sound. It is not surround like few other sound bars. I ended up returning this and bought a Sonos Sound Bar for $700. I was very disappointed with the Sonos. It had absolutely no bass and sound was not as good as the Pioneer. But if you pair it with a Sub that costs $700 more than it sounds amazing. But I did not have that much money so I went to Costco and bought the Vizio VIZIO S4251w-B4 for $250. This unit is amazing. It sounds much better than the Pioneer and works flawlessly. It is very stylish and slim. It has clear and deep bass and very good surround sound. I highly recommend that you give the Vizio Sound Bar a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B782KFNKYT0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EHBPF6W#wasThisHelpful","R1B782KFNKYT0C","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been doing a lot of research on Sound Bars for the past 2 months because I wanted to replace myWired 5.1 system. I have tried a total of 3 sound bars and I ended up keeping the Vizio S4251w-B4. I initially bought the Pioneer SP-SB23W and the sound was very good and much better than the Sonos Sound Bar that costs $700. The reason I returned it was because it was very unreliable. The optical port broke and the cable wont stay put. And many other users reported Bluetooth issues. The system had very good bass but muddy at times but overall 4 star sound. Then I bought the Sonos and I was very disappointed. Read the quick Sonos Sound Bar review at the end of this post. Then finally I went to Costco and bought the Vizio S4251w-B4 for only $250. I dont like Vizio products because I think they are a third ranked brand and I had reliability issues in the past with this brand. But I wanted to try it out because it had such good reviews and Costco had a demo of it that I was impressed by. So I bought it and I was blown away. It sounded better than my wired 5.1 system and a lot better than Sonos sound bar and a little better than the Pioneer. Everything worked flawlessly and the sound was amazing. It had clear and deep bass and surround sound was great when I plugged in a DTS and a Dolby 5.1 source. It is very stylish and slim.I bought the Sonos Sound Bar from Best Buy and after listening to it, I was very disappointed. I went back to Best Buy and bought the Sub to hear the difference. It is literally night and day. I would give it 5 stars with the Sub. The Sound Bar itself has absolutely no bass, if you turn the bass up, then you just hear fake annoying bass. Nothing that would shake even a glass of water if placed in front of the Sound Bar. I ended up returning the Sub and the Sound Bar because I could not spend $1400 for a Sound Bar System at this moment. I am giving it a 2 stars because the Sub is not included with the system and this review is for the Sound Bar alone because it is sold alone. I have tried various sources for the audio including Dolby 5.1 and Bluetooth source. I am an IT person and I tried everything to like this Sound Bar, but the sound was just not worth the $700, maybe $200 in my opinion. It was clear sound but it needs bass.In conclusion, if you have $1400 then buy the Sonos Sound Bar and the Sub. If you are like me and cant afford that right now, then purchase the Pioneer or the Vizio for less than $300 and you will be satisfied. I do plan to buy the entire Sonos system at one time. But for now I am more than happy to have the Vizo replace my 5.1 wire mess.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSCO5MJN2T82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDIK908#wasThisHelpful","R3QSCO5MJN2T82","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am not a detailing professional but I do like keeping my cars looking new. I have bought 2 brand new cars since 2009 and I have kept them looking new by buying all kinds of car caring products. I visit a lot of different car forums and collect the best car care products including cleaners, wax, tire shine etc. If you need advice on recommended tire shine, cleaners, car wash, write a comment. I have heard about liquid glass before but I wasn't convinced that it was as good as people say it is. I was tired of applying wax all the time and the results were great but it didn't last long. I bought my second car several months ago and I wanted to keep it looking new all the time without applying wax every week. I almost purchased OptiCoat 2.0 because many people say it is a permanent coat on top of your clear coat and it lasts well over 3 years. I decided not to buy it because I don't think my car will keep looking new for three years after applying a product one time. So I did some research on other products and I came across liquid glass again. This is a very old product that has been around for over 20 years but the formula has slightly changed over time. The ownership of the company has also changed but the product is better than ever.It's very simple to apply and keeps the car looking shiny and it is somewhat permanent. Since my car was new, I didn't use a clay bar to get all the materials off the paint. I simply used the liquid glass pre cleaner and then applied liquid glass polish. You have to make sure the paint is clean and defect free. If you have rock chips, I would recommend applying touch up paint first because the liquid glass will permanently seal those chips and will be hard to fill later. I applied one layer of liquid glass using a microfiber cloth one section at a time and let it dry for 15 minutes and then cleaned off the haze using another cloth. Make sure the temperature is at least 50 degrees and there is sunshine. After doing the entire car, let the car bake in the sun for about 4 hours and apply another coat and let that bake. After my second coat, my car looked better than new and I am not kidding. It is a white car and it had a deep shine to it. I can tell that there is a layer of protection on my car. It has been two months since I applied the two coats and to this day water just bounces off my car and dirt barely sticks to the paint. I also applied liquid glass to my mirrors and windows. It's funny to see the water sliding off my glass when it rains. It is very easy to wash my car now because the dirt does not stick to the car as strongly as it used to. Liquid glass can be applied many times as desired without removing the old coat; it is actually recommended that you apply multiple coats. The more coats you apply the deeper the shine gets. I have read in many places that after about 20 coats, the paint will have a lot more rock chip protection. The layer will get thick and will protect your original paint from chips. Obviously you can't expect total protection because rocks can fly at your car pretty fast.  I am waiting for better weather to apply more coats. I actually bought a gallon of liquid glass from autobarn.com for around $60. You should not apply any wax on top of liquid glass if you plan to apply more coats because you will have to remove that wax before applying another coat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSV00ZXKY9FD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0002JMIEK#wasThisHelpful","RYSV00ZXKY9FD","A2HRHF83I3NDGT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2HRHF83I3NDGT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was very happy with the results of the blue verison of this product. I decided to try it because it supposbly has wax in it now. Honesly I can't tell the difference from the older one but I guess it maybe a little better even though i don't notice it. I will continue to buy this just because it maybe better even though i don't notice it.Here is my original review of the blue version of this:I am very surprised how well this works and how easy it is to use. When I read all the reviews, I thought everyone was just exaggerating. At first I was skeptical that it was possible to wash my car with this and a bucket of water. I have a 2011 green camaro and I would never take her to a car wash place. I have many detailing product and this is my favorite. I used to use other car soap to wash my car and I always had to wax it after to get it to shine. No I simply wash the car and it gives my car a very deep shine with so little effort. I bought a bucket that collects dirt at the bottom from chemical guys. I mix two capful of this and half bucket of water. Make sure to buy good and absorbant micro fiber cloth. If you do it right it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes to wash your car and it will shine as if you waxed it. If the car is very dirty, i usually rince it off with a hose first then apply this stuff with a micro fiber cloth. Then use two more cloth to dry the car.

If you simply want an electric toothbrush and don't want extra unnecessary features, then this is the one to get. It simply works and cleans like it should. It even has pressure sensative sensors that stops the brush when you brush too hard. It lacks the different modes and it is less powerful than the higher models.

"Like most people I have used chapsticks or Burt's Bees and they only work temporarily. When I used those products, my lips only felt moisturized for few hours but they did not heal my cracked, peeling and dry lips.

My lips stopped peeling and are moisturized even when I dont use this ointment. I only use this 2-3 times a day and thats enough to fix my lips.

"This is such a great little set! I love to use labels, and I really like the designs that are included in the set. There's many different sizes that will work for different projects and occasions.Along with 48 labels, the kit also contains a chalkboard marker pen. The marker is very nice and has a fine tip on it that's perfect for writing. When you first use the pen, be sure shake it several times, and push the tip down on the paper to allow the ink to absorb into the tip. You may have to repeat the process a couple times before it's ready to use.This would be perfect to use for the holidays, and also I think they would be really nice for the mason jar projects that are on pinterest. The labels are also reusable! Just make sure to let the ink dry completely on the label before trying to remove it. It comes right off with a damp cloth.

"Wow, I'm actually surprised!  I really didn't know how my co-workers would react when I decided to take a bottle of this to my workplace.  There's only about 4 or 5 of us that work together on shifts (911 dispatch center) and they've all asked me where I found this spray.  It really works!It's not like a normal air freshener that you pick up at the store.  This works by spraying it over the surface of the water... it traps the odor by creating a film over the water.  Also, the scent is very nice.  Although the size of the bottle is nowhere near the size as most air fresheners, this will last quite a while... a little goes a long way!So besides my co-workers asking me if I was trying to ""hint"" around about something, it's went over very well, lol.  I'm fairly certain a couple have visited Amazon to order their own personal bottle.

"I've had the opportunity to test out a couple other headphones similar to the over the ear style and I wasn't really sold on them until I tried out these by Soaiy. Yes, I can be hard to please when it comes to ear buds, only because I don't like how most feel once they are in my ears. Also,they tend to slowly fall out of my ear, and it becomes annoying. I'm very happy with these... they haven't given me any issues at all. Verycomfortable and fit great!-- sounds clear and clean, however hands-free calling had some static--The behind the ear fit is perfect for workouts, and I've not had any problems with them falling down.--Works great with android and iPhone devices.--Sweat-proof.--Fits close to the head, very lightweight and doesn't hurt my ears.--All the controls are on the headset--Blue tooth connectivityI've had some issues with the blue tooth range.  Nothing really bad, but I've had a few other pairs with a broader range. I've used them mostly while on the treadmill... as long as my device is close by, I've not had any major problems.

"Wow! This is a very nice leash.  I've had many dogs throughout my life... most recently 2 mini schnauzers and my sister just got a very large Golden Doodle puppy for her kids. I decided to give this to my sister since it's a larger type leash and perfect for larger more ""spirited"" dogs. :)The handle on this leash is perfect for keeping control of the dog and leash.  It has a large loop with a padded lining that keeps the hand from slipping out.  It's basically a grip control lining... it reminds me of what some steering wheel covers are made from.  The actual leash is also well-made and very durable.  It's much thicker than other leashes I owned, but it's not super heavy.  It's a doubled-layered nylon leash that's very smooth to the touch.  At the end of the leash is the metal latch hook.  It's quite large and also swivels around.Bottom line?  Very, very nice leash that will last a very long time.  Durable and well-made, I'recommend this to all dog owners!  Plus, the company stands behind their product with a LIFETIME GUARANTEE!  I've bought other leashes for well over $25 that were no where near as nice.  My sister loves this one and I'm glad I could gift it to her.  Product provided free for testing and reviewing purposes.

"I must admit, before trying out selfie sticks, I thought the idea of a stick to take selfie's something a child or teen would use. Now that I've actually tried one out and used it a few times, I'm hooked!  I've had the opportunity to try out several over the last few months, and this one is probably my favorite out of all of them.--compact, folds up and travels nicely--no need to take time out to set up bluetooth, simple and easy with the attached cord--nice durable handle that's easy to grip--comes with a wrist strap and velvet storage bag--comes with a removable GOPRO tripod mount!I really love that I can use this stick to get great video and photos. It cuts out on blurry images and out of focus images. Also, there's nothing worse than capturing a great ""selfie"" only to see part of your arm as the focus of the photo.The greatest function of this selfie stick is that it needs no charging or bluetooth pairing! Just connect the adapter in the hole for earphones, and that's it! Very easy to install. This came in extremely handy at a concert some friends and I recently attended. I just threw the stick in my bag, and used it all night at the concert. I got some really great crowd shots, as well as shots of my husband and I.So, I have to say that I'm now a believer of selfie-sticks! Its a fun little gadget to have around.

"This is a really nice oral thermometer. Before receiving this one, I'd been using one of those forehead type thermometers, but didn't always get the most accurate readings with it.My husband had a terrible sinus infection 2 weeks ago, so I tried this one out well during his sickness. We compared it to the forehead thermometer several different times, and the results from this one was more consistent than the other.  Also, I really like the flexible tip... it doesn't click against your teeth!It's very simple to use... just turn it one, insert it under the tongue, wait 8 seconds (it will beep when finished) and that's it!

"I'm very happy with these little travel/cosmetic bags.  Right now, I'm using them for my ever-growing makeup collection.  Yes, I have a slight addiction to lipsticks and mascaras!  The smallest of these 3 bags is perfect for my lipsticks.There's a total of 3 bags, and when not in use, they fit inside each other.  I really like the clear top... I can look and see what's in the bag without having to dump everything out to find one item.  Also, each bag zips up very easy and there's a handle on top of the bags.  They are made froma very durable material and I can tell they will last quite a while.  Also, the type of material is easily wiped down so they won't be hard to keep clean.The depth of these bags are fairly shallow, so I wouldn't suggest them for larger type items.

"Princess Rosies Rainbows is a 30-page book written for children that are 4 or older.  Some years ago a representative from Wisdom Tales Press offered me the opportunity to periodically receive childrens books to read, review and post on this site with no strings attached. This is one of those books.Author, Betty Killion has nine grandchildren, is a childrens librarian, a substitute teacher and a prolific writer who has been published over 800 times.  She did a magnificent job telling this memorable tale while Illustrator, Kim Jacobs added a colorful dimension as she has done so many times for more than thirty years as a professional artist and book illustrator.In addition to the story and illustrations, Wisdom Tales has put together another quality made gem protected with a beautiful and durable book jacket.  The glue and binding are first rate while the hard back and acid-free pages are made to last.This is a fairytale from a faraway magical kingdom in a land adorned with frequent rainbows.  In fact, when Rosie was born, the first thing this little princess saw was a beautiful rainbow.  It was an event that brought her great joy and happiness that followed her each time she looked upon a rainbow.Sadly, as the rainbows disappeared her smile and joy went with it.  Accordingly, the King and Queen offered a bag of gold to anyone in the kingdom who could make Rosies rainbows permanent.  Try as they may nobody was successful.One day Becca, a wise old teacher from a faraway village taught the princess a life changing secret.  She taught her to picture the rainbow in her memory and carry it in her heart. It worked and she lived happily ever after.As an added bonus, the author provides a simple science lesson in the back of the book explaining how to create your own rainbow.As usual, I enjoyed this quality childrens tale and can picture myself reading it to a future grandchild who listens with great interest while enthralled and pointing at the amazing illustrations.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EYN3SJZG9XWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937786447#wasThisHelpful","R3EYN3SJZG9XWL","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is my first exposure to bestselling author Patricia Cornwell and it seems that my timing could not have been worst.When I selected this Advance Readers Edition, Depraved Heart, I had no idea that the author had already published more than twenty Scarpetta novels.  Undoubtedly through many episodes she developed a storyline and major characters; however, Depraved Heart seems to have been poor choice for me to jump into an ongoing series.  I kind of felt like I walked in at the end of a movie before I had time to grasp a plot or have an affinity for any of the characters.In spite of the vividly descriptive scenes and a plethora of referrals to past episodes, this novel had a thin plot with way too many disconnected elements and poor transitions.Often the author successfully built suspense while developing seemingly key events; however, she habitually switched directions with unrelated elements deflating both her pace and my interest.This book was so disjointed and the storyline so thin that it felt like the author did not plan the structure, direction or elements to this story.  It felt like a first draft with a flight of ideas that never came together for me.Although she identifies major characters and their interrelationships from past novels, I had a hard time separating the good guys from the bad guys and eventually did not even care.After reading this book and writing the review, I talked to my wife it.  Although she has not read this novel and I was not aware that she was familiar with Cornwell, she told me that she read and enjoyed the first in this series and many others in sequence for some time, but lost interest after waiting too long between episodes and found them too convoluted to follow and enjoy.I do not recommend this novel as a first exposure to this author or a place to enter into the Scapetta series.  This is clearly not a standalone novel nor one of the authors best efforts.","1.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJ3J8A9Y3GFHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006232540X#wasThisHelpful","RJ3J8A9Y3GFHK","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Some years ago, a representative from Wisdom Books invited me to accept free childrens books to read in exchange for my honest review on this site.  Whispers of the Wolf is one of the books that they sent me recently for that purpose.This 38-page heartwarming tale written for ages 5 and up was written by Pauline Tso based on oral American Indian folktales originating some 500 years ago about the Pueblo Indians of the desert southwest and beautifully illustrated by the author.It is a quality book in both life lessons and respect for living things and fine paper, binding and illustrations.It is the story of a young brave named Two Birds and his rescue of an abandoned wolf pup that he feeds, raises and is best friends with for the pups 6 months of life before setting it free to be adopted by a pack of wolves.Their mutual friendship helps Two Wolves gain confidence and make friends with his fellow braves and while teaching life lessons.The last 3 pages are informative notes that explain the illustrations in detail.  The author also lists 7 books and authors for those interested in learning more about the Pueblo people.This book is a gem that I am proud to display in my home and read to my future grandchildren.I recommend this book to friends, family and those who enjoy reading meaningful and beautifully illustrated Indian folktales to their youngsters.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DZKOQAXSUEF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937786455#wasThisHelpful","R27DZKOQAXSUEF","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read and listened to many CDs from novels written by Reed Farrel Coleman that I have really enjoyed and Where it Hurts is another that makes him one of my favorite authors.This 353-paged, riveting Gus Murphy thriller had me twisting and turning in my chair like I was on an exciting roller coaster ride while wondering whether this retired Long Island cop turned private eye, Paragon Hotel driver and bouncer had a death wish and if he would find his bad guys and survive this crime fiction.When John Augustus Gus Murphys 20 year old son, John Jr. died suddenly of a defect in his heart while playing basketball, his family life went into an accelerated downspin.  Gus and his wife, Annie divorced and their daughter Kristen moved out of their home while Gus took a job at the less than stellar Paragon Hotel in exchange for a low paging job and living quarters in the hotel.Gus was angry and vented on ex-con, Thomas Tommy D Delcamino who had traced him to his hotel and offered his several thousand dollars to find out who savagely murdered his son TJ.  Gus incorrectly figured that Tommy D was using John Jr.s dead to get Gus to empathize with him and take the case.Feeling bad that he took his anger out on Tommy D, he sought him out to apologize, but instead found himself wounded from gun fire from gangsters escaping Tommy Ds own murder scene.Mad at God for taking his son for reasons unknown, Gus envied Tommy D because at least his death and that of his son had a tangible reason  and a perpetrator behind the crime to reckon with.Although his is discouraged from pursuing the cases by his former police buddies and attacked by those who sought to scare him away or kill him, Gus is doggedly determined to find and bring the killers to justice at any cost.Sparks fly, guns blaze, bodies mount and excitement builds as Gus methodically makes progress and barely escapes numerous attempts on his life from many directions for reasons he does not understand yet plods forward uncovering many surprises along the way.Reed Farrel Coleman did a splendid job developing this tale and characters while keeping readers engaged and guessing through the end of another well-paced and exciting crime thriller.I recommend this novel to friends, family and others who enjoy entertaining and captivating action packed novels by an author who know how to keep the reader engaged.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIGHPVTG6HX0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039917303X#wasThisHelpful","R1UIGHPVTG6HX0","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Orphan X was a quick, easy and entertaining 355-page Gregg Hurwitz Thriller that I found hard to put down!While reading the first few pages I thought that this might be a creepy novel about a clandestine monster who preys on children, but thankfully it was not!This is a bigger than life story beginning with 12-year old, Evan, an orphan boy who really knows what it is like to need a rescuer in order to survive being the prey of powerful and overwhelming monsters.That experience makes Evan the perfect selection to be drafted and molded for years by a surreptitious handler, Jack Johns, for a secret government agency to become an elite assassin.That orphan boy transforms into a man with enormous hidden wealth and assets and the most elite and talented martial artist, weapons expert and stealth assassin following his own agenda blending in with everyday people while conducting secret super hero missions for helpless beneficiaries of his choice.Evan Smoak, is among the top two elite of dozens of like governmental assassins unknown to all but their own unique handler.  While his knowledge, strength, skills and powers are phenomenal his code of rules and his ethics are stringent. His average body type and demeanor make him blend like a chameleon.  Like Clark Kent, one would not expect that this meek and mild mannered man is a superman.What happens when the agency disbands and these uniquely trained clandestine assassins are left to their own agendas or hired as underworld agents?What happens when the most skilled are pitted against each other in life or death operations?This was a very entertaining book that I would not hesitate recommending it to friends, family and anyone else who enjoys the James Bond type pace of an exciting thriller.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZU4R75DGJLR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250067847#wasThisHelpful","R2YZU4R75DGJLR","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Child is one of my favorite authors.  I enjoy listening to his books on my drive to and from work.After reading a positive review from one of my trusted cyber friends, I quickly purchased Lees Make Me performed by Dick Hill.  While waiting for it to arrive, I read another trusted cyber friends not so positive review.Having learned some time ago that they make cars in different colors because people have different tastes I hoped that I would enjoy the CD as much as my first friend did when he read and reviewed the book.  Sadly, my opinions align closer to my second friend's perspective.My biggest disappointment with this Jack Reacher mystery involves both the pace and the change in Reachers personality.The tale progressed so slowly that I became more interested in my drive than the storyline. Lee spent way too much time with detailed descriptive minutia that quickly became annoying and for the first time ever, I did not enjoy the Reacher character.The storyline was bizarre and the evil inhabitants of the town of Mothers Rest required a major stretch of the imagination to be the slightest bit believable.While the bad guys were really evil and the victims were really weird, Reacher and his new found girlfriend with benefits, ex-FBI turned private investigator, Michelle Chang both murdered bad guys in cold blood.Folks, if this is Childs new trend for the Jack Reacher novels, my best guess is that many of you will join me, going elsewhere for our murder mysteries.Obviously, even for Halloween entertainment, I cannot recommend this storyline and character behavior to Lee Child and Jack Reacher fans or for those who may be reading or listening to this authors work for the first time.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H27R1644O6YZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178771#wasThisHelpful","R2H27R1644O6YZ","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Based on Top Fifty Amazon.com Grady Harp's outstanding review on March 1, 2013 of Black Crow White Lie I ordered it immediately and could not put it down, read it in one sitting and have since read it again.This is a fictional story about a gifted child, Carson Calley who turns 14 by the end of the story while developing his ability to heal others with his hands.  He grows up in Hollywood, California, a latch keyed lad living in various low cost hotel rooms with his alcoholic fortune telling mother, Maggie who has changed her name to Juliet Bravo.Carson has no memory of his father and only knows what Juliet has told him--that his father was a war hero buried in Washington, D. C.Juliet often leaves Carson to fend for himself while she stays out late with her married boyfriend, Jackson, relying on her son's memory to piece together when she came home and what she said in her drunken state after she sobered up the next day. Carson has developed a special friendship with Benjamin Dampleson, a tall lanky albino with lavender eyes known as Casper, the proprietor of a nearby head shop.Likewise, Farris, the owner of a tattoo shop named The House of Freaks and Carson develop a father and son type of relationship.On the darker side and much to his dismay, Carson is losing his ability to control his pent up anger and has resorted to late night vandalism and associating with juvenile delinquents.On the brighter side, Carson's accomplishments and reputation as a healer builds and seems to verify his mother's stories that he is destined to be a great healer.Candi Sari has written an astonishing, griping, believable and haunting tale that will weigh heavily to the readers mind long after turning the last page.I recommend this engaging 158-page tale without reservation.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QZNUT9F9HH5H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IPJ5DI#wasThisHelpful","R3QZNUT9F9HH5H","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Not long after I bought Nutribullet blender, I misplaced one of the lids. Only two come with the product and my wife and I both take a healthy blended meal replacement to work each morning.This is my first Bullet and I did not realize that the containers and lids on the original product are smaller than the Nutribullet blender.

I enjoyed Free Fall and The Promise most recently, while waiting impatiently to dive into Suspect in my growing stack of books on deck.Private Detective Coles facetious lightheartedness and his no-nonsense friend and silent partner, Pike of the Elvis Cole Detective Agency and are joined in this engaging episode--The Promise--by intriguing new character, LAPD K-9 officer Scott James and his incredible German shepherd, patrol dog, Maggie, the stars of another fast-paced, satisfying and thrilling crime novel.At the onset, two storylines quickly converge.  Elvis is hired by the secretive and annoyingly impatient Meryl Lawrence, a senior executive for a company called Woodson Energy Solutions to find her purported embezzling fourteen year chemical production engineer co-worker, Amy Breslyn.  Meryl gave Cole three things, an old Echo Park address, plus $2,000 in cash and Amys detailed corporate personnel file.Amys only child, Jacob, a journalist was killed in a terrorist blast in Nigeria some sixteen months earlier. The Echo Park address belonged to Thomas Lerner, Jacobs closest friend.On another front, clandestine killer, Mr. Rollins is in that very Echo Park address conducting business with criminals of the worst kind when an unexpected wounded cohort being chased by police on the ground with a K-9 unit and the Air Support helicopter search lights overhead roaming the area.Elvis quickly becomes a suspect at the crime scene as he is confused with the escaping Mr. Rollins and high quality chemical explosives and the murdered fugitive are discovered at the Echo Park address.  The only witness who can collaborate Coles alibi is Scott James and his 85-pound black and tan German shepherd both of which are targeted for elimination by Mr. Rollins.Investigations continue and the puzzle begins to take shape while bodies and tensions mount, deceit and lies unveil and another exciting meandering roller-coaster adventure comes to its satisfying closure.For me, the addition of Scott James and Maggie provided another entertaining perspective to this episode in the never aging Elvis Cole and Joe Pike adventures.As usual, I was entertained by this Robert Crais creation and look forward to the next.  I bet you will too.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCYITIZNDB1SR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=039916149X#wasThisHelpful","RCYITIZNDB1SR","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Folks, I will leave it to the product page and others to provide you with all of the technical items you may want to know about this product.  If you are like me, the most important things to think about when purchasing a product like this is: (1) how hard is it to set up and (2) what else do I need to purchase to make this product worthwhile.Well, I have Comcast Cable and TV service and a Sony Television.  It has been a while since I have used an audio-video amplifier and I was a bit worried that I would have some problems hooking this product up.andwell, the instructions were not all that helpful.I went to a well-known audio video store that carried this product to find to see if I could get a good deal on speakers and I found a set I liked; however, when I looked the system up on amazon.com I found it was $150.00 less expensive there with free shipping.  The speaker wire was also a third of the price and the connectors were less expensive at amazon.  After speaking to the sales manager, they agreed to match amazon.com prices and my wife was relieved that I could take home my birthday present that day.The speakers were easy to install, as was a wireless system I used to connect the rear surround sound speakers  that eliminated the need to string wires across open spaces.I was a bit upset when I could not figure out how to connect the video portion from my cable company modem, television and the audio-video amplifier.  In the middle of the night I woke up thinking, what the heck, why do I need video, so I connected the audio from my television to the amplifier and it worked pretty well.  Then I asked myself, what I am missing?I went back to the local audio-video store and found a service employee that looked about 15 years old and asked him if he was familiar with this product, Comcast, speakers and television hookups.  He smiled and explained everything so clearly and succinctly that I felt like a Neanderthal.I asked him what the difference was between connecting the audio from the television sound jacks to the amplifier as opposed to connecting the audio-visual system.  He told me the difference is like night and day.He said to connect a HDMI ""out cable jack"" on the back of the Comcast television box to the HDMI ""in cable jack plug"" that is clearly labeled CATV on the back of this Sony Audio-Video product. Then connect another HDMI cable plug from the amplifier's CATV ""out jack"" on the back of this product to the  television's HDMI ""in cable port."".Next, he told me to then connect my DVD's ""out HDMI plug to the DVD ""in HDMI port"" on the back of this audio-video amplifier.After following these simple instructions, I turned on the television and the audio-video amplifier and an easy to set up screen appeared on my television to set up the speakers that automatically balanced the sound and connect my amplifier to the internetEASY, EASY incredibly  EASY!Following the relief I felt after discovering the ease of set up, I felt even greater joy with the quality sound emanating from this amazing system.Television, radio and cell phone music applications all produce high quality sound via this amazing system.  It is Heavenly!The theatre quality sound is astonishing. While the insulated HDMI cords are not cheap, the resulting connection ease and quality sound make this a product one that I am proud to own and delighted with the performance of this new theatre quality sound  system.If you are familiar with setting up an audio-visual amplifier or willing and patient enough to download and follow instructions or find can someone to help you install this product, you will be happy with the unbelievable sound of this amazing product.I am happy with the difference this product has brought to my listening entertainment.  I think you will be too.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIUQ7I7GXFO5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VNH97QM#wasThisHelpful","RIUQ7I7GXFO5D","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wisdom Tales provides me with quality childrens books in exchange for my honest review.  I am proud to read, review and save for my future grandchildren.The Thunder Egg by Tim J. Myers, illustrated by Winfield Coleman is a prime example. This 26 page gem is printed on quality thick acid-free paper and professionally bound, displaying beautiful artwork that enhances this story written for age 5 and up.The Afterword, Notes on the Illustrations and Bibliography provide interesting information that provides the reader with helpful information that may motivate the reader to purchase this wonderful childrens book.As her grandmother told her, Stands-by-Herself was a special child in tune with nature in the Great Plains where the big grass and sky seemed endless.She believed the Creator was a giant eagle and the egg shaped rock that she discovered the Thunderbirds offspring.In spite of being teased by the children of her tribe for her fantasies, she loved and cared for the thunder egg.As summer grew hot and dry and her people were hungry as food became scarce.Stands-by-Herself remembered the words of the holy man, Sacrifices must be made to make the world new.Accordingly, Stands-by-Herself climbs to a hill and places the thunder egg under a lone tree as and offering to please the Creator.The next day Stands-by-Herself becomes a legend when her actions bring a blessing to her people.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LGJXECHJZDK7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937786390#wasThisHelpful","R2LGJXECHJZDK7","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I feel immense joy and satisfaction discovering the talent of a debut author via an advanced reading copy that unwittingly engulfs me with a mesmerizing tale beyond my imagination.  Douglas Schofields Time of Departure is the epitome of that experience.This is not only a haunting, wonderfully paced and thrilling crime novel, but also an engaging love story that transcends time and death.While the storyline is much different; however, for me, the authors writing style has a similar flavor of my favorite cult classic screenplay Somewhere in Time, written by Richard Matheson and based on his 1975 novel, Bid Time Return.The lives of the young and talented Florida state prosecutor Claire Talbot and enigmatic former Gainesville police Detective Marcus Hasting are intertwined in the haunting fabric of this intriguing tale spanning just more than 3 decades and drawn together by a series of unsolved 1978 serial killings.This was my favorite mystery of 2015 and I boldly predict it is destined for both the best seller list and the silver screen.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCMCPEHSI0R5A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072751#wasThisHelpful","RCMCPEHSI0R5A","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pretty Is is Maggie Mitchells first novel.This is a meandering story of the bond between two women (Lois Lonsdale and Carly May) and the mysterious stranger (they referred to as, Zed) who for unknown reasons, stalked, studied, kidnapped and held them captive in an isolated cabin far from home some twenty years early when they were pretty, talented, unhappy and bored 12 year old girls from different states.Lois, a spelling bee champion prior to the event become an upstate New York college English Professor and secretly author, Lucy Ledger writing her story as if it was a fictional tale not related to her or actual event.Carly May a preteen beauty queen becomes actress, Chloe Savage living in Los Angeles who will have a part in Lois screen play.Dealing with survivors guilt and their inability to feel worthy of meaningful relationships they live separate lives with secret identities on the edge of sanity.While this genre and writing style is not my cuppa, others may find it more entertaining than I did.  I found the pace way too slow for my taste, confusing at times, somewhat melodramatic and maybe more appropriate from a womans perspective.Maggie Mitchell is without a doubt a talented and creative writer that will have a following; however, I am not a fan.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15O4DMIYXY8NP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1627791485#wasThisHelpful","R15O4DMIYXY8NP","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Bose SoundTrue around-ear headphones are a quality product that uses technology which brings rich clear music to my ears like no other brand of headphones I have ever owned.The lightweight head set comes with an attractive soft zippered case where the soft cushioned padded earcups rotate and lay flat when stored therein.From tip to tip, the 68 inch audio cable detaches from both the 2.5 mm connector that plugs into the headphones and the 3.5 mm standard connector that plugs into the musical device to be stored along with the headphones.Nearly a decade ago my wife gave me a set of Bose noise suppressing headphones that I absolutely loved.  Sadly, that set came to an untimely end when the hard wired cable attached to the headphones got caught on my desk drawer and broke the wire when I moved from my work station.  I am pretty sure that the new design with detachable audio cables from both ends will prevent that from happening again.Unlike the much more expensive Bose headphones my wife bought me in the past, this headset has an integrated microphone and remote is designed for use with my Samsung Galaxy Cell phone.  On the audio cable located 4 inches down from the headset attachment, a 3-button remote allows the user to answer and end a call, increase volume or decrease volume with the touch of the buttons.In media playback functions the Answer/End serves different functions.  It becomes a play/pause for a song or video when pressed once, a skip forward when pressed twice and a skip backward when pressed 3 times.I am extremely happy with the utility of these headphones and bet you will be too..The quality of sound is so rich and clear that I cannot imagine future problems; however, I will provide an update over time if I run into snags that change my perspective.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAKMWQPE13A0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0117RFYYG#wasThisHelpful","RAKMWQPE13A0L","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This 16 ounce Stainless Steel Travel Mug is the crme de la crme.  Its utility is perfect for my needs.  The one click button on the top is a unique feature that prevents it from spilling or leaking. It keeps coffee hot for hours, fits comfortably in my hand around the rubber grip and snuggly in the drink holder in my car. It looks great and maintains the temperature of hot or cold drinks much longer than any of the travel mugs I have used in the past.If you are looking for an inexpensive, dishwasher safe product, this one is not for you.  Like a thermos, this double walled vacuum sealed product must be hand washed.Unlike the dozen or so travel mugs that I never use, this one works well and is well-worth the price tag.The only problem I have had with this mug is the need to buy a second one.

"From the onset, you should know that I do not own an Xbox.  I am using this product with my Samsung android cell phone and computer via the standard 3.5mm headset jack and I enjoy its utility..I wear hearing aids and am comfortable with the lightweight over the ear design.While the single ear cup took a while for me to get used to, I appreciate the slotted ear cup because it allows external sounds in.  While listening to clear music on my cell phone through the headsets 40mm speaker, I have no problem hearing my house phone ring.  In-line Controls make it a snap to adjust the master volume without removing the headset or turning off the music while communicating over the landline.Likewise, when listening to music on my cell phone with the headset the music automatically stops allowing me to take the call through the headsets speaker and microphone.While this product was designed for Xbox, I find its utility perfect for my needs and will leave it to others to comment on its use with the Xbox controller.Enjoy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R164N4EEFB2BVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YXO5UXG#wasThisHelpful","R164N4EEFB2BVJ","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the past, I have purchased longer than normal charging cables so my wife can reach the power supply to charge her iPhone at work.  Her last phone got so hot that it melted the case into the back of the phone.  I really never thought about the charging cable being the cause until recently.We traded in that iPhone for an iPhone 6 and I bought her long cables for work again and finally the light went on in my sometimes pea sized brain making the connection that the charging cable was making the new iPhone hot too.So, what is the difference in this 4 foot Belkin Charging Cable compared to the others?  You guessed it!  Price!You pay more for cables that are certified to meet Apple performance standards that those that are notMUCH MORE; however, this Red Belkin MFi Certified 4-Foot Flat Lightning to USB Charge Sync Cable for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus, iPhone 5 / 5S /5c and iPod touch 5th Gen is about half the price of the replacement Apple charging cables.In my experience, there are no free lunches.  You get the quality that you pay for nearly each and every time. There is a good reason why some products are extremely cheap when compared to others.We are happy with this cord.  The red color makes it easy to find. The cord is flexible, thick, flat and durable, but the best attribute is that it charges quickly and the overheating problem is a thing of the past.I recommend this quality product with confidence and without reservation.

"This appears to be a durable and quality blow dryer that has many features, looks great and is easy to operate.  I use it to dry my hair after showering and it does a great job.My wife uses it much more than I do.  Here is what she has to say.I must confess that I have not had to purchase a blow dryer for about 10 years. I was pleasantly surprised when my husband asked me to use the Revlon 5 piece deluxe blowout set with IONIC and Tourmaline  technology. This light weigh easy to use dryer has triple ceramic coating that provides heat distribution which penetrates hair quickly and that cuts drying time.  The tourmaline ionic technology eliminates static electricity and frizz. There are three heat settings cool, warm and hot. A new feature to me is the cool shot which I find helpful for post shower hot flashes.The handle has a textured hand grip that helps with wet hands.  Also there is a round blowout brush, a concentrator attachment and two sectional clips that aid in styling your hair.  I have what I call thyroid hair, it is thin, dry and lackluster. I do find that this dryer has given my hair a little more volume and appears to me to shiner, less frizzy and less dry looking. My styling/blowout time has decreased and that allows me another cup of coffee before leaving for work. This makes me a happy lady.We are happy with this blow dryer and would recommend it to family, friends and those of you looking for an easy to use, quality blow dryer that is very functional.

"David Perlmutters book Brain Maker was recommended for me to read by a Physicians Assistant that I wholeheartedly trust and respect.  I am so glad that I read this enlightening book and recommend it without reservation to those who are concerned about their health and well-being.Perlmutter is an award winning board-certified neurologist and a Fellow of the American College of Nutrition who is concerned with curing a variety of maladies as opposed to just treating the symptoms.This is a very readable book that I found both intriguing and engrossing.  Doctor Perlmutter is an open minded physician who explains complex medical studies in terms that the average reader can understand.Many of us do not know that our stomach houses a plethora of a variety of bacteria that is called the Microbiome.  These bacteria have been around long before humans inhabited the earth.  In our gut, they are key to our health.In advanced modern Western society, it turns out that what we put on and in our bodies upset the balance of that bacteria.  Antibiotics, some medicines, soaps, shampoos, process foods, pesticides, and genetically altered meat negatively impact that balance.Perlmutter provides example after example of medical conditions that have been reversed or improved upon through change in diet, use of prebiotics and probiotics.It turns out that mental and physical maladies versus health are related more than we know to the bacteria balance in our bellies.David introduces enlightening studies and recommendations while giving hope to those suffering from a variety of conditions that can be cured or improved through eliminating the extermination of helpful bacteria and living a healthy lifestyle.The author teaches the reader how to make many of the foods that positively impact a helpful balance of healing bacteria that keep our bodies running at optimal efficiency.I like this book so much that I am not only following the recommendations and losing weight, but also purchased the authors bestselling book, Grain Brain as well as books by other authors dealing with balancing gut bacteria that promote weight loss and a healthy way of life that improves our physical and mental well-being.I whole heartedly recommend this easy to understand enlightening book that may extend your life as well as the quality of your existence.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C3ZYPF5I27DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316380105#wasThisHelpful","R3C3ZYPF5I27DG","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ortho Poison Ivy and Tough Brush Killer worked great for me in and around my flower beds.  A couple hours after thoroughly spraying it on poison ivy, weeds, grass and other uninvited floras in my flower beds I could see that this spray was going to work well.  I then waited for a couple of weeks before removing and disposing the dead vegetation. The directions say to use rubber gloves and dispose them and the dead plants in tightly sealed garbage bags and not to refill the container.Folks, the active ingredients in this pesticide work well; however, it is poison that is harmful to people and animals as well as the plants you intend to exterminate, so do not use it on or near plants that you intend to eat.The directions recommend using it on a calm non-windy day where rain is not expected for at least 24 hours.  Also, the safety instructions explain that the liquid is not safe to touch for at least a couple of hours after spraying.I do not recommend this product for use in killing weeds on your lawn.  Although it has an adjustable spray head, I learned the hard way that it kills the grass around the weeds too.This is a powerful pesticide that really works well to get rid of poison oak, poison ivy, Kudzu, woody plants, vines and brambles; however, I would only recommend it to those who read and follow the directions closely.Be safe.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R285ZLYL2ZBVSO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZSMWEO#wasThisHelpful","R285ZLYL2ZBVSO","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Over the years, I have read and reviewed many Wisdom Tales Press childrens books in exchange for my honest reviews on amazon.com. Paul Gobles Red Clouds War is one of these books.  The inside cover says it was  written for ages 6 and up; however, publication details put it in the 8 to 12 year range.Like all of their books that I have read, this 48-page, hardcover fictional tale is well-worth the price.  The quality pages are printed on acid-free paper filled with dramatic digitized illustrations and art work that capture the spirt of setting and era.Based on oral Native American history filled in with quotes of actual historical figures, fictional Lakota warrior, Brave Eagles narrates the battlefield events known as the Fetterman Fight that took place in December 1886.Civilian expansion westward infringing upon Indian lands caused an uprising.  Red Cloud met with politicians bearing gifts in exchange for peaceful passage through Oglala Sioux territory northwest of Fort Laramie through Wyoming along the Bozeman Trail to search of gold fields.Red Cloud rebuffed the disingenuous offer when it became clear to him that soldiers and scouts were already in place to build forts whether he granted passage or not.I am impressed with the quality of this book, the extraordinary artwork and the authors skill in capturing the essence of this era in history from the Native Americans perspective.I recommend it for ages 8 and up wholeheartedly without reservation.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROI613L92O11P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1937786382#wasThisHelpful","ROI613L92O11P","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ben Coes is one of my favorite authors. I was thrilled when offered this book free in exchange for my honest review.  I have read and enjoyed all of his Dewey Andreas novels and this was no exception.With the Fourth of July rapidly approaching, his Independence Day is a timely, entertaining, quick, action-packed, engrossing 502-page suspense thriller that is hard to put down.The compelling characters and the descriptive well-written tale kept me bobbing and weaving from beginning to end.The story begins with a Russian scientists young son witnessing the murder of his parents by a clandestine operative CIA agent when the Russian genius changes his mind about defecting.His life spared, the youngster grows up in an orphanage and went on to become a legendary computer hacker monitored Cloud, the ethereal millionaire genius whose life mission is to revenge his fathers murder and bring America to its knees at any cost.The one-man wrecking crew agent Dewey Andreas known for his success in impossible black ops missions suffers the loss of loved ones and experiences a loss of confidence.  Nevertheless, he finds himself the rogue last resort to thwart a nuclear attack on American soil after his formidable antagonist eliminates two teams of seasoned American agents on their find and destroy mission.In typical Ben Coes fashion, this gripping tale held me captive, entrenched and engrossed through the last page.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R169YIQTG4P0N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00H6EJSC4#wasThisHelpful","R169YIQTG4P0N2","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Last year a family friend gave my wife and me a solar butterfly for our flower pot that is a joy to watch on our deck.  I have often thought about buying more, but did not know where to get them.Not long ago I discovered this slightly different brand and ordered a dozen of them on amazon.com.They work great and are very easy to put together.  The 3 piece stakes fit together neatly. A battery compartment for an AAA battery is easy to use.  It fits into the stake and has a switch for battery or solar use.On the top is a swivel device with a wire shaped kind-of-like a horseshoe that suspends a lifelike butterfly that flutters like a butterfly and revolves in a circular route around the top of the device.My colorful butterflies are red and yellow and are mounted in flower pots mounted at the top of rails all around my deck.It is amazing how such simple inexpensive little colorful devices like this are so enjoyable to watch.

"In July of 2013 while reading Alex Kavas the Maggie ODell series action-packed thriller Stranded, the author  introduced us to an intriguing new character, Ryder Rye Creed that I hoped would his own series.I was thrilled to learn that the flawed, former marine character, who then owned a Florida based company with his partner, Hannah Washington called Crime Scent K9 is now the star of his own Alex Kava series.Ryder rescues and trains abandoned dogs like Jack Russell white terrier, Grace to track cadavers or missing people in various settings.Silent Creed is the second book in this series, but is enjoyable as a standalone; nevertheless, as soon as I discovered the Ryder Creed series, I ordered the first, Breaking Creed.The author smoothly merges two storylines involving Colonel Abraham Hess, a brilliant biologist and 55 year Army Medical doctor and our governments clandestine experimentation and use of biological and chemical weapons on friendly forces and other innocent civilians in preparation for the likelihood of an enemy attack on America using biological and chemical weapons.On the Washington, D.C. front, the four-term senior Senator Quincy from Illinois is using his junior colleague from Florida, Senator Ellie Delanor as a token woman member on a congressional committee played for voters while secretly sabotaging witnesses seeking government compensation for the disabilities they suffer as a result of clandestine government experiments.Meanwhile, in Haywood County, North Carolina a devastating mud slide has swallowed up a classified Department of Defense research facility leaving unknown hazards and a wasteland of destruction, dead and missing people in its path.Ryder was hired by his former marine nemesis, Lieutenant Colonel Logan, to search the site for 45 missing survivors or cadavers.Maggie, an FBI agent is reunited with Ryder when her boss/boyfriend Benjamin Platt assigns her to the site as a trusted agent to represent government interests.Creed and ODell work together and fight their romantic attraction to each other while they uncover clues that put them in the path of natural and contrived perils.As with her other thrilling action-packed mysteries, Silent Creed is a well-written and entertaining tale that is believable, intriguing and engrossing.The vividly descriptive settings are first-rate while the character development is fantastic.  Even Ryders intelligent dogs have interesting personalities.I can hardly wait the read Breaking Creed and the next in this riveting series!Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JDPJDA9L6UVL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399170774#wasThisHelpful","R1JDPJDA9L6UVL","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Run You Down was my first exposure to author Julia Dahl.  This 279-page novel is written from the perspective of a mother, Aviva Kagan, housekeeper and her daughter, Rebekah Roberts, a New York Tribune reporter, who do not know each other.  This tale leans heavily on Jewish terms, culture and rebellion.I found the need to take notes on the key elements to understand the interrelationships between characters, follow the storyline early on and slowly unravel this unusual, yet well-written mystery.Sam Kagan, Avivas youngest brother was sexually and mentally abused; however, silence for the sake of religion and family honor trumped justice.  His best friend since childhood, Pessie Goldin loved him as he did her; however, he discovered a man, Ryan Hall that he loved is a different way.Ryan, like Sam hated the family circumstance that he was born in.  Ryans father and brother are intolerant hatersdangerous anti-Semitic racistswho would never tolerate his sexual orientation.Pessie, married Saul Katz, a retired NYPD officer turned private inspector.The crux of this mystery centers on unraveling the circumstances of Pessies deatha suicide or murder and why--and developing relationship cultural and family relationships.I struggled at the onset, but quickly became intrigued and immersed in this unusual yet believable tale and learned a lot about the Jewish culture in the process.I recommend this author and story to those that are patient, open minded and willing to piece together a carefully unfolding mystery.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWQYQDI2RG20M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043409#wasThisHelpful","RWQYQDI2RG20M","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Recently Ohuhu sent me an invitation to receive a handful of products in exchange for an honest review. This 9 inch Survival Paracord Bracelet with Flint Fire Starter Scraper, Whistle Survival Gear was one of those products.As a first time users of this type of product, I was pretty disappointed to find the instructions and probably utility applications are all written in Chinese characters.Nevertheless, I used some survival skills of my own to search the internet for a like product with English instructions and found a product thatappears to be identical.If you are a novice, you may be asking yourself--what is Paracord? It is a military quality cord originally used as suspension lines of U. S. parachutes with a minimum breaking strength of 550 pounds with a cord diameter of about 1/8th inch.In the case of this product, when the 9 inch bracelet is unwoven it measures 9 feet of 7 woven strands contained in a nylon sheath.  Each of the 7 stands are woven from 3 finer stands that have a variety of uses including fishing line while the sheath itself could be used as a combustible fire starting source.This survival bracelet houses a steel blade in the female portion of the clasp capable of cutting the Paracord; however, its primary use is a striker to be scraped across the magnesium post housed in the male portion of the clasp.Note that the magnesium post comes painted with a black substance that needs to be scraped off first to prepare it for sparking when scraped against the steel striker.The base of the male portion of the connecting strap also houses a whistle capable of making a loud noise.If you are interested, instructions on reassembling the unwoven bracelet are available on ""Utube;"" however, it seems unlikely that a user would desire to reassemble this product given the relatively inexpensive replacement cost.To be fair and balanced, despite the lack of English instructions, I have found that this product is significantly less expensive that those packaged elsewhere with English instructions.I am happy with this useful product and wholeheartedly recommend it as a survival tool for outdoorsmen with the caveat of one doing their homework to obtain English instructions to learn its full utility prior to use.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35QJ4LJNYHDWL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OK5K8XU#wasThisHelpful","R35QJ4LJNYHDWL","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It took me about 5 minutes to mount it using a power drill/screw driver, rubber hammer and a Phillips-head bit; however, a large nail, a regular hammer and a Phillips-head screw driver might take a little longer to install but would work just as well to mark and make 6 holes into the wall suitable to insert the plastic screw mounts and attach the universal mop frame to the wall with the 6 screws that come with the product.I hang 3 microfiber mop handles, a broom and a toilet plunger from mine and use the hooks to hang washable replacement microfiber mops.What I like most about this durable product is that it provides a safe and handy easy to find location to store household tools that I prefer to keep in the garage.My wife and I are happy with this product and recommend it whole heartedly for its unquestionable utility.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SE9V6E1MGU9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SR5KWOO#wasThisHelpful","R2SE9V6E1MGU9E","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Recently, I received two unsolicited gifts from the San Francisco Salt company in appreciation for reviewing one of their products in the past.One of the two gifts is an attractive, 6 ounce Bamboo Jar with a swivel lid and a hidden magnetic locking device.

"A Fine Summer Day is the 16th and latest Inspector Ian Rutledge mystery series written by an extremely talented mother and son team writing under the pen name of Charles Todd.I have read many books in this series; however, this book presents a younger version of Inspector Rutledge set in June through December 1914 England prior to the protagonist's war time military service.If you are new to this series or a longtime fan, this is a must read. In this episode, the young Scotland Yard Inspector is assigned to several difficult cases that keeps him on the road where he is able to spend little time with his fianc and faces added pressure and little support from a demanding and unreasonable supervisor in a time of diminishing manpower as Scotland Yard loses personnel who are eager volunteering for wartime service.Ian has developed extraordinary skills connecting the dots where others have failed. He suspects a connection between vandalized graves and unsolved murders that he believes are the work of a clever adversary using the same very personal modus operandi to somehow convince unlikely suicide victims to drink deadly poison in the dead of night.  These seemingly unrelated victims from various towns are mounting.While Ian is an astute investigator, the antagonist has comparable skills.The mystery revolves around discovering the link before the killer strikes again.  Suspense builds as victims fall while the odds of identifying and bringing the perpetrator to justice are slim.The Charles Todd writing team are a joy to read.  They really know how to build suspense, develop strong and believable characters and keep the reader immersed and engaged through their descriptive well-thought out writing style.Like the many other tales in this series, I was thoroughly entertained by this spellbinding tale.  I bet you will be too.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RL6M6BMRG4TW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JTYLZI4#wasThisHelpful","R1RL6M6BMRG4TW","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have mixed feelings about Michael Sears Jason Stafford mystery suspense novel Long Way Down. It is a fast-paced action-packed thriller chuck full of twists and turns that held my interest and kept me guessing.Protagonist, Jason Stafford is an intelligent, flawed and likeable character patiently raising his autistic son, Jay.  Heather is a PhD Candidate, Heather who specializes in autism spectrum children and has a calming effect on Jay.A talented financial investor, Jason served two years in a federal prison for insider trading. Jail time enhanced his skill set with instincts and savvy street smarts that when coupled with escape and survival skills learned from his new found associate, Ben McKennas, have narrowly saved him from certain death at the hands of an army of mercenaries and assassins time after time while Stafford uses all of his skills to protect his son and his fiance, Wanda Skeli Tyler out of harms way.Jason is hired to help biofuel engineer Philip Haley, multimillionaire CEO of Arinna Labs secretly developing a clean alternative energy source by finding out who is trying to derail him by framing him for a federal crime.The closer Stafford comes to proving Haleys innocence, the greater the threat to Jasons life.The reason I have mixed feeling about this story is that toward the end, the tale begins to feel a bit forced and unrealistic, but for me, straw that broke the camels back was the unwelcomed insertion of what felt like the authors personal political agenda.  It distracted, annoyed and ruined the integrity of the story for me.To be fair and balanced, I am sure that my pet peeve is not shared by many readers who might add a star greater than my measure of satisfaction with Long Way Down.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZW9AUE94HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399166718#wasThisHelpful","R8ZW9AUE94HY","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The T.S. Shure Pictorial Map of the World is a colorful 24"" tall x 35"" wide laminated poster with a grommet in each corner, making it easy to mount on a wall with thumb tacks.While I am not likely to use the 56 illustrated stickers that come with this map, with the help of her mother, I am sure that my two year old great niece would love to place a sticker over Juneau, Alaska to mark where they live. Although the United States is not detailed enough to include Arizona, a sticker pinpointing Phoenix where her cousins live might also be fun.From an adults point of view, I am not impressed with this poster as a world map; however, from a childs perspective, it may be helpful for parents and elementary teachers to pique their interest in rudimentary world geography.The hand drawn and lettered illustrated landmarks and topography could spark playful interaction with children with a side effect of educational entertainment.When my son was a toddler, my wife and I used two interactive educational placemats to spark his interest.  One was a United States map that identified each state and its capitol city the other identified the planets in our solar system.This fun filled interactive educational entertainment was an effective source of joy during that magical time in my familys life.  Likewise I am sure that this pictorial map of the world will be useful for parents and teachers to produce an environment that is fun for children while they learn.T. S. Shure also makes a Pictorial Map of the United States.  Both of these maps would be ideal gifts for my great nieces and I bet that you can think of little ones who would be entertained by these too.Enjoy!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39RJJG7RQE3KP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLFWEDS#wasThisHelpful","R39RJJG7RQE3KP","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One Man Standing is the 6th and latest book in the Ben Blue series written by Lou Bradshaw.  I have really enjoyed this series and impatiently wait forward to the authors next episode in this creative old western saga.I would recommend that readers start with the first four books in this series prior to reading this one.  There are numerous characters developed in those books that will make this book much easier to follow.In this tale, J L Tate is further developed from previous books in this series and plays a major role in this one.  In fact, he narrates chapter 19 which start at 88% in the Kindle version where he unintentionally mirrors similarities of Bens deceased adopted brother, Andy.In this episode, a clandestine serial killer stalks and kills three victims in Patchwork, New Mexico.  One of those victims is Joe Tucker, a key character from an earlier episode.Ben Blue puts on his U. S. Marshall stare and joins local Sheriff Nelson and Texas Ranger Spade Carson who is working undercover using the name Dale Carter.  They are working together trying to find the mysterious killer who we later learn has killed 10 other victims somehow connected to a confederate prison camp during the civil war.In this episode, Ben turns to his Mexican allies with the help of Juan Domingo and Enrique, characters from earlier episodes who tell him to seek out Tomas Menendez, a village elder who has his finger on the pulse on the goings on in that community.Suspense builds and bullets fly leaving a wake of bodies as Ben and company unravel motive and connections that put him, Tate and Spade in peril against great odds against vicious killers.This was another flowing, well developed, fast-paced, action-packed, quick, easy and intriguing read that kept me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end through wee hours in the morning.This has been both an entertaining and spellbinding series that has held my interest and left me anticipating the next episode in this series.For those who like this genre, I wholeheartedly recommend this series.Enjoy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AKEXAPG6UQTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PURYG3K#wasThisHelpful","R2AKEXAPG6UQTM","A2Y8FNMWA9A1R","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Y8FNMWA9A1R?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"PROSLighter than standard, non-CNX KeensGood constructionNice lookGood finishCONS:Less support than standard KeensMinimal padding in the footbedFlimsier soleFit is slightly narrower than standard KeensThese are good shoes.  Good but not great, like my other pairs of Keens.On the bright side, the CNX line lightens up the entire weight of the shoe.  Whereas the shipping weight for my last Keens--a pair of lace up Dillons--was about 15 ounces, these weight in around 9.9 ounces, nearly 1/2 a pound lighter and you can feel the relief easily when lifting your feet.  The overall construction and production values are about equal to the standard fare Keens these days.  That is to say, Keens are not nearly as well made as they were five or six years ago and don't nearly last as long, but they are still reasonably good shoes.In terms of the fit though, the CNX line has less room in the toe box than standard Keens.  This doesn't translate into needing a larger shoe size, though, as if I sized up these would be too big.  The styling of the front of the shoe is more narrow and less flared, giving less side to side wiggle room.  The amount of leather above your toes is also a little more scant, as the dome of the toe box isn't as rounded.  This in and of itself is not necessarily a deal breaker, just not what I was expecting in a Keen.The major issue for me is the sole of the shoe.  The sole is contoured rubber with a tread pattern, and superficially looks like the old-type Keen, but is far thinner.  The thinner sole offers far less impact protection for those of us who are on our feet every day.There is padding inside, but the foam insert--though reasonably comfortable--is not as thick and protective as one might expect after buying Keens for many years.  What with the thin sole and thin padding, you can feel the contours of the ground beneath your feet.So if you are the type that use Keens at the workplace because you are running around all day, these wont afford the same kind of impact protection you are used to.  They are not bad for casual use (and that is what I use these for now, rather than work), but if your feet are tortured every day because you are constantly standing or on the run, you will feel it in your feet, ankles, and knees at the end of the day.  (The warranty on your joints seems to expire at age 30--I never felt bad with any shoe at work until after that and finding Keens was a godsend.)But, all in all, it's not a bad looking or bad fitting shoe.  The thin sole does take away a lot of weight and it does add to the flexibility of the shoe.  This is not a bad thing, once again, for casual use but it is very different from what I expected when buying a Keen for work.I can't vouch for the longevity of this pair, but if my other recent Keens are any indication they will not last as long as my original Keens.  When I first bought Keens many moons ago in 2005 or therabout, they were robust shoes that would hold up for two or even three years of hard use.  In recent years this has not been the case.  The production values and the quality of the materials have gone down (especially, I think, since the inventor of the shoe, Martin Keen, left the company).  They shoes are still of reasonable quality but the soles seem to wear down after about a year of use and the uppers don't seem to maintain support as well.  The fact that the prices have gone down over time may have something to do with this.  I sense more foreign rather than domestic production and the use of inferior materials compared to when the company was founded as the reason for this.I'm still good with this company, though, as they have a product that fits me (Keens are great for those of us with wide feet) and their products still hold up pretty well and their form tends to follow function.  But given my wide feet and padding beneath my feet, I won't be buying any more of the CNX line.In conclusion, these are more of a lightweight fare than their thicker soled, more rugged, standard Keen cousins.  I would not buy from the CNX line again, but for lighter duty and the right person, these shoes may be a good fit.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HK4R34GX4FN4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008KI855G#wasThisHelpful","R2HK4R34GX4FN4","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:Easy to useRemovable, dishwasher-safe grill platesCeramic, anti-stick finish really works wellLarger than standard sizeBack hinge adjusts to the thickness of foodClean up was easyCONS:Edges of grill not as hot as centerTemperature is not adjustableSmall power cordSimple instructionsThe George Forman Removable Plate Grill is a larger than standard size electric grill.  It works well for what it is and removable, dishwasher grill plates make it easy to clean.  It is the kind of kitchen device that only does one thing, but it does it pretty well.The grill comes packed with a drip tray and a set of instructions.  The appliance is not compact, with external measurements of approximately 16""x11""x 5"" in its greatest dimensions and weighing in at about 9 pounds.  The device is stable on a counter.  The top part is hinged at the rear, with a base that is heavy enough to prevent it from tipping backwards.  One frustrating aspect of the machine is the power cord, which is a mere 2 feet long, meaning that you better locate the grill on a counter where there is an outlet close at hand.  The production values are not what you might expect from the highest line of appliances--this does not have the precision edges of the latest iPhone.  However, the construction seems quite solid.  It is mostly constructed out of heavy duty plastic, but you get the idea that this is the type of gadget that is made to take a bit of abuse and shrug it off.  I can't vouch for the longevity, having only used it for about 4 weeks, but so far it looks like a device that will hold up for the long haul.The machine simply plugs in--there is no power switch--and heats up to temperature within 8 minutes.  You can start grilling once the green power indicator light turns on.  Food is placed on the grill plates which are angled down towards the front of the machine.  The free-standing drip tray is placed in front of the grill to catch drippings as the food cooks.  I had imagined that the drip tray might make a mess if it was moved from the front of the machine.  However, in practice this did not happen.The minimalist instruction manual gives you some idea of how long to cook a 6 ounce salmon steak, 4 ounce burger, 6 ounce, chicken breast, or 7 ounce beef steak, so that they are rare, medium, or well done.  However, these are ballpark figures and didn't seem all that accurate.  With a little experience, though, you will learn how long to cook different food items on the grill.  As advertised on TV commercials, this is easy and the drippings do come off of the food, ostensibly reducing the fat content of the food.  Quite surprisingly, meats didn't dry out and seemed to stay juicy.  Turkey burgers are always a bit more challenging than beef, as they toughen up too much if you cook them too long.  Once I got the timing right, they came out flavorful.  Even veggie burgers and hot dogs cooked quickly and easily.Both top and bottom grill plates are heated and, quite nicely, the rear hinge adjusts to the thickness of the meat.  All this allows the grill to accommodate food items that are approximately 1 1/2"" thickness and cook them rather quickly.  The weight of the top plate is enough to hold the food in place without unduly squashing it. This model does not have an adjustable temperature.  In practice, this didn't seem to make much difference for me. The ceramic coating worked as well as Teflon for me: nothing seemed to stick to it, even without the use of cooking spray.On the downside, the actual, total cooking surface is approximately 12"" x 6 1/2"".  For me, this was only large enough for two normal sized burgers (or three, slightly small 3"" burgers.  This is okay, but means that this 'oversize' version of the Foreman grill is really not big enough to quickly cook dinner for more than two or three people at a time.This is further complicated by the fact that the actual heating element is located under a metal plate and is only 9"" x 3 1/4"".  Although the edges of the grill pleads are heated by conduction, they are not as uniformly hot as the center of the plates directly over the metal heating plate.  This means that the heating is a bit uneven--food on the edges of the grill is not kept as hot as the food in the center of the grill.  You can certainly rotate food on the grill while cooking, but it is simply easier to avoid cooking at the edges of the grill, which further limits the quantity of meat that you can cook at a time.Clean up was easy, given that the plates are detachable and that the ceramic coating virtually rinsed clean.  As an added bonus, they are dishwasher safe.  As with any of these kinds of kitchen devises, there are nooks and crevices that need to be cleaned with a damp cloth, as the base cannot be submerged.  Nevertheless, detachable grill trays are really the key to a quick and easy clean up.Oddly, the company adds little value here.  The box makes a big deal about the George Foreman Weight Loss Challenge, but this amounts to 4 PDF downloads: a getting started guide, meal plan guide, very basic exercise program, and work sheets to track your progress.  That's not to say that very basic things cannot work, but the hype on the box seemed to indicate more than was delivered.  Recipes are included with a meal plan--on most days only dinner requires the use of the George Foreman Grill. (You can find more recipes for your grill on websites unofficial web pages.)One thing that is important to remember is that unlike cooking on an actual grill, the George Foreman Grill will not add a specific grill-like flavor to your food.  When you grill your burgers over charcoal and mesquite, even unadulterated beef gets that barbecue flavor.  If you are cooking on an electric grill, you will have to make sure you spice things appropriately.On the whole, I was impressed that the grill was quick and easy to use.  If you are a family of two or three, this grill might just hit the spot.  High points were that it is easy to use and easy to clean up.  The most pertinent negatives were the small grill real estate and uneven heating at the edge of the plates.Generally, this George Foreman Grill delivers what it promises to do and does it well, but it is another one-trick-pony type of kitchen gadget.  If you like cooking this way and cook this way often, it is a good investment.  If you only grill meat occasionally or like that authentic outdoor barbecue taste, you may want to skip this one.  But for the right person, this is a reasonable investment.

"At Home in Exile: Why Diaspora Is Good for the Jews, is Alan Wolfe's attempt to reconcile Jewish existence outside of Israel in the era of Zionism.  His purpose is similar to one of the principle aims of the Mondowess web site, ""To offer alternatives to pro-Zionist ideology as a basis for American Jewish identity,"" but Wolfe goes much further.  Wolfe wishes to turn around what he calls the ""more than a century old argument' that the Diaspora is 'the wrong place' for Jews to live. The book is clearly and carefully written, but will almost certainly ruffle feathers on both sides of the fence.  For some, Wolfe goes too far by deemphasizing the importance of the Jewish state and for others he will not have delegitimized Israel enough.  For me, the book was an engaging, interesting, and, at times, a painful read but was always thought provoking.The fact that the author is not at all used to writing about Jewish issues and instead of just testing the waters by getting his toes wet jumps straight into the water commando-style, makes this one worth the price of admission.  Although extremely well read, some of Wolfe's insights--especially in understanding the complexities of the religious, Jewish world--seem fresh but callow.  To be sure, the book has some very interesting and controversial ideas that are mixed in with more mundane and prosaic thoughts.  Moreover, Wolfe is a complex thinker and kicks around a lot of ideas in only 226 pages of prose.  This makes this a very difficult review to write.I can't possibly cover all the ground that Wolfe has covered, but will try to highlight some of his basic theory and what I found to be some of the more problematic aspects of the book.WOLFE'S THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELIn Wolfe's model of the Jewish world, Jews appear align themselves along three separate domains: particularism/universalism, religion, and Zionism .  The particularists are insular, only concerning themselves with internal Jewish affairs.  Particularists are only concerned with the outside world in so far as how the outside world affects the lot of the Jews.  Universalists, on the other hand, see the world as a more fluid place.  They are interested in internal Jewish affairs and but also how Jewish affairs affect the outside world.  Universalists are interested in how they can improve the greater good for the entire population, not just Jews.  The second domain is that of religiosity: Jews may either be classified as religious or non-religious.  Religious Jews see their Judaism as a reflection of their religious life, whereas the non-religious consider themselves Jews by circumstance, culture, or ethnicity.  The final domain is Zionism.  Zionists feel that Jews are cannot be complete Jews unless they live in the land of Israel.  Accordingly, Zionists may feel that it is improper, if not immoral, to criticize Israel in any capacity. The opposite of this point of view would be the non-Zionist point of view.  Non-Zionists believe that Jews can lead fulfilling lives within or without of Israel.  Non-Zionists also believe that Israel can and should be criticized along conventional, moral lines.  (Note that the opposite of Zionist, here, is not 'anti-Zionist.'  Jewish anti-Zionists may be a subgroup within the category of non-Zionists, but anti-Zionists represent only one flavor of Jewish, non-Zionism to Wolfe.  Being a non-Zionist does not require one to harbor antagonism towards the state of Israel, but at very least requires a certain ambivalence towards the Jewish State.)Hence, the original Zionists whose actions helped found Israel as a state (e.g. Hertzl, Jabotinsky, Weizmann, Ben-Gurion etc.) were particularist, secularist Zionists.  Whereas mainstream, Orthodox Jews in favor of the Israel might be described as particularist, religious Zionists.  Yet, Wolfe describes some significant players in the American Reform movement (Reform rabbis who agreed to the Pittsburgh Platform, Rabbi Stephen Wise, etc.) who can be described as universalist, religious non-Zionists.  He even points out a number of influential Israeli, universalist, secular non-Zionists.  Nevertheless, Wolfe fails to point out that there are some very insular, ultra-orthodox Jews called the Neturei Karta (Aramaic for 'Guardians of the City) who are opposed to a secular, Jewish state who one might describe as particularist, religious non-Zionists.  These may be contrasted to Wolfe and other like-thinking academicians, who are best described as universalist, non-religious non-Zionists.I suppose it is of no great surprise that Wolfe feels that the best of choice here is to be a universalist, non-religious non-Zionist. The main thrust of the book seems to indicate that this is the best way for Jews and the Jewish State to win friends and influence people.  He proceeds to make his argument along historical, emotional, and statistical lines purporting, among many things, that a secular, non-Zionist, universalism:  harbors good will; helps Jews integrate seamlessly and in comfort within the diaspora; makes complete sense in a world where, Wolfe states, there is no longer any significant anti-Semitism;  assures ethical checks and balances that will actually increase world-wide acceptance of the State of Israel; and that universalism--even at the extremes--may change what we think of as Jewish peoplehood but will not eliminate it.SOME JEWS DEFY CHARACTERIZATIONOf course there are some interesting paradoxes that Wolfe does not bring up.In spite of Wolfe's notion that there is an overwhelming dominance of Zionism within the world's Jewish population, less than one half of the world's Jewish population actually live in Israel.  And there is no indication that this will change in the foreseeable future.  There are probably many reasons for this, not the least of which is that most Jews tend to avoid the extremes within Wolfe's three dimensional classification.  They may tend towards particularism, but unless they live their lives within a single, separatist sect, also harbor inherent universalism.  They may donate large sums of money to their synagogue, for example, but they may also decide to donate money to the Jewish National Fund, the March of Dimes, or the Sierra Club as well.  They may be fervently religious, but may also immerse themselves within secular issues as well (the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive).  Jews may categorize themselves as Zionist, but that does not mean that they are blind or turn a blind eye to problems in Israel policy.  Being a Zionist, doesn't mean that you support further building of settlements or incursions into Gaza.THE DIASPORA AND JEWS--A MORE COMPLEX EQUATIONI will limit my discussion to topics where there is actual data that can be interpreted, although there are other assertions that Wolfe makes with more sociological arguments that could also be challenged.One thing that Wolfe makes clear--and this is absolutely true--is that Judaism may have preceded the Diaspora but Jews worldwide have been shaped by it.  For example, Abayou, Abdala, Barcelona, Hadad, and Tawil may not sound like Jewish names to an American ear, but they are perfectly acceptable Sephardic Jewish names, names that draw on the prevailing culture surrounding the Sephardic Jewish community.  Wolfe doesn't bother to go back this far, but the Talmudic academies of the diaspora in Sura and Pombedita (modern day Fallujah), founded somewhere around 200 BCE, were well known to have surpassed the scholarship of the Talmudic acadamies within the Land of Israel.  This is one of the reasons why the Babylonian Talmud is considered more authoritative than the Jerusalem Talmud.  Anti-Semitism of the diaspora whether in Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere was detrimental but also galvanized the Jewish people into cohesion, whether the Jews in question were religious or not.  So the argument that the diaspora has indelibly influenced Judaism is not a spurious one.But the manner in which the diaspora kept Judaism alive, the delicate balance between acceptance and discrimination, is side-stepped by Wolfe.  Wolfe purports that mixing with other ethnicities and religions does not pose a serious problem to Judaism.  He argues--quite oppositely--that intermarriage ('universalism in miniature') will bring new members into the Jewish fold.  Of course, the data from A Portrait of Jewish Americans conducted by Pew Research quite coldly contradicts Wolfe's assertion.  According to the poll, 67% of Jews who do not identify themselves as having a religion, report that they will raise their children `Not Jewish.' That is, devoid of Jewish identity. Only about 30% of those characterized as `Jews of no religion' would raise their children with some semblance of Jewish identity. This contrasts vividly with those who feel as though they are Jews by religion who raise their children with some aspect of Jewish identity 93% of the time. Moreover, 37% of intermarried Jews would raise their children as `Not Jewish.' This compares to Jews marrying other Jews, of whom 96% would raise their children as Jewish by religion.To recap: in an open society such as the United States, the Jews most likely to perpetuate Judaism are religious Jews (of any franchise) who actually marry Jews.  This contradicts Wolfe's hypothesis that secularism and universalism will keep Judaism alive, albeit in another form.  If the Pew data is correct, the future of Judaism lies in the hands of the religious and particular rather than the secular and universal.  The most secular and universal statistically fail to perpetuate cultural or ethnic Judaism effectively.  I am saddened that the Jewish population is shrinking. But the idea that the secular and universal do not perpetuate Judaism well is not so disturbing to me, as the perpetuation of a kind of genetic Judaism smacks of racism and eugenics.  However, the idea that if you wish to practice Judaism effectively as a religion, you need a commitment and shared goals with a life partner (who was born Jewish or converted to Judaism), shows a commitment to faith and a way of life that is neither racist or eugenic in nature.Along the same lines of strange interpretations of statistics, Wolfe's report of the death of anti-Semitism is greatly exaggerated. Clearly, of course, he looked over the galleys of his book well before the July 2014 and Operation Protective Edge with the subsequent protests that have taken Europe by a storm.  But perhaps I exaggerate: Wolfe warns that the particularists always believe that anti-Zionist or anti-Israel sentiments are inherently anti-Semitic. Having issues with Israel, Wolfe argues, does not necessarily mean that someone is anti-Semitic: one can be virulently anti-Israel and not harbor ill will towards Jews. At least, in theory...The problem is that if you look at the actual situation on the ground, the `anti-Zionist' or `anti-Israel' protests in Europe have overwhelmingly been anti-Semitic in nature. It is difficult to call a demonstration `anti-Zionist or `anti-Israel' when the protestors are demonstrating in front of a synagogue or Jewish museum rather than an Israeli embassy. Among the very many unfortunate events in Europe this past summer: in Brussels, four people were murdered in the Jewish museum and a synagogue was firebombed; in France, `anti-Israel' protesters tried to force their way into a Paris synagogue and targeted demonstrations in front of synagogues and Jewish owned shop; a London theater refused to have a Jewish film festival and a major London supermarket removed kosher food from its shelves because they were afraid the presence of kosher items would incite a riot; in Germany, protestors had to be prevented from attacking a  synagogue in Berlin and Molotov cocktails were thrown at a synagogue in Wuppertal.  As Deiter Grauman, president of the Center Council of Jews in Germany, stated in an interview with CBS, that it was unthinkable to hear, ""... people here chanting--a roaring mob chanting--Jews to be gassed, to be slaughtered, to be burned."" The people are chanting anti-Jewish slogans, not just anti-Israel slogans.But the universalists might tell us that we are our own worst enemy: that it was Israel's actions stirred up latent anti-Semitism.  The problem is you can't have it both ways.  If anti-Israel does not equal anti-Jewish, Jews should not be globally blamed for the actions of the Jewish State.  The Jews of Europe did not sit in on Natanyahu's cabinet meetings and decide how the Israeli army would respond to a missile barrage or when to attack Gazan tunnels.A 2013 report of a survey conducted by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (carried out between September and October of 2012) showed that almost 1/3 of European Jews considered emigrating because of anti-Semitism. The percentage in France and Hungary was 46% and 48% respectively. All this before the recent purely `political,' `anti-Israel' demonstrations. This might be discounted as simply paranoia.  An ADL poll of the general population from 2012 showed a rising anti-Semitic sentiment throughout 10 European, as compared to a similar poll conducted in 2009.  Quite interestingly, the Europeans polled reported that violence directed against Jews was felt to be a result of anti-Jewish feelings rather than anti-Semitism in 6 out of the 10 countries.  And if that doesn't clear up the ambiguity, in a rally in front of a Switzerland synagogue a woman carried a sign reading, ""Every synagogue is an Israeli embassy.""These incidents are not just about Jew baiting by 'immigrant' populations within Europe.  Native Europeans are becoming more successful with their own brand of anti-EUism, anti-immigrantism, anti-Zionism, and anti-Semitism. In Greece we have LAOS and Golden Dawn; in Hungary Jobbik; in Bulgaria the Greater Romanian Party; in Slovakia the Slovak National Party; in Wolfe's open and beloved Britain we have UKIP and the BNP.  These parties are not composed of disruptive 'immigrant' populations.  These parties are composed of native Europeans who buy into this mix of Islamaphobia, homophobia, anti-immigrant sentiment, racism, and--of course--anti-Semitism.Sadly, anti-Semitism is not dead yet.  When British former Chief Rabbi, Sir Jonathan Sacks--an accessible and moderating voice within Orthodox Jewry who Wolfe quotes frequently--wrote in the Wall Street Journal that he entered this past Yom Kippur with, ""... a degree of apprehension I have not known in a lifetime,"" because anti-Semitism has returned to Europe and, ""Never again has become ever again,""  Rabbi Sacks was not exaggerating.  This is not some particularist conspiracy theory or an over-call by European Jews that just misses the point.  It is, however, an illustration that sitting in a plush, academic armchair in the cosmopolitan, American city of Boston and declaring anti-Semitism as no longer relevant is a critical misread of the situation or at very least premature.What is interesting is that anti-Semitism also seems to shape Jewish identity. Anti-Semites see us as strangers in strange land and don't particularly want us here. They also remind us that as Jews, our fates are seen as intertwined with Israel whether we like to believe it or not. `Free Gaza' slogans (often accompanied by swastikas) have been emblazoned on synagogues and Jewish monuments world over. Even if Jews are at home in the Diaspora, anti-Semitism--overt or latent--associates Jews with Israel.  The same force that rails against Jews and Zionism actually forces Jews towards particularism and Zionism.On the bright side, I am happy to agree with Wolfe that this not the Europe of the 1930s. Governments are lending police protection and taking steps to prosecute protestors who vandalize or become violent. Additionally, prominent government officials in all these countries have harshly criticized anti-Semitic protestors and in some cases (such as Angela Merkel of Germany) taken part in rallies against anti-Semitism. Still, it is crystal clear that the undercurrent of anti-Semitism still exists in Europe. It has not gone away.SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTSAs with many hot-button topics, there are very few Jews who haven't already addressed this issue and made up their mind already.  To think about it another way, approximately 6 million Jews live in Israel, which is still less than half of the world's Jewish population. Particularist or univeralist, religious or non-religious,  Zionist or non-Zionist, Jews in the diaspora do not seem to have a problem living outside of Israel and it's not as though they haven't thought about it.In this respect, this book doesn't have much of a captive audience: Wolfe's arguments are inherently secular and non-Zionistic in nature.  It is difficult for me to see that the book will be considered very seriously by the bulk of religious and secular Zionists, who will discount Wolfe's arguments out of hand.  (This doesn't mean, however, that they will not use Wolfe's arguments as a foil.)  Additionally, the book will have little impact on Jewish anti-Zionists, who already firmly agree with Wolfe's premise and do not require nuanced arguments as they too have already reached their conclusions.  So the book may definitely cause a brief kerfuffle within Jewish circles, but is unlikely to start a serious debate.It will appeal, however, to a narrow stripe of academics who, in spite of already being set in their opinions prior to reading the book, still like discuss these kinds of things.  This is a pity, however, because the major purpose of a book such as this is not so much to strike up controversy as to strike up a real, intellectual conversation about a pivotal issue.  This is why I still hope that Wolfe's book will garner a larger audience.  What Wolfe discusses herein are largely articles of faith within the academic community and within the larger Jewish community.  Intently reading this book may not make much of a difference in terms of one's own conclusions about Zionism and the diaspora.  However, it will help the reader place the opinions of others into context.  This might not open the floor for a true debate, but I do have hope that it could open the door to true dialogue.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38IMZT2Z04C9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0807033138#wasThisHelpful","R38IMZT2Z04C9U","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the early 1900s exhibiting humans to be gawked at as thought they were animals was a common practice in side shows at fairs and amusement parks.  In her book, The Lost Tribe of Coney Island, Claire Prentice brings to life the story of the Igorrotes, a Filipino tribe imported to the United States for the purposes of such an exhibit, and describes their fate in a compelling and sensitive manner.A group of Igorrotes had been a popular attraction at the 1904 St. Louis Exposition in 1904.  The manager of the Igorrotes for this short exposition was a Dr. Truman Hunt, who had lived in the Philippines amongst the Igorrotes and knew them well.  Given the success of the exhibition, Hunt switched hats from medical doctor to impresario and decided to bring a group of Igorrotes back for an extended tour of the United States.  Hunt would pay the Igorrotes monthly more than they could make for a year of work in the Philippines and in return he would get the lion's share of the profits from the tour.For a short while, things seemed to go as planned, but rather quickly it all unhinged.  Truman would end up keeping the Igorrotes in America for well over the agreed upon year, exploiting them,  and would end up extorting their money.  To make matters worse, Truman was not only duplicitous, he also had major skeletons in his closet.Prentice takes us through the Igorrotes American journey which started with promise but eventually descended into madness.  Using a multitude of primary and secondary sources from the time, Prentice puts this amazing journey into the context of the times.  She documents Truman's descent from impresario to shameless promoter to charlatan to petty criminal.  Prentice not only confronts the inherent racism of the day but is also able to highlight the humanity of the Igorrotes.  The narrative makes the reader question the notion of civilization, as the 'primitive' Igorrotes come out in the end as far more measured, rational, and fair than their American hosts.  She highlights the heroes, who try to chase Truman down and bring him to justice, as well as the villains.Although there are plenty of lessons to be learned from this small slice of history, Prentice is never pedantic.  She paints a clear and honest picture of the Igorrotes without being insultingly sentimental and avoids being overly judgmental of Americans in the early 1900s. (There were those in the government who wanted justice for the Igorrotes, but they were few and far between and there was, at most, only a tepid response from the public, who would have been outraged at the treatment of the Igorrotes had racism not figured into the picture.)The book does sag a bit in the middle, as the Igorrotes wander about North America, but in general Prentice is otherwise engaging throughout the narrative.  The writing style is more journalistic than historical, but this treatment works well for a story such as this.All in all, the book was a fast, easy, and educational read for me.  Prentice brings the turn of the last century to life in all its glory and ignominy--a virtually unknown chapter in American history that we can still learn something from.  Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQMR3B4W93S9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=054426228X#wasThisHelpful","RQMR3B4W93S9U","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Scandal, sex, secret lives, coverups, drugs, murder, blackmail, outlandish parties, and stars behaving badly sure sound like the hallmarks of our modern-day superstars.  But long before the deaths of Natalie Wood, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G, and Marylin Monroe and long before the shenanigans of Mel Gibson, Lindsey Lohan, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and their ilk, trouble was brewing in Tinseltown.As William J. Mann attests to, in his brilliant book, Tinseltown: Murder, Morphine, and Madness at the Dawn of Hollywood, the stars were wreaking havoc in Hollywood from its very beginnings.  Mann's book vividly recounts the unsolved murder of film director William Desmond Taylor in 1922, and follows the trails left by three significant women in his life.Mary Miles Minter, Mabel Normand, and Margaret 'Gibby' Gibson were all movie actresses and were all connected to Taylor at the time of his death.  They, and their host of colorful associates, were all considered suspects at the time.  Taylor and each of these woman all had their own checkered pasts and secrets that Mann brings to life in his thorough history that reads like a thriller.Along with the murder mystery, Mann serves up an excellent and detailed description of the nascent film industry.  Although it is difficult to imagine at this point, the jump from nickelodeons to movie theaters led to an explosive growth in the business of motion pictures.  Similar to the .com boom in the late 1990s, this business was speculative but offered the potential for astronomical profit for those who succeeded.  Those who succeeded, however, became incredibly wealthy.  And the very wealthy always have a need to protect their investments.  If that meant being unscrupulous and trying to sweep a scandal under the rug, so be it.Mann not only has a knack for narrative, he also vividly describes the various characters involved in the plot.  Moguls like Adolph Zucker (founder of Paramount Pictures), Marcus Loew, Louis B. Mayer, Samuel Goldfish, and Archibald Selwyn dominated the market by both making movies and building movie theaters in which to view the movies in.  These moguls and movie companies had a vested interest in keeping the movies squeaky clean, by keeping scandals under wraps.  Mann brings color to these black and white moguls and their stars and is able to pop them out of the celluloid and into three dimensions.Mann's research is also meticulous: Mann scoured through studio files, transcripts, newspaper reports, listened to recorded interviews, weather reports, movie footage, and clearly went on location to view the murder scene and other sites so that he could describe them in such detail.  In spite of the complexity of the case and the sheer number of characters involved, Mann's narrative is always clear and I was never confused as to where things were going.For some readers, the extensive descriptions of old Hollywood, the studio system, side stories (for example the Fatty Arbuckle murder trial), and details about early movie censorship  and blackmail scandals may be too much for some readers.  However, I  felt that all this material was relevant, engaging, and had a true impact on the murder case.  For my part, I read this all with rapt interest; however, it might be a bit much for someone who is not a film buff.Additionally, this was my first exposure to the story of the murder of William Desmond Taylor.  Those who are more familiar with the case (there is an incredibly detailed website devoted to this case) may quibble with Mann's handling of some of the details.  There were actually even more people involved in the investigation than the many who are noted in Mann's book and there are clearly differences in opinion regarding the sequence of minor events.That said, this book is a sheer pleasure to read.  These were some of the fastest and most engaging 428 pages of prose that I have ever read.  It is one of the few non-fiction books that I just couldn't put down.  Highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LTD0O0G2BOXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242164#wasThisHelpful","R3LTD0O0G2BOXW","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROSGood soundValue for the priceAugmented bass and crisp treble works for most pop musicComes with three sizes of eartips50 inch cord3.5 mm jackCONSCannot handle large dynamic rangeVery muddy or missing midrange soundsPoor for classical music, jazz, or more complex musicSo-so build qualityEartips are difficult to exchangeThis one nabs 4 stars because you are not going to get a better set of earbuds at this price ($6.99 at the time of this writing) anywhere but amazon.  The sound quality is mediocre is you compare these to the latest Beats cans (>$300) or even my middling Altec Lansing MZX652s (~$70), but you can't expect perfectly balanced sound for around seven bucks.  Obviously, you cannot expect audiophile performance at this price, but for earbuds in this range, the Amazon pair delivers.Inside the box, you will find the earbuds themselves and 3 sizes of noise isolating silicon eartips.  The earphones are simple, generic-looking things.  The housing is shiny black with simple white letters for 'R' and 'L.'  The silicon eartips and the rubbery, plastic cord are in a dull black finish.  The length of the cord from buds to plug are a generous 50 inches. On inspection the cord isn't the most durable.  It is thin and you get the sense that it's not up to taking a lot of torture.  The earbuds are able to be interchanged, but this isn't something you'll want to do a lot.  They are easy to remove--just pull.  But replacing the new eartip is a bit of a challenge.  You have to turn the flange inside out and try to push the flimsy, narrow connecting end on to the receiving end on the earpiece.  It takes some trial and error but is doable.The 3.5 mm jack might be a turnoff to an audiophile--they'll want a 1/4"" audio jack for high end sound.  But given the price and given that these buds are strictly meant for light travel and the mp3-iPod set, this is actually not an issue here.The sound is in the solid to good range.  The buds are meant for pop music and deliver a crisp treble and pretty good (and loud) bass.  Played at a moderate volume, there are few problems, but if you turn up the volume the treble still can get a little tinny and deep bass seems to bottom out.For the most part, though, if you are mostly listening to a typical 4 or 5 piece pop band, you'll still hear the best of the lead guitar, lead singer, drums, and the boom of the bass.  If you want to think of it in terms of the Beatles, this is a fine headset to listen to 'Come Together' (even the awesome Aerosmith version) but not so much with 'I am the Walrus' (even the quirky but amazing Zappa version).The major problem with the sound quality, though, is that you are missing a lot of mid-tones and what you get in the mid-range is pretty muddy.  This makes these buds particularly unsuitable for jazz and classical music.  There's just too much going on the mid-range here and the bass is out of proportion to the treble.  Jazz listeners will not be all that satisfied here as you'll miss a lot of layering in the sound.  Mingus' Moaning just sounded... well, too much like moaning.  You only hear lows and highs and there's a hollowed out mess in the middle where a lot seems to be missing.  Even fooling with a software equalizer didn't make the sound any better.  Classical music is equally a mess.  Mozart's 25th in G Minor came across as too flat and bland and in forte sections you only hear the top and bottom well.  Brahm's Rhapsody in D Minor (solo piano) just sounded--well bad. The earbuds just couldn't take the dynamic range of the piano without losing the middle and fraying during the forte.All-in-all, though, you won't get a better pair of buds at this price.  You won't get audiophile quality but for in-the-pocket, mp3 listening you could do far worse.  There's a lot of value packed in here, given the low price, which makes these definitely worth the price of admission.  Not for the audiophile, but recommended for the casual listener.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25GO3FODH84MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L3KSKYY#wasThisHelpful","R25GO3FODH84MO","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"LEGO Architecture: the Visual Guide by Philip Wilkinson in collaboration with Adam Reed Tucker, is an elegant coffee table book that displays all 22 of the LEGO Architect and Landmark Series--LEGO models of masterpieces of world architecture from 2008 to present.The book starts by introducing the Architect Series of models and describes the goals of the artists.  There is a timeline that shows when each model kit was introduced, brief profiles of the artists, an overview of the creative process, and a visual glossary of lego parts.  There is also a handsome two-page 'cityscape' where photographs of all the models were placed side by side to make a LEGO skyline.The format of the chapters on each building is pretty simple: generally, each kit is introduced with a large photograph of the completed model itself, a quick blurb about the reason for the choosing the building and the LEGO artists approach to building the model, and a side box with a small picture of the actual building including baseball-card style statistics.  The second part is devoted to a display of the model at different angles, with text that highlights important features. Often, there is also a mock up of the box.  The third section is an exploded view of the building that gives you an appreciation of how the it is constructed. Finally, there is a section devoted to pictures of the actual building with highlights describing the architect, the intended vision of the architect, innovative features of the building, and often a description of how it fits into the surrounding landscape.The photography of the models is superb.  This is especially true of the exploded view of the building.  This really gives you an idea of how the models were conceived.  Whether they are more schematic or more detailed, this view really gives you an idea of the genius of the LEGO model builders and a real appreciation of the art that goes into translating a brick and mortar building into a plastic LEGO kit.The lead LEGO artist in the architecture series is Adam Reed Tucker himself.  He designed 11 out of the 22 kits, with Rok Agolin Kobe designing 10 models (at least one in conjunction with Jorn Kristian Thomsen), and  one (Villa Savoye) designed by Michael Hepp.As with any endeavor, some models are more successful than others.  Some are highly schematic (such as the Willis Tower or the John Hancock Center) and some are far more detailed,such as Fallingwater, the Robie House, or the Imperial Hotel.  Realize, however, that these models were actual kits that were to be sold to the public: the artists couldn't use infinite numbers of LEGO bricks to construct the models.  Fewer bricks meant that compromises had to be made in terms of realism.  The curved roofs of Sungnyemun Gate would have to be flattened, the Guggenheim would lose some of its sloping curves, and the concavity of Marina Bay Sands would have to be squared off.  The goal, however, was that in spite of those compromises, the final model had to be instantly identifiable as the building it represented.  Overwhelmingly, the artists were successful in this.The models are truly beautiful things to behold and the expert photography makes them pop.  As an added bonus, you get a brief overview and history of each building.  Granted, this is not architecture text book, but if you enjoy LEGO and beautiful buildings this one's for you. Although not made specifically for children, this book might serve as edutainment for a child that is already interested in LEGO but hasn't even thought about architecture.Kudos have to go out to the art director Lisa Lanzarini and design manager Ron Stobbart for putting together such a beautiful and visually engaging book.  The layouts are stunning and do justice to the buildings.  Sadly, I was able to find credits for the photographs of the actual buildings but could not find credits for the brilliant photographer(s) whose stunning images of the LEGO buildings really make the book worthwhile.Finally, this book succeeds brilliantly on the coffee table.  Sure, it has that big-picture-book attraction, but the fact that it's  LEGO-art gives it that quirky, never-quite-seem-something-like-that, intellectual-fun quality that just makes guests want to pick it up and open it.  Just the type of conversation piece that a coffee table book should be.  Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37BMXGQGOZNY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1465422862#wasThisHelpful","R37BMXGQGOZNY7","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"[FULL DISCLOSURE: I received a device from LifeCHARGE so that I could do this review. Note, however, that the review was not vetted with LifeCHARGE prior to posting and my opinions of the device are based on my experience with it over the past couple of weeks.]PROS:Mat based charging (no need to plug phone in)Adds 2200 mAH battery so you never run out of power during the dayHigh production valuesExcellent fit and finishStylish caseConverts lightning port to more common microUSB portCan charge or synch with iTunes through microUSB portProtective lip around front of case is tall enough to protect the screen from scratches when placed face down on a counterBuilt in overcharge protectionIncludes extender cable for recessed headphone jack portCONS:Adds weight and heft to your iPhoneRecessed headphone jack port, requiring included extender cable for most headphone jack accessoriesSomewhat deep reach for ring/silent switchHeats up when charging phoneBack of the case is smoother than the sides and not so grippymicroUSB out has its advantages, but is not compatible with most iPhone-centric accessoriesUSB wall plug not includedQUICK OVERVIEWThe LifeCharge InAir Power Case is fine case for your iPhone 5S that will more than double your air time.  It can be charged either via USB or via the included mat, protects the iPhone as well as any back case, and has high production values.  The major compromise with this case is that it makes the iPhone larger and heavier.  However, for those who need the extra battery life it works incredibly well.INSIDE THE BOXInside the box you will find the case itself, charge mat, a micro-USB cable, an extension cable for the headphone jack, and a set of instructions.USING THE CASEAfter aligning the lightning connector, the phone easily snaps into this one-piece case. This is a back-type slip-in case, so the front of the phone is completely exposed.  Back-only cases generally offer little front screen protection.  However, unlike many, the InAir Power Case has a nice rubberized lip around the entire phone that can protect the screen from scratches if the phone is set face down on a counter.  I have one of those thin, glass screen protectors on my phone and even with this in place the lip is high enough to prevent direct contact.PORTS AND SUCHIn the front there are vent holes for the bottom facing microphone and speaker.  Note, there is no muffling of sound during phone calls and I have not noticed any distorted or decreased sound with ring tones or when playing back music over the native, iPhone speaker.On the bottom of the case, you will notice that the lightning jack has been replaced with a microUSB port and that the native headphone jack is visible, but is now quite recessed.  The transition from lightning port to USB is probably a good one.  MicroUSBs power most handhelds and accessories nowadays and the cables are much cheaper than lightning cables, so I absolutely respect the choice made by the LifeCHARGE designers.  In testing, I was able to charge and synch to iTunes at native speeds through the microUSB port on the case.  The downside of the microUSB port is that if you have iPhone specific accessories (a speaker laden dock, video out cable, or credit card reader, for example) that rely on the lightening connector, you will have to remove the iPhone from this case to use them.  The recessed headphone jack is more problematic: they do supply you with the extension cord, but it's inconvenient to have to carry around an extra piece of equipment so that you can connect to peripherals.The left side of the case has a nice rubberized cover for the volume controls that works perfectly.  The ring/silent switch has a cutout, which means digging in a bit to switch this on or off.  The cutout is generous enough, but it's still a bit difficult to switch on and off if you have larger fingers without long nails.  The rubberized cover of the on/off switch on the top, perfectly aligns and is easy to use.The back of the case has a generous, oval cutout for the camera and flash.  It is large enough that the case does not obscure the flash and there is no visible framing of pictures.  The back has the look of faux leather and there is even faux stitching on the periphery. Rather than looking cheesy, this gives the case a rather classic appearance. I would have preferred if the back of the case had the same grippy feel as the more rubberized sides.  It is a bit slippery, but otherwise felt fine in the hand.  There are two, tiny, widely spaced metal contacts on the back.  There is also a button at the bottom to activate charging the phone flanked by four, tiny, blue LEDs that indicate the charge level.CHARGING/BATTERY FEATURESThe major feature of the case is the integrated battery, which can either charge on a mat or via the microUSB port.  The case is not exactly an induction charging case, as the phone is not charging due to a magnetic field.  Instead, there are two exposed contacts on the back of the case that align with the two metal plates on the charge mat. But given that the contacts are tiny and that the metal plates are quite large, you don't need any specific aim.  You just plop the phone on the mat and it charges.  No fuss, no muss.The mat itself weighs only about 2 ounces and is 4 7/8"" x2 13/16"" x1/4"".  It is a simple plastic affair with to large, smooth, silver contact panels on the front and rubberized feet at the bottom so that it stays in place.  It connects via a microUSB cable (included) and can connect to any USB power source.  Note, however, the company did not include a USB wall plug.  The phone easily rests on the panel face up.  So long as the two metal and you can note that the phone is charging when you see a little blue light escape from the underside of the charge case.  This is enough to let you know the phone is charging but is faint enough that it will not prevent you from sleeping at night.I am still surprised at how much I really enjoy charging on the mat. It's not that pluggin in a cable is really such a pain, but just placing the iPhone on to the case without having to push a cable into place is completely effortless and is somehow liberating.  Even more liberating was the 2000 mAh battery capacity.  The native iPhone 5S battery is only 1560 mAH, so the iAir more than doubles your capacity.  The iPhone battery is supposed to last for `10 hours of talk time,' but in real time use with extensive use of LTE or GPS etc., your iPhone 5S will lose power more quickly.  I'm lucky to eek out a days worth of iPhone time if I don't charge the thing at lunch.  With an extra 2000 mAh at the touch of a button, my days of worry are over.Note that when you set the case on the mat, the case will completely charge your iPhone first, before it charges the case's own internal battery.  Also note, that the battery has overcharge protection built in.The battery does not just kick in when the charge on the phone is below a certain percentage (this might be a nice feature to add to the next generation of LifeCHARGE cases).  You have to manually push the back button and hold it in and you're iPhone will start to charge.HEAT WITH CHARGINGThe battery heats up when charging.  This is a perceptible, but not overwhelming, amount of heat. The iPhone 5 itself can generate a fair amount of heat when you use the GPS features or a lot of LTE.  The warmth you feel with the charging is similar to this.  The case doesn't have great ventilation per se and I had concerns--especially in the heat wave we've been having--that the phone might overheat, but it didn't.  (My iPhone 4 would sometimes overheat and shut itself off when it was on GPS for prolonged amounts of time, but I have never had a problem like this with my iPhone 5S and certainly not with this case.)SIZE AND HEFTOne of the reasons you might have bought the iPhone 5S in the first place is because Apple is able to fit an amazing amount of hardware into an impossibly small space and light form factor.  Apple tries to make the iPhone as svelte and light and possible and when you add a battery case--this one included--you definitely add to the heft factor.The case adds about 3 ounces in weight, increasing the total weight to about 7.5 ounces.  This is a whopping 40% increase in weight.  The case also increases the total dimensions of the phone to 5 3/8"" x 2 1/2"" x 1/2"", up from the native dimensions of 4 3/8"" x 2 1/4"" x1/4"" (about a 37% increase in volume, for those who like these kinds of calculations).  You will definitely feel the difference in hand and in your pocket.  It's almost like having a Galaxy Note 3 or Lumia 1520 in your pocket, without the advantage of a larger screen...There are no two ways around it: you will compromise your iPhone's svelte figure and light weight by adding this (or any) battery case.  The thing is, we do this kind of thing all the time.  Apple works hard to give us the highest quality screen with vibrant colors and retina resolution... and to save our investment we cover it with a screen protector that blurs the resolution and washes out the colors.  We buy Otterboxes to protect our iPhones from drops up to 6 feet, but then make it larger than starter Android phones from 3 years ago.Sure, the iPhone will now be solid in your pocket.  But if you need power like I do, you won't care.  If you want to go out on the town for some haute cuisine and need your iPhone to slip effortlessly into your suit's breast pocket, don't use this case--fully charge your iPhone and buy a simple case (or let your iPhone go commando).But if you are doing a days work and truly need the power, this case will bring it.  No more carting cables wherever you go, charging in the car between locations, or hooking the phone up at your desk at lunch.LONGEVITY:I cannot vouch for the longevity of the device, as I have only used it for about 2 weeks. If there are any significant problems in the future, I will post them.CONCLUSION:Although it definitely adds heft to my iPhone, this case is a winner.  For a back-type, snap-on case, it adequately protects the iPhone, it can charge via a mat, and it more than doubles the battery life of my iPhone.

"Cathedral of the Wild, by Boyd Varty, is a memoir about growing up on a nature preserve in the South African bush.  It is a wildly interesting tale told in short vignettes by a master story teller.  The book really shines in the last 100 pages, where adversity strikes in the idyllic African Bush.I first learned of Boyd Varty when I was quite randomly came upon his TED talk while surfing the net.  Varty had spoken at TED after hearing about the death of Nelson Mandela, a Varty family friend.  Varty's talk was not only starkly honest and heartfelt but he really wove together the many difficult issues in South Africa with his own life's work--nature conservation and education--in an incredibly eloquent and passionate way.  When I saw his book offered on my Amazon Vine list, I grabbed it.The book is written as a series of vignettes that cover the founding of his family's Londolozi Private Game Reserve from its beginnings, as a family hunting ground, to its present incarnation, as a luxury nature preserve where the safaris are for tourists and the hunting is done with cameras instead of guns.  The place was founded on Varty's grandfathers' love of hunting and nature.  Londozoli's fate was sealed when Varty's father and uncle noted a decline in native animal species, decided two switch gears, bring the land back to its natural state, and bring back the animals.  A private nature reserve was a very strange notion at the time, but the Varty family's activism and deep love of the land has motivated them to replicate the Londolozi experience elsewhere.  The Varty's were also antiapartheid activists and they always hired and interacted equally with the local Shangaan tribe.  This is why Londolozi was chosen as one of the first places Nelson Mandela went to recover when he was released after 27 years in prison.The first third of the book is devoted to interesting stories about the founding of Londolozi and growing up in the wild, African bush.  Given that most of us have never experienced this kind of life, it is inherently interesting material. However, encounters with elephants, leopards, hippos, crocs, and other bush staples can't alone buoy the narrative and there is a limit to how far you can go describing the humorous crises that can occur when running a luxury nature preserve.  Still, Varty has a knack, however, for telling a good story and his writing style is incredibly rich.Still, the nearly idyllic bush life and the growth of Londolozi from a raw sketch of a park to a major, luxury safari compound can only go so far.  About two-thirds of the way into the book, I was really wondering whether this was going to turn into a 300 page promo for Londolozi.  But, thankfully, it didn't.As Varty grows up the perils of his family increase as they are beset with a number of tragedies.  Whereas the first part of the book recounted the halcyon days of Londolozi and Varty's youth, the last third of the book is gripping as the Varty family is gripped by adversity, and the legendary mettle that Boyd Varty described at the beginning of the book is tested.  Both Varty himself and his family seem frighteningly rudderless for a while, until they are able to get themselves back on track.There are certainly controversies that don't quite come to the surface in this book.  Varty's uncle John, is definitely a controversial figure with his unorthodox methods of filming nature documentaries and his more recent tiger preservation project. (The endangered tigers are on a preserve in Africa, where they are a non-native species. The idea being that they will be allowed to thrive on a preserve and later reintroduced to Asia at some point as the tiger population dwindles.)  On the one hand, the Varty's ecotourism model has served nature well, but--I imagine--it has also served the Vartys well and there are those who might contest their conservation as entrepreneurship.  At very least, nature is preserved for only those who can afford to pay to see it.  The Vartys certainly provide a living for the many Shaangan that they hire, but there's still an Apartheid cloud that hangs overhead, as blacks, as a rule, did not own land under Apartheid.  Even now, nearly 70% of land is owned by the white population and about 25% is owned by the state (15% 'black communal areas' and 10% 'other state land'), according to the latest figures I could find from PLAAS.Still, it's hard to make a mark in this world without stirring up some controversy.  And it's hard to fault the Vartys for wanting to make a living; and if they do so and at the same time save the planet I'm all for it.  Moreover, the Vartys were white, antiapartheid activists when such a thing was not only rare but dangerous, and they continue to act as activists when it comes to racial equality and conservation.  They also have been instrumental in creating an organization that brings education to the poorest of South Africans.  They may be controversial, but even after a little research it is clear to me that this remarkable family does what they do with a pure heart.Boyd Varty's book really gave me an appreciation for what it was like to grow up in the bush and the need for activist conservation using unique and sustainable models.  It is a worthwhile and interesting memoir and a great read.

"A Spy Among Friends, by Ben Macintyre, is a fascinating look at the life of Kim Philby, brilliant charmer, doting father, scion of the British establishment,  and one of the most successful Soviet moles in the British secret service.Macintyre traces Philby's life from boyhood growing up in the shadow of his father St John Philby, an accomplished writer, explorer, British ambassador, and intelligence officer; to his schooling at the Westminster School and Trinity College at Cambridge; his days as a reporter; and finally his rise and demise in MI6, the British intelligence service.Philby was a communist sympathizer during his college days and was recruited to become a Soviet agent by first wife, Litzi Friedman, in the 1930s.  As a newspaper reporter in Spain at the time of the Spanish Civil War, he was able to feed information to the Soviet Union.  He was encouraged by the Russians to give over sensitive information regarding German troop movements to ingratiate himself to the British.  Eventually, this helped Philby segue into a position as a British secret service agent.  By 1939, the British had entered the war and Philby was recruited by MI6 after he, ""dropped a few hints here and there,"" to the right people.Macintyre is able to weave together the diverse elements of the story and present a compelling narrative that reads more like a thriller than a history.  He gives just enough background so that the reader can understand context, but does not let it get in the way of the narrative.  He uses the parallel life of Nicholas Elliot--Philby's best friend, classmate in Trinity College, and fellow spy who eventually became a director at MI6.Macintyre skillfully explains how Philby's subtrefuge.  How Philby was able to truly live a double life; how he ingratiated himself to the higher ups in MI6, all the while feeding huge amounts of sensitive information to the Soviets. Philby was able to hide in plain sight, using his incredible charm, social position, and by playing on the existing friction between the two major parts of British intelligence (MI6 and MI5, roughly the equivalent of the CIA and the FBI in the United States), .  Even as overwhelming amounts circumstantial evidence compounded, Philby's circle of friends--including Nicholas Elliot and James Angleton, counter intelligence chief of the CIA--continued to protect him.One major shortcoming of the book is that there is a certain sterility to the narrative, as Macintyre does not appear to use any living, breathing sources of information.  He relies  almost solely on secondary sources of information. You don't quite realize what you are missing until you read John Le Carre's afterword.  Le Carre basically recalls a number of meetings he had with Nicholas Elliot before Elliot passed away.  He quotes extensively from Elliot and within the span of 14 pages you realize that although Macintyre does an adequate job of describing Elliot, Le Carre's descriptions and quotations really help you understand the essence of who Elliot was.  Sure, most of the players of that time period--including Philby himself--have died. However, there are plenty of people who are alive today that knew him and whose more intimate knowledge of Philby might have allowed Macintyre's already rich description of Philby (and others) to pop out of the page.Nevertheless, I found this book to be a gripping and engaging read.  More like a spy novel than a history book, it fleshes out a dark and embarrassing period in the history of British intelligence.

"***UPDATE (10/1/2014): I have bumped up the review back to 3 stars.  I had a few go-rounds with Mr. Coffee customer support via email but they did, in the end, agree to take the French Press back to determine what was wrong with the defective button and offered to replace the item.  As my French Press was received as a demo model to review on Vine, I did not ask for a replacement.  This was not the smoothest customer support I have ever received--it took about 2 weeks for a resolution--but in the end Mr. Coffee did the right thing.  As far as I know only one other reviewer so far had problems with the button.  Once again, it is not clear to me whether this was a problem with the demo model or a more pervasive problem with the product line, but I have to give kudos to Mr. Coffee for standing behind their product. (I will leave the rest of the review unchanged.***NOTE (9/15/2014): In light of present problems, I cannot recommend the Mr. Coffee BVMC-FPK33 at this time. I initially posted this as a 3 star review and because of developing problems I have now downgraded it to a 1 star review.  Initially, the temperature/start button simply stuck occasionally and needed to be wiggled a bit to be activated.  After 3-4 weeks of regular use, the pot is now temperamental and only intermittently works.  I am in the process of contacting Mr. Coffee customer support and, depending on the answer I get, I may increase the star rating back to the original 3 star rating. It may be that my demo model came from a bad lot of coffee pots, but I can only judge the product in the basis of my present experience. I will leave the rest of the review unchanged until I hear back from Mr. Coffee.***PROS:StylishBoils 1 liter of waterNo loss of coffee temperature while brewingFrench press parts are easy to disassemble for cleaningAnti-boil dry detection for safetyKeep warm function for three temperatures 112, 160, and 195 FCONS:After 3-4 weeks, the kettle only intermittently works-->as above contacting customer supportNo cup measurement linesNo grips to remove lid after boilingSticky temperature buttonMy old standby hot pot can boil up 1.7 liters of water with nearly the same counter footprintNeed to clean the carafe and (take apart and clean) the filter apparatus if you have used the press to brew one kind of beverage and then want to use it for hot water or another beverageQUICK OVERVIEW:The Mr. Coffee BVMC-FPK33 2-n-1 is a combination electric hot water kettle and French press.  The pot functions as expected in terms of boiling water but the French press function is not necessarily as convenient as I would have thought.  I have enjoyed using the press but do have some reservations about whether combining a hot pot and a French press is the best way to go.  The major plus of making French press coffee in this apparatus is that you don't lose heat during the brewing stage.  The major disadvantages--and the reason for a lower star rating--are the awkwardness of pouring coffee grounds directly into hot water, the fact that the device is electric which makes cleaning a little more of a challenge, and an intermittently sticky center button.THE APPARATUS:In the box you will find the base, the hot pot itself, and the lid with the integrated French press apparatus.  The coffee pot is quite stylish, with modern aluminum accents.  At the bottom of the hot pot, you will find the temperature control button.  Most of the inside of the carafe is made out of tempered glass, but the exposed hot plate on the bottom is metal.To use the hot pot, you basically fill it with the desired amount of water and press the center button.  The pot takes about 6 1/2 minutes to boil a liter of water (212 F). When the water is ready you will hear a 'click' and the red LED will flash over 195 F.  By default, the hot pot will maintain the temperature at 195 F and shut off the hot pot automatically after 25 minutes.  By pressing the center button multiple times you can specify a lower  holding temperature.  If you do not want to boil the water first and only want to heat it up to 112 or 160 F,  you can specify this by pressing the button multiple times at the outset.  If you are heating to a lower temperature, the pot will automatically shut off after 60 minutes.When you remove the pot from the base (to pour the hot water), the pot will shut off.  If you want to keep the water warm after this, you simply press the center button to specify the holding temperature.  So long as the water is warm enough, the apparatus will not reboil the water--a nice feature especially when you are brewing coffee and would not want it to reboil.  As an added safety measure, there is an anti-boil dry detection feature, where the pot will not heat if the water level is too low.MAKING COFFEE:Making coffee is fairly simple.  You boil the water and wait at least 30 seconds so that the water is not actively boiling.  You remove the lid and put in the desired amount of coffee.  The instructions state that you then press down on the plunger such that the grounds are completely submerged in the coffee, but it makes more sense to me to stir the grounds with a tablespoon (as you do in a standard French press) before you replace the top, to ensure that the grounds are all uniformly and thoroughly moistened with water. They do not specify an extraction time, but usually this is around 4 minutes. After about 4 minute you press the plunger to the bottom and your coffee is ready.(Note: amounts of coffee used and extraction time can vary given your taste and the type of coffee used.  It takes a bit of experimentation to get the perfect cup of coffee.)The instructions for brewing coffee are, of course, by the cup.  They suggest about 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounce cup of coffee, which seems to be something of a standard.  Please realize that you will need to have coffee that for French Press coffee, you need to grind your coffee more coarsely than for drip coffee.  If you use a standard, drip coffee grind, a lot of grounds floating in your coffee that passed through the mesh of the French press.  The instructions state that you need a 'coarsely ground' coffee but do not explain this any further.MAKING TEA:Basically, you can use this to brew tea or any other brewed beverage.  The water is boiled, tea leaves are placed in the carafe, you stir, replace the lid, and let the leaves steep over time.  You then press the plunger down and pour out the tea.  Ratios of amounts of tea leaves to hot water and steeping times vary greatly between different varieties of teas.  It may take a little experimentation, but brewing tea works quite well in a French press.  As above, you must clean the device thoroughly between uses if you are using a different type or tea or brewing coffee, as lingering tea leaves and residue caught in the filter will alter the taste of boiling water or the next brewed beverage.PROBLEMS/GRIPESFirst and foremost, there is the issue as to whether this combination is truly necessary.  You can buy an inexpensive and higher capacity hot water pot and a reasonable French press separately for less than the current price of this model.  A separate French press is easier to clean, as it has no electronic parts and can be immersed in water.  Note, however, that Mr. Coffee press definitely keeps the water up to temperature while brewing so it also has its own advantages.Cleaning is relatively easy, but given that the device is electric, you cannot submerge the base and have to be careful about keeping water inside the carafe.  For the most part, you can give the carafe a quick rinse, but after a few press uses, you will probably need to clean with a little soap and water.  Once again, not a major problem, but you have to make sure you don't get the outside wet.  As to the plunger apparatus, it comes apart like a conventional French press.  You might give the plunger apparatus a good rinse every once in a while if you were using a standard French press, but if you intend to use this device as a hot pot, using the water to make tea or hot chocolate, and do not want a residual coffee taste, you will have to clean it thoroughly in between uses. That said, if you want to use it to brew tea from leaves or coffee from grounds, you will have to clean it thoroughly in between. Once again, not any more difficult to clean than a regular French press, but given that it is also used as a hot pot, this makes me less excited about using the device as a coffee maker.The apparatus only came with one lid.  It would have been nice if they supplied an extra 'boil water' lid.  If you unscrew the bottom of the plunger assembly and set it aside, you can easily boil water in the device without the whole coffee press screen in place. Without the plunger screen/spring and without the need to leave room for the volume of the coffee grounds,  you can actually fill the device with more water (safely in my testing, although not recommended by the manufacturer).  As above, if you only use the device to brew coffee or one kind of tea, this is not such a big deal.  But if you are using the press for hot water after you brew some coffee, a second lid would allow you to boil plain hot water without having to thoroughly clean the filter apparatus in between.The only measurement line inside the pot is the 1 liter mark--this is majorly inconvenient.  Because it also serves as a coffee pot, I would have expected that there would have been cup mark lines (e.g. 2 cups, 4 cups, 6 cups etc.) so that you could accurately measure your coffee to the cup without having to use some kind of external measure.  (For the record, I believe that there are about 5.6 six ounce cups and 4.2 eight ounce cups in a liter--so a liter is not a very precise way to determine cups of coffee.)There is something quite inconvenient about removing the top of a pot of boiling water, having to add grounds, and then stir.  This is compounded by the fact that the dome atop the press doesn't have any contoured grip to pull up--you basically have to pull up on the French press handle.  This is not particularly difficult, but it is a design flaw nevertheless as this is how Mr. Coffee intended you to use the pot in the first place.I have had minor issues with the central button.  I used the pot for about one week and the temperature control button intermittently sticks.  I have not used the pot for anything other than boiling water/making coffee and it has not been exposed to any sticky substances.  By carefully gripping the sides of the button and wiggling it, it seems to work well again, but this has happened several times.(For some true, coffee aficionados, this pot would be inadequate for making French press coffee.  In order to brew French press coffee 'correctly' you are supposed to place the dry grounds at the bottom of the coffee pot first.  You then 'bloom' the coffee by either pouring in just enough water thoroughly moisten the coffee or by filling the pot half full.  You then stir until the coffee grounds are fully moistened, fill the balance of the pot with hot water, and stir again.  Personally, I don't think that this is a major issue.  Perhaps I use inferior coffee and/or don't have the taste buds that can tell the difference, but the coffee tastes the same to me whether it is 'bloomed' at a separate stage or pour all the water in at once and stir.  Nevertheless, for some, this might be an issue.)CONCLUSIONS:In general, the Mr. Coffee Electric French Press works as you would expect.  It is nice to look at and brews a fine pot of coffee.  Still, I am not convinced that this device is a perfect marriage between hot pot and coffee press.  There are some rough edges in the design that could have been better, especially given the price at which this device is currently being offered.  For the right consumer this two-in-one device might hit the spot, but most would be better served buying a hot pot and a French press separately.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RISGBYGSDXR0N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LHRHBSO#wasThisHelpful","RISGBYGSDXR0N","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROSReady in under a minuteCan accommodate widths up to 12.5""Easy to useSelf adjusts to thicknessQuickly switches between hot and cold laminationBack up button to correct errors in feeding should they occurResponsive touch sensitive buttonsSafty/powersaving 'sleep mode'StylishExcellent customer supportFellowes stands by their productCONSHeavy at 14 lbsHas a large footprint 20""x6.75""x4.5""OVERVIEWThe Neputne 3 125 Laminator by Fellowes is a well made, fast, and easy to use product that does exactly what it is meant to do.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThe laminator comes well packed in the box with a set of instructions and a starter pack of 10 Fellowes Enhance 3 laminator pouches.  In order to set up the laminator you simply snap on the wire exit tray and plug it in.LAMINATOR ITSELFThe laminator itself is handsomely made.  The front and back of the machine are plastic and the top is graced with opaque silver plastic that has a dull sheen that makes it look like it is covered in aluminum like an expensive kitchen appliance. Apart from the on/off switch in the back there are no other physical buttons.  The three touch sensitive buttons in the front light up when the machine is powered up, lending a space-age quality to the laminator.  On the left  is the Standby/Power button, in the middle is a hot/cold laminator button, and on the left is the reverse feed button.Note: the laminator itself is pretty heavy, weighing in at 14 lbs.  It is also fairly large at 20"" wide and 6.75"" deep, and 4.5"" high--this has quite the large footprint.  (Given its size, my kids were jokingly calling it the 'sheepinator.')When you power the machine on the buttons light up.  After activating the touch sensitive standby/power button the machine starts to heat up.  It appears to default to the hot lamination mode, but this can easily be disabled by touching the hot/cold lamination button.  The touch sensitive buttons are responsive and worked perfectly.As a safety feature, the machine has a sleep mode, which will turn off the heat and place the laminator on standby after 30 minutes of inactivity.USING THE LAMINATORThe laminator beeps to signal it is ready and for hot lamination this takes less than a minute.  You simply place your items for lamination in a laminator pouch and it passes through the machine in seconds completely and perfectly laminated.  If you need to stop and redirect the pouch, you can hit the reverse, remove, the pouch and refeed it into the machine.  The machine auto adjusts to the thickness, so there are no other settings. The machine can handle Fellowes' 3, 5, or 7 mil thickness pouches which come in a variety of sizes and finishes.  The laminator can accommodate widths of up to 12.5.""Using the supplied pouches, I laminated a variety of things on regular paper, thicker paper, collages using construction paper, and even photographs.  All came out perfectly and the process was effortless.CUSTOMER SUPPORTThe first laminator I received for testing would not power on.  I contacted Fellowes' customer support via email and got an answer within 24 hours.  They shipped out a new laminator to me no questions asked (it arrived in 7 days) and gave me a UPS return label so I could return the broken laminator.Customer support was prompt and professional.  I was impressed that they not only responded so quickly but that they truly wanted to solve my problem promptly.  In my experience this is stellar customer support and few companies try to resolve problems so quickly.

"PROSCertified by AppleLonger than the OEM cable by about 8 inchesSame dimensions as the OEM lightning cableSlightlyThe Belkin Apple Lightning USB ChargeSync cable is a worthy replacement for your iPhone, iPad, or iPod original cable.Comes in six different colors (green, blue black, pink, purple, red, and white)CONSOddly, Belkin didn't include all new iPhone 5c colors except for yellowBelkin's cable seems just a little more hardy than Apples.  Production values seem to be high, and there seems to be a better overall sturdiness/hardiness than the original Apple sync cable.  The cable sports the same dimensions as your original, Apple lightning cable, so there is no worry about whether it will be compatible with Apple approved cases.Belkin offers their cable in a variety of different colors, so if you are sporting an iPhone 5c you can match the cable to the back of your iPhone or if you have a colorful case for you iDevice you can match up the aesthetics.  (Strangely, Belkin left out yellow--one colors that are part of the iPhone 5c lineup.  I suppose you could get white or a coordinating color if you have the yellow 5c model.)Belkin's cable is 1.2 meters, as opposed to Apple's which is 1 meter.  Basically, you get nearly 8 inches of extra length if you go with the Belkin.I have used the cable for both charging and synching.  Everything seems in order.  As to the longevity of the cable, it is hard to say after only using it for a short period of time.  I will update this review later if I have any problems.All-in-all this product could work well as a replacement or extra lightning cable for your iDevice.

The high points of this scanner are its portability and ability to easily and accurately scan text documents.  Low points include a clunky set up for the iMac, a somewhat washed out appearance in photo scanning, and lack of drivers/software for Linux or Chromebooks.  Nevertheless, this is a convenient, portable solution.WHAT'S INCLUDEDInside the box, you will find the scanner itself, a USB cable, carry bag, quick start up guide (both English and Spanish versions), set up CD, 4 AA batteries, a calibration sheet, dry cleaning sheet, and wet cleaning sheet.  All of this is handsomely packaged in the box.THE HARDWARE ITSELFThe scanner itself is about 11 1/2 inches long and accommodates paper sizes up to size.  A guide can be moved to the maximal setting at Letter but also has convenient stops at A4, B5, A5, and A6.  The guide, however, can be positioned at any size.  The construction is all plastic but feels solid. It is mostly a dull finish but doesn't attract noticeable finger prints.  The stick-shaped scanner's look is somewhat cheaper than you would think and the design is more practical than beautiful; nevertheless, form follows function. On top, there is a gray power button and a blue feed button.  Three LEDs indicate battery status, WiFi, and feed.  On the front you will find a toggle that allows you to go between Wi-Fi, AP, and USB modes.  The connect button for WPS web setup is in the back.There is a port for an AC adaptor, but this is not included with the bundle. (Note: the USB cable is only for hooking up directly to another device and is NOT a charge or power cable.)DIFFICULT SET UP FOR MEI am an old hand at setting up printers and scanners.  This kind of thing is never for the faint of heart and is rarely straightforward.  In general, Windows set ups are easier than Mac set ups, not because the Mac is a difficult machine to use but because the Mac software--I think--is usually more of an after thought for companies who are mostly marketing to business clients--the type that mostly use Windows.All that said, the set up for iMac reached a new low in clunkiness.  It was way too much trouble  took way too long to get the DS-40 hooked up to my Mac and way too much trouble.  (For the record, I was installing the software on a 21.5 inch, Mid 2011 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5 with 12 GB of 1333 MHz DDR3 running OS X 10.9.4 and completely up to date.)The included CD has software for all versions of Windows from XP on forward and OS X software from 10.5.8 to present.  My main computer is a Mac.  Install was simple and straightforward.  After inserting the CD you click on the icon and away you go.The problem that I encountered, however, is that the Wi-Fi set up for the DS-40 comes at the very end of the install and--for whatever the reason--I couldn't get my iMac to recognize the DS-40 on Wi-Fi.  I tried automatic WPS recognition, I tried WPS with PIN, I tried updating my router drivers.  I tried rerunning, start and restart or the router and my iMac--no dice.  I even tried installing the software on VMware Fusion Windows 7 and still the computer wouldn't recognize the scanner.  To make matters worse,  there was no back button or place to install the DS-40 other than going through the entire set up procedure.I gave it a rest for the night and tried again in the morning.  Still no luck and no way to connect a PC via AP mode.  USB mode posed no problem, but I really wanted to get the Wi-Fi going.  Before giving up, I flipped on my iPhone and downloaded the Epson app.  I was able to connect he DS-40 to my local network on the first try.  I then did the set up/install from soup to nuts and voila! My iMac finally found the scanner. After that it was smooth sailing.In the process of installing the scanner the night before, however, I ran down the batteries after an intense couple hours just trying to set up the scanner. Note to self: wherever you go bring extra batteries and Epson should have included the AC adaptor with the bundle.I also set up the scanner anew using my Android tablet and was similarly successful.  I was able to set up the scanner, off network, via its own Wi-Fi signal, using AP mode with either the iPhone or Android app.  (This AP mode will not work with a PC or Mac.)USING THE SCANNERScanning was simple and intuitive.  The on screen scanning software for the iMac is basic but functional.  Once the scanner was up and running scanning was easy.  The feed seemed to work well, you just need to be careful to have enough clearance behind the machine so that the scan goes through.Prior to scanning, you can choose the type of file you want to save to (PDF, JPEG, TIFF, or PNG). If you choose PDF or JPEG there are compression options as well.  You can choose the resolution (200, 300, 600 dpi or a custom level of dpi between 50-600). There are few post processing options in the document capture software, other than rotating the final picture.Text scanning was excellent and the quality was fine for all kinds of text sizes at 300 dpi.  The DS-40 was competent at scanning photos at 600 dpi, but less than ideal.  In comparison to similar scans using my Brother Printer (MFC J8700W--not exactly a superstar) set at 600 dpi resolution, the actual quality of the resolution pixel for pixel was better with the DS-40.  Sadly, though, photographs scanned with the DS-40 lost contrast and appeared washed out and flat in comparison to the Brother scans.  So, in spite of the better pixel for pixel view at high magnification, the Brother produced a far better, overall picture quality than the DS-40.Whether scanning documents at 200 dpi or 600 dpi, color, gray scale, or black and white, the scanner worked quickly.  The delay, however, occurred on the computer side where higher resolutions took longer for the computer to compile.As above, the scanner functioned well whether using it with a computer or handheld device.  Realize, however, that handheld devices can only scan up to 300 dpi, whereas a computer can take full advantage of the DS-40's 600 dpi capability.I scanned a variety of media from plain paper to magazines to photos.  The DS-40 seemed to handle the different thicknesses of paper well without any hitches.  If you obstruct the outflow, however, you may get a smear artifact on your scan of the image.I was more than satisfied as to how the device handled itself whether scanning from a handheld device or the computer.MORE SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWSOn Windows you get additional software including ABBYY Fine Reader Sprint that allows you to convert scanned images to various formats. Fine Reader will convert images to Word, Excel, PDF, or to e-mail and in doing so will use OCR to convert any letters to searchable and editable text.  Generally, this functioned quite well.  (Realize, though, that this is a basic version of the software and will not perform any advanced options or convert PDF files to other editable forms.)Windows users also get Presto! Biz Card, a software package that allows you to easily and automatically scanned business cards to a computer address book.  I did not try this package, but the interface looked a bit outdated.Sadly, iMac users do not get these any extra software packages.CONCLUSIONThe DS-40 is a competent, portable scanner.  The set up via iMac was challenging for me, but once set up I was quite satisfied with what the Epson had to offer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F83RXWJ1PBI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K33YZP0#wasThisHelpful","R2F83RXWJ1PBI1","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROSEasy to useAccurateFits wide range of arm sizes from 9"" to 17""Large LCD readoutCONSBatteries not includedNo AC adaptor available--battery operated onlyNo time stamp on blood pressure readingsNo backlightNo connectivity options to computers or handheld devicesThe Omron BP710N 3 Series Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor is the most basic and affordable automatic blood pressure cuff offered in Omron's latest lineup.  Although it is not chock full of features, it will definitely do the job--it is an easy to use, accurate, and affordable way to monitor your blood pressures at home.Inside the box you will find the basic unit itself, the cuff/tube assembly, full instruction guides (in English and in Spanish), and a quick start guide (in English on one side, Spanish on the other).  Batteries are not included and the set up doesn't come with a carry case.  More importantly, there is no AC cord included and there is no power jack on the device: this is a batteries-operated-only device.The unit itself is smartly compact for such units.  Assembly is simple:  you put four AA batteries in the bottom compartment of the unit and plug the arm cuff into the main unit.  The cuff is simple enough to place on either arm.  You cinch it until it is lightly snug and then secure it using velcro.  You then twist it so that the tube leading from the cuff is directly over the inside of your elbow.  This isn't so bad, but on my old Omron, the HEM-711 DLX, the cuff itself was more rigid and easier to place.  This isn't a deal breaker, it just makes the cuff little more difficult to place. The lower line cuff is on the less expensive model, but for people who have lost some dexterity it may be worth it to spend the extra dollars and opt for one of the two higher line models with this 'Easy-Wrap ComFit' model.Checking your blood pressure is as simple as pushing the button.  You press, wait, the cuff inflates, deflates, and the monitor shows your blood pressure and pulse in large 3/4 inch numbers.  If there is an error the cuff notes this.  Additionally, it will display a heart shaped symbol if you have an irregular heartbeat and a movement symbol if you move your body during the measurement.The cuff keeps a record of the last 14 readings, but there is no time stamp/clock on this model, so you will have to mark down the times and dates on your own.  If you want more memory or a time stamp you will have to look for a higher end model.  There is also no connectivity (via Bluetooth, WiFi, or USB), so you cannot offload blood pressure readings to a spreadsheet on your computer.There are not a lot of bells and whistles here, but if you want an easy and accurate blood pressure measurements at home, this cuff appears to be accurate and will do the job.  Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R95RXQ5E9XVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KPQB2KG#wasThisHelpful","R2R95RXQ5E9XVO","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROSA quick and easy cleanGreat substitute for damp moppingRefills are reasonably pricedCleaning fluid refills come in different formulations for different applications and in different scents to suit your tasteEasy to useEasy to assembleCONSBatteries not includedMinimal supplies includedNot suitable for overly tough floor cleaning jobsThe Swiffer WetJay Spray Mop Cleaner Starter Kit is a good way to clean your hardwood, tile, or linoleum floors.The kit comes with the Swiffer mop itself, a 500 mL bottle of cleaning fluid, 2 Swiffer pads (one regular and  and 'Extra Power Pad' with a blue strip of Mr. Clean Magic Eraser in the middle), and an instruction kit.  Batteries are not included.The mop itself is mostly preassembled.  The handle folded into three pieces that snap together quickly.  You have to supply 2 AA batteries.  You can then snap in the bottle of cleaner fluid, velcro on the Swiffer pad, and you're ready to go.Swiffering is really damp mopping. Before Swiffering--similar to mopping--you have to make sure that you have swept or vacuumed well before you begin.  Larger chunks will not stick to the Swiffer pad and, if there is too much dirt on your floor, you will make mud when you wet it that will be hard to Swiffer.When you press the button on the handle, the cleaning fluid shoots through two jets on the sides of the Swiffer head.  It shoots about 2 1/2 feet ahead of the Swiffer and the spray is just about as wide as the Swiffer head itself.  You then mop.  There is a 'scrubbing strip' in the front--like the kind of scouring pad for dishes that is gentle enough to use on teflon--on the front that can be used to loosen very stubborn stains.The regular Swiffer pad is just a simple pad.  The Extra Power Pad with the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is more suitable for stubborn stains, such as scuff marks on linoleum.  In home testing, the pads worked pretty much the same.  I tried both on some scuff marks and the Magic Eraser pad maybe did a little better.  But the scrubbing strip worked better than the Magic Eraser in my home tests for removing scuff marks and anything that was really tough to remove required the use of the scrubbing strip anyway, so I'm not sure how truly different the Magic Eraser experience was.  Depending on how dirty the floor is and how much you have to Swiffer, you may need to change pads frequently.On the upside, this is a very quick and convenient way to clean your floors.  As a side perk, kids love the motorized spraying action and at least for the first two weeks are more willing to help you clean the floor just so they can use the Swiffer.  Swiffer cleaning fluid refills also come in a variety of formulations for different surface types and in a variety of scents.  There are also a number of different Swiffer pads to choose from.  Refills are also reasonably priced.On the downside, I'm not sure why the Swiffer needs to be electronic.  The older versions with a mechanical spray trigger were not harder to operate and did not need batteries.  The kit also comes with only barebones supplies: 1) two pads will not get you too far; and 2) the size of the Swiffer cleaner is 500 mL--less than half the usual size (1.25 Liters) of a Swiffer cleaner refill.  I guess you could look at the supplies as bonus items included with the Swiffer Wet Jet, but 10 pads and a normal sized refill would have been more to my liking.All in all, the Swiffer WetJet was effective and worked as expected.  If your floor is an abysmal mess of dirt and grime, you will need to vacuum and take out your old fashioned mop and bucket for a thorough cleaning.  But if all you need is a superficial clean, you can use the Swiffer as you would when you damp mop.  It is an easy and convenient way to clean your floors and is definitely worth the investment.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ7R1IW6CCW9X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008MOQA#wasThisHelpful","RQ7R1IW6CCW9X","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The unit does come with a set of instructions.  (Make sure you remove the plastic drain attachment from the water compartment before operating and DO NOT remove the styrofoam float which monitors the water level.)The unit itself is compact enough, given what it does.  It stands on mobile castors about 23 inches high and is about 15.5 inches wide and 11 inches in depth.  It is not a light weight piece of equipment at almost 40 lbs, so the wheels are a welcome addition.  This is a larger capacity dehumidifier; the tank holds 70 pints (2.1 gallons) of water.  The water compartment slides in and out easily but also snaps into place to prevent accidental spillage.  As the unit is self-contained it can move anywhere you have an outlet.If you want continuous drainage so you don't have to empty the water compartment periodically, you can use the optional drain attachment.  To attach the drain, you simply remove a rubber stopper on the back of the unit and screw in the drain fixture.  The hose with this attachment is only about 6 3/4 inches long, so you will need to buy an adequate length of plastic hose to attach.  This drains by gravity and NOT by pump, so you have to make sure that you use a floor drain that is lower than the unit to achieve adequate flow.The machine powers on via a control panel at the top (there is no remote supplied with this unit).  There is a power button and the fan can be adjusted to two speeds (Turbo and normal).  When powered on the unit can certainly be heard.  Using an iPhone app it appears to throw off about 60 dB on the low fan setting and 63 db on the low setting at 10 feet. My average window air conditioner throws off around 70 dB depending on the fan setting, so this is about twice as quiet as your average air conditioner. (dBs are note a linear scale; 70 dB is about twice as loud as 60. To give you an idea, 60 dB is about the range for normal conversation.  70 dB is like driving in the average car.  A normal, quiet home is about 40 dB.)The unit seems to do a fine job of dehumidifying.  On some hotter and more humid days, however, the container will fill up rather quickly.  On one of the scorching, >90 F days with 80% humidity, the container filled to capacity within about 5 hours.  The machine stops dehumidifying and beeps when the container is full.  As above, it is simple to empty and there is is a convenient carry handle on the bucket.The unit effectively dehumidifies, so long as you place it correctly in a room.  It needs to be able to access enough airflow so that air can circulate through the unit.  You cannot put the unit in a closet and expect it to work.  If you place it in the basement, it would probably function best in the middle of an open space.  If you are using this in your living room, it can be placed in a corner, but  needs to be far enough away from the wall to have sufficient air flow.Additionally, the unit has a timer function so that it will automatically turn off after the set time.I am pleased with the performance of this dehumidifier.  It isn't the fanciest unit or the unit with the most options, but it does its job well and at the time of the writing of this review appears to be priced competitively.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23WVF2AX18GT3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JE1KP06#wasThisHelpful","R23WVF2AX18GT3","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As Edgar Walsh--Pearl S. Buck's son and manager of her literary estate--states in his excellent forward to this book, The Eternal Wonder is a literary find.  Buck died in 1973 with her estate in shambles.  The manuscript was taken from Buck's house and somehow ended up in a Texas storage unit.  When the storage unit was abandoned, its contents went up for auction and the manuscript was serendipitously found.It is not clear exactly when Buck wrote her final novel.  What is clear, though, is that Buck was a perfectionist and this novel is far from her usual level of perfection.  Walsh and the publisher worked together to edit out some of the more obvious kinks, but otherwise the novel was left untouched. Buck was clearly not finished with this manuscript and the lack of polish is evident.Still, the book is definitely a diamond in the rough (or perhaps a better metaphor in this case, an uncultured pearl).  It contains the same soaring themes that you might find in Buck's many works: the burden of being different, the individual who is both part of society yet alienated from it, the evils of oppression of minorities and women, cultural clashes between East and West, and others.  It takes us from the United States to the far East; while Buck herself clearly revels in rather than criticizes the clash of cultures, Buck's characters are forced to struggle with their differences.In spite of it's flaws, Buck's characteristic voice echoes throughout the book and you can almost hear her voice, too, somewhere in the background lamenting that she didn't have a chance to polish the book before you had a chance to read it.  Transitions between settings and segments of the novel are a bit choppy.  Although she wraps up the story, the denouement is all too quick.  But this unfinished quality does have its own allure, as you get a better idea of the process by which Buck might have written her novels.The story, from the outset, is a bit contrived. The novel follows the life of Randolph (Rann) Colfax, a genius from birth.  Of course, writing about a character who is deemed a genius is easier said than done. It is easy enough to state that your character is a genius, but it is far harder to concoct actions and dialogue that bear out this fact. Rann often states a conclusion that is rather pedestrian whereupon another character remarks that Rann is clearly exceptional.  Buck certainly has Rann accomplish a lot by the end of the book; however, a lot of his adventures seem propped up and--if we just observe what Rann does and says-- Rann comes across more as being more precocious than being a true genius.  My guess is that Buck knew this and might have buffed up these aspects in subsequent drafts.Buck has her protagonist one-up Stephen Dedalus: Rann's life story begins before parturition.  Prior to reading this book, I wasn't aware of my bias against novels that initiate their narrative in utero.  It seems more than a bit contrived and may have been one of the parts that Buck might later have scrapped or rewritten so that it would be more compelling.  The book then takes us through Rann's coming of age, the development of his sexual identity, his struggle to define himself, and finally deciding on his path in life.The book is less timeless than some of Buck's other novels.  Her choice to set this in her own era probably accounts for some of this.  The book might have seemed more inflammatory had it been released in the late 60s or early 70s.  Buck's ideas of racial and ethnic equality are, thankfully, no longer radical.  Her descriptions of Rann's sexual coming of age, which might have been scandalous when the book was written, are tame by modern standards.  And yet, even while Buck was forward thinking, some of her mores--which were definitely considered quite liberal during her lifetime--are still entrenched in the 1950s and 60s and these fall dissonant on the modern ear.Although the prose retains Buck's classical elegance, the dialogue is often stilted and some characters, such as Rann's mother and father, are not more than cardboard props for the novelist.  In this book, characters channel Buck with blatant sermonization of Buck's thoughts and philosophies.  If Buck were to have to done a later revision, you might imagine that some  of the paragraph length dialogue might have been cut back and the sermons might have been replaced with shorter, more subtle dialogue and actions that demonstrate rather then orate Buck's philosophies.  Additionally, she would definitely have fleshed out some the characters--including the protagonist.Flaws aside, I was still duly impressed with the effort here.  I was hooked by the book for two reasons.  First, it is just amazing to have unearthed a heretofore unknown novel from a major 20th century author.  Second, the book offers a rare look  into the building process of a novel.  Finally, I'd take this first draft from Buck over many third or fourth drafts of other authors.  The book may not be perfect but its still a great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23Z7CBAKFZ6PL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1480439703#wasThisHelpful","R23Z7CBAKFZ6PL","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Gutenberg's Apprentice, by Alix Christie, is a historical novel about the printing of the Gutenberg Bible.  Christie, a letterpress printer herself, mixes her own knowledge of the printing process with the handful of known facts, and stirs in a healthy dose of fiction.  The result is a lushly written novel that, although slow at times, really gives the reader the feeling of what it must have been like to live in the 15th Century when moveable type was invented.The major players are Johannes Gutenberg, the mercurial genius himself; Johann Fust, Gutenberg's patron and financier; and Peter Schoeffer, Fust's adopted son who becomes Gutenberg's apprentice.  [Note: historically, Schoeffer was not Fust's adopted son.]Christie's protagonist is Peter Schoeffer, the ambitious, young scribe.  After learning his trade in Paris, Schoeffer comes back to Mainz, only to find out that Fust wants him to eschew the trade he has learned, work with Gutenberg, and learn about this newfangled thing called printing.  We follow Schoeffer through his initial resistance to the project, his woes of working with the occasionally volatile and always unpredictable Gutenberg, and finally his mastery of the press.As the story is framed by the reminiscence of an elderly Schoeffer, we know from the outset how the story ends: Gutenberg loses his printing press to bankruptcy and Fust buys out the business with Schoeffer as his partner, forming the first successful printing house Schoeffer & Fust.Christie's writing is, no doubt, a thing of beauty.  The prose has an archaic ring to it, as though you are reading a translated history from the 1400s.  She also has a knack for capturing the sense of wonder that her characters have for the invention of moveable type, a feeling that we might compare to the invention of the internet today.  Moveable type changed everything.  It was a radical change and was immediately recognized as such.  What people couldn't predict was how vast its influence would be in such a short time.Given the subject matter, though, the book flounders a bit.  The general plot is simple: Gutenberg and company must race against time to complete the bible. For one, the money is running out.  For another, the Church authorities have an inkling that something is up and it seems clear that they want to shut down the presses.  And while their beating the clock, they have to invent all the techniques needed to successfully print things.Christie throws in a few side plots and a little romance, but since we know the ending, the mystery isn't whether the get from point A to point B but how they get there. (We know at the beginning that Gutenberg has a falling out with Schoeffer and Fust and the bible definitely gets printed--or at least I'm pretty sure of it because of its Wikipedia entry).  Additionally, as much as a modern reader realizes the impact of the printed word, it's hard to get as jazzed up about it as characters in the book do.Although there are parts of the book that I had to push through a bit to read, I thoroughly enjoyed it overall.

"The Tombow Mono Professional Drawing Pencil set comes in a blister pack with six 'extra-refined' graphite pencils and a 2.3 mm precision eraser.  A carrying case is not included.The pencils from hardest to softest are 2H, HB, B, 2B, 4B, and 6B.  (The HB pencil is usually about the harness of your average, #2 pencil, but there are no universal hardness guides and pencils can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.)The variety of hard and soft leads is reasonable for someone who is just starting out.  However, until you have developed your own style, it makes sense to buy a set of 12 pencils.  There is a Tombow set on Amazon that does not come with an eraser but has 12 pencils in a plastic box that might serve you better. It's nice that they concentrated on the softer leads, as that is where I end up doing most of my drawing because I enjoy blending.I sharpened the pencils with a conventional sharpener (some prefer to use a craft knife).  They performed as expected and compared favorably to my reliable Staedtler set. The leads seem of appropriate hardness and the pencils feel good in the hand.  They are hexagonal so they don't roll away too quickly on a flat surface and have the right feel of an artists pencil.The eraser is a reasonable point eraser.  Obviously, at 2.3 mm this is not an eraser for large areas.All and all, this is a fine set of drawing pencils for the beginner.  Those who are more serious will probably want the set of 12.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QAWXZW4WEUXD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRLV1YI#wasThisHelpful","R2QAWXZW4WEUXD","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:SimpleConvenientReally does cut down on prep timeChops and dices to uniform sizesMuch safer and easier to use than a mandolin type slicerEasy clean upEasy storageComes with helpful cleaning toolIntegrated measuring deviceCONS:Not for large jobsVeggies need to be cut down to size before they can be used in the deviceNot suitable for softer fruits, vegetables, or cheeses or veggies that are too pulpy (e.g. soft tomatoes)Very fibrous, not so crisp sweet potatoes were a bit of a challenge (but a crisper, less dense variety worked famously)Cutting blades are not meant to be cleaned in dishwasherLess versatile than a mandolin slicerSturdy, but not heirloom kitchen device qualityThe Freshware Onion, Vegetable, and Cheese chopper is a simple kitchen tool that just does the job.There is really nothing all that fancy here: basically the device is a simple hinge.  You select from three cutting grates: large squares, small squares, or slices.  You select one of the grates and place it on the base of the device, place the food on the chopper blade, and push the hinged lid closed.  This forces the food through the grille and--voila--your food is chopped.As an extra bonus, there are measuring lines drawn on the side.  If you tilt the device on end, you can see if you have enough, say, chopped onions without having to use a measuring up.Is this genius?  No.  Is this new, innovative, and oh-so-different than anything out there in the market? Absolutely not.  However, the chopper is simple, easy to use, and light weight.  Whether you are making sweet potato fries, chopping onions, or cutting harder cheeses in cubes or strips it is simple and just works.  This is an easy to use, easy to clean, device that doesn't take up a lot of room, but might save you a lot of time.The device could probably chop just about anything but, for me, worked best on larger more solid types of food.  Potatoes and crisp sweet potatoes worked exceedingly well. (Note: very fibrous sweet potatoes that weren't so crisp didn't work well in the system.  For some reason they were trouble.  However, another crisp and seemingly less fibrous variety worked famously in the machine.  You may have to experiment at first with what works.)  If you want strips or slices you give them one pass.  If you want cubes, you put them through for a second pass.  Solid fruits, such as apples and firm pears worked well too. Onions were diced with one pass.  Note, however, firmness is key. If the onion is on the riper side, it still works, but there can be some slippage.  Celery, carrots, and parsnips all worked pretty well, but were less convenient as you need to cut them in strips that fit on the chopper blade and you can't really stack them.Certain veggies, such as tomatoes, didn't work as well.  Sure, if you have a more solid beefsteak tomato without a lot of seed or pulp it would probably be okay.  But if your have a less meaty tomato that has a lot of pulp/seeds, you will pulverize more than you chop.  The same goes for ripe pairs, bananas, softer cheeses etc.  Softer things that don't hold their shape don't work as well.Given the incredible sharpness of the blades, there was little slippage of the food while chopping.  With a tiny bit of pressure, the food anchors quite well.  The sharpness of the blades is also key when it comes to ease of use.  You do have to apply some pressure for things like hard, firm, white potatoes to initiate the cut, but so long as you put a little of your weight into it wasn't a problem.  Once again, if the blades should become dull, this might be a bit of a chore.Clean up wasn't bad at all.  The bulk of the device can easily be cleaned in soap and water and--I believe--is even dishwasher safe. There is a cleaning tool that will help you easily pick food pieces from the top of the device, where there is a square pattern that helps prevent slippage.  Without the tool, this would be difficult to clean.  The blades are dangerously sharp. There is a thick plastic frame around each, so handling isn't a problem.  They generally rinsed clean well, but as far as I can tell, the blades themselves are not dishwasher safe.  Be very careful when cleaning to avoid injury.  (The blades are razor sharp the way blades on a mandolin slicer are sharp.  The thing that makes this device safer than the mandolin-type slicers is that everything is covered while you are doing the chopping so you don't expose your fingers to injury the same way.)Blades can be stored in the bottom of the closed chopper.  This is nice, as it means that there are no exposed sharp edges to snag and cut you if you are reaching for the device in the cabinet.One caveat: this is not the device you would use for industrial sized cooking.  The area of the cutting blades is small and some larger vegetables need to be cut down to fit the size of the cutting surface.  Additionally, you have to be careful about vegetable height, as the vegetable can't be too tall for the hinge.  But if you're preparing dinner for 1-8 people it worked just fine.  Another issue: the effectiveness of the chopper really depends on the fact that the blades are razor sharp.  They will likely become dull over time and if that happens the device will be close to useless.  The device--with the exception of the blades themselves--is made of hard plastic.  This is not an heirloom kitchen device that you will pass on to your children, but in practice seemed sturdy enough for the job at hand.On some level, this is a 3-trick pony: it slices and cuts strips in two sizes.  It is easy to discount this as yet another superfluous kitchen device, but the fact that it is small, easy to use, and does the job quickly make it a real asset and something that I used far more than I ever thought I would.  Simple things like chopping up onions for sauteeing: just strip the onions, stick them serially into the device, and--bam--you are done.  No lengthy dicing and the size of the chopped onions is uniform.  The same was true of making fries or cubing cheddar.  It was all much faster than usual and actually justified the time it takes to clean up the machine afterwards.I'm not a person who likes buying a kitchen device for every little chore, but although it's repertoire is limited, this one actually seems to work well and has become a go-to device in my kitchen.  Surprisingly, I like this device and see myself using it a lot in the future.

"PROSFine shave--up there with the best of the electrics at a great price pointBetter foil shaving system than last iterationCan be used corded or uncordedBlades are easier to clean than last modelHead be cleaned under water5 minute quick charge featureDigital LED charge meterCompatible with international voltagesCONSLarge/BulkyLouder than Panasonic and Braun modelsFit and finish not quite on par with Panasonic and BraunNo carrying case providedCostly replacement foil at this point in time (over time, this will likely go down)OVERVIEWThe Remington F7-7800XCD Mens Shaver is a fine electric razor.  It rounds up the top of Remingtons mid-line range of shavers and definitely does the job as well as any electric razor. I last reviewed a Remington razor in 2009 (the F-5790, which is still available on Amazon as of this writing), and since that time Remington has made a number of innovations to improve its product line.  The result is an easier, faster shave and the shaver is easier to clean.IN THE BOXIn spite of the manufacturer number F7-7800XCD, the box is labeled F8.  Im not sure exactly why this is, but Im happy to round up.  Inside the box you will find, the shaver itself, a small stand, the power cord,  a small cleaning brush, and a cover for the shaver.  No carry case is provided, as you might find with other manufacturers.The shaver itself is true to Remingtons more modern design trend.  The shaver is long and has an ergonomic curve.  The bulk of the shaver is made out of black plastic.  All of this is sturdy enough, but this is not heirloom quality. The assumption is likely that you will replace the razor in 4 or 5 years.  Atop the shaver is the pivoting foil.  In the F7/F8 line this pivots front to back (in the higher FR line it also pivots side to side).  The stand is attractive enough and has little more heft than a coaster.  I was concerned that there would be a lot of balance problems, but the engineers clearly designed it with the shape and center of gravity of the shaver itself in mind; once attached, the shaver and base are surprisingly stable.The cord is upgraded from the last time I had a Remington.  The plug end is shaped like an oblong cylinder now and it is far lighter and smaller than my old Remington cord.  Happily, the cord can either attach to the base for charging or directly to the shaver.  The trend these days in less expensive electric razors is to have either a cord or a base but not both.  Corded is good, because it means if the shaver is not charged you can still plug it in and use it while it is charging.  A base is good because it gives you a place to park and charge the shaver while not in use.  Kudos to Remington for going retro and supplying both.  Of note, this shaver does adapt to international voltages (but you will need the proper adapter).This model has an amber LED light indicating the charge.  Full charge is indicated when the LED lights up to 60, as a full charge yields 60 minutes of shave time.  It takes 2 hours to charge fully, but you can do a 5 minute quick charge if you are in a rush or just shave with the cord attached.The cleaning brush is the simple type with shorter bristles at one end to clean the foil and longer bristles at the other end to touch up the rest of the shaver.  The included cover is opaque, black plastic, instead of the usual clear acrylic.  No issues here.Fit and finish on this shaver is pretty good, but it doesnt live up to the fit and finish on Braun models or Panasonic models that Ive used in the past.  The seams are less smooth and the overall feel is less solid and more plasticky.SHAVING EXPERIENCEThe shaver is easy to use, you simply turn it on and rub it against your face.  Unlike older models with a two or three foil array, this is a two foil model with an Interceptor component in the middle which has a more trimmer-like action.  This array takes care of the longer hairs, making them shorter and more available to the foil part for shaving.  The pivoting head is a nice touch, but in practice makes little difference while shaving.  In past models you could activate or deactivate the pivoting.  Here it pivots all the time, but once again this doesnt seem like a big issue.I found that the new blade array did make for a faster shave.  Unlike the old Remington, this was more comparable to my Panasonic shaver.  Although the results were on par with the Panasonic, the shave was a little rougher on the skin.  For those not used to using an electric razor, you do get used to this.  However, given its more gentle tendency, the Panasonic would make for an easier introduction to an electric shaver.The Remington is certainly louder than my Panasonic, but not as loud as my older Remington.The flip up trimmer is located in exactly the same place as it was on the previous model.  The trimmer works just fine, but given its location and the size of the shaver itself, it takes some practice to see where you are going.  If the trimmer popped out farther away from the shaver or was located at a higher level (impossible, because of the pivot) there would be fewer problems with visibility.NOTE: you need to change the blades/foil every 6 months to a year.  The foil itself for this model costs $24.99 at the time of this writing. This is a little pricey, as it does not include the replacement blades.  (For reference, the total cost for replacement foil and blades for my old Remington is $18.16 at the time of this writing.)  My guess is that this is a new model and that the price will go down.CLEANINGAlthough this is not a wet-dry shaver (dont use in the shower or with shaving cream), the body is sealed and the head of the shaver may be rinsed with water for cleaning.  Remington has taken a cue from Panasonic and increased the space between the cutting blades and arranged them more in loops.  The result is that the shaver is much easier to clean.  You generally can take of the foil cover, rinse under the tap, and let air dry.  Given the new blade design, I havent even had to use the brush for cleaning.  Very convenient.Unfortunately, they have not changed the design of the head array.  If stray hairs get caught in the sides and corners of the head array, the foil will not snap on.  If this happens, you simply need to clean out the wells and sides of the head piece and this will correct the problem.  My Panasonic does not have this problem because the bottom of the head assembly is generally flat and stray hairs just wash away.CONCLUSIONRemington has made some advances that make this shaver better than their last iteration and on par with the competition.  Remingtons shaver is still bulky, a little noisy, and lacks the fit and finish of its competitors, but it now gives a comparable shave at a much lower price point.  Its well worth the look.

"PROSOrganized new interfaceImpressive fidelity with importing office documentsEasier editing capabilitiesCan add video, sound, 3D components to documentsMore 'windowslike' in behaviorFully functional form fillingFully functional form creationIncredible OCRNo crashes during testingCan save directly to Dropbox, Evernote, or Nuance CloudCONS:Still note quite a fully integrated windows programClip art is very basic/early 2000s type of stuffSome problems with editingOccasionally wonky commenting/annotating featuresNo PDF data collection featuresOVERVIEWNuance Power PDF standard is Nuance's latest iteration of its PDF manipulation software.  Nuance has ramped up the interface and made some major improvements, making this edition a winner.Power PDF replaces Nuance's PDF Professional line, a very powerful and competitive package with an incredibly clunky interface that didn't always play well with windows.Adobe will still be the go-to program for the true power user--it simply is at the cutting edge and is the gold standard in the field. But in terms of ease of use and the features that most people want, Power PDF will get you there--in style--for about 1/3 of the price you will pay for Acrobat Pro. (Don't let the 'standard' in Power PDF's title fool you: it's feature set is more akin to Acrobat Pro than Acrobat Standard.)THE LOOK AND FEELUnlike PDF Professional, Power PDF looks slick, like you are opening another Microsoft Office program.  Instead of a clunky, old-fashioned ribbon, there is a new tabbed interface.  Nuance takes cues from Microsoft, giving it simple, non-skeuomorphic set of icons that are easily recognizable. But it's not just the look, the menus are organized--something sorely lacking in Nuance's last offering.Now, I realize that some people really hate Microsoft's new tabbed approach, but when you are used to it from Office since 2008, it keeps things uniform and familiar. Moreover, the thoughtful organization makes it easier to find features.WORKS MORE LIKE A WINDOWS PROGRAMNuance's last offering really didn't behave like a Windows program.  For example, in the past, you had to open everything from the menu bar and cut and paste was often iffy.  Here you can simply throw your Office document into the PDF Professional window (or on top of it's menubar icon) and it just opens it.  Additionally, the style of the window matches Windows 7 and 8.1 much better.Not all is quite perfect in paradise, however.  You can open multiple documents, but they all reside in different windows.  And the style of the window fits in better with Windows' standard, but the fit is not perfect.  Still, everything is placed where it should be and the style is a good enough fit to prevent icon confusion and dissonance.In practice, almost all PDF manipulation programs (Adobe included) behave in a somewhat alien fashion compared to usual Windows programs.  It is unclear why this is, but it happens to be true.PDF CONVERSIONThis can now be done with a right click of the mouse and a simple save.  Even better, you have several options for right click conversion, including three different quality levels (standard, draft, publishing), company confidential, tagged PDF, MRC compression, or save as a searchable PDF.  Or you can just throw the document in the Power PDF window and edit before saving.The results are actually some of the best I've ever seen.  I tried converting many different kinds of documents and the fidelity was actually stunning.  Most processed to PDF without a glitch, whether they were Word, Powerpoint, or Excel.  Colors were unchanged and even layered graphics/text came out to near perfection.EDITINGNuance has actually made some great advances in editing.  For one thing, their old program had a tendency to crash a lot with editing.  This one seems rock stable.For another, many PDF programs have problems with mucked up spacing or paragraphing when you try to edit. Changing a few characters can mess up all the paragraphing below the correction.  Power PDF recognizes characters as characters. It basically places each line of text in its own text box, so that correcting one line will not affect any others.One major glitch on the editing, which only happened in a PDF I tried to edit that was made in Apple's Pages--if the font you wish to edit has no analogous font; you can erase text in that section but if you try to type text, Power PDF pops up an error window and will not allow you add text to edit that section.  There may be a work around, but I am not aware of it. (The best I could do was to erase the line altogether and add my own text.  Adding text can be done using the typing tool or going under the forms tab and adding a text field.  It's all a bit clunky, but such is the world of PDFs.)There is no way to 'paint on' a format to change the entire body of text to a font that Power PDF understands so that you can have full-featured editing.  On the one hand, it is nice that Power PDF can display the font effectively and even handle it like text even though it doesn't have the font available.  On the other hand, it puts you in a sticky editing situation, where you can delete letters but you can't replace them.Pictures and graphics are easily removed, replaced, or resized.  This even works with more complicated, layered graphics, although unless you select all the layers you will have to move them separately.There are no 'extra' types of formatting available.  No shadows, glow, fanciful colors, or 3D effects, but these kinds of things aren't standardThere are easy ways to add watermarks, rearrange pages, and bookmark pages/locations within the document.ANNOTATING/COMMENTINGThere are a variety of features for annotating PDFs that generally work well.  The pop-up, sticky note feature for changes works easily and as expected.Underlines, cross-outs, and highlighting, however, can be wonky. There were no problems in documents with simple layouts, but in more complicated ones are times where you try to underline, cross-out, or highlight and, instead of affecting the intended single word or line, you actually end up affecting a whole section.  Most of the time, you can fidget with it and get it to look right, but this should be a little easier.There are some advanced features, such as 'draw tools,' that allow you to place a 'pencil' mark, draw an oval, or box off an area that you want to comment on.  There are even 'callout' boxes with arrows that point to problem text.  So-called active mark up allows the allows you to annotate an area and at the same time a sticky note pops up titled with the moniker (e.g.'underline') that describes what the sticky note pertains to. There are other options for this as well if you highlight a word or section and right click a mouse you can cross-out text and choose a pop up that will say 'replace text' or 'insert text at cursor.'  Definitely a useful feature.As Nuance makes Dragon Naturally Speaking, you can even click on 'Dragon Notes' and dictate into your annotation boxes.  A nice feature.PDF FORMSPower PDF does a reasonable job at filling in and creating PDF forms is straightforward and very similar to other PDF programs.Adobe still reigns supreme here, with more specific types of forms that can be added (e.g. date forms with a pop-up calendar).  There is probably some way to program these in Java and have them for use in Power PDF, but that would be beyond the scope of my ability.The form fields available here are the standard button field, text field, check box, radio button, combo box, list box, and digital signature.  You can change the properties of the boxes with a right click or double click.  Most properties can be changed for multiple boxes, if you shift-click.  This will select multiple boxes in a row.  Oddly, you need to hit control-RIGHT click to select multiple, non-contiguous boxes.  A bit strange, but it works.In theory, you could produce forms from scratch using the program.  In practice, this would be difficult, as this program (and most PDF programs) lack the elegance and ease of use of a standard word processor.That said, Power PDF does an excellent job of picking up form fields correctly.  Lines become text fields and squares or circles will become check boxes (these would have to be changed to radio buttons if you only want to select one item out of a list).  On the whole, though, for simple forms, it makes things easier.There is an interesting compare option (for some reason under the home tab) that allows you to compare two PDFs.  The program will highlight the differences in the color of your choice.SECURITYDocuments may be made more secure using itms in the security tabs.  This allows you to set signatures, encrypt the documents contents, add password only access, require certificates, etc.  These are fairly straightforward.THE CLOUDSave options include Dropbox, Evernote, and Nuance Cloud Connector.DATAIf you are using PDF forms to collect specific PDF data, this program may not be the one for you.  Try as I may, I couldn't find any PDF data collection forms or a way to output PDF form data on to a spreadsheet.  That doesn't mean that it can't be done, but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to do it. My guess is that this kind of feature is reserved for the Pro edition.NUANCISMSIn the past, Nuance has been criticized for poor customer support and difficulties regarding draconian security procedures leading to the dreaded activation issues.I have not tried customer support for this product, but their policies have much improved.  It used to be that you were only allowed a single phone call regarding Dragon Naturally Speaking products and over the past few years, they have been better about 30 day support.  Their website has a reasonably organized FAQ section and there is a vast user-contributed database of answers to common and not so common questions.As to security and activation issues, in my experience these things have been largely solved.  Over the past four years, I have not had a problem with a Nuance product (e.g. Dragon or PDF Professional 8) that refused to boot up after I swapped out a hard drive or connected/disconnected a multitude of USB devices.  I even seamlessly migrated a version of Dragon for the PC from one office computer to the other--the only caveat is that you MUST uninstall the program from machine #1 before you install it on machine #2.That said, there have been activation issue horror stories in the past with Nuance products.  I cannot deny them, I can only tell you that I have not personally experienced them.CONCLUSIONPower PDF is Nuances' slickest and best PDF creation and manipulation software to date.  Although Adobe Acrobat Professional remains the gold standard in the field, Nuance has come up with a program that has 98% of the features that most of us are looking for and is actually a whole lot easier to use than Adobe's offering.

"PROS:CompactKeyboard integrated with casePortableLong battery lifeBluetooth connects easilyUniversal fit for 7-8 inch tablets with different dimensionsCONS:Frustrating to use for the touch typistPoor tactile feelToo cramped for fast touch typingPoor layout choices hobble fast touch typingLittle ability to change the angle of the keyboardOVERVIEWThe Belkin QODE Universal Portable Keyboard is a serviceable, Bluetooth keyboard for 7-8 inch tablets.  It works reasonably well as a case and the keyboard is faster than typing directly on to the screen, but in the end the keyboard is just too small to allow for quick, touch typing.FULL REVIEWThe case itself is a simple, portfolio case.  The style of the flat, powder dull, black case mimics the Apple iPad smart and does reasonably well in terms of not showing too much in the way of fingerprints.  However, there is definitely something a little cheap about the feel.  The workmanship is okay, but the production values are clearly not at the highest industry standard, with the edges not perfectly aligned.  The inside surfaces of the case have a soft, microfiber texture and keyboard is recessed enough to protect your screen from scratches.  The battery life is acceptably long, reportedly 155 hours between charges.SETTING UPThe tablet is secured by four rubber brackets, which are connected to the case with elastic bands and thus can accommodate tablets with slightly different dimensions.  It was easy to secure the tablet and, once secured, it was easy to remove it from the case.  In concept, I thought that the system would be a bit dodgy, but once secured, the iPad mini stayed in place. The case can be configured on a table so that the tablet sits like a laptop.  There is little you can do to adjust the angle at this level. You can make it really shallow, but that was a poor angle to type with.  Even so, the angle was good for sitting and typing.  The case kept the tablet stable at the selected angle, so there were no worries about the tablet flopping around while you were typing.  Along with the viewing angle, it would be nice if there was some way to angle the keyboard while typing to help with position/wrist strain.  I have not seen a case where you can actually angle the keyboard itself, but this is a feature that would definitely be helpful.Bluetooth connection was straightforward and they keyboard connected easily to my iPad mini.MAJOR KEYBOARD ISSUESThe major problem with the case is the keyboard itself.  The first thing you notice when you try to type, is that this is a very cramped, chiclet keyboard.  Belkin made some bad choices when downsizing the keyboard.  First and foremost, they did not use the full width of the case.  Had the keyboard even been 1 inch wider, it would have been easier to type on.  Second, they fit in more keys at the bottom of the case by shrinking the space bar.  Not a bad compromise, as most people only use the inner part of the space bar anyway, but they went a little too far.  There is really very little space bar real estate and I found myself hitting the command or the  the ?/ keys, which flank the space bar, when trying to touch type.  The same can be said for the shift keys. The left shift key  poses less of a problem, but arrow-up is right below the right shift key and this causes some frustrating typing errors.The keys themselves are smaller than their large, chiclet key counterparts, which makes them very small targets, indeed. Given the size of the keyboard, they are crowded close together, leading to further typing errors.  Moreover, they are more mushy than clicky, making for a poor tactile experience.Even a small amount of expansion would have been welcome. Oddly, there is space above and below the keyboard which could have been used to expand the size of the keyboard vertically and there is plenty or space beyond the sides of the keyboard for horizontal expansion.  I still don't understand why Belkin decided to make the keyboard so small, when there was ample room to expand without changing the dimensions of the case.Even the keyboard from my ancient HP2133 would have almost fit within the constraints of this case, and the HP2133 keyboard is actually quite easy to type on.  Just small changes in dimensions and a better quality keyboard could have made all the difference.For now, I will continue to use a spare Bluetooth, iMac keyboard that I have, as this is a full size keyboard and works much better than any keyboard case that I have tried in the past.  (It's also not all that heavy and can be taken on the go, if necessary.)CONCLUSIONThe keyboard will work for you if you just want an upgrade from the onscreen, keyboard input.  However, it is more amenable to the hunt-and-peck typist than someone who is a fast touch typist.  For most touch typists, this keyboard will really slow you down given a combination of the crowded spacing of the keys, some poor choices in keyboard layout, and poor tactile feel of the keyboard.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R6RFNM7EM7XC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ETBHOIM#wasThisHelpful","R1R6RFNM7EM7XC","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When Ellis Rogers retires, his marriage was on the rocks, his best friend had betrayed him, and he was just been diagnosed with cancer.  Rather than wallow in misery, he uses his engineering skills and some misunderstood equations developed by a forgotten scientist, builds himself a time machine, and whisks himself away into the future.The Hollow World, by Michael Sullivan, follows Ellis' adventures in the utopian world that he has found. Avoiding any spoilers, suffice it to say that Ellis is not only unprepared for what he finds but is also the only one equipped to root out an evil plot that threatens this gentle, future world.Some aspects of Sullivan's future world are unique but others  are horribly cliched. There are a few inconsistencies as well.  But okay.  This may not be genius level science fiction, but for me it was an engaging read from start to finish.  And just when you think that Sullivan might be writing too predictably, he throws in a plot twist that changes everything.The book sometimes wanders a bit and you may not find yourself impressed by the depth of the characters, but Sullivan is a craftsman when it comes to writing an overarching plot and that is really what keeps the book moving.This may not be the book for someone who doesn't love a quick sci fi novel, but I'm a junky and Sullivan gave me my fix.  On the whole, a great effort and something that piqued my interest: I'll be looking for the next adventure in the Hollow World.  So if you are a fan of pulp sci fi, the kind that still tries to make you think at least a bit, this one may be for you.  For the right person (a person like me), I'd recommend it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD4M031AFB0WG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=161696183X#wasThisHelpful","RD4M031AFB0WG","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Without revealing spoilers or too much detail, Lankester recounts turbulent events that transpired after she unwittingly joined Ron 'the cigar' Sacco's illegal, California bookmaking operation in 1986.  As Lankester tells the story, she was really looking to become a race car driver in the CanAMex car rally.  Her racing partner, Jim Arnold, happened to work as a telephone and security technician for Sacco.  Using his connections, Arnold got Lankester a job as a bet taker so she could support herself until her racing career picked up.  This was the start of an 8 year roller-coaster ride, with the Sacco organization on the run and Lankester in tow, until the whole operation was taken down in 1994.Lankester is actually quite a good writer.  She concentrates less on description and motivation, saving most of the narrative for the action.  The book is rife with guns, intrigue, run ins with the law, love, sex, betrayal, bathos without a lot of pathos,a few bodies left behind, and very little time for serious self reflection.  But you get the idea that that was how things were for Lankester in 1986-1994. She doesn't glorify.  She doesn't justify.  She just tells. And she is quite a good teller.With the exception of a short hiatus after a big bust in 1987, when Lankester and her husband tried to settle down and become a dull, suburban couple, the book is all go, go, go. This is a fast and intriguing read; well worth the price of admission.While the book is a great read, there is one major caveat here: it is hard to completely trust Lankester as a narrator.  In a first person narrative, you take it for granted that you get a one-sided point of view.  I realize that memoir writers are not always interested in telling the whole truth, but Lankester paints a very selective picture and throughout the narrative seems far too naive.I have a hard time believing that she didn't understand why the US Government would want to shut down a $100 million  per month, $1.2 billion dollar per year, illegal, gambling enterprise. Did she really believe that there wasn't a crueler side to Sacco's organization?  Did she really believe that the government didn't care about Sacco recklessly flouting the law and not paying taxes? Did she really think that Sacco didn't have any ties to the mob when it was clear that he had to be working with the mob? I understand that when Lankester started off she didn't know the whole story. I understand that she was in it neck deep by the end.  But the fact that she stuck to it for so long hints that she might have been just a bit more than a telephone operator: Enquiring minds want to know.  You get the idea that Lankester softens her role in the operation in an attempt to avoid any kind of instigation that might arise after publishing the book.It is also a little disconcerting to see that the people that are benefiting from the story of the bust the most are Lankester and the FBI-hired conspirators who helped bring down Sacco's organization in California.  The two conspirators have since incorporated as a private investigation firm--touting their success in bringing down the entire Sacco operation (err... well, for at least a year before Sacco opened shop elsewhere) and that the two were almost certainly skimming money 'off the books' during the sting operation, all the while getting paid handsomely by the FBI.  When the most unlikely people seem to use a story to their own advantage and for their own purposes, it makes you wonder about how straight the narrative really is.Still, Lankester has lived a life that is better than fiction.  After reading the book, it is hard to imagine that this is an orthodox, historical account of the events, but, even so, it is still a great read.  Recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32IP4VYHFFZ71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=3906196003#wasThisHelpful","R32IP4VYHFFZ71","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

More important, the software has to do some thinking for itself: I want contextual menus so I don't have to hunt through multiple menus of features before I find what I want.Although Corel Office X7 may have a lot of power under the hood, it lacks these capabilities and lacks modern fit and finish.  It falls far short of the latest Microsoft Office Suite and Apple's iWork Suite.  In fact, there are some fairly polished, no-cost options such as Open Office, Libre Office, Google Office, and the desktop version Kingsoft Office that will have a more modern and intuitive interface, are easier to use, and actually provide equal--if not better--compatibility with the corporate, Microsoft Office standard.I am sure that there are die-hard WordPerfect fans, who have continuously used this program for years and would never use anything else.  The fact is, I really wanted to like WordPerfect--I have fond memories of it from the 90s when it was features ahead of the curve--but there is little to praise in this latest iteration, as there is little to separate WP X7 from the free competition.  As the free versions of office suites have matured, WP X7 has a hard time distinguishing itself from the pack and it doesn't come close to the latest offerings from Microsoft or Apple.I will first address general issues and then discuss the components of the Corel Office X7 Home Student package.INSTALLThe software install was straightforward.  You are offered an install of Word Perfect X7 and a second install for extras (like clip art).  I went with the complete install, soup to nuts.  I'm not sure why you have to go through with two installs--these days you'd expect to click off the options you want and then a single install would be complete--but it was easy enough, so I'm good with it.  No issues here.OLD-STYLE INTERFACEWhen you open Word Perfect X7 (or any part of the WP office suite), you will be transported back to the halcyon days of 2003.  Residing on top of your document you will find the old-fashioned ribbon menu, not seen in Microsoft Office after Word 2007.There was a lot of brouhaha when Microsoft updated the ribbon in 2007, as 'everything changed,' and all my features were afloat, lost in a strange sea of clickable tabs.  But in the end, I believe, Microsoft was actually right.  Once you got used to the tabs, it is, indeed, easier to find what you want to find.  And when you select something in your document, the tabs switch to what you want in context.  A very clever innovation.Not so in Word Perfect X7.  The tiny, crowded icons on Word Perfect's ribbon are lined up like two rows of soldiers at the top of your document.  No longer used to the anachronistic menu, it took me a while to reorient myself.  I was as surprised at the wayback machine as I was at my inability to navigate it easily--my it has been so long!The old-style ribbon has its advantages.  For one, everything you usually use is tucked in at the top of the menu. The program defaults to displaying the WP menu and the formatting menu. The first problem, as you will remember, is finding where everything else is.  Most of the sub menus are hidden, but can be added to the ribbon by going to view-->toolbars and then clicking on other options (such as 'drawing').  The problem is, as you reach a critical mass of menus, you occupy more screen real estate atop of the document.  Additionally, the more menus you add, the more crowded things get up there and it's harder to find what you want.  When clicked to life, the `extra' menus appear as floating windows.  By double clicking the menu bar, you can embed them in the main menu.  There are some glitches here.  First, clicking on the PDF menu just added an empty ribbon bar.  This may be because the PDF stuff is now on the main ribbon or because the Home and Student edition doesn't have advanced PDF features; either way, this should have been cleaned up after beta testing.  The second problem is the addition of rows.  In the later versions of Word with the old ribbon, you could move the ribbons around and show what you wanted to show.  Here, you are stuck adding rows.  If you try to move the ribbon, the floating window pops up again.  This limits efficient use of screen real estate.In order to make up for the lack of more modern, contextual menus in this early, uncharismatic, 2000s paradigm, the WP folks have created their own contextual menu (""Word Perfect Expert"");  an equally uncharismatic, column adorned with horizontal., gray-pinstriped and with text that is fixed to the left side of the screen.  This isn't a terrible solution, but it uses words and not icons for options and takes up too much screen real estate.  You can minimize it, but then you lose your contextual menu.  WP does have at least one contextual menu that is reliable: this is the drawing menu.  When you click on a picture or drawn object on your document, the Word Perfect Expert vaporizes, pin stripes and all, and you will find a leaner, vertical column of  buttons for various drawing options in its place.  Not bad, but you first need an object on board to see this, as there is no way to toggle this left-sided menu using the WP expert column.Word Perfect used to be the chameleon of word processors. Quite cleverly, the WP programmers realized that if you wanted to get people to switch from another word processor, you should allow them to customize the ribbon to resemble their word processor of choice.  This can still be done, but sadly you are unable to manipulate the toolbar to resemble anything past ""Word 2002""--not very helpful in a more modern era.  One of the free options, Kingsoft Office (desktop edition), allows you to change the menu from the traditional ribbon to the post Word 2007 one, so it's not as though this kind of thing is impossible.In another, odd anachronism, not all menus in the toolbar are completely embedded.  In more modern software, you might click on the menu item and you get a drop down.  If you highlight a selection on the drop-down, you then get another drop-down.  Here, for example, when you click ""view"" and then highlight `toolbars"" this opens a floating window with check box options instead of another embedded menu with options you can highlight.  This is not a bad thing per se, but is another blast from the past.LIMITED FORMATTING OPTIONSIn using this office suite, it is clear that there has been a lot of building up done in Word Perfect X7 but not a lot of thoughtful rebuilding and restructuring.  The bones of the program are good but the interface suffers.This can be seen when applying formatting.  For example, when you format text in Word 2014, the font names in the drop down are written in their own particular style.  As you scroll through different fonts, the actual text in the document changes.  WP X7 goes old style, with the drop down menu in plain text, with the font shown in a pop up window next to the drop down. The text in the document does change, but there is a significant lag time whereas in Word this is instantaneous.  Worse, when you draw shapes, you must double click on them to bring up the object properties window.  There you can select different fill colors/patterns. You will see the 'preview' in an example box in the upper right of the object properties window, but you will not see changes made to your shape until you click 'okay.'  Not bad for 2004, 10 years later, you should be able to see this preview on the actual drawing in your document.This pattern seems to be pervasive in WordPerfect X7, with virtually every change--from slide coloration and themes in Presentations to table formats in WordPerfect--occurring in a tiny box rather than being previewed within the document.LIMITED STYLING OPTIONSStyles for documents and text are similarly Neanderthal.  It is very easy to make a three dimensional charts and drawings in Microsoft Office and iWork.  Everything is early-2000s-flat in Word Perfect.  The ability to design attractive documents and figures is just not there.  Short of importing drawn elements from another program, you would be hard pressed to make them in WP X7.  Sure, you can whip up a 3D bar graph, but it will look like vintage early 2000s stuff.  I'm not saying that Open Office or Google Docs will do you any better in this regard, but if you are paying for software, you want the latest and greatest and the the bar has been raised for bar graphs since 2007.This is especially a problem when using templates.  The choice of templates for WP is limited and really a throwback to a bygone age.  Everything is flat and unengaging.  My 12-year-old can create a professional looking newsletter for her class in Microsoft Office 2013 or iWork.  You just open the template, lay down some text, and swap out a few pictures.  Wham!  Courtesy of easy-to-use-software, it looks like she's some kind of document prodigy.I suppose it could be done in WP X7, but it would take a lot of picture imports and grunt work to get the text to line up.  That said, picture enhancements are virtually nonexistent: you will have to edit the picture before putting it into a WP document.  Moreover, there are no frames, no instant alpha/background removal,  and no reflection options.  Shadows are possible in drawn objects but are a flat, unrealistic gray, whereas in Word and iWork, they are realistic and make objects look like they are floating off the page.MISCELLANEOUS ANACHRONISTIC FEATURESNot to get off track, there are some other anachronistic features worth highlighting.  I'm all for remembering old friends, but it's been a long time since I've cared to save a document in Ami Pro 1.2-3.0, DisplayWrite 4.0 to 5.0, MultiMate 3.3-4.0 format, Professional Write 1.0-2.2, Volkswriter 4, Wordstar 2.2 to 2000 3.0, and (!) XyWrite III Plus 3.55-4.0.  According to Wikipedia, there is an article from 1986 titled, ""Volkswriter 3 Is a Word Processor Not Likely To Be Outgrown,"" but I haven't seen hide nor hair of it since 1991.Why they included AmiPro and some other dead (and nearly dead) word processors from the 80s and 90s and forgot to add open document format (.odt) capabilities is a mystery to me. I would be ecstatic about the old formats if I was a Luddite and my trusty Kaypro 10 just crashed a final, horrible crash; but in the modern age--and the age of Google Docs and OpenOffice variants--open document format is just more useful.NOTE: in the student edition, you can SAVE to PDF but you CANNOT import from PDF.  For that you need the professional version.  I think this is a major misstep from the WordPerfect folks.  If you are trying to sell a second tier program to the public, you need to supply it with options that make it more attractive than the 'gold standard.' PDF import capabilities might have separated this out from the pack.NO CLOUD CAPABILITIESCorel Office X7 has no cloud capabilities.  Sure, with Microsoft, you will have to pay for this.  But Apple provides iCloud and Google Office is a native cloud-based office suite.  These days, accessibility is important and the ability to save documents to the cloud is almost expected.WORDPERFECT X7The overall experience is not all that different from using OpenOffice, LibreOffice, or Google Docs.  If you are writing simple, unadorned documents this is an easy word processor to use.The spell check was easy and conventional.  The grammar checker was strictly okay but sub par when compared to the Microsoft Word version.Conversion of the more conventional Microsoft Office documents was strictly okay.  Anything with heavy formatting (such as a newsletter) came up with an error or all ajumble.You can insert footnotes and endnotes within the program, but it does not appear to be compatible with standard reference tracking software such as Zotero or Stat!Ref. There is apparently a work around for Zotero, involving .rtf files and having Zotero itself insert the references without using a word processor, but this means that you won't be able embed references in real time.  Reference Manager had a plug in for WordPerfect X3, but I do not know whether they maintained WP compatibility.  Lack of a plug in for a major reference manager may limit the use of WP for those in academia.What Wordperfect does far better than Word or Apple's Pages is reveal the edit codes.  Reveal codes actually allow you to easily clean up wonky formatting.  Once you see where the word processor went wrong, you can delete the codes that are causing the quirky display and easily move right along.  Word does this in some shape or form, but it's not as good as WP.  I really don't know if this is even an option for Apple's Pages.If you want to create complicated and professional documents with ease, this is not the word processor for you. With a lack of templates and old-fashioned style options, any stylized document will look like you designed it 10 years ago.  If you really want to make a modern looking document, you would have to fashion the graphics using another program and import them as pictures in WP.PRESENTATIONSYou could argue that spit and polish in text documents is just vanity, but in presentation software the glitz is the stuff that presentations are made of.Basic templates are a wash here.  The available templates are flat, dull, and uncharismatic.  You can import Powerpoint templates, but the more complicated ones don't translate all that well.  Free office suite options also have fairly cruddy stock templates, but seem to translate Powerpoint ones better.Slide making is easy enough, it is just that the options are limited.  The transitions are limited and really stink compared to Powerpoint or Apple's Presentations.  There are options for flow sheets and embedding graphs, but the results are fairly crappy and two dimensional compared to Microsoft and Apple options.  Animation options are there, but control is limited.  There is little difference between WP Presentations and the other non-paying options.You can import Powerpoint format but the results are less than stellar.  Complicated animations are usually way off, backgrounds can be skewed, pictures may change positions, picture backgrounds eliminated in Powerpoint may return (or the picture may be rendered as square with a white background), and even the text is usually skewed or set in the wrong place.  More complicated presentations will require a lot of clean up.  Once thing that was particularly irksome is that shadowed text from a Powerpoint presentation looked more like double letters when things were converted over to WP Presentations.If all you want is a simple presentation, Presentations will work out okay.  However, the standard for design has changed over the past 10 years, and what looked good in 2004 looks silly and dated in 2014.  Say what you will about style over substance, but style is truly what modern presentation software is about.QUATTROPRONo major complaints other than the interface.  The program functions like a standard spreadsheet program.  It is simple to input data and manipulate it.The problem is that Quattro Pro X7 does very little to separate itself from the free competition. The fact is that Microsoft Excel, for all its flaws, is the corporate standard here.  It has more mathematical functions and operations than Quattro Pro and the macros are not compatible cross platform.  Moreover, there are a lot of third party plug-ins for Excel that won't work in Quattro Pro.Realize, though, that Quattro Pro is more mathematically adept than any of the free office suites.  It appears to be more sophisticated, function wise, than Apple's Numbers as well.  Microsoft, however, still has a little edge at baseline and after you consider the third party add ons, Excel probably wins the race of the most 'functional' spreadsheet program.In terms of displaying your data, Quattro Pro is unable to beat the competition.  You cannot make attractive graphs the same way that you can in Excel or Apple's Numbers (with Apple taking a major lead in this category).  Microsoft and especially Apple's Numbers can really display data in a meaningful and attractive way that Quattro Pro simply can't. Back in the day, you might have crunched your numbers in a spreadsheet and then exported them to another program, like SigmaPlot, to get a more attractive picture or have a better way to display the data.  Nowadays, for all but the most rigorous and scientific-based users, there is little need to have one program to crunch some data and another to display it.  For most power users and corporate users, Excel or Numbers does a fine in manipulating and displaying the data attractively. Quattro Pro can crunch with the best of them, but loses in terms of display.LIGHTNINGLightning is an okay digital notebook.It is eminently usable but it's interface is simply not as attractive or easy to use as Microsoft's One Note (it's very Windows 2000 in feel).  This is made worse by the fact that there are programs like Evernote that take the note idea to the next level, with a more modern interface and a way to access your notes on the web or from your mobile devices.CONCLUSIONCorel Office X7 is not a bad office suite, it just has almost little to recommend it above the free options out there.  I am not averse to spending money on software that makes my life easier.  However, there is little here that is all that different and a lot that is regressive about Office X7 in comparison to the free office versions out there.  The particular standout in the free field was (surprisingly) the desktop version of Kingsoft Office.  It is more limited than Microsoft Office but it is a virtual clone of Microsoft Office.  If you have lighter needs and are used to Microsoft products, Kingsoft isn't a bad way to go.Corel Office X7 offers stability and a better price point the Microsoft, but it lacks in areas of compatibility and has an aging and clunky interface.  As I stated before, the bones of this program are good.  There is no reason why Corel couldn't give this product a long, overdue overhaul and set things right. Additionally, if they threw in some cloud capability, worked with third party vendors for some major plug-ins and tie ins, and added value (e.g. advanced PDF capabilities, eBook capabilities that they offer in their `professional' version) at a lower price point, they could potentially have a winner.  But as things stand, there is little here that you can't get free and when the free competition is actually easier to use, it's hard to justify this software at any price.Sadly, I cannot recommend this product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XS7321DSMPOZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JC5Y6YA#wasThisHelpful","R2XS7321DSMPOZ","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"PROS:Relatively straightforward constructionAdjusts from about 4 to 7 basket heightSturdy for a basketball hoop with a weighted basePlays like a real basketball hoopHoop will accomodate regulation sized basketballsCONS:Included tools will work but things go much faster with a ratchet setNot regulation heightAs with any freestanding, weighted-base hoop there will be some movement with playOVERVIEW:The SKLZ Pro Mini Hoop Poolside System is a scaled-down version of a regulation free-standing hoop that would work well at poolside or can be used on-ground as a nice starter system for children.  It is easy to put together, is built to last, and has all the features you would expect of its larger cousins in a smaller package.CONTENTS OF THE BOXInside the box you will find the many parts to the hoop itself, a deflated mini-basketball, two disposable wrenches to help with construction, and the instructions.PUTTING IT TOGETHERUnlike many, similar products, the SKLZ product was easy enough to put together.  The directions were helpful, albeit the writing and the diagrams were nearly microscopic.  That said, my kit went together without a hitch.  Im somewhat methodical when I do these things but constructed it solo in under an hour.  There are some parts to the contruction that might work a bit better with 4 hands, but 2 hands were sufficient.  The included wrenches could be used to put the thing together, but as with most such equipment its better to use your own tools if you have them.  I tried valiantly to make it work with the included tools, which probably explains the time requirement.  About half way through I gave it up and went with my ratchet set.  If I started with the ratchet set, it would have sped things up considerably.One bit of advice: be careful not to overtighten the bolts that connect the net to the backboard: if you do the net will angle downwards.  There is also a nut at the base of the spring behind the net that can be loosened or tightened to make the basket level.FUN AND GAMESThe mini-hoop set up itself is nice. The traditional black and orange have been changed to an attractive aqua and white (ostesnibly to match the usual outdoor pool colors).  The hoop is easily adjustable with the pull of a single pin to  itself is scaled down, and adjusts from a minimum of about 4 feet to a maximum height of 7 feet high.  This may disappoint some budding LeBrons and Kobes, but you have to realize that this hoop was really meant as a pool side hoop.  When you are shooting a basket from inside a pool, you are probably standing in at least 4 feet of water--a standard sized hoop at poolside would be a towering 14 feet high for you.  So as a poolside rig, this thing is about right.  If you are using it, as I do, as a hoop for kids, this is just about the right height for the 14 year old and under set.But it is even fun for adults.  Sure its smaller, but when you play with the pint sized basketball that comes with it, its a fun and fast game.  Also, its nice to be able to dunk at 54, something I can never do on a 10 foot hoop! (I almost feel like Yao Ming!)  Whats really nice, though, is that the hoop really plays like the big boys.  SKLZ didnt build it cheap just because it is a small hoop.  There will always be a little jiggling with a free standing hoop that is not anchored in the ground, but this one is one of the more solid hoops out there.  Additonally, the backboard is solid acrylic and doesnt bend or warp when you hit it hard with a basketball.  The hoop itself behaves like a regulation basketball hoop, with a spring at the bottom.  You get the idea that this set up will have some staying power.The hoop is wide enough to accomodate a regulation sized basketball.  However, given the heft of a regulation sized ball and the relative weight of the apparatus and smaller sized base, you will cause jiggling and movement if you slam the net with the basketball pretty hard.  But you can definitely go nuts with the pint sized ball.This is a nice little mini-hoop that thinks like a regulation sized basketball set up.  Rather than making a flimsy kiddie hoop, SKLZ has worked small but thought big.  This hoop works well at poolside and would be a great, free standing hoop for smaller children who are learning how to play. (It really beats the pants off of the usual, little-kid mini-basketball hoops.)  Its even fun for a casual one-on-one for upper teens and adults.  Its different kind of game, where even at 55 I can showcase my dunking skills.  Its good for a whole lot of non-regulation, summer fun!

"PROS:Sturdy constructionBlades self-contained in the mandolineSimple adjustment for thickness of cut5 different bladesComfortable hand guard on hopperCONS:Individual blades are hand wash only (the body is dishwasher safe, though)No safety cover when storingCourse and fine grating results are not much differentThe Cuispiro Hand Held Mandoline is a reasonable iteration of this simple type of kitchen device with a couple featues that make it stand out in the field.Mandoline slicers are simple kitchen devices that basically use a slant board and a reverse mounted blade to help yo quickly slice fruits and vegetables into uniform slices with little effort. The food is placed in a hand held hopper so that you dont accidentally slice your finger as you are trying to slice the food.  Different conformations of blades can be placed on the slantboard to cut or grate food to order.  Handheld slicers llike this seem to work best for quick, small to medium sized jobs.  If you are looking at doing your slicing in bulk, it probably makes more sense to bring out the food processor or similar device.The Cuisipro has a large, easy to grip, rubberized handle.  It has rubberized feet that do not slip on the countertop and a notch at the base so that it is easy to use over a bowl.  Blades are conveniently stored on the mandoline itself.  This is a nice feature as you dont have to worry about losing a blade, but it does limit the number of blade choices that may be used. The blades are engaged by slipping them into the active slot and do not require any complex snapping or mounting procedure.  This is a nice touch, as mandoline blades tend to be quite sharp and many an injury can occur snappinga blacde in and out of a device.  There are  3 blades that can be configured for basic slicing, crinkle cutting, waffle cutting, French fry cutting, julienning (thinner than a fry cut), and grating.  The blades comfortablly snap in and snap out and the way it works there is little risk for injury.  There is a knob on the side to adjust the thickness of the cut, which is also a nice tough.The hopper is oversized and has three metal prongs that keep your food in place.  The grip is easy to hold and, once a vegetable is secured, it is easy enough to cut.  That said, some things work better in the hopper than others.  Potatoes and apples seemed to work the best for me.  Carrots and parsnips are difficult to slice, unless you are slicing the thicker bases, as they arent held all that well by the three metal prongs.  Onions were a mixed bag.  If you are trying to slice an onion that is on the mushier side, forget it.  A crisp, firm Vidalia, though, worked just fine for me.The actual slicing worked really well for potatoes, sweet potatoes, and apples.  Anything large and crisp seemed to work the best.  The blades are razor sharp and you can quickly slice through a large, crisp veggie easily and get nice uniform slices no matter what the setting.  Things like carrots and parsnips are generally too narrow to work in the hopper.  You can easily do them if you forgo the hopper; this is not recommended, however, as it is all too easy to slice your finger.  Once again, less crispy vegetables and slightly soft onions did not work well at all in this system and should probably be done in a food processor.The grating attachment has two sides.  One for a fine and the other for a more coarse grate.  I didnt see much of a difference in the size of the final product.  The mandoline works better with hard cheeses but will have a more difficult time grating softer varieties.  The blades themselves appear to be well made.  Its hard to say, of course, how well the blades will hold up over time.One issue I had with this mandoline is that there is no cover for the blades when storing the device. Most of the blades are safely stowed on the machine but there is always on exposed in the cutting position and there should have been a safety cover on this for storage.  Cleaning the blades must be done by hand and is something that you will have to do in a very careful manner, as the blades are very sharp.  It would have been nice if the blades could be cleaned in the dishwasher.This is not the most advanced mandolin device on the market and only has limited number of blades.  However it does work as expected and is quick and easy to use kitchen tool.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYAA1O4U9BDNZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IUMLQV2#wasThisHelpful","RYAA1O4U9BDNZ","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disobeying Hitler, by Randall Hansen, is a study of resistance against Hitler during the Third Reich. The book is clearly written by a scholar in this area and is likely of academic significance. However, as a lay reader I found myself wanting to like the book more than I did.The book starts with a cursory description of Operation Valkyrie,  the July 20, 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler led by GeneralFredrich Olbricht,  Major General Henning von Tresckow, and Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. He then describes the aftermath, where distinguished Nazis such as Rommel turned against Hitler because they felt the war was hopeless.  Although Valkyrie failed, Hansen suggests that it became a rallying point for all subsequent, meaningful resistance to the Nazis.After describing Valkyrie and its aftermath, Hansen goes on to describe the actions of a number of German Generals who defied Hitler's 1945 Nero Decree that ordered a scorched earth policy.  Instead of  blowing up bridges, demolishing factories, demolishing the water supply, doing irreparable damage to the power grid, and fighting the allies to the last man, a number of Nazi generals took it upon themselves to put up only a token resistance and ignore Hitler's orders and defying the SS.  By doing this, these renegade generals preserved European cities and avoided countless civilian deaths from collateral damage and starvation.  This also prevented a major post World War II refugee problem.Hansen describes in detail how the actions of General Dietrich von Choltitz preserved Paris and likely saved the lives of countless Parisians.  He then goes on to describe how similar actions of other commanders, backed up by civilian lobbying, saved cities such as Dusseldorf and Heidelberg.  The stories of the cities are interesting, but there are times where Hansen gets bogged down describing troop movements in detail or lingers too long on the motivations of the allies.  The detailed descriptions, of course, are of great academic importance, but are tedious for the casual reader.Hansen also vividly describes how the actions of Albert Speer in thwarting the Nero Decree.  Speer used the Nazi bureaucracy to add layers of approvals that were required to implement the scorched earth policy and urging Nazi generals to avoid unnecessary self-sacrifice and destruction.  Hansen does an excellent job of painting a vivid picture of a very complex man.  In the end, though, it didn't really change my opinion of Speer all that much.  Speer never renounced Nazi ideals, he just knew that the war was lost.  In the end, he acted more for self preservation than anything else.  Even when you read Speer's own writings, it seems clear that he was acting to save what was left of Germany and had a vision that he would become a major leader in Germany's post war reconstruction.In Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, William Shirer pretty much sums up German resistance during the war as too little, too late.  Shirer felt that German resistance in the latter part of WWII did not represent a real change in heart within the German military.  Few were swayed by ethical concerns regarding Holocaust victims.  Most were motivated by self preservation and the understanding that there was no value in destroying cities and fighting on when the war was already lost.Hansen's book definitely gets the point across that Shirer's view only works when you are looking from the outside in.  It would have been far less of a personal risk--even the path of least resistance--for leaders in the Wehrmacht to toe the party line and simply follow orders.  Those commanders who refused to do Hitler's bidding avoided needless civilian and army casualties and avoided needless destruction of European cities.  However, they put themselves at great personal risk to do so, and because of this some commanders paid the ultimate price for this.The book is a very detailed account of Nazi post resistance and certainly has a great academic value and merit.  Unfortunately, it is a difficult read and is hard to recommend to the more casual reader.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39UI54RMAZ3C9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0199927928#wasThisHelpful","R39UI54RMAZ3C9","A2VW4FYZILSXF2","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VW4FYZILSXF2?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have purchased Hemp Hearts from this company before, and I liked the taste/flavor. I saw these come across in my Vine account, which means that I get to try the bars as long as I leave a review. I was excited and just had my first bar for breakfast....and I was very disappointed.First, the good. The ingredients are few- hemp hearts, organic coconut palm sugar, organic brown rice syrup, dried apple, cinnamon, organic apple flavor, pectin, organic sunflower oil, organic caramel flavor, rosemary extract. Yeah, a good dose of sugar (10g) in the bar, but overall, nothing too offensive. You get a good dose of protein (10g) and Omega 3's & 6's (10g total...doesn't say what the split is on each omega). One bar only has 230 calories.Second, why I was disappointed- the taste. As I said, I really, really wanted to like these bars. But the taste just wasn't that good. I could definitely pick up the hemp heart flavor (which I don't mind), but the apples and cinnamon flavor was so minimal. Overall, it was quite bland. And you know how you have an initial flavor, and as you keep chewing, that flavor might change? I wasn't a fan of the second flavor. I almost stopped eating the bar halfway through, but I trucked on, hoping that maybe it would get better if I finished the bar. It didn't.Taste is so subjective, so maybe you'll enjoy the bars. I would perhaps find them in a health food store and try one bar before you go ahead and buy a whole box like this....that way, if you don't like them, you're not stuck with a ton of them! I wish I could say better things- I really do- but I just am not a fan.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13ERCAXRYIR88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014852WIK#wasThisHelpful","R13ERCAXRYIR88","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

However, just because it's simple doesn't mean it's cheap in quality.

"This is a pretty nice light! I have it next to my computer and love how it doesn't create glare on my screen. I have it on the brightest setting, and I think it's nice that you can dim it if needed (by holding your finger on the area that turns the lamp on). There is no on/off switch as you might expect- instead, at the top of the lamp, you just have to touch the power ""area"" and the light comes on.I like how the light is flexible, since it has an arm. On the bottom of the unit, it even comes with a hex wrench- in case the joints get loose, you can tighten them back up. I appreciate how the base is flat- while the base is large, this ability saves space in a way since I can stack items on top of the base of the lamp. Finally, I also like that it has the capability of charging up an item via USB (there is one port at the front of the base). Neat idea!My only qualm is that it's not the most attractive thing in the world to me. It's pretty narrow so it doesn't stand out horribly or anything, but it looks a little....robotic, in a way....to me. It probably would look great modern/tech-y style room. The look wasn't enough to really knock down the lamp's rating to 4 stars....it's more of an opinion rather than a malfunction/item issue.Overall, practical, great use of space, good light (and it's a nice, white, bright light too- great for reading/desk work!).

"First of all, let me state that I received this machine for free so I could use it and review it. I am in no way affiliated with the company, so this is my honest review of the item. Secondly, note that this a review from the point of view of a barista- I have about 5 years of experience between working in a coffee shop in college, and again, most recently, during some weekends throughout the school year + during the summer (I am a full time teacher otherwise!). Finally, when I make lattes and cappuccinos at home, I use a Moka pot to brew espresso on the stove and an Aeroccino machine to froth milk. It's been a fine way to make my favorite drinks, but can take awhile and sometimes it would be nice to have something a bit more automatic (it's easy to burn espresso on the stove/with the Moka pot if you're not careful! I find it difficult to make consistently good coffee with it).My first impressions of the machine- it is very sleek, somewhat heavy (not a problem for me, but just an observation), not too big, and it was packaged well. The various compartments are intuitive to put back together if you take them apart, but you definitely need to read the instructions before using the machine for the first time. That part was a little obnoxious- the instructions are quite detailed and lengthy- and I'm the type of person who would rather have someone just SHOW me what to do. It would be nice if the company had the manual PLUS access to visual instructions, like a link to a YouTube video or a DVD of info that would come along with the machine.Needless to say, I figured it out and eventually had my machine running. Note that in the instructions, it does say that it takes 3-4 brews before the espresso tastes the best.Other things:- WATER HARDNESS: When you first set up the machine, it will have you do a hardness test on your water. The machine ""knows"" how often you need to descale it, based on your water hardness, and will notify you as needed (cleaning fluid comes with the machine).- WATER FILTER: I like that the machine also comes with a water filter (it says you should replace it about every 2 months, but if you do not use the machine often, you'll have to replace it after about 3 weeks).- ADDING COFFEE: I LOVE that you can either add whole beans to the machine, and it will grind them as needed (and yes, the grind can be adjusted if the machine tells you it's too fine), and you can also use pre-ground coffee. I have some espresso already ground for my Moka pot, and I'm excited to be able to use it in the machine.- COOL FEATURES: the machine has neat features like changing the brew strength of the espresso; there's a 2x feature to brew a double shot or increase the amount of milk in your drink; it has a ""clean"" feature for the froth wand and steams it clean, like a barista does with the big espresso machines; the top of the machine has a cup warmer; you can adjust the espresso nozzles to come down closer to the cup, which helps make the espresso creamier; and so much more.- CLEANING: I haven't had to do a full cleaning of my machine yet, but after I brewed a couple shots, it was simple to take out the bottom tray and rid of any water that it caught + clean out the espresso grounds. The milk container is dishwasher safe and can be washed as needed (and should be washed often, it suggests).Overall- it's an awesome machine that makes great coffee shop-quality drinks. The froth is great, the shots are delicious....the mechanization of the machine makes it so easy to use (once you get the hang of it). While a Moka pot and an Aeroccino (my old way of making fancy drinks) are definitely easier to clean/maintain than this machine, I do like the automation and consistency in the taste of the drinks. On the con side, the Moka and Aeroccino have fewer parts and are less likely to break (or are at least not too expensive to replace)- this machine has so many working parts that if it breaks, it might be hard to fix (it does have a warranty with it, of course).I find that with having experience as a barista, it was easier for me to understand how to work and clean the machine; if you are not as familiar with ""fancy"" coffee drinks, it might take you a bit longer to get the hang of it. But once you do, it will be smooth sailing! I can see this machine functioning in a home (if you can afford it....it *is* quite expensive), in an office, or even in a restaurant. I can see small restaurants using a machine like this to make some good espresso drinks. It wouldn't do well in a place with super high coffee demand- you would want a bigger machine for that for sure. But for personal use/small business use, it is quite perfect.I am pleased! My machine will definitely be used often!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MTWODMXRUGDD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YCP6RBA#wasThisHelpful","R2MTWODMXRUGDD","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note that this vacuum is not for using across a large floor carpet....if that were the case, I would not be giving this vacuum 5 stars. The provided attachments do allow for such cleaning, but if you try, you'll find yourself stooped over (unless you're shorter...I'm 5'7"") and it takes a lot longer to do the whole floor that way. So, on to my review in regards to what the vacuum IS made for-First, upon opening and setting up the vacuum, I thought that it was pretty neat-looking. I also noticed that it was pretty compact and lightweight. Other features- the cord is stored in the vacuum's body (you push a button to ""suck"" it back in), it can be rolled around on the carpet upright (like in the picture) or laying on its side, and the button to turn it on/off (as well as to retract the cord) are large/easy to press/easy to find.I used the vacuum on a variety of surfaces. I didn't think the cord would be long enough for what I was doing, but I was actually able to reach into three rooms in my house without a problem (the length of the hose and the body of the vacuum provide extra length). I immediately noticed how QUIET the vacuum was, and I was impressed! My Dirt Devil (that is a mock Dyson) is pretty darn loud, so this was a nice change. Here is what happened on each floor (note that there are settings to switch between for each floor type):- On the carpet, as mentioned before, it worked, but would be more tedious than using an upright vacuum.- On the kitchen linoleum floor, the suction was so powerful that right under where I was working, it started to pull up a bit (oops! Thankfully no permanent damage) and so I stopped right away and won't be using it on that floor again :P.- On the area rugs, it did a great job pulling up visible dirt and seemed to work very well- On the hardwood floor, it sucked up all my dog's lost hair SO well. The shape of the attachment allowed me to get closer to baseboards and areas that my upright vacuum cannot do (unless you bring out the hose part). I was very impressed!As I mentioned earlier, there is also a furniture setting, and I can imagine that the vacuum would be great to use in that case too.I'm not a huge fan of the fact that it's a bag vacuum (I like bagless because then I don't have to keep buying bags!), but since I won't be using it to clean whole floors all the time, I can imagine I won't go through a ton of bags anyway.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F5U1I1AO6C91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00US4DNMU#wasThisHelpful","R1F5U1I1AO6C91","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall, this is a very nice planner. Things I like about it:- The color scheme- I like the natural brown and with the splash of orange color- The fact that it is spiral-bound, so it lays flat when you open it- The size of the planner- when opened flat, it is the size of a sheet of paper (8.5x11)- The months are tabbed- The whole-month calendar for each month has plenty of space to write in- The weekly calendar pages have plenty of space to write in- There is a plastic pocket in the back cover to hold loose papers, like business cards or folded sheets- The whole thing seems pretty durableWhat I don't like about it:- The weekly calendar pages go from Monday to Sunday. I'm used to calendars starting on Sunday and going through Saturday. I will get used to it, but it is different from all other weekly planners that I have used.Hey, only one thing I don't like about it- not too shabby!

"This is the first electric stapler I've owned, and I am definitely impressed. Note that it is somewhat large, so if you don't have a lot of desk area, you might not wast this bad boy hogging your small space. The stapler has little suction cups at the bottom, which are nice for holding the unit down. The cord is a little short in my opinion, but for me, at least it's still long enough to reach where I need it to go. When I received the stapler, it came with both standard staples as well as heavy duty staples. In terms of functionality, I think it's great!As I said, this is my first electric stapler. When I set it up and loaded it with staples (which was quite easy to do), I put in the heavy duty staples, I putzed around by stapling a single sheet of paper (just to see how the thing worked), and WOAH- 1) the machine is a little loud, and 2) I learned NOT use heavy duty staples for non-heavy duty jobs!! It saw that it poked the legs of the staples back through the front of the paper in a dangerous way!!! I switched back to standard staples, and found that if you are using the machine to staple 2 pieces of paper together, it's still way more force than you need. If you are stapling simple things, use a good ol' fashioned hand stapler. But as you need to staple thicker packets, the Swingline makes the process fast and easy.So if you can get over the fact that the stapler is a little bulky, the cord might be a little short for your needs, and it's a little loud when it staples (the 3 reasons why I give it 4 stars instead of 5), you'll have no problem with this machine, which works and works well!

"I have gone to PT on and off for a couple years for a bad knee, and most recently, for Piriformis Syndrome. In both cases, I have used a Bosu and I loved it. I found a couple at the place I work out at and started using the Bosu's there; I really wanted one at home, but was deterred by the cost. Needless to say, I loved using one so much that I finally just sucked it up and bought one. I'm so glad I did!While the foot pump isn't the best (as other reviews mention), it *does* work. As I started to inflate the Bosu, I thought it was going to take FOREVER to inflate, but it wasn't as awful as I thought. I was able to inflate it properly, put the peg in (that blocks the air hole) without any issues, and I have been using the Bosu for a couple weeks without any issues whatsoever. The DVD that came with it is pretty cheesy, but I bought the Bosu for the Bosu, not the workout video, so I don't really care.As I mentioned before, these are a little expensive....but with how often I use mine (since I don't go to the gym to work out every day) for my own exercises plus my PT exercises, it was well worth the cost.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30RBQ7JCLNDII/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AQ4F19K#wasThisHelpful","R30RBQ7JCLNDII","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My crummy apartment kitchen floor gets dirty very easily, especially in winter. I have cleaned it using a sponge mop, wet mop, and cleaning it on my hands and knees with a sponge/rag. The sponge mop only pushed around the dirt, the wet mop left the floor too soppy, and cleaning on my hands/knees was thorough but time-consuming and tedious.Lo and behold, the Shark mop. When it arrived, it looked intimidating, but was actually very easy to set up. I like that it can be used as both a stand-up mop, but you can also remove the main part, attach a hose, and use it to clean things like the shower. Once set up, the mop is still very easy to use- you fill the little pitcher with water, pour it in the green section of the mop, plug it in, turn it on, let it warm up (about 30 sec), and then mop away!There are many reasons why I love this mop. First, the fact that it steam cleans without needing chemicals (it explicitly states not to use chemicals or essential oils on the tank) makes my ""green"" heart happy. Second, and another thing that makes this mop eco-friendly, is that all of the scrubbing cloths are removable and washable. No needing to purchase special pads (like a Swiffer mop)- just wash and re-use. Third, I love the mop because it is effective and easy! I was able to quickly scrub my kitchen floor with this thing.....it picked up more dirt than my old sponge mop, the floor dried almost right away unlike my wet mop, and it was MUCH more efficient/easy than doing the cleaning on my hands and knees. Oh, and another plus- the cord is decently long, so you can clean a kitchen quite easily (assuming you don't have a ginormous kitchen or other area to clean).I feel that with the ease of use, the effectiveness of the cleaning treatment, and how simple the mop is to set up/take apart, I will be cleaning my floor a lot more often than I used to, and not hating the job as much as before!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18W36527DXQI1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OLAVM02#wasThisHelpful","R18W36527DXQI1","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Initially, I WAS a fan of this backpack. I viewed it as a nice work backpack- it has a pocket built in for a laptop in the main compartment, has TONS of other pockets and spaces, and feels quite durable. I used it to bike to work, and I was a fan. It was comfortable, and I liked the chest strap- it made the backpack feel more secure as I biked.When considering what type of review to give this product (I received it free to test it out and make a review), I was considering 4 stars- overall, I liked it, but the main compartment seemed a little small. Yes, the main part can fit a laptop, but the space seems ""tight."" This backpack is designed for travel too, so if you were to use it as a carry on, the limited amount of space makes sense....but I wish it was just a little larger. The top opening also felt a little awkward but I figured I just had to get used to it (it doesn't open like a ""normal"" backpack- it's a U-shaped zipper at the top).As I was looking at the tag, seeing if there was anything else I should include in my review, my stomach dropped when I read the following:""California Proposition 65 Warning: this product contains chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer, or birth defects, or other reproductive harm.""My views of the product immediately diminished.

"I've had hormone regulation issues since my thyroid was removed 3 years ago (cancer)- when I went off my birth control about 6 months after my surgery (my acne seemed to be under control), I didn't get a period for a year. I eventually went back on the pill (turns out my adult acne was only taunting me....it came back pretty bad). While it worked for a couple months, I eventually started getting my period every 2 weeks. Definitely not fun.I actually didn't start taking EPO for acne reasons- I was interested more in hormone regulation and weight loss. While I did not experience weight loss (I'm not overweight, but I have about 10-15 extra pounds I'd like to shed), I have experienced some hormone balance. Granted, I'm on a new birth control pill and that might be helping too, my acne patches have faded TREMENDOUSLY and I rarely get zits anymore (which is a big deal, since my acne is cystic). I actually didn't put 2 and 2 together right away.....I came back on Amazon and read reviews about how it really helped some people's acne....and I realized that my face clearing correlated with taking the full dose (3 pills, 2x/day) consistently.So while the EPO might not help you shed those last pounds (CLA might, though! I saw some success with that), if you have adult acne issues, this might be your answer. The results won't be immediate, but I couldn't be happier with the (accidental) results!

"This is a really nice furniture set! Setting it up was not too difficult. The instructions were easy to follow and assembly went relatively quickly. It would have been helpful if the pieces were labeled to match the labels in the instructions (for example, if the arm marked ""a"" in the instructions also had a sticker with the letter ""a"" on it on the physical arm). Such labeling would have helped a bit and maybe would have sped up initial setup, but overall, it was pretty intuitive and went quickly!The set is absolutely beautiful. It is attractive to look at and actually very comfortable! I'm 5'7"" and can comfortably stretch out on the couch. My head has to be propped up a bit on the arm to fit with my legs straight out, but it's actually in a comfortable pillow-like way. My dog jumped up on it and looked pretty comfortable and happy with the set as well!The chairs are wide and super comfy as well. When I sat down in a chair the first time, I immediately designated it as a perfect reading chair! Because it's wide, I could curl up in the chair quite easily. I could probably sit side-by-side with someone else my size or smaller in one of those chairs.The table is nice, too. It looks elegant with the glass piece and rounds out the look of the set very well.Overall, as I said, it's such a beautiful furniture set. I haven't decided if I want it outdoors on the patio yet (How will it hold up to the weather? Will the cushions fade?) or if I want it indoors (it does function as an indoor/outdoor set). I could really see it in either location. If I put it outside and any weathering occurs, I will be sure to come back and update my review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q1JPPSU3K5I8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IV35WHY#wasThisHelpful","R1Q1JPPSU3K5I8","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ended up with a hamstring injury playing racquetball; I'm a runner and continued to irritate the injury on a regular basis. I always felt like compression on the area would be helpful, so I looked for a wrap and settled on this one after comparing many brands on Amazon. I tried to run with it and had the slipping issues that others mention in their reviews. In general, I feel like the wrap is just too bulky when it's on- I experimented one day wearing it under my pants to work (to see if a couple hours of compression made a difference) and it was just too thick to wear that way.I'm just not a fan of this compression wrap. It didn't stay tight enough, slipped, and was too bulky.

"I went Paleo a couple of years ago, and when I did, my tastes changed drastically. I now like just about every vegetable (in the past, I was very narrow in veggies I'd eat). So it helps that I already like that vegetal taste...makes it easier to actually enjoy taking Amazing Grass! I like AG because it helps me make sure I'm getting enough nutrients. I also like the company- they are very conscious and I like supporting themThis stuff IS drinkable in water, but I definitely prefer it in almond milk. In water, I found that the water needs to be cold. I normally prefer room temp water, but I don't like the way the powder tastes in warmer water....at all. With cold water, it's better (but sometimes still makes me scrunch my nose). However, as I mentioned, in almond milk- this stuff is great! I always buy unsweetened almond milk (sometimes vanilla, sometimes plain) and the AG has a sweetness to it that compliments the taste of the almond milk. I think it's quite delicious and I look forward to drinking it each day!I used to drink it in the morning, but I have no thyroid and remembered that calcium can interfere with medication absorption. Almond milk is almost always fortified with lots of calcium, so if you are on levothyroxine or synthroid and you prefer to drink AG with almond milk (or other fortified milks), be careful when you drink it. You should wait 3 hours between taking meds and consuming lots of calcium. I always drink my AG in the afternoon to make sure I don't mess with my levo absorption!The 17 oz canister is a good size and it comes with a scoop to portion out servings. I keep it in the fridge since it suggests the powder should be stored in a cool, dry place. I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31U64KL04YN97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038B3AAK#wasThisHelpful","R31U64KL04YN97","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been working on transitioning over to tea instead of coffee (less caffeine, more antioxidants and things, etc). A couple of years ago, I would have hated this tea (or any tea, for that matter). But now, as I have been expanding my tea tastes, I find that I really, really like this black breakfast tea.I may not be a tea snob who knows the difference between blends and whatnot (I WAS a coffee snob for sure!), so you have to take my review as being from someone who enjoys drinking tea is definitely not an expert.As the package states, it's a full-bodied, strong tea. That's probably why I like it so much, since coffee has those same characteristics. I probably make it on the weaker side, though; it suggests using 1-2 tsp per 8oz water, and when I'm given a range, I always use the smaller amount in 16 oz water (so I do 1 tsp per 16 oz). It suggests steeping from 3-5 minutes, and so I did 4. I do not add milk or sugar to my tea.....if I struggle with the taste of a tea, I'll add some stevia. I find that I can drink this tea black with no issues, and I actually ENJOY the taste!I like the sleek look of the package (a minor detail, but being eye-catching helps sell stuff from a marketing standpoint). I appreciate that it is resealable. I also like the fact that the leaves are NOT in tea bags- then I can use my re-usable steeper and avoid bleached bags/creating more waste. Loose leaf teas are also more economical, as most people know.Looking forward to drinking this tea often- and also making kombucha with it once my current batch is ready and consumed  :).","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EN0IMU11BTFO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KGUQDKA#wasThisHelpful","R3EN0IMU11BTFO","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The main reason I gave this label maker 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is GIANT. It reminds me of a mini-typewriter! Despite that, it's quite the neat little machine.For starters, it is in intuitive. I put in the printer tape without reading the instructions. I was able to figure out how to print right off the bat and was impressed by the variety of designs, symbols, and fun things you can pick from to print on your labels.When you connect the label maker to the computer, it's a little less intuitive. Plugging in the USB and turning on the machine will install some basic drivers, but you need to go to the Brother website to get the P-touch software. This allows you to design custom labels and print them while your machine is connected to the computer....I love that! I just played around with the software a little bit, but it seems to have many neat features!Overall, an EXCELLENT machine. Nice labels, has an automatic cutter, the display is easy to read/crisp, the keys are easy to access and in QWERTY format (some smaller label makers can be difficult for big fingers), and you can use batteries (6 AA's) OR a cord in the wall.

"I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer at age 25 and underwent a total thyroidectomy, followed by RAI. Over the course of the past three years (that's about how long I've been dealing with being thyroid-less), I have experienced everything from hair falling out, brittle nails, fatigue, heart palpitations, muscle cramps, and ridiculous weight gain. I'm not overweight or fat by any means, but I went from being 145 to 160 in a matter of months (and that's even with following a Paleo-style diet, doing 3 Whole30's over the past two years, and running 3-7 miles a couple times per week).With my weight skyrocketing (despite watching/cutting calories, making sure to exercise, etc), I've been getting more depressed (despite my strong support system of my boyfriend and family, both who reassure me that I am just fine) and turned to Amazon to maybe find a book to help me. I came across this and bought it, not sure if it would speak to me since I am not hypothyroid by blood test levels (thyroid cancer patients are initially run hyperthyroid to make sure the cancer does not come back). But I was frustrated at FEELING hypothyroid despite technically being hyper.Turns out that this book actually DOES pertain to me. The author mentions right off the bat that not having a thyroid, even if running ""hyper"" by blood test, you are still considered hypo. Not all of the chapters in the book pertained to me, but I just skipped those and focused on the ones that did. There's even a chapter near the end just for people who have had thyroid cancer.I really wish someone gave me this book right after my surgery. It was SO comforting to hear the stories of the author (and others) going through the same things that I am right now. When Shomon mentioned that she tried cutting calories/increasing exercise and still gained 1-2 lbs per week, I was so happy.....because it finally made me feel like I'm not alone. I love the chapter on weight loss tips and how Shomon states, straightforwardly, that weight loss for the hypothyroid person WILL be hard. We CANNOT compare ourselves to others or what our bodies did pre-hypothyroidism....because that's not how our bodies work anymore. She states that it's downright unfair that we have to deal with this, but it's not our fault...it's medical...and we have to work with it as best as we can. Persistence & patience are key. While at some level I knew all of this already, it was so comforting to hear it from her; it really helped me start to change the way I think.After reading this book, I feel more empowered. I came to it for weight loss help, but now have a better understanding of my condition (even though, as a science teacher/general science nerd, I thought I already knew a lot!). There were some symptoms that I have that I didn't even realize were thyroid-related....and it's just so nice to know WHY my body is acting the way it is rather than wonder what's wrong with me.This book is a definite must-read for anyone who finds themselves thyroid-less. I am thankful I picked it up!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R157NL9H4GEWYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0060740957#wasThisHelpful","R157NL9H4GEWYM","A2LIPLT5LJTN5B","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2LIPLT5LJTN5B?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have stubborn, cystic acne. I've been through rounds of antibiotics, topical face creams, Proactiv.....just about everything sans the scary Accutane. Being near 30, having such annoying acne is frustrating, but I've been able to get it mostly under control with birth control, Differin, and clindamycin. While I'd prefer to be on all-natural products, they just don't work for me.....except this blemish stick.I wouldn't say that the results are immediate by any means, but when I feel a cyst under my skin (or have a big blemish already appearing), I immediately attack it with this blemish stick. After using it twice a day, after a couple of days, the acne definitely is reduced in size and angry-ness. Someone with less aggressive acne could probably get by using just this...but if you have tough acne like me, you might feel comforted to know that while it won't solve all your problems, it might actually help in addition to whatever else you use.

"Transformative, that is the one word that I would use to describe this amazing cd composed and performed by Tim McCauley. I was first intrigued by it after completing the Namaste Yoga Complete Series 3. This is an awesome album to have. It has 11 tracks that vary in length from 5:08 to 7:39 in length. The tracks are:BahaElevationExalted WarriorThe CircleJaiLotuslandAwakeningVaranasiWater LightHeart OpeningRiding the WindSince I received it I have listened to it through dozens of times. I have put it on a few times for my personal practice time on the mat. And I have used it a few times for prayer and meditation. But what I have used it for most is as a little oasis in a stressful day. Standing at my desk and they day has become hectic and not what I had planned, I can put on my headphones hit play and slow my breathing, regain my focus and even if I just close my eyes and breathe deeply for a few minutes these songs help to re-enter and rebalance me to get back at it. Even as I am writing this review I have it playing in the background.It is simply just a wonderful album to have in your collection either for mat time, meditation or even just relaxing with a good book.

"I have read a few books by Joelle Charbonneau, and to be honest have liked them all. But this book was amazing. Of the 110 books I have read to date this year it is one of the best! I had a really hard time putting it down. The premise is rather intriguing, but the plot and characters are incredibly well done. The big questions is how far will you go to get something you want or think you need.The students at Nottawa High School in Wisconsin are drawn into a complicated plot. A new social networking site has popped up called 'Need' and you simply make a request. If it is a want you will be given a task and you will get what you requested. If it is a need the system will notify you that it is being worked on. But the stakes quickly rise. The first few members only needed to invite members to the site. Soon the tasks and consequences get much, much higher.Most teenagers have complicated lives, school, friends, cliques, work, family and more. But for Kaylee it is even more so, her brother is sick, her father has disappeared, and she has alienated most people in town trying to get them tested to see if they match her brother.As the requirements to get your request escalate life in this small town starts changing. So there are bodies, and Kaylee seems to be the only one making the connection. And then her life is threatened. Can she solve the riddle and figure out who is behind Need or will she become another statistic in the escalating experiment?This story takes a look at the darkest facets of human nature, and of social medial with anonymity mask what you are doing. There is an old saying ""No one gets something for nothing. We all should know better."" And the students in Nottawa are manipulated into a devastating high stakes game.This is a dark gripping tale and I had a really hard time putting it down and reflected upon the story for days afterwards.

Patrick Tonerand an amazing Appendix Titles for Mary by Deacon Tom FoxThe contributions are an amazing mix, from clergy, laity, men and women, married, single with and without children. As I was reading numerous times I took quotes and emailed them to friends thinking how perfect the quote would be for a person at that point in time. I highlighted almost 50 passages during my first read through and will use some of those in the rest of this review to highlight how excellent this book really is.Sarah in the introduction states: ""You might say it's become my blankie prayer. Just as my children cling to their worn-soft, faded blankies, so I cling to my Blessed Mother's skirt through this prayer. When my heart aches, I cry out a Hail Mary. When I need to be held in my sorrow, it's a Hail Mary that comes out. When I'm worried or troubled, the words I can't find on my own shape up as a Hail Mary."" This echoes with me so much. She goes on to say ""I pray it unconsciously, the way my children grab my hand without even knowing it when we're walking side by side. It's a comfort to me, and I'm so blessed to have it. When I don't have words for the desires of my heart, I always have the Hail Mary. When I'm lonely or sad or just at odds with the world, I have the Hail Mary. In the Hail Mary, I find so very many spiritual delights, not the least of which is how it leads me, irrevocably, closer to Mary's Son."" I find that I am the same way, it is my default prayer, my first in the morning and my last at night. Next Sarah exclaims: ""Of course, I couldn't resist considering my favorite prayer in light of this word-by-word approach. What would it be like to pray the Hail Mary deliberately, carefully weighing the importance and significance of every one of the forty-two words?""I have found from the time I have read the introduction to this book my prayers especially The Hail Mary and The Our Father my prayers have slowed down. Sometimes even pausing with every word. I have also slowed down my three children as they pray their nightly prayers. Sarah says: ""There's a new message for me each time I approach the Hail Mary slowly. A calmness is cultivated that forces me to live in the present moment in a way so few things in my modern life of gadgets and responsibilities require."" I am finding this also as I slow my prayers down, and this book has been a great tool for that. Finally She states: ""We'll take a journey together through the Hail Mary, word by word. The prayer will expand as we work our way from Hail to Amen. You may find yourself uncomfortable, inspired, confused, or even overwhelmed. Embrace that experience and let Mary guide you to her Son through it."" So come along see what else really hit me from the book and hopefully from these samples you will find that deeper connection to Mary and through her to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.Carol Ann Chybowski in the first chapter on 'of' asks us to reflect on these questions: ""As you pray, ask yourself: What am I of? Where do I come from? And to whom do I belong?"" Do you relflect upon these questions.Jennifer Fitz in her chapter on 'women' stated ""And if some of us women are called to biological motherhood-the business of bringing forth newly created bodies and souls-all of us are called to spiritual motherhood. Grandmother, aunt, sister, daughter, colleague-whatever our title, we have a lifelong mission. An eternal mission, as the intercession of the saintly women in heaven attests."" To me this was one of the most powerful passages in the book. I have shared it with a few friends and family and all the women I shared it with were touched.Later in the book it says ""As Catholics, we have been raised to understand Mary in that endearing way. We embrace her not only because of the important role she played but also because we know she can sympathize with our family problems."" Michelle Buckman in penning these words might know how many mothers and fathers these words will impact but they have greatly impacted me.Recalling a story Donna-Marie Cooper O'Boyle says this ""Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta, whom I knew personally for about ten years, had a very close relationship with Mary and taught me a simple yet profound prayer that I pray often: ""Mary, Mother of Jesus, be a Mother to me now."" Mother Teresa stressed that Mother Mary wants to mother us sinners and wants us to call upon her often. She wants to be our Mother. Mary, Mother of Jesus, be a Mother to me now!"" This chapter on 'sinners' was amazing and what I really needed to read that day.""The Hail Mary is a beautiful and powerful prayer. In the first part, we recite the words of the archangel Gabriel and then those of Elizabeth. In the second part, we ask Mary to pray for us. And to pray for us now."" Ellen Gable Hrkach in her chapter on 'now' pens these words. How many of us pray in the now, or even live in the now. This was one of my favorite chapters in the book. (Not that there was a bad one, but some impacted me more now than others.) Ellen goes on and later says ""Now is a good time to take stock in our spiritual life. Now is a good time to take care of our bodies, our minds, and, most importantly, our souls."" Will you do so?Susie Lloyd in her chapters on the last 'the' uses a number of examples from Winnie the Pooh I am looking forward to reading her chapter with my children  and seeing if they get it. It is a splendid little chapter.Fr. Patrick Toner writing on 'amen' says: ""The Church teaches lex orandi lex credendi, or ""what you pray is what you believe."" The Amen at the end of any prayer is like signing your name to the Declaration of Independence: you've put your life on the line. Live all of your Amens."" What do you believe, what do you pray, how do you pray?This book was wonderful. Unlike most books I read it slowly over a few weeks and have already gone back and started it again. It is an excellent read and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XB7PK55PYLE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594716404#wasThisHelpful","R2XB7PK55PYLE","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a long time since someone bought me a book not on a wish list. If they all end up being as good as this one I might start asking for surprise books. That is what this book was a complete surprise. My wife bought it and give it to me in the car on the way out of town, I had read almost 100 pages before we got to our destination. It has been a few days now since I finished reading it and I cannot stop thinking about the story and the characters.This story is told in many parts, and is really many stories that come together like streams then flow apart again. The main part of the story is set in year 20, that is 20 years after the Georgia Flu wipes out an estimated 99% of the world's population in a very short time. Because of the lack of manpower, within days services start failing. Water, hydro, the internet all stop working. Civilization has crumbled. The Travelling Symphony work a territory traveling and putting on Shakespeare plays and performing concerts. One of the towns they have frequented is 'under new management' and their fortunes have taken a turn for the worse.The story is told back and forth across time. Sometimes stories pre collapse, and sometimes people remembering stuff pre year 20. The main stories follow some key characters, world famous actor Arthur Leadner, Jeevan a paramedic in training the night the flu hits who tries to save Arthur on stage in Toronto. Miranda who was Arthur's first wife and the author of the graphic novels Station Eleven, Clark, who is Arthur's oldest friend and Kristen who is with the Traveling Symphony, and in the time before as a child was on stage with Arthur, and the strange 'prophet' of the light.This story is amazing on a few levels, first it is a post-apocalyptic story that showcases lives, before during and after the collapse of all we know. Second the characters are wonderfully written. Years ago I head Madeleine L'Engle speak and she mentioned that her characters were alive and real to her, and often she got insights to what they were up to now. I wish we could know some of that for these characters, where are they in year 25, what are they up to, what successes and what failures have they faced. I keep thinking about them and their world and wondering what happens next. That is a sign of a great fiction novel, it entertains, it makes you think, and you keep coming back to it.A few years back Emily's earlier book The Singer's Gun ended up in my to be read pile and I just never seemed to get around to it. That was my loss. With how much I enjoyed this book I know I will be reading Emily's three other novels soon! This book was a thrilling read and I highly recommend it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VUO4DBHBGBPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ICNOGHU#wasThisHelpful","R1VUO4DBHBGBPF","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I am always open to trying new styles of yoga, new teachers and new practices. That being said, the style in these videos is very different from what I would normally practice or even what I myself teach. I do not think you could get much more different from DDP Yoga than Namaste TV. But often something different is exactly what you need. I can say having done all of these workouts at least once now that they will end up being a regular part of my practice.The description of this season on Namaste TV's website is that ""is more than just an exercise video- it's an experience that will calm your mind, strengthen your body and inspire your soul. Master yoga teacher Erica Blitz guides you through 13 classes, all filmed amid the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest."" And does it ever deliver on that promise. These are excellent classes and I can honestly highly recommend them. Give these workouts a try you will not be disappointed! And now a quick mini review of each episode.Episode 301 Soften the EdgesHips and HamstringsThis was an awesome flow. As my first introduction to Namaste TV it was a wonderful experience. I broke a light sweat and really felt the engagement during the flow. This style is faster than most styles I practice but slower than some I have tried. To be honest it is a very nice middle ground. I know I will be coming back to this flow often.Episode 302 Align Your AxisTwistsThis was much more intense than episode 301. There were 2 moves I have not encountered before, which is always exciting and a learning experience. The pace was excellent, at the end I could not believe that the 20 minutes had passed.Episode 303 Warrior WisdomHip Opening SequenceThis was an awesome sequence. Two odd parts were no guided transitions from warmup to flow, or from flow to cool down. But even with that it was an excellent practice. It was a great workout and the cool down was incredible.Episode 304 Release and RestoreA Sequence for Your SpineThis was another really good sequence. There were a lot of chair poses during the flow part of this video. Great transitions from warm up to flow and then to cool down. I can see doing this towards the end of the day often to close out my practice for the day.Episode 305 Create Your CalmA Grounding Flow for Hips and HamstringsI love that when Erica designed these sequences, that she things of small things, like when doing cross legged forward folds, she has us switch which leg is in front and does the pose again. It is some of these small details that make this video and the whole series so great.Episode 306 Reflect and ConnectOpen Your Shoulders, Hips and HamstringsThere was a lot more floor work on this one. Very different from the first 5 videos. It is an excellent sequence. With some subtle variations to work into the Shoulders, Hips and Hamstrings in different ways.Episode 307 Balance and BendBalance and ConnectThis video has an awesome warmup. There is the addition of mudra's for the first time this season. The balance sequence is just wonderful. One of my favorite video's in the whole season.Episode 308 Bhakti FlowOpen Your Upper Back and ShouldersThis is another of my favorites from the series. Even without the guided transition from warmup to flow. There are a lot of eagle arm variations in this sequence and also a few full eagle poses. Just an excellent flow!Episode 309 Open and GroundStretch Your Shoulders andStrengthen Your Upper BackThis was one of the hardest flows in the series. It is a great sequence. A number of sphinx and dolphin poses add a lot of variety into this video. This one is intense compared to some of the others.Episode 310 Stabilize and CenterStrengthen Your Core and Open Your HipsThis was a good flow. It combines elements used in many of the others. I enjoy the subtle variations offered across the different videos in the series. Could really feel this one in the core after all the boat poses.Episode 311 Prana FlowOpen Your Shoulders and HipsThis was nearly a perfect flow. It was seamless from warmup into flow to cool down. Absolutely wonderful practice. Loved this one.Episode 312 Grace and GratitudeBackbending PracticeThis was a good practice. But from other practices I have done the backbending was pretty minimal. I was concerned before beginning what the backbending would included but there was nothing to be concerned about. It is good but not one of my favorites.Episode 313 Reconnect and RefineHip Opening and Abdominal StrengtheningWe encounter full bow pose for the first time this season. There is a lot of time on the mat, and far less standing work in this sequence. Physically it is much more demanding than some of the other videos.The length of these videos at 22 minutes each is excellent for short practice or stinging them together into a longer session. You can also combine them with other practice to round out your time on the mat. Some of the sequences start to feel familiar across the videos but that is to be expected and in many ways is a benefit as you become more and more familiar with Erica's style. The Top Pros and Cons of these videos are:One of the best things about these videos is their length, you can choose to do any one of the 22 minute sequences by itself or string a few of them together into a longer practice. You could even use these to supplement other styles of practice for an awesome change up. Some of the sequences start to feel familiar across the videos but that is to be expected and in many ways is a benefit as you become more and more familiar with Erica's style. The Top 3 Pros and Cons of these videos are:Pros:Awesome flowsAmazing cinematographyIncredible production quality4K resolution for large displaysFocus on balancing both sides in poses others often do notCons:All women castVery few modifications offeredThese 13 classes are great. I highly enjoyed them and know I will come back to them often. The cinematography is incredible, following the same flow with between one and three examples on screen, in city scapes, nature, on water. The videos are amazing to watch let alone practice with. And the original compositions by Tim McCauley perfectly accompany both the practice and videography. And I am looking forward to trying more from Namaste TV. You will not be disappointed by these great 22 minute practices!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LG0KE01TT4VV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYX0HY8#wasThisHelpful","R2LG0KE01TT4VV","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit that the Namaste TV videos are highly addictive. When I first got on the mat to try them I was planning on doing 1 or 2 a day until I had worked through the season. But I could not stop I did the 13 episodes in season 3 in 2 days and know I will be incorporating them in my practice often. I am always open to trying new yoga teachers and styles. That being said, the style in these videos is very different from what I would normally practice or even what I myself teach. These are very different from the DDP Yoga that I usually practice and teach, and maybe that is what makes them so good for me. I find that with my personal practice and almost daily mat time something new and different is invigorating and renews my love and passion for time on the mat, Namaste Yoga does that!On Namaste TV's website the description for this season is that it ""is more than just an exercise video - it's an experience that will calm your mind, strengthen your body and inspire your soul. Master yoga teacher Erica Blitz guides you through 13 classes, all filmed amid the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest."" And does it ever deliver on that promise the 4k resolution and stunning cinematography really enhance the practice. Give it a try you will not be disappointed!

"Somehow this books slipped through the cracks. It ended up in a pile with prayer cards, prayers books and little Catholic spiritual pamphlets a few years back. I do not even actually remembering getting the book. But a few weeks back I came across it while cleaning up my book shelves. And I can only state that it is an amazing little volume. The sections in the book are:Promises to My WifeOur RomanceOur FamilyPromises to My ChildrenOn ReligionOn DisciplineOn Family LivingPromises to MyselfMy Spiritual lifeMy Family LifeMy Friends and CommunityBooks like this have been around for years, and one of the most popular for a long time was Life's Little Instruction Book by H. Jackson Brown but what makes this volume so amazing is the clearly Christian focus, and the humility in some of the promises. My only real regret is that there is not an ebook version available so I could always have a copy with me to read 1 or 2 a day as reminders.Examples of some of the promises are:#15 ""I will try and listen attentively even when I don't really feel like it.""#42 ""I will choose to forgo some of my interests, allowing more time for you and our family.""#85 ""I will try to explain why I say no.""#113 ""I will teach you that in many matters you must be different.""#172 ""I will pray for the virtues; wisdom, fortitude, patience.""This was a wonderful little book. I have read through it three times now. And know it will be a companion for yours to come.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVTG63JO2HI0E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=189062666X#wasThisHelpful","RVTG63JO2HI0E","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have yet to read all of Michal Stawicki's books, but that is a big YET. I know I will have all of them that are out read in the next few months. This year in the last 6 months I have read 8 of his books once and most of them through a second time. He does an amazing job of packing a lot of useful information into small packages, that are easily digestible and easily applied. This current series is some of his best writings. This books continues after Simplify Your Pursuit of Success (Six Simple Steps to Success Book 1), building from where the last left off. The six steps that will be explored starting with this book are:1. Self-analysis. People of success know themselves.2. Health. You don't have to be a fitness fanatic to be successful. But you can do much more in every aspect of life if you take proper care of your body.3. Habits mastery. It is extremely hard to find a successful person who doesn't use consistent habits to achieve more.4. Focus. Vision. Goal setting. This topic can stray into the intangible, but I'll keep it down-to-earth.5. Socializing for business. Networking. It's hard to find a rich hermit.6. Reading and self-education. How to get ahead of the knowledge curve and stay there.And the chapters in this book that Michal works through for us are:Realization Begins Your JourneyPhilosophy Is the Key to ChangeAn Unheralded Weapon: Self-talkTracking Is the Rudder That Keeps You on CourseJournaling Opens Your MindSelf-Analysis is SimpleMeditation Illuminates Your PurposePrayer Puts Things in PerspectiveYour MissionIn SummaryLook in the Mirror and Start NowThe Kindle edition comes in at 60 pages and man does Michal cram a lot of content in such a small space! Each chapter has the main teaching and then a quick point summary of the key items to remember or to think about implementing. As usual Michal teaches from his own experience and observations. In the introduction he states ""Finally, I realized the broader picture: success is directly dependent on your ability to examine yourself."" And what an example his own story is. Later he declares ""My attention to self-analysis isn't the sole reason I gained these successes. Self-analysis is only one element in a set of success-building factors. But it's a necessary one."" And it is the first one because The next steps will build upon the knowledge gained working through this process. Michal quoting book one says ""I said it in the introduction to this series: success is not wealth or one-time achievement; it is process and small disciplines."" And true to his work any success worth having will take work.Later in the book he states: ""Because you are your greatest asset. Your success depends wholly on you. You can face obstacles, but armed with your internal resourcefulness you can overcome them. You may get lucky, but if you screw things up it won't do you any good. Your attitude and reactions determine your actions and the results you get."" We must work at what we want, we must take ownership or who we are and also who we are becoming. Michal highly recommends tracking your goals, and he lives it. Currently on coach dot me he has over 22609 check-in's. In the fourth chapter he says ""The easiest way to become aware about the performance of anything is to track it. To progress in any given area, simply begin to track the essential metrics. You don't have to decide that you'll be mindful about it. Once you start tracking, you'll put your attention into it, and it will happen automatically. Focus and results are just natural aftereffects."" And he goes on to say: ""So pick whatever you want and attach some metric to this activity. I assure you that your focus and awareness will naturally increase in that area."" But he highly stresses that the tracking must be easier than the habit itself or you will not keep up with the tracking or in many instances the habit because of lack of tracking. He emphasises ""My suggestion is to start slowly and gradually. Expand your tracking activities in both scope and detail according to your progress."" And I agree. When I started with coach dot me I had a few goals, I now have a few dozen with some, daily, weekly, monthly and even quarterly - all starting with simple advice from Michal months ago.Michal also highlights the importance of journaling ""You can write down your goals, break them down into weekly and daily actions, and monitor your progress."" From the chapters Self Analysis is Simple two of the 5 points in the Rember section at the end of the chapter really hit me they were:Your brain avoids self-analysis to keep you dormant.The results of self-knowledge are purposefulness, resoluteness, single?mindedness, strength of will, strength of character, firmness, intentness, and decision?making.Both of the stuck with me for days after reading the book. The final point that really hit me was when he stated: ""But remember, knowledge alone counts for nothing; implementation alone holds the secret to success."" For much of my life I collected knowledge and it has only been the last number of years I have really focused on applying what I know. Michal's books are helping me to do that.Michal's writings remind me often of John C. Maxwell, or Stephen Cover or Dan Millman. He gives great advice, but it is almost all from stuff he has learned from trial and error. His books give us great tools in small packages. I highly recommend this book and look forward to the next in the series and am sure you could get a great deal out of reading it also!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBZEFJKLG211Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016UUFG7A#wasThisHelpful","RBZEFJKLG211Q","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was the 11th book by Michal I have read this year, well actually the 8th book but I have read a few of them twice because they were so good. This book really packs a lot of punch into 35 pages. It is intended as an intro and overview of Michal's steps to success in any area of your life. And over the next 6 books in the series he will take us much deeper into each topic. This volume give some great advice and tips.The chapters in this book are:1. Do you believe success is in your hands?  What is success, for you?2. What will success mean if you achieve it?3. The cost of pursuing success4. A successful pursuit: Jim Rohn's example5. The methodology to use in your pursuit  Develop your success one piece at a time  Let's revisit my experience  Study the success of others  A quick word about money and millionaires6. Claim success: you can do it  There are many ways you can begin  The six strategies7. Your next step  Right nowIn the first chapter Michal quotes Calvin Coolidge ""Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent."" And that advice rings true. Michal has lived it in his life and his books help give us tools to pursue our own dreams and goals. Later in the chapter he quotes Ray Kroc ""Luck is a dividend of sweat. The more you sweat, the luckier you get."" Success will not come to most without hard work and persistence. Michal stresses that fact and does not sugar coat it. This is not a quick fix this is a tried and tested process and it is work! Quoting Earl Nightingale ""Success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal or ideal."" Michal asks ""What kind of success do you want? The first thing to understand is this: You define your own success, so think about what it is for you. What do you yearn to be? A writer, a space rocket pilot; perhaps an entrepreneur or a great parent?"" So knowing what you want you need to know what motivates you, he states ""The meaning of success, for you must come from your heart. If it doesn't, you won't find the strength to pursue it. Your willpower will drain fast. You need a compelling reason to steadily pursue success. Reflect. What is your compelling reason?""I think the greatest single piece of advice from Michal in this book is ""doesn't, you won't find the strength to pursue it. Your willpower will drain fast. You need a compelling reason to steadily pursue success. Reflect. What is your compelling reason?"" Anything work having will take hard work. Michal does not water down that truth with platitudes. Later he states ""Success is not grand. Success is not massive. And that's cool, I think."" True success is the result of lots and lots of work, dedication, persistence and Michal reinforces that truth.Later Michal states: ""In this series about pursuing success, I will each cover of these six disciplines in six different areas of your life at once. You wouldn't have a high probability of success. It's much better to study and implement them one by one."" Those six steps are:1. Self-analysis. People of success know themselves.2. Health. You don't have to be a fitness fanatic to be successful. But you can do much more in every aspect of life if you take proper care of your body.3. Habits mastery. It is extremely hard to find a successful person who doesn't use consistent habits to achieve more.4. Focus. Vision. Goal setting. This topic can stray into the intangible, but I'll keep it down-to-earth.5. Socializing for business. Networking. It's hard to find a rich hermit.6. Reading and self-education. How to get ahead of the knowledge curve and stay there.Michal then goes on to state: ""This book series is the 'back way in' to success. I believe that when you have a degree of mastery in each of these six tangible areas (common to most achievers), you will also be enjoying life!"" He is guiding us with his own life as an example.This was another amazing book by Michal Stawicki. I highly recommend it and really look forward to the rest in the series! Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23DFVM7W1L1N9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016IQ81SW#wasThisHelpful","R23DFVM7W1L1N9","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was waiting months and months for Advance Reader's Copies of this book to come out. That is one of the big problems with getting review copies it is that much longer until the next book in a series publishes. I kept checking again and again to see if Angry Robot had review copies available. When it finally showed up boy oh boy was I excited. I could not wait to see what Virgin Jackson and Nate Sixkiller would get up to next. I was not disappointed.These books read like a cross between old Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns fused with Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert or Alfred Bester. It is an awesome mix of western, soft science fiction and a strong bent to religious studies or spiritual realities. The three authors mentioned above all among my all time favourites going back to when I was just a teen gorging on any book I could get my hands on, and comparing de Pierres to them is among the highest praise I can give.This book continues almost immediately after book 1 - Peacemaker. Virgin is still stuck between a rock and a hard place. She has been black mailed by her mother to work for a government organization; the CJIC. Her mother that she did not even know was alive. She still has a murder charge hanging over her head and a cop that does not want to seem to let it go. And it seems that with every day her life and responsibilities get more and more complicated. With such problems as a bounty on her head, an escalation in Mythos sightings and discovering her mostly estranged brother is somehow involved with this whole situation is not making Virgin's life any easier. And for someone who would prefer to spend most of her time alone on her horse patrolling the preserve she is spending far more time with way more people then she really wants to.This story seems to have both a fast and a slow pace. Part of it is the back and forth between extreme action and trying to figure things out. We get to know both Virgin and Nate better and have an even greater appreciation for them and what motivates them. They are very well written characters. The pace of the story is great and when you hit the end you are desperate for more. So hopefully there will be at least a third book of not more in the series.This was an awesome read and I highly recommend the series, but unlike some series this one should really be read in order.

"I have enjoyed all of the Erin Bow books that I have read but this one completely blew me away. It is amazing. Of the 112 books I have read since the beginning of the year it is the best. It has left a lasting imprint. I found myself for days after reading the book thinking about it. When I read it I was unaware that it was a first book in a series and desperately wanted to know what would happen next.Set in the future when climate change has ravished the planet, and control of resources is of utmost importance. The UN and most of the world's weapons are under the control of an AI - Talis. In order to mitigate major wars for there to be personal consequences of going to war the ancient practice of Hostage exchange. The children of rulers are sequestered in Precepture's in isolated around the globe. There they are taught history, philosophy, sciences and everyday could be their last if their nation goes to war.This is the story of Greta who was been in the Precepture since she was 8, and for 10 years has been the ideal student and hostage. And Elian Palnik who has just arrived and is as rebellious and headstrong as Greta is passive and submissive. But something sparks between the two as Greta witnesses Elian's arrival in chains. Both of them interact extensively with The Abbott a human who uploaded to his current form as another AI and leader of their school. And of course Talis, you will never forget Talis he is sassy, smart, sarcastic and very passionate. He will do what it takes to keep as many humans alive as possible even wiping out nations. He might be a little crazy but he gets the job done.This story has incredible characters. You will find that the twists and turns in the story get you thinking and wondering. It will leave its mark on you as it does all the children of peace. As I stated it is one of the best books I have read this year and I am desperate to read more of the story. But it stand very strong on its own. Give it a chance and likely you will be hooked.Extremely well done!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDUVYYPYA68DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1481442716#wasThisHelpful","RDUVYYPYA68DN","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I need to be honest and state I picked up this book for a number of reasons. First Peter H. Reynolds is an amazing illustrator and an excellent author in his own right. And second last year I became a certified DDP Yoga instructor and love practicing with my kids. And third the cover was so amazing I was literally waiting and waiting for the book to finally come out.This book did not disappoint. In fact it was far more than I ever expected. My son has neurofibromatosis and one of the reasons I pursued Yoga certification was because he loved working with me. This book will bring to him a side of yoga I need more of in my life, focus, calmness, centering and mindfulness.The story by Susan is one that almost all of us can learn from. And the illustrations are amongst Reynold's best ever. The balance of color and light, the pallet used and the mix of full color and monochromatic illustrations works so well.This was a wonderful book that I have already read numerous times and know I will be sharing with my kids, friends and family often. It is wonderful!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KIRWMNY97ZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1419716646#wasThisHelpful","R2KIRWMNY97ZZ","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 6th book that I have read by Michal Stawicki this year. Each of them was well worth the cost of the book and the time spent. But this one might be the best yet. This is an amazing collection of stories. As you read some you may be familiar with, some may be new to you and some you might never encounter anywhere else. Stawicki and Ingraham have compiled a collection spanning the ages and from around the world.I have read through this collection twice now and know that from time to time I will pick it up and randomly pick a story for encouragement and motivation. I have recommended this book to a few friends who have already read it and love it. There is something for everyone and everyone can take something from almost all of the stories.Give this book a chance and the stories will surprise, encourage, motivate and challenge you to write your own success story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWE3OB85QRXQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012ZMV3CO#wasThisHelpful","RWE3OB85QRXQQ","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These books are so good it took every ounce of self-control to not pick up book 2 until after writing my review of book 1 - I Am Margaret. It was worth the wait. This book continues immediately after book one. The story in some ways has a very different pace than book one. But it is a very tight story. A story about resistance, about friendship, betrayal, faith and a journey of 2000 kilometers and above all hope.At the end of book 1 Bane has freed Margo and Jon and the other ReAssigness from the EuroGov facility. Now they are all on the run. They must cross the continent because their survival depends on it. And now they are the Three most wanted. The three are pretending to be new adults backpacking across the country. Being careful of who notices them, and how much they interact with others. But life trekking across the wilderness can end up being harder than expected. Especially with Margo recovering from the start of her collection. Jon being blind and hiking across the country and with needing to be extra cautious at every turn.The three friends encounter a wolf pack, up close and personal, a bear and experience betrayal more than once. Their journey seems to get harder at every turn. All of this while trying to make it to the Vatican free state.Amazing story! Excellent writing. Some incredible characters who lay it all on the line. I cannot wait for book three to be available in North America and will be following Book 4's release in the UK. Great books give them a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CLNZM5MQTM0V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QL64FMG#wasThisHelpful","R2CLNZM5MQTM0V","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sometimes it really pays to follow authors you really like. Regina Doman recently posted about this book, and it caught my attention. To be honest I had never heard of the author or the series. I am so glad it did. This is one of the best books I have read this year and the best new Catholic fiction author I have discovered in years! This book was incredible.I literally could not put this book down. Even though I had to be up early to travel I stayed up way way too late to keep reading. I could barely put it down the two times I had to take breaks from reading it. And each time all I could do was keep thinking about it. In fact it was so powerful even though I finished it two days ago I keep playing over parts of the book and wondering what will happen next. It was only towards the end of the book that I found out that it is part of a series. Something I am extremely grateful for.For me there are a few hallmarks of great books:1. I know I will read it again2. I can't wait to share it with my children as they grow up3. I keep sharing about it with othersThis book meets all three of those categories. And it was one of the best books I have read in ages.This story is set in the near future, much of the world's nations have amalgamated into regional entities. And all religions have been banned. Margaret Verrall lives in the EuroGov and at 18 there is the sorting test. Those who pass go on to productive lives in society and those who do not become ReAssigness and are literally recycled. They go to a facility and for the next 2 years are being prepared to be in prime condition for harvesting unless there is a specific need for their parts before then. But Margaret has two major problems first she is pretty sure she will fail the testing as she really struggles with math, and second she is part of the underground network of believers. But she is in love and Bane will not just let the government take her.This story has incredible characters. Runs at a breakneck pace from start to finish. And is very very well written. Give this book a try it will enthrall you and leave you hungry for more of the story.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33WCL734L6CQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Q4CF7TC#wasThisHelpful","R33WCL734L6CQM","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Being in the middle of a yearlong leadership development course at work I have read far more business books this past year than in a while. And I must be honest and say this book was amazing. Brady writes in a very engaging manner. His text is clean, crisp and concise. He drives home each chapter with a case study from work they have done with other clients. In many ways reading this book was like reading John Maxwell, Patrick Lencioni, or Spencer Johnson. But there is a freshness or energy in Brady's writings that reflects what he is teaching.Brady focus a chapter on each of 10 leadership principles and therefore sections in this book are:1 Manage Energy, Not Engagement2 Deliver Experiences, Not Promises3 Target Emotion, Not Logic4 Trust Conversations, Not Surveys5 Seek Tension, Not Harmony6 Practice Partnering, Not Parenting7 Pull Out the Backstory, Not the Action Plan8 Think Sticks, Not Carrots9 Meet Needs, Not Scores10 Challenge Beliefs, Not EmotionsConclusionAppendix / Wants vs. NeedsThe purpose of this book is the help manager, leaders, and shapers within any organization see improvements in employee engagement. But not just in the short term, this book will help you find lasting changes and in some ways change how you do business. But if you follow the direction the business will do better and your people will be more satisfied and balanced. Brady does this by focusing on the connection between the brain and energy within the individuals that then rolls up to teams, departments and the organization as a whole.One of the case studies Brady serves up to us is A Tale of Two Marathons and it is his story of two different runs at the Boston Marathon. Once you have read this story you will be hooked. Brady states: ""Engagement is essential, foundational, elemental. But by itself it is insufficient. Without energy, it is simply unsustainable. Let's face it: it takes a lot of energy to sustain engagement."" We have all see this in organizations and teams we have been on. Brady gives us the tools to provide fuel to the energy so that the engagement continues in not only a sustainable buy in a way where it can grow.This book was an amazing read. I have already passed off my copy and mentioned it to numerous other people. Even if you are not a manager you will benefit from reading the book and applying the lessons to your own work and life. If you are a manager you can help take good teams and make them great> If you already have that great team this book will help you sustain their level of commitment. So pick it up and give it a try you will not be disappointed!","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18S3SFVK71AGY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UOEDBM#wasThisHelpful","R18S3SFVK71AGY","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To be honest this book was not bad, but it was not great either. After finishing it - it felt sort of ho-hum. Other than chapter 6 on Advanced rebounding exercises there was little in the book you could not quickly find on numerous websites with information on rebounding or use of mini trampolines. Other than this information being radially available on numerous websites the book also included no pictures. For a book on fitness practice I found this highly unusual and extremely disappointing.The sections in the book are as follows:Table of ContentsIntroductionChapter 1 Rebounding ExerciseChapter 2 Benefits of Rebounding exerciseChapter 3 FAQChapter 4 TipsChapter 5 Rebounding for beginnersChapter 6 Advanced rebounding exerciseChapter 7 Special considerationsConclusionI did give this book a 3 out of 5 stars even with my issues, that was in part because the writing is very good, excellent grammar and formatting. But as stated other than Chapter 6 it was really a waste of time. Comparing it to 3 other books I have read on this topic this was the weakest in terms of both content and delivery of that content the complete lack of photo's. The book reads as a collection of information gathered from other sources and with no photo's little effort or work was put into the compilation of the content. If I were you I would just skip this one and try one of the other offerings.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MPU5R7WE4PW3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOIKSTM#wasThisHelpful","R2MPU5R7WE4PW3","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is strange how some books come across our paths. This book was given to me by my 72 year old mother in law. She has been using a rebounder daily for a few months now and wants to get one for us and the kids. But she wanted me to read the book first. And I must be honest going back and reading a fitness book from a fad from the 70's and 80's was a little different. Yet the more that I read the more interested I became. Since then I have read this book twice, looked at a few other books about Rebound Exercise, and yet this older book has some great material, excellent scientific research and I became more and more intrigued.  Doing some research I came up with this timeline of rebounding:1936 Nissen Corporation creates modern Trampoline1975 Victor Green patented Small trampoline - Rebounder1977 pamphlet ""Rebound to Better Health""1979 Albert E Carter publishes The Miracles of Rebound Exercise1981 Dr Kenneth Cooper research rebounding get 25% more gains than jogging1981-1985 The Far-Craze Phase of rebounding1988 publishes ""NEW Miracles of Rebound Exercise""2005 Publishes ""Rebound Exercise: The Ultimate Exercise for the New Millennium""In this book Albert Carter goes through his own history and research and also shares numerous testimonies from people who have used the practice of rebound exercise to improve their lives. Now yes the book is dated and there are some newer versions but Albert and numerous other authors. For example on p. 85 it states ""Although most of us have some hidden desire to be like Charles Atlas or Bruce Jenner, we recognize the improbability and are willing to settle for some exercise program that will merely help us endure to the end."" Now today in 2015 I am not sure a lot of guys would want to look like Bruce Jenner, but the concept still holds. The other quote that really grabbed me was on p. 102 ""Your challenge is to study the concepts of this book and either prove, disprove, or use these concepts for better health.""Table of Contents:The Often Invisible ObviousA Dream and a DreamerDiscovery of a VoidThree Powerful HorsesRebound Exercises - Past and presentRebound Exercises and the LymphaticsRebounding - A Cellular ExerciseRebounding to Muscular Strength and Physical FitnessA Vital Exercise for Vital OrgansAerobic is Necessary, butA Safe Answer to JoggingAnd The Eyes of the Blind Shall SeeStartling Breakthrough in EducationSuccess StoriesNow having read the book through twice, now I will share my story. I tweaked my knee a number of weeks before writing this review. It was progressively getting worse. I was at my mother in laws and in a fair bit of pain and thought what have I got to lose. So I got on the rebounder in the living room, actually limping to it. Very gingerly I started with the Health Bounce feet not even leaving the surface. I did a hundred bounces very gently and then 100 more - more vigorously. Then I did 100 jumps and 100 twist jumps. When I got off there was no longer any pain. I slept through that night for the first time in weeks without waking up to knee pain. And it felt better for days after.I am looking forward to getting our rebounder and maybe even one for my standing desk at work and getting on it the 3 to 5 times a day recommended and seeing what happens. As Carter said you need to either prove, disprove or use the concepts presented. My own limited use and my mother in laws testimony both prove it, so I suggest you track down one of his book read it and give rebounding a try! You really have nothing to lose but maybe your pain, your discomfort and you can gain greater health and wellness.The only hard part is all of his book currently are out of print and no ebook editions seems to exist but we can hope for either a reprinting or ebook versions again soon.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RLQ2BSHP42FS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000LQJG2Q#wasThisHelpful","R2RLQ2BSHP42FS","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have read a few books by Anthony, A.R. Horvath over the last 8 years. I have always been impressed with his writings, but there is something about this one that really grabbed me as a reader and kept me glued to the pages. Also I am looking forward to sharing this book with my children when they get a little older.This story may seem like a strange mash-up, it had Big Foot, Dracula, a young boy who gets caught in a great adventure, angels, demons, and the legacy of Jesus Christ. Casey is a young boy out exploring his back yard when he sees a shadow that does not make sense, using a bit of cunning, and a few ticks he has collected in his bag he ends up catching hold of a Big Foot, only to be whisked away into their realm. But even there things are not always as they appear.This story is tightly written. Casey is an interesting young hero and his Great Great Great  Aunt Myrtle has a story most would not believe. The pace was great and it ends with a killer cliff hanger ending.I do not know how many books Horvath has planned for this series but I can only hope it is a few because this one was a great read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OR3AAIHIV1CD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010QXJVMI#wasThisHelpful","R1OR3AAIHIV1CD","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was right to be leery of starting a series with over 40 books! For now not only am I addicted to these books but my children are also. I am reading ahead of them and reading them a few chapters each night before bed. They love the story so far, and I am thoroughly enjoying it also. To be honest I have yet to read anything by Tony Abbott that disappointed. And going back and reading some of his earlier works has been a blast both for me and for the kids.Droon is an interesting world to visit. For when we go there always seems to be a task for Neal, Julie and Eric to complete. And this time is no different. This time they join Princess Keeah, the wizard Galen Longbeard, and we meet new creatures the lumpies and go on an adventure. In the first adventure in Droon the Eye of Dawn a crystal that can control nature was lost to the evil Sparr. In this story our team of adventures head to his secret hideout inside a volcano to try and retrieve it. We also find out that not all things are as they appear, and some who work for Sparr might even be forced to do so. Can the team get into the volcano, can they find the Eye of Dawn, can they get back out again. Come read the story and find out.Droon is becoming a fun place to visit time and time again. And this story has a bit of everything, a magic doorway, strange creatures, adventure, friendship, the desert, a secret lair and a hook at the end to bring you back again! As mentioned I am enjoying reading the stories, and my kids are also, and hopefully in a few years the younger kids will be able to reread these books to me. But for now Droon is a great part of family reading time.The only real drawback is it was only after starting the series that I discovered that only the first 10 books are available electronically at the moment. I can only hope the rest become available quickly, especially at the pace we are reading them. This was the 17th book by Tony Abbott I have read, and a number of those I have read twice. His stories always entertain, and now my kids are at an age where I am starting to share his great book with them. Tony has over 100 books published so check out The Secrets of Droon of some of his other stories they will not disappoint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3V6TWEXHLKC84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OBOA3IA#wasThisHelpful","R3V6TWEXHLKC84","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit I was learn of starting this book. It is hard to imagine starting a new series with over 40 books in it that was started 16 years ago. I feared loving the book and being hooked for the whole series. And as much as I love most of Tony Abbott's books that I have read I also feared not liking it and being disappointed. With mixed feelings I must say it is the first. I now have a much bigger to read pile thanks to venturing into the world of Droon.I find I go through spurts reading middle grade, young adult, and non-fiction almost alternately. I am really glad I picked up this book. My oldest two children are just at the point where they can read these books to me. It has been really fun going back and reading some of Tony Abbott's earlier works now that they are showing up in ebook formats. This book though simple, was very enjoyable and I know my children will love it. And the benefit is that being part of a finished series they will not have to wait for new books to come out.This is an interesting fantasy story. For when Julie, Neal, and Eric are cleaning the basement they discover that when the door under the stairs is closed a set of steps appear leading down, those steps lead to another realm, the realm of Droon. They soon realize that Droon is a place in turmoil and after encountering red shiny men, flying lizards, And angry wizard named Sparr and some other fantastical creatures, and a princess that needs their help. And much more. Overall a great little read.This was the 16th book by Tony Aboott that I have read out of his 100 published. It was a fun read and I look forward to where the series will go next. So give it a try and see, you just might fall in love with Droon also!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R36UF8PF3P886O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OSJ3OOS#wasThisHelpful","R36UF8PF3P886O","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book designed to help you get the best return on your investment for personal leadership development. The main focus is finding the middle 70%, not the 20% of key strengths you already exhibit, nor the bottom 10% that are you main weaknesses but that middle ground that you can learn to make small changes at and focus on making changes there. Based on the studies they provide if you only focus on your key strengths you will become stagnant, and to quote Steven Brust:""Failure leads to maturityMaturity leads to successSuccess leads to stagnationStagnation leads to failure!""If you only rely on your strengths you will eventually either fail or become redundant. But on the other end of the spectrum if you try and change your greatest weaknesses, not only will it take a lot of effort but often there is very little return on investment. The amount you can make changes here is small. However on the other hand if you pick a skill or two in that middle ground and consistently work at you can turn them into key strengths. They will not take nearly the effort of your bottom 10% and the results will be much more dramatic.The sections in the book are:IntroductionPart 1 About Hidden Strengths1. What Are Hidden Strengths?Why Hidden Strengths?The Risk of Focusing on WeaknessesThe Risk of Overrelying on StrengthsThe Reward of Focusing on Hidden Strengths2.

It clearly lays out the why - focus on the middle 70%, and only focus on changing 1 or 2 at a time. The how - do the online survey, find your area's and work on them diligently.  With the book you get access to the survey and can do it as many times as you need. After you get your results you apply Part three from the book and work on them and turn them into true strengths.This is an excellent read and I highly recommend it and know I will be using the tools it provides to help me grow that middle 70% and you can also!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31FETP7PI5LZR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1626562830#wasThisHelpful","R31FETP7PI5LZR","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second book published by Mark and to be honest with each book I have a great desire for more output from this author. He is a man who has transformed his life and now has a passion for helping others to make changes themselves. This cookbook will wet you appetite, give you some great jumping off points and serve as a reminder that healthy nutritious food can be amazing to prepare and share.The layout and design of this book is amazing. I will be honest the first thing I do when I look at a cookbook is flip through the pages and see what photos catch my eye, with this one almost every page did and I stopped flipping and started reading pretty quickly. One of the greatest strengths of this books is Marks friendly style, he encourages experimentation, and he states Have fun with the recipes and by all means, make them your own. For me recipes have always been a starting point, Mark not only encourages that he offers a number of variations or options for modifying on almost every recipe. In fact my only criticism of the book is that Marc said there are no desserts because he does not bake. But I would love to see what he could come up with non-baked desserts, homemade sorbet, fruit or veggie desserts that surprise and amaze. I am sure he could impress himself and us if he gave it a try.This is an incredible cook book. Not just because it has great recipes that you can copy verbatim. But because it is a guide to cooking. It will be a starting point to help you become a great cook through trial and error. And like some example in the book sometimes mistakes create something completely unexpected that becomes awesome in its own right; see the example of falling up! So get the book, read it and get experimenting in the kitchen and pretty soon you too can be healthier, wiser and enjoying your time in the kitchen!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12GUUVO4JHIE4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y3DDF8O#wasThisHelpful","R12GUUVO4JHIE4","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When someone heard I was reading this book they asked why. I read on average over 100 books a year. My reading speed is over 400 words per minute. But it was not always that way. I have a dual form of dyslexia and came out of grade 7 reading at a grade 3 level and went into grade 8 reading at a University level because I spent my whole summer break in school learning how to read. With this book you can achieve that in just 10 minutes a day! My answer was threefold, first I am always looking to improve and grown and second I often get asked for book reconditions for people looking to read more. And third I have loved all of Michal's books that I have read and want to read his complete cannon. Up until now I would always recommend either The Coles Notes Your Guide To Speed Reading or Teach Yourself Speed Reading from the Work Smarter series. Both of which I have read and recommended to numerous people who have had success in increasing their reading speed. But now my first pick now will be Michal's book!Like the other books in the 10 Minutes a Day series this book follows a simple format but presents a lot of great information in a small concise package. The sections in the book are:Introduction10 MinutesSpeed Reading ObstaclesTechniquesProgramFree ResourcesThe StoriesNathaniel's StoryMy StoryConclusionEarly on Michal states: ""Your background, your education, your interests, your general knowledge - all these factors influence your reading speed, because they determine your vocabulary and your reading confidence."" And from my previous reading and experience that is very true. But based on Michal's story: ""I'm living proof that a 10-minute practice can be fruitful. I can read more than 50% of what I read a year ago within the same time. I can read 90 minutes a day (including the speed reading practices) and still read the same amount of text that used to take me two hours to read a year ago."" And that can be true for you also. So pick up the book and give it a try. As Michal declares ""Value your time. Your time is your life. Start today, grab a book and use your finger as a pointer, or read and simultaneously pat your thigh rhythmically. Just for ten minutes. Discover that there is no magic in speed reading and keep practicing."" And who knows what your reading speed may become, you will have more time to read or for other activities. Basically it is a win win situation for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QSFWL29G6BGJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G3EBDA8#wasThisHelpful","R3QSFWL29G6BGJ","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Few books that I can recall ever reading were as disappointing as this one. This book was the first Kindle book that I have read after reading it completely. Basically the book is a short paragraph and then a link to a youtube video. The descriptions of the youtube video's overlap with the content in the book for that specific chapter. So you pay for the ebook and get links to publically available videos on the author's channel.If you ever watched Friends, and how most of the gang respond to Janice's voice is like listening to Robin's video's. The only reasons I gave the book a 1 star and not 0 star rating, is that my reaction to his voice I know will not be all people's and second, some people might actually be able to use this to learn to do handstand. Second you cannot actually give it less than 1 star. For me it just would not work and paying for links to public video's seems ridiculous.So my opinion of this book is it is less of a book and a brochure you buy with links to the real content.Greatly disappointed and really cannot recommend it to anyone. I cant even give it an A for effort.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QTXDQNYNULET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NRBACYI#wasThisHelpful","R3QTXDQNYNULET","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book showed up in my Amazon recommendations. I am very thankful that it did. Now at first I was hesitant to buy this book based on the price point, number of pages and not knowing the author. But at the time his book The Fitness Expert Next Door (How to Change Your Life in 10 Minutes a Day) was available for free on Amazon. I read it and loved it. I have read 5 of Stawicki's 8 books in the last few weeks and will finish the remaining books soon. One of the quotes from this book that grabbed me most was ""Understand that each decision or action in your life could be the beginning of a change in direction."" Reading this book can be one of those decisions for you!Some reviews of Michal's books criticize the English. And Michal admits that his native tongue is not English, but he does an excellent job communicating. And the few rough phrasings are more than made up for by the quality of the content. In another review I compare his writings to those of Robin Sharma, Stephen R. Covey, Dan Millman and John C. Maxwell. This book is short, concise and relays some great information. And it is not just head knowledge it is knowledge that Michal has gained from making changes in his own life. The power of story, his story, and stories he uses of others to give examples beyond his own can motivate you to making changes in your own life.The chapters in this book are:1. The Instant Gratification Curse2. Closing the Gap3. Definition4. Four Lessons from a Millionaire5. The Significance of Consistency- Paco6. Two Kinds of Motivation7. Utilizing Motivation- Ellyn8. Purpose9. Purposeful Motivation10. Mission- Teri11. Personal Philosophy12. Shape Your Philosophy13. Cornerstones- Ludvig14. Tiny Habits15. Tracking16. Focus- Stan17. No BlueprintSummaryEach chapter has the main teaching points and then a Knowledge Items summary at the end, and some have action items so you can start putting the tips into practice. I found I copied a number of these Knowledge summaries as reminders of next steps. On page 22 he states ""Intention, attitude, and commitment determine your consistency"" This knowledge point was one of the most impactful for me in the book. He also provides links to some other articles, TED talks and other resources to go deeper on some of the key teachings. Later in the book he declares ""If you wanted to walk north, you would follow a compass. The compass needle would show you the way. Reason-powered motivation is your internal compass, always pointing you north. It's the real reason for starting and continuing a discipline. It is a values-driven decision from deep inside that you want a certain result. Some days you will not feel much like going out and working toward it. The flames in your fire may be burning low from time to time, particularly after a big discouragement. But the fire never goes out.You can't depend on emotion-based motivation to fuel consistency. Depending on emotional motivation is a recipe for catastrophe as emotions are not constant.Rather, you should place much more reliance on reason-fueled motivation. The real reasons for a journey don't just disappear in one instant. Your ambition to go ""north"" will motivate you to keep going when the going gets tough. It can back you up when you lose your hope. It can add a needed pinch of passion to your mundane activities, which will make them interesting enough that you continue your journey. It may save your life literally and metaphorically."" Further on he says: ""You can do this too. Motivate yourself with purpose-driven self-talk and reflection every day, and you will enjoy a fresh source of sustained energy that will propel you towards your goals.Motivation is a powerful tool. Look for ways to motivate yourself into action by drawing strength from the inspiration that comes from your ideas and the power that comes from your beliefs and values."" From these two and the following quote ""A life purpose is so powerful because, as its name says, it's a part of your whole life. It's always deep in your heart and will support you in your struggles"" we get the main point of his argument. In order for changes to take hold, for them to last and become habits the desire to change needs to be values based, and not just passion based. From that values centred if you can craft your life purpose, and work towards it every day it will fuel the journey and drive the change even when you hit the hard times.What is your purpose, are you striving towards something or just existing? Michal says: ""Your personal philosophy is your life attitude, which is formed by all of your past experiences and the meanings you gave them. It's your accumulated life knowledge and wisdom. As you become aware that you have an attitude towards life, you can systematically investigate and develop it using your analytic abilities. Unfortunately, not many people do this. For most people, their personal philosophy is just something that has molded itself through various life experiences rather than something they deliberately shaped."" Are you willing to work to find your purpose and then pursue it? If so this book and his book A Personal Mission Statement: Your Road Map to Happiness will help you along that path.Some of the best advice in the books is: ""Here are some ways we can work at the detail level to improve your general capacity to be consistent:1. Make it as enjoyable as possible.2. Make your goal public knowledge.3. Make time for the activity you want to undertake.4. Don't set the bar too high too early.5. Make it easy to say yes (or no).6. Track your progress.7. Make decisions now.""Michal declares: ""If you really want to be satisfied in your life, to say goodbye to your frustrations, you must start enjoying the process of achievement, not just the destination itself."" So grab this book and start that journey, and if you are already on it, it will likely help you forward. ""Realize this: there is no magic formula that ensures results through processes you will always enjoy. Keeping your focus on being consistent is often plain hard work. But if you don't get at least some satisfaction from the steps along the way, your chances for staying consistent in your efforts will lessen rapidly."" So get the book and let's get to work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E9HSFGW8JG1T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UFGN128#wasThisHelpful","R3E9HSFGW8JG1T","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have now read this book three times over the last three years. I must admit even with all the knowledge presented in the book there are still times that I struggle with it. It is hard in part because I am the only one in my family who has gone gluten free. It is very hard when pizza is in the house, or making toast of bagels for the kids. I really believe the message of this book, but I cannot force my wife to change or force changes in shopping habits until she is convinced. The other thing that makes it so very hard is how pervasive wheat is as an additive, filler, packager and more. Between wheat and corn you eliminate almost 80 of the groceries in the store, and if you try and go dairy free also take out another 10%.That being said, I know I feel much better when I am following the advice in this book, and it is not just about the waist, and weight loss. It is about overall wellbeing, energy, emotional balance and just plain drive and focus are so much better by following the advice in this book. The Appendix 'Looking for Wheat in All the Wrong Places' will blow you away. The last time I had accidental exposure to gluten was a tin of Cashews, they were on sale and a different brand and my wife picked them up for me. I ate a couple of handfuls after a workout as a snack, an hour later I was feeling bloated, brain fog and generally unwell. I went and checked the can and wheat was listed as an ingredient. I literally could not believe it why in the world add it to the nuts?I highly recommend this book and to be honest the practice of going wheat and mostly grain free. This book will bring the head knowledge you need to make an informed decision and then you will need to move it to heart knowledge so that you consistently put it into practice. That will be the hard work and I hope that Dr. William Davis new book Wheat Belly Total Health will help me get there!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1X2XXFM9VODV8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1609611543#wasThisHelpful","R1X2XXFM9VODV8","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I read this book about 6 months before its release date. It was an absolutely incredible read. It was my 3rd favorite read in 2014 out of 187 books. I have said it before but with every book by Cecil Castellucci that I read I am more impressed. This one was amazing. Literally I finished it and started reading it again at a slower pace to savor it because the first time I could not pause and raced through the book to finish the story.One of the greatest strengths of Castellucci's writing is her strong female characters. In this case we return to the story of Tula Bane. I thought the first book in the series had plot twists and unexpected turns, this second part of the story make it look like a walk in the park. Tula is now a wandering human alone in space, trying to warn other humans and still intent on seeking revenge. But she is also finding that her path is a different one than she expected.This story is a strange mix of revenge, love, family and some sense of redemption of justice. I know I plan on going back and rereading both books back to back again. The writing is incredible. It is an excellent read and if you have not picked up the first book give it a try.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCP1C03DIUSMK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1596437766#wasThisHelpful","RCP1C03DIUSMK","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It you are tight on kitchen space or like Joe looking for a travel model there are some serious benefits to this model. If you are not sure you will be a big time juicer and looking to test the waters, it is a fantastic model for the price point. As mentioned I have used this every day I have been in town since I got it. I have juiced a wide variety of fruit, veggies, and herbs. It has made some amazing juices and will get the job done and done well.

"Few books that I have read have been as open, honest and transparent as Mark has been in sharing his story. Mark is able to objectively look back at the mistakes he mad, some time and time again, and say 'yeah it was my choice, my fault, I screwed up' but in saying that he has turned a corner and is now in a very different place.This short biography follows Marc from his youth to the low point in his life. He shares his darkest secrets and biggest failures. He shares photo's that embarrass him, and stories he regrets. But he does so to show us that change is possible. This book clocks in at 65 pages and most of it is raw. Mark does not hold back, on analyzing his own mistakes, so that they can be an example to others who need to make changes in their own lives.Once I got into it I could not put it down. Which makes it good that it is short and to the point. Mark's vulnerability is what makes this book most powerful. I believe anyone could read this book and come away looking at their own life in a different way, and looking for ways to make improvements. This book will motivate you without a doubt.Books by Mark Campanale:Fat Business Man (Summer 2014)Fit Business Man (Spring 2015)Untitled Cookbook (Spring 2015)","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FCFQY6OXDYDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KQTGPCW#wasThisHelpful","R2FCFQY6OXDYDL","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must admit there is not a lot I have read from either Holly or Cassandra that I have not really liked. When I read their books most get a 5 out of 5 stars. But this book was in some ways more unique and enjoyable. Maybe it was the fact that it is their first collaboration? Maybe it was the fact that many would compare it to harry potter, and it is better, better writing; better story.From the first words I could barely put the book down. This is the story of Callum, he lives in a world where magic is real. But many do not know about it. His father has raised him alone and spent his whole life warning Callum, how bad magic is and those who practice it. He has been raised to want nothing to do with magic. So when he is summoned to the Iron Trial to determine if he will enter the Magisterium to train to control his magical abilities, he does everything he can to try and fail, and fail he does or at least thinks he does. But that is not to be his fate. He is in fact taken on by Master Rufus to train along with Aaron and Tamara. Though an unlikely paring the three soon become a true team. But their adventures to get through the first year at The Magisterium only begin with the tests to go to the school.As you begin reading these books you have a young hero, who clearly has set ideas about magic and its place in his life. Readers are also set up to lean towards some preconceived ideas about where the book is going. And then it throws you a big curve ball. Some of the unexpected turns, and character development is part of what made this such an exciting and engaging read.This book was a great read. It was fun and entertaining and definitely left you wanting more. Which is very good because it is the first in a new pentalogy. The bad news is the books are coming out about a year apart so there will be a long wait for book 2. This is a wonderful read from two of the hottest authors in young adult literature. So check it out, you will not be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PTOLQ5N7VVO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0545522250#wasThisHelpful","R1PTOLQ5N7VVO4","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been a long time since a new author or series has seized me as much as these authors and this series. In the matter of a few days while travelling for work I read the prequel, first novel and short story between the first and second novel. These are riving stories that were very hard to put down. Now to be honest they are not the sort of thing I usually read any more. These were the sort of novels I read about 15-20 years ago when Anne Rice was at her peak and I was just a university student looking for distractions from studies. But there is something about the way these stories are written, especially this first novel in the trilogy, The Blood Gospel, which grabbed my attention and would not let it go.The basic story is that an earth quake centered in Masada, Israel, unleashes a gas that kills hundreds. Sergeant Jordan Stone is there to investigate the compound used and trace it's source and eliminate the threat. Father Rhun Korza is there to run his own investigation. And Dr. Erin Granger is called in as an archeologist against her will, to investigate a tomb found hidden in the mountain. The three are the only survivors of a brutal attack that wipes out Stone's team of highly trained military men. The three flee, and are now on the run chasing clues that should lead them to The Blood Gospel a book supposedly written in Christ's own blood. The three must explore the past in order to try and save the future. But there are many hands at play.The Order of Sanguines is a secret society within the Catholic church, they are sworn to fight the Strigoi, vampires, but they also have other secrets. The Belial are a group who work with the srigoi.The three main characters are wonderfully written. You really appreciate the strengths and weaknesses each brings to the team. The story is face paced and high addictive. It is like a cross between Dan Brown and Anne Rice but better than either. It is a great novel and should prove to be an awesome trilogy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1020ISFR9O99C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0089LOGDE#wasThisHelpful","R1020ISFR9O99C","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second novel I have read by T.M. Gaouette and I have enjoyed both immensely. However the pace and intensity in this story was gripping. I barely put the book down and read it in two extended settings. When I finished this novel, I was really wishing for more. It was only when I went to do some research for the review that I discovered it is the first in a series called Faith & Kung Fu.This story was a very intense read. From the moment Gabriel met Tanner Rose he was apprehensive and reserved. Gabriel and his mother live in the country, he studies martial arts and is a young man of faith. Tanner Rose is a very young Hollywood starlet who dresses and acts beyond her years. At every Turn Gabriel's patience and fortitude seems to be tested by this girl his mother has brought home. Gabriel and Tanner's mother were roommate in university and even though they have chosen very different path's Miss Ruth took Tanner in to try and help. Both Ruth and Gabriel have strong faith and personal practice. Tanner thinks they are just country hicks, and feels like she is being abandoned, punished, and neglected by her mother for pulling her from her party scene lifestyle. Will Gabriel's steadfast faith and strength help ground Tanner or will her wild addictive and self-centered traits rub off on him.""There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it."" - 1 Corinthians 10:13)The characters are wonderfully written. The solid honest ethical life of Gabriel and his mother in contrast to Tanner and her Hollywood shenanigans is a stunning look at faith in the midst of modern life and culture. The story was compelling and an absolute page turner. I can highly recommend it. It is one of the best Christian Fiction stories I have read in years, and one of the best Catholic Fiction stories for young adults I have ever read. In many ways it reminds me of Regina Doman's writings. Good solid writing crafted into an awesome story. Freeing Tanner Rose is to be the first of four books in the Faith & Kung Fu series. And I cannot wait to read the next instalment. It was an excellent read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DMMZRTRURF5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1494305062#wasThisHelpful","R1DMMZRTRURF5B","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I must be honest and state that I absolutely love Andrew M. Seddon's Saints Alive Volume I - Saints of Empire and Saints Alive Volume II - Celtic Paths so when I had the chance to receive a review copy of his latest novel Ring Of Time I was thrilled. The book did not disappoint. Seddon has a stunning ability to take readers into the past but learn lessons they can apply daily in their lives. Some books I devour, and go back and reread, others I read and the seldom come to mind again. This book I had to take my time with, to savor, taste and wait and come back to it again. If this book were a meal it would be a rare dining experience, intended to be relished and recalled fondly again and again.Set in the 27th century, it is a series of stories told to us by Dr. Robert Cragg, he is the first time-travelling historian. Humanity has reached new heights of technology, they can send someone back in time and retrieve them. Suffering from the loss of his daughter and wife, he volunteer's to be the first to test this new technology, in fact he becomes famous as a time-travelling historian. He is running from his pain and loss into ancient Rome. But instead of encountering dry dusty stories he finds people, many of who he comes to care about and even a few love. The places and time's he visits are:The Ghosts of Kourion, Cyprus, AD 365Tyndareus and Krikor, At Sea, 15 BCMoonrise over Metzada, Judea, AD 74The Slipper of Sulpicia Lepidina, Britain, AD 103Dust of Caesar, Italy, AD 79Eudaimon, Egypt, AD 132Asellina's Last Fight, Britain, AD 84Doctoral Dissertation, Rome, AD 113In the Mists of Britain, Britain, AD 62Kobrinia, Britain, AD 257The Arms of Venus, Melos (undated)The Philosopher's Ring, Egypt, AD 415But bouncing around time seems to be taking a toll on his health and he knows his number of trips to the past is dwindling. He must make some decisions about the past and about his future. He has had the pleasure of walking the sands of time and he has interacted with commoners, nobility, sailors, businessmen, zealots, legionaries, druids, gladiatrix and philosophers  and through it all, he finds people he can interact with, learn from and he finds he enjoys the past more than the present. . For Robert the past is not dead and gone, but alive. More alive than he ever expected to feel after all he has lost.The story is wonderfully written, not only does the past come alive for Robert, but for us the readers also. It is an incredible read and one of the best books of the more than 115 I have read so far this year and one of the best of the past few years. It is an excellent read!Well done Andrew well done.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHMOK21NX0MMM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7C7C0W#wasThisHelpful","RHMOK21NX0MMM","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a few hallmarks of great stories, at lease in my opinion. One of the big one's for me is does the story stay with you. I finished this story about a month ago and yet it keep's coming back to me. I have now reread it. My first impressions were 'What an Incredible story!'. And that feeling has only intensified. This is likely the best science fiction short story I have ever read and to be honest probably the second best short story I have every read.Two brothers who have never really met, Varion the greatest warrior the empire has ever known, and Dennison his younger brother, born while Varion was away at war. Varion who has never know defeat and Dennison who has never known victory.This was an amazing story that really has stuck with me. I highly recommend it. Great writing, excellent characters and break neck pace. My only regret is that it is a short story. I would love to read longer versions of this story, or more stories with these characters.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIL5JGIKQ1R5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V4B4GQ#wasThisHelpful","RIL5JGIKQ1R5W","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the readers of my review blog suggested I give Gerard Brennan a try. The first one I tried was good but not great it was a collection of short stories called Other Stories and Nothing But Time. Reading it I could see where the recommendation came from, it felt kind of like reading Chuck Palahniuk or Irvine Welsh but not quite. This one was much much closer and I see why Brennan is compared to those two.This is a novella set in the world of Wee Rockets. The main character is Danny Gibson a young tough serving time in a facility for young offenders. Danny is not tall in stature but he is tough as nails and also smart, even if that brain is often turned to destructive tendencies. He is learning how to act in front of his staff, the teachers and even his educational psychologist. But there are some things he just cannot let go. He will not show weakness. And he is vindictive. But something strange happens; Conan Quinlan a new detainee has found a soft spot in Danny's armour. Conan is on the autism spectrum and the teachers do not thing he is in the right facility. Danny sort of takes him under his wing.This story really surprised me. It was rough and raw like other stories by Brennan I have read, and yet this one over comes that anger and harshness and shows us something else. The story was really well done and immediately upon finishing it I started reading the novel set before it Wee Rockets.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12FPIS86ARAW0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYZLHRU#wasThisHelpful","R12FPIS86ARAW0","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Of late there have been a number of trilogies that have let me down, they started off amazing and went downhill; each successive book just a bit more disappointing. That was not the case with the Jasper Dent or I Hunt Killers trilogy. With each book I had a greater respect for Lyga's powers as a wordsmith. My first response was 'Wow! An amazing conclusion to the series. With every book I read by Barry Lyga my respect for him as a writer goes up.' And reflecting back after thinking about the book for a few weeks I can honestly say this is one of the best series I have ever read. I average over 100 books a year, and to be honest waiting for the final installment in this series was painful.As fan's will know book two ended with three simultaneous cliff hangers. Our friends Jazz, Connie and Howie are all in life threatening danger, without a lot of chance of things improving. In fact things are going to get worse, much worse. And Jazz realizes the only way he will ever catch his father is to break the law, lots of laws and maybe even do things he never ever wanted to do.To go back to my first impressions, wow! One of the greatest things about Lyga's stories is the characters, and the growth of the characters in this story is incredible. The pace of the story and plot twists are at times overwhelming. The story is very very well written. This book was so addictive, I stayed up reading and did not put it down until I was done even though I had to work the next morning.Blood of my Blood is an amazing story in an excellent series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R128UGG2W4PARD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQ2MZRQ#wasThisHelpful","R128UGG2W4PARD","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was actually browsing the Kindle story for prayer books by Stormie Omartian when this one caught my eye. Words do have incredible power, the words spoken over us, the words we speak to ourselves in our heads; the words that become our reality in our day to day life. But those words can hurt, cripple and destroy or they can be words for life. Now to be honest over the last 25 years I have read numerous books on prayer, and books of prayers. There is not much new in this volume. But it is written with such straight forward faith and devotion. It will encourage and challenge you. You will find some of the prayers speak directly to you that day and will speak them aloud a number of times. Others will be prompted to share with others or to pray them over friends, families or situations you are aware of. This book is 30 declarations of faith paired with 30 prayers. I have prayed them each aloud and plan to do so again.The 30 Declarations are:Everything Is In God's HandsI Am God's Precious ChildI Will Live in God's FaithfulnessI Will Be Free From AnxietyI Will Declare God's TruthsI Declare I Will Pray MoreI Will Be Grateful To GodI Will Glorify God By TestifyingI Will Have An Abundant Explosion of God's FavorMy Only Addiction Is To The LordI Am Anointed By GodThe Bible Teaches RighteousnessI Will Use Words WiselyGod Can Breakthrough AnythingGod's Destiny For My Life Will PrevailMy Body Is God's TempleJesus Is My Savoir and FriendI Am Justified By FaithI Am Blessed With Spiritual GiftsI Will Ignite My Passion For GodI Will Chose Faith Over FearI Will Be Bold and Stretch My FaithI Choose to be Calm in the StormI Will Build People UpI Will Be Active for the Lord Rather Than PassiveI am ForgivenGod is My HealerI Have A Sound Mind Grounded in God's TruthI Will Thank the Lord for Adversity by Singing PraisesNothing Will Separate Me From God AlmightyReading this book took me back to when I was new at being serious about being a Christian, it reminded me of books by Bill Bright and Neil T. Anderson, Billy Hybels and more. It is a short book with prayers that have the power to transform your life. This was an amazing little book and I look forward to reading more from Glenn in the near future and I am already rereading and praying this one.

"This book took me completely by surprise. I was intrigued from the first time I saw the cover and title. I found that I kept thinking  about it and once I finally read it I found that I thought about it for weeks after finishing it. The story is amazingly well written, it is told in two parts a trial and Sunny remembering the events that led up to the charges. It all started with required community service hours to finish school.From the very beginning we knew a tragedy was coming, but we did not know how. We had no idea what got us from where we were to a corpse. Sonja Anna Ehret aka Sunny has been charged with manslaughter, the story takes place a year after the events. The trial begins and Sunny is living through the trial and remembering the story as she experienced it. Sunny was volunteering at Paradise Manor because she had to for school. But while there she meets Cole Demers a young man about her age that comes almost every day to visit his grandmother. They develop a friendship and often spend their time at the manor together helping the older people. Cole shares with Sunny that he promised his grandmother that he would help he pass if it was needed. After an accident Sunny feels responsible for, she is faced with questions or loyalty, commitment and following through.This is one of the best books I have read in the last year. It will make you think. It will stir your heart.

"This book surprised me, plain and simple. I must admit when reading about the book I knew I would end up comparing it to the Hunger Games and know that many other would also. And to be honest for about the first third of the book I was asking myself 'How would Katniss handle this?' or 'how would Collins have written that'? But soon this story grabbed me and took me to places I had not yet imagined. It was an amazing read and I cannot wait for the next installment in the story. In a world devastated by the Seven Stages War, no one is really safe. There are zones or colonies where the survivors try and survive and try and repair the earth and the environment. Yet even there things are not as they seem, as Cia Vale discovers when she is selected to be a testing candidate. On the eve of her selection her father warns her that the testing would be devastating, he warns her to trust no one.From the beginning I found myself trusting Cia. Cheering her on.

"This little book is an amazing mix of theology, philosophy, memoir, pense and story. The main premise is that we really live by spending our life. They paint is brought home to us again and again through different vignette's. Wilson is open and transparent. He shares his struggles, joys and disappointments.  Both Tolkien and Lewis believe that stories were truth in as much as they taught and showed us that there is more than what we see. Wilson has managed to extend that insight by sharing his own stories. Also Madeliene L'Engle stated ""I am using myth in its ancient meaning - That which was true, that which is true, that which will be true, that strange truth which is as elusive as home."" Wilson has shared his myth and how he uses myth making to give life more meaning and unravel the meaning in life.This book was an amazing read!

"This series is an interesting concept. 10 short stories focusing on the life, exploits and adventures of Magnus Bane. Coauthored in a collaboration between Cassandra Clare and with either Sarah Rees Brennan or Maureen Johnson each piece published separately for digital consumption as they are written and then combined and republished as a whole.  Having read the first 5 twice now it will be interesting to see how the final book comes together, will it just be the stories, will they be separated and pieced together chronologically or yet in some other whimsical combination. But let's get back to the story at hand.What Really Happened in Peru is an interesting story or series of vignettes in the life of Magnus Bane. The story is broken into four tableau's each a different event set in different times, 1791, 1885, 1890 and 1962. As we have come to know and love the over the top flamboyant character of Magnus in Clare's other series it is interesting to see stories focused solely on him. It the preface we are told that Magnus was saddened when he was Banned from Peru by the High Council of Peruvian warlocks. These stories are some of the reason why. But taking them as a sample and comparing them to other adventure of Magnus it is surprising he is not almost universally banned from both downworlder and shadowhunter society.1791Magnus and Ragnor Fell sort of a Peacock and a Pigeon they have an encounter with a holler monkey, ships full of guano and pirates. What could go wrong?1885On this escapade we find Magnus along with Ragnor and their friend Catarina Loss.1890Magnus decides to take up music. A charango specifically. But with all Magnus does he has an ulterior motive, and often it is about someone he is lusting over. A very drunk Magnus does much he regrets.1962Another adventure with another interest. And will we find out why he was banded?This was a great short story and a wonderful into into this new series all about Magnus, and really would he have it any other way?","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1629MSVOYW0E4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAWEFB2#wasThisHelpful","R1629MSVOYW0E4","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have enjoyed all the books by Regina Doman that I have read. But this one is to date the best! The story was so powerful I read it twice. It is raw, powerful and riveting! As a reader we can see the train wreck coming but have no idea how the crash will happen and if there will be any chance for a recovery.It all begins with a secret! A secret summer romance between Hermes McCaffrey the conservative catholic senator and Raphaela the adopted daughter of an extremist reclusive scientist. Scaling the tower of the property next to their summer home to win a bet Hermes discovers Raphaela and soon their friendship blossoms. For different reasons they each want to keep their friendship a secret from their families. And that first deception soon leads to others all heading towards a disaster but neither realizes how dire the consequences will be.Be warned this book deals with numerous issues, premarital sex, debate about abortion. Prison and the reality of that environment. And the many conflicts between a Roman Catholic and a post modernist world view.  But with that being said.Rapunzel Let Down is an amazing Read. It is a unique twist and modernization of a tale we all know. Two young adults raised in radically different environments meet because of a dare. And soon find they have a great love of books, learning and life. Each sparks something the other did not know was missing. But can traditions, and family pride keep them apart? Read this riveting new novel by Regina Doman, the  sixth novel in the Fairy Tales Retold series is an enthralling read. Once you pick it up you will not want to put it down.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2X6OXO3QTB963/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982767773#wasThisHelpful","R2X6OXO3QTB963","A2KBF2OYR359AJ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KBF2OYR359AJ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"You may like this or not--depending on what you're looking for.If you're looking for something that's a healthy alternative for peanut butter, keep looking. The first ingredient in this spread is sugar. Yes, real sugar not high fructose corn syrup, but 21 grams of sugar in a 2 tbsp serving is a powerful punch of sugar. My favorite peanut butter (Jif Extra Crunchy) has 3 grams of sugar for a comparable serving with a lot more fiber to balance out the sugar rush. Cocoa and almonds are down on the list of ingredients past the fats. Both my husband and I agreed that the chocolate taste is stronger than the almonds. Try a Hershey's chocolate almond bar before you commit to a jar of this and if you like that flavor, you should be good with the spread.If you're looking for a sweet frosting consistency spread with a Hershey bar with almond flavor, run and grab a jar of this stuff. You are going to love it.  It is kid sweet and it'll be great on sandwiches, with carrots or celery, or even as a frosting for brownies or cupcakes. You may like it with fruit, but not if you're looking for something that will bring out the natural flavor of the fruit--this is way too sweet for anything except maybe bananas--it will definitely overpower strawberries or milder fruits.Rebecca Kyle, March 2014","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7F66SRIHYN6H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8YLISS#wasThisHelpful","R7F66SRIHYN6H","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a lot already said about this novel. I will honestly say it's worth 5 stars for quite a lot of reasons, but the reason I am choosing to highlight in this review is the skillful hard-hitting drawing of her characters.It's easy to depict your main character. Writers want the reader to know them and preferably to like them since many in this genre want to write sequels.Allison Leotta goes where few authors are brave enough to tread. She shows you her bad guys--in this case, a DC-based gang of teenage boys led by Diablo, who are as bad as it gets. She doesn't just hide the bad behind a curtain, she lets you see these dudes and it's chilling.I remember working for Probation and Parole with an officer who came from DC and what he said about crime there would chill your blood on a summer day. This novel reads like how he described his experience. The sketches of these gang members are so vivid and strong you could use them for a mug shot. Writers, for certain, should read this book. It will teach you about writing memorable story people.Rebecca Kyle, January 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U8DV3491HQUW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=145164485X#wasThisHelpful","R2U8DV3491HQUW","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to really understand this book, you need to read Piccirilli's first book in the series, The Last Kind Words. There's just too much backstory to weave into this novel and you need the worldbuilding he's done in The Last Kind Words to fully understand character motivation and past events. Trust me, it's worth the investment of time and money. I honestly like The Last Kind Words better than this book, but both are darn fine crime fiction.Terrier Rand and his criminal family are characters you are not going to forget. The interweave of the relationships with the plot is strong enough to keep you turning pages whatever mode of reading you choose. For this read, the plot was not as strong as the first book--there were a few too many stories to tell, but I believe there are going to be more Terrier Rand books coming and this is just the setup for a series which I hope will be a long one.Rebecca Kyle, January 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O22SJPEQ0AZE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345529006#wasThisHelpful","R2O22SJPEQ0AZE","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In my opinion, an iPad (or similar device) back cover, should do three things:1.  Not block the camera or any other back and side accessible ports2.  Protect the back of the device from dirt and scratches3.  Protect the device when it is dropped4.  Provide a better surface than the slippery metallic back of the device to handleThe Belkin cover does 1 and 2 admirably.  The cutout for the camera does not impair its function and the other ports are all accessible with no problem. It's thick enough that it should prevent the worst scratching damage. You can even see the Apple cover clearly.I have enough trust in Belkin's engineering to believe that they considered protection from falls when they chose the material for the back cover. My experience with the company has been very good to excellent so far.The only area where this cover fails is the fourth and final one. The plastic material is slippery and hard to hold onto. For our household, this is a big no-no. We do a lot of pass-and-play gaming with the iPad Air and one fumble and that costly device is broken on the floor. Neither my husband nor I like the feel of the back cover at all, either. It's almost slimy it's so smooth. Would definitely prefer something with a bit grippier surface.Rebecca Kyle, January 2014","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NKB7WEII1WTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FSB5UB0#wasThisHelpful","R1NKB7WEII1WTM","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband recently updated to an iPad Air and as usual, he grabbed the Smart Cover from Apple.  He then went looking for a back cover that he would like.In the meantime I came across the SnapView Folio from CaseLogic and ordered it for him as a surprise.When it arrived he was dubious but he tried it anyway.  Guess what, he liked it better than the Smart Cover.The SnapView allows him to use the case in more positions than the Smart Cover, has back protection for his precious and the fabric is easier to grip and never cold to his hands.Installing the iPad into the SnapView was very simple with a snug fit. All buttons, ports and the like are easily accessible with the cover on and unlike the Smart Cover, the SnapView will not accidentally come off in his hands.Heck, I even got to play with his iPad for a bit with the SnapView on and I am impressed.  It does add a little weight but not so much that it would bother except for really long sessions.  I played a game on it and found it easy to hold.Best of all, it is half the price of the Apple Smart Cover and covers BOTH front and back of the tablet.So yes, this is a case I will be recommending to friends who purchase an iPad.  They even make a version for the iPad Mini.Rebecca Kyle, January 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25D7KZIWCEWJ7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EH6ZK9O#wasThisHelpful","R25D7KZIWCEWJ7","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband and I went to see this film at our local art theater on its last week of showing on a lark. If I had realized how good it was, I would have seen it sooner so we could have caught it once more on the big screen. My husband and I -- as well as most of the audience -- left the theater gobsmacked.An all-star cast, including Sting, David Bowie, Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen and others pay homage to a group of amazing women who brought life to their music. That's their backup singers. Their voices, the subtle touches have added the sparkle and spice to some of the greatest music of our time. The ""call and response"" form that's used in gospel has literally shaped the sound of rock and roll. Ray Charles pioneered it and the Caucasian artists rolled with it--for example, Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wide Side.""I didn't know the incredible female voice from the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"" was the backup vocalist's idea. The song itself is amazing but the half-screamed ""It's just a shout away!"" adds a kind of urgency to the song that even Mick Jagger has to bow to.The chorus is what makes David Bowie's ""Young Americans"" rock.It seems hard to believe, but Darlene Love and her backup group The Blossoms were the voice of the Crystals. She and her fellow singers had to watch as the Caucasian group who were lip synching rose to stardom while they were the ones who actually sung the songs.The interviews are incredible. The music is even better. I would strongly recommend getting the CD with the music as accompaniment. It's well worth the money.Rebecca Kyle, January 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GFB86KKGITUD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E1LR2B4#wasThisHelpful","R2GFB86KKGITUD","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first read ""Kindred Rites"" back in 1999, it was an instant favorite. Back then, the book was difficult to classify--it still is. Within the pages are tales of dark fantasy  so elegantly intertwined with our American history and folklore, they are equal and integral parts. We not only visit the old arts of magic, but the near lost arts of quilting, beer brewing, and home midwifery.Alfreda is now thirteen, she should be home with her family still, but her magic required training. Still unsure and untried, she faces challenges that skilled practitioners would fear. I well remembered the challenges she faced and yet I still was up until 3:00AM re-reading ""Kindred Rites."" The suspense is that finely penned.The story is one you will revisit from time to time when you need an old friend. I would recommend both ""Night Calls"" and ""Kindred Rites"" for readers of history and fantasy from young adult on up.Rebecca McFarland Kyle, January 2014","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QQ8OSR42VOEC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYPRITK#wasThisHelpful","R3QQ8OSR42VOEC","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's difficult to review a product that I am stocking as a preventative measure. I don't have the flu and I am hoping I don't get it. Should I be unfortunate enough to get ill, I keep a supply of products like this in my medicine cabinet to ward off the flu at the first symptoms.Of course, the best remedy for the flu is prevention. I vaccinate every year. Vaccinations don't just protect me and my family, they are also good for the population as a whole. By vaccinating, we protect the vulnerable segments of the population:  infants, elderly, cancer patients and others with immune issues. I wash my hands, too. And, I have learned from a friend who works as an ER nurse that a saline nasal rinse whenever you're around someone who is ill can help to prevent contagion.It's important for us to consider alternate remedies for the flu and other similar illnesses because the tried-and-true remedies may not work for much longer. Just recently, I read an article where Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, one of the physician researchers at the CDC said we are reaching the end of antibiotics. Many issues have caused antibiotic resistance, including physician over-prescription and antibiotics used in our food supply. In 2007, ""Environ Health Prospect"" published an article citing that Tamiflu (one of the most popular prescription flu remedies) may be contaminating the water supply and thus could potentially help evolve a Tamiflu resistant avian flu.King Bio's Natural Homeopathic Remedy for multi-strain flu is herbal and gluten free. According to the manufacturer, there are no known side-effects with other drugs and it is new enough on the market for there (hopefully) to not be resistance to it--at least, in my case, since I have not tried this type of remedy before, it may work quite well.Here's to your health this season.R.

"Scotland Yard was quite busy in the 1880's. Jack the Ripper was ravaging the poorer quarters in Whitechapel and another serial killer was creating just as bizarre crimes--in this case, leaving only the torso of his female victims to be discovered. The Torso Killer would probably have gained much more attention had he not been eclipsed by Jack.Pinborough writes an interesting account of these killings using Dr. Bond (a real physician tormented by opium addiction) as a focus character. There's a strong fantasy element and a bit more gore than some readers can possibly handle (I was fine with it).Bear with the first sections of the book which can be a bit of a tangle of characters and setup. It really does get better.Sarah Pinborough does an outstanding job of capturing the essence of Victorian London. Her historical knowledge is exceptional.

"On a future Mars, colonists are formed into caste societies. Children are assigned duties based upon their colors--and they are bioengineered for their roles. You eat based upon your output--and if your team doesn't produce, your rations are cut. There's no mercy and lives are short and brutal. Darrow's a sixteen-year-old miner, already wed until his wife is killed quite literally for a song. He's enlisted into a conspiracy to infiltrate a leadership school.The story's one of a huge handful of dystopics coming out for young adult readers still hungry after finishing ""Hunger Games.""

"I honestly don't think I have felt so much reading a novel since the first time I read ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" I don't make comparisons to Harper Lee's single masterwork easily. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of my all-time favorite books and films.A returning Black war hero is murdered and his battered body is dumped. There's no justice for him in Mississippi, but a White author writes the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall sends Regina Robichard down to investigate. Within a few pages, I'd wept, been furious, and felt the faint stirrings of hope for justice. The story ably deals with huge issues:  segregated military units in the war, treatment of Blacks in the South, female lawyers...It's a huge scope for 400 plus pages, but all of these stories are intertwined in an inexorable whole.Be prepared for a powerful wash of emotions.

"Having used the FitBit, and returning said FitBit when it failed to record correctly, I've been on the lookout for something else.  When iHealth became available I thought what the heck, lets try it.Where the FitBit was small, the iHealth is pretty large.  The device itself is round and can be popped out of the ""bright"" blue band it comes in stalled in and put in one of three other holders. There is a belt/pant clip in both blue and black and a black wrist band.Because of its size I could not imagine having it on my wrist unless I used it only when I exercised.  The pant/belt clip seems to be a way to keep it with me and record my life of activity without the annoying reminder I'm recording my life of activity. Plus the wrist bands are made out of a rubber like material that I can imagine would sweat badly in hot or humid (or hot and humid) weather.The enclosed instruction manual is in English and French only. Not sure why Spanish was missed.  Looking at iHealth's support page did not quickly reveal any other manuals.  The font size of the manual is small so people with visual issues may need a magnifier to clearly read the manual.iHealth can communicate with your iPhone via a free downloadable application. Users of Android smartphones are out of luck as iHealth only supports the iPhone and users must have iOS 5 or later to use it. In order to use the iPhone app you need to create a user account.Where the FitBit tracked more than walking, it seems the iHealth can track steps and sleep.  iHealth also resets your stats at midnight so be sure to set the date/time correctly when it is first powered on. There is also the silent alarm which is meant to gently wake you up.  Not sure about this feature for my husband who can sleep through horrible thunder storms (really loud thunder storms) or the vibrations of his iPhone going off during the night.After creating my account, entering my vitals and pairing the phone and iHealth a popup shows a new firmware to be installed.  Now I understand putting in my height, weight and age to the application but I have no idea if iHealth stores that information online.  Well I quickly found the answer to that by logging in to iHealth's website and there, staring back at me, were my vitals. Color me an unhappy camper.Yes, I did see the iPhone app had a ""guest"" account that could be used.  Sadly the iHealth will not pair to the guest account.  A user must create an account in order to pair the device to the iPhone application.A good thing though is no fiddly mess to set the date and time.  The iHealth syncs date and time automatically from the application.iHealth's battery is not charged when received so charing it is required.  But the manual gives no indication how long this will take.  Also the included USB cable to connect the iHealth to a computer for charging is very short.  Depending on your computer you could have the iHealth dangling off your desk to make an attractive cat toy should you have cats.Thankfully one does not have to open the app daily.  iHealth indicates it can store up to 14 days of activity between syncing the app to the device though the manual highly recommends you sync daily.The manual shows the user how to enter sleep mode for tracking your sleep patterns and airplane mode when flying.  All in all iHealth is going to be easy to use.Just like the FitBit, I'll probably update this review after I get more time in with the iHealth and learn more about using it.Rebecca Kyle, November 2013","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1202MAW6352YW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D8JIPJI#wasThisHelpful","R1202MAW6352YW","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""A Beautiful Truth"" is two intertwined tales: one from the point of view of a wealthy man whose younger wife just lost their child and realizes she can have no more. When he sees a circus chimp, he believes adopting one will be the answer for his grief. The other is the narrative of the chimps at The Girdings Institute, a primate research facility.The human narrative is interesting. It's easy to see how well-intended decisions lead a person to make bad decisions. This story alone is worth the price of the book...The ape narrative had me riveted. The author based his writing on years of research into chimpanzees, so it's authentic as possible. The speech is simplistic, but shows heart, imagination, and purpose.Yes, there are beautiful truths in this book. Ugly ones as well.

"You get the dog you need--this is author Jon Katz's take on people adopting dogs. Not only do we purposely look for a dog to fill a void in our lives--the dog intuitively senses what we are seeking and fills that role.Maria came along in Jon Katz's life when he was at a low. He was over sixty, alone and separated from friends and family. His marriage was ending and he was despondent.It was love at first sight -- at least, that's how Jon felt for Maria. Frieda, the traumatized guard dog Maria chose because she protected her from men....This story is not just about Frieda, but Jon's recovery and Renaissance and the budding late-life romance between him and Maria. It's a hopeful tale all-around.While I read the entire book, I found myself wanting to move past the people and back toward the dog--it wasn't for lack of compassion for either Jon or Maria, I picked up the book because of the title and I was hoping for more of a dog tale. Frankly, I needed badly to escape people for a bit. I'd say about 1/3 of the book is Frieda--her training and her story. Those pages had me riveted and often in tears because that's what I wanted and needed to read about. That's why I chose this particular book.If the dog's story being a smaller portion of a larger tale is enough for you, you're good. Katz is an excellent author and an excellent detailer of his own character and that of our current society. I would gladly read more of his writing, but this tale should perhaps best be titled, ""A Second Chance Life.""Rebecca Kyle, October 2013","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DB6EXQJAMZHV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345531175#wasThisHelpful","R1DB6EXQJAMZHV","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

From the moment the film came on, I was lost in space, my hands gripping the seat, and my heart hammering. The music was a beautiful counterpoint, emphasizing the key moments without overwhelming viewers.We saw the film in IMAX in an RPX environment--essentially, Regal charges extra for leather seats, widescreen and upgraded sound. It was worth the near double price of the ticket. ""Gravity"" is the best film I have seen in a long time.This is probably one of the most researched films in history and the hard work really paid off. ""Gravity"" took 4.5 years to make. Sandra Bullock said choreographing the zero gravity pushed her body to the utter limits.  While rehearsing, Bullock had contact with a real astronaut, Catherine ""Cady"" Coleman, who sent her texts from outer space to tell her various aspects of her job. When Coleman finally got to see the film, she said it was one of the best depictions of her work she'd ever seen.WARNING:  Some people have complained about dizziness and nausea from viewing the film. People with vertigo and problems with 3D should probably not see ""Gravity"" in 3D. I have vertigo and did not have a problem with the standard version, but your mileage could vary depending on what your triggers are.Rebecca Kyle, October 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNDG360EF9WYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LAIIGM#wasThisHelpful","RNDG360EF9WYZ","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""MaddAddam"" is the conclusion of a trilogy, which began with ""Oryx and Crake"" and continued with ""The Year of the Flood."" While I strongly recommend that you read both books before you attempt ""MaddAddam"" because they are worth the effort and reading them will help you fully comprehend the conclusion. You do not have to do so, though, because Atwood has very thoughtfully included a summary of the two prequels upfront called, ""The Story So Far.""I once said ""The Handmaid's Tale"" was the most terrifying books I have ever read. That includes King, Poe, and Lovecraft, by the way. Well, Atwood stepped up her game with this trilogy. The best horror (and dystopic sci-fi) takes current headlines and permutes them to your worst nightmares. ""MaddAddam"" is the culmination of corporate greed, abuse of humanity and genetic manipulation.""MaddAddam"" is not a book that I would take lightly. It's a responsibility to read works like these because once Ms. Atwood opens your eyes to the possibilities of what could happen, you need to consider what kind of world you want to leave to the next generations, then step up and get informed about what is going on and do something to effect the kind of change you want to see in the world.I would include Margaret Atwood in a list of the finest authors I have ever read.

"I honestly did not buy this dryer for my hair. I have fine highlighted hair and blow drying tends to turn it the consistency of broom straw. I wanted it for various crafts which require heat.It's so bloody cold this year I realize I don't want to just towel dry my hair. So I started using the Remington to dry it--understand there's so much static in the air that if I combed my hair in the dark, it'd look like a Tesla coil. But, I decided to try without mousse or conditioner just to see what would happen.Guess what? The little red Remington dried my hair just as well as it would if it were naturally dried. I did leave it just a tad damp so I didn't take all the moisture out, but my hair looked fine.Add mousse to the picture and my hair looks great! I think there actually is something to this dryer's technology that it does not cause damage that the older dryers did.Then came Snowpocalypse. This little Remington saved our bacon when the pipes froze the first time at the first of the year.Though the sun was out this morning, it is still 14 degrees and I probably should not have stopped the faucets dripping at sunrise.

"Did I ever get this one wrong.  A wireless headset that my husband could use downstairs.  I was all over this.Little did I know it is not meant for home phones but rather office phones.  To me the text about compatibility being ""DECT GAP VoIP"" meant nothing.  I knew our phone service was VoIP but that was about it.So how did I review this item?  Well, it was based on setting it up and having my husband take it to his office where his phone there did support the ZUM.He reports the unit was easily assembled, fit together well and had lots of spare parts like 2 ear pads.  He even noted if one did not like the typical headset piece the ZUM came with ear pieces so it would fit over/around your ear.  There were multiple items like this so we figured it was meant either for sizing or extras.The instruction manual is clear and easy to read.  It includes instructions on how to replace the rechargeable battery which is not always the case with devices like the ZUM.Unfortunately my husband is a developer/programmer and doesn't talk much on the phone.  He tried it out and said it worked well enough but he would love to give it a better evaluation but his position does not require lots of phone contact.So to recap, this is not for your home system unless it is DECT GAP VoIP compatible phone.

"I have practically worn out my ""Practical Magic"" DVD. I even own the soundtrack and play music from it quite often. It's one of my go-to movies for Halloween or when I just want to curl up and enjoy. Usually, I look for a book when I see a movie that I like. I'm not a huge fan of tie-ins, but I like seeing who wrote the story and often I will read the book as well.And yes, the book is almost always better. In this case, I am calling a tie.What are the differences?  The film plays up the witchy plotline a lot more and we see more of the elder aunts. In the film, Sally still lives in Massachusetts with the aunts. The film is the story of the aunts, Gillie, and Sally. The book tells more Gillian and Sally's story and that of the third generation, Antonia and Kylie. Both feature the death of Gillian's poisonous ex, ""Jimmy,"" but the Goran brings the character to delicious wicked life in the film.This is the first book I have read by Alice Hoffman; however it will not be the last.

"When a werewolf is killed outside the quiet village of Sun-Return, Allie Sorensson discovers two truths:  there are beings beyond her ken and that she has inherited Gifts to fight them. This is a heavy burden for a girl on the verge of turning twelve.As her lessons begin, Allie's most important insight is discovering how little she knows. Missing a simple detail in identifying an herb used for medicine can cost a life. Lives are at stake - because there's more dark creatures coming.Funny how when you read a book that you haven't read in a long time, it feels like meeting an old friend again. You pick up where you left off and then you're lost in that world of wonder. In the case of a very well-written book like Night Calls, re-readings always show you something new.  The first time I read Night Calls, I was fascinated by the supernatural element - werewolves in a pioneer setting. Now, I'm realizing the deeper lessons we can learn from the pioneers of Sun-Reach:  communities must remain strong, land must be carefully stewarded, and no Gift should ever be wasted.Night Calls will keep you up all night and leave you anticipating the sequel.Rebecca McFarland Kyle, September 2013","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I2K2EQKKCQGH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00F8G0IR6#wasThisHelpful","R3I2K2EQKKCQGH","A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My daughter packs her lunch to school every day.  Just the basic sandwich, chip, fruit and veggies as they don't have a microwave.  I have been using ziplock baggies but she complains that her sandwich is smashed and once her cherry tomatoes came out of the bag and it was a horrendous  mess as they were mashed during transit.  These lunch boxes are the perfect solution.The three compartment containers measure 8""x6.5""x1.75"".  They are the perfect size from a sandwich, chopped veggies and a little dessert such as animal crackers or teddy grahams.  The set of four has different colored lids which is great if you have more than one lunch to pack.  The proper meal can be easily identified by lid color.  The lids snap closed on each side and while it provides adequate protection, it is not leak proof (which is clearly stated in the product description).The bottoms nest and the lids stack for easy storage.  The descriptions says that they are microwave safe but I haven't tried them in the microwave yet.  For easy clean up, I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher and they have done just fine.  Overall, these boxes have performed wonderfully and work perfectly for ""brown bagging"" it.  *I was provided this product free of charge to test for quality and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SZPRQC7WNXAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141KVN9G#wasThisHelpful","R3SZPRQC7WNXAQ","A3N4BJK6GUF8WS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4BJK6GUF8WS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a beautiful white Maltese who has sensitive skin.  I generally limit her washings to her monthly grooming but after a recent run in with some mud puddles (and I mean mud) only two weeks after her grooming, I had to wash her.  I had just received this shampoo so I gave it a try.  There are so many great things about this shampoo.  It's 100% USDA Certified Organic.  It contains oils of coconut, olive, jojoba, lemongrass and rosemary as well as oatmeal, Shea butter and aloe vera.After wetting down my little Gigi, I put shampoo about the size of a quarter on my hand and began working it in.  That wasn't quite enough so I had to use about the same amount again.  (She's about 7#)  The shampoo lathered well and has a wonderful aroma.  I worked it through her fur , including her face.  The product did not cause any irritation around her eyes.  I then began the rinsing process.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well this product rinsed out. With just a little rubbing, the rinsing was quick and painless.The best part was after she was dried.  Not only was she beautifully white again, she smelled clean and fresh.  Gigi says thanks for a great product that left her soft and clean and I say thanks for product that left her irritation free and was easy to use!*I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VL81R1VPIU7V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0167AVKCI#wasThisHelpful","R2VL81R1VPIU7V","A3N4BJK6GUF8WS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4BJK6GUF8WS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My teenage daughter has entered that acne phase so I am always on the lookout for natural ways to handle her breakouts.  I love essential oils and Tamanu oil has antibacterial and anti-inflammation properties which make it perfect for pimple control.  After cleansing her face I have her put a few drops of oil onto a cotton ball and apply it to the affected area.  By morning, the oil has absorbed and her face is not greasy at all.  The oil comes with a dropper for easy dispensing.  She has been using this for 3 days now and we can already see that her pimples are drying out and new ones are not forming.There are multiple uses for this product including acne scarring and stretch mark reduction but so far we have only used it for acne so I can attest to the benefits of other uses.  The only negative is the smell.  It isn't necessarily unpleasant, but it's different.  My daughter doesn't like the smell at all so I put in some lavender oil help mask the scent.

"We spend a lot of time outside during the warmer months and the kids love nothing more than playing in the hammocks.  While we have a traditional fish net kind, they are hard to get in and out of and more than once, an arm or leg has pushed through the holes.

"This is by far one of the best products I have ever come across.  I drive a Durango and while I have running boards on it, my mother has a horrible time trying to hoist herself up into my car.  It was always difficult, but after a recent surgery, it was almost impossible.  We had to literally pick her up and put her in my car.  I have the handle which is located by the windshield on the right but she had nothing to grab onto on the left side.  Until now.  This support slips into the locking mechanism of the door providing a stable additional handle for car entry.  There is a rubber handle with rib grips providing grip without slippage even when hands are damp.There is even a light operated by a push button in the handle for lighting for night.  The metal end that goes into the door is also a window breaker in case of an emergency and there is a build in seat belt cutter at the bottom of the handle.  My firefighter husband was very impressed with these additional features as he is always saying you can never be too prepared.  It is about 7 1/2"" long and fits easily into the compartment between my seats.Overall, I am very impressed with the operation of this product and can recommend it with 5 stars without hesitation.  *I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31K4C0Y83E3N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015O81RJA#wasThisHelpful","R31K4C0Y83E3N","A3N4BJK6GUF8WS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4BJK6GUF8WS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Product does not come with any directions so I am assuming that you clip it onto the area of your nose you wish to alter.  The device is spring loaded and opens up by pressing on the handles.

You can spends hundreds of dollars of various creams, oils and serums but this is an all natural way to take care of your skin care needs.  Here are the ways I use this oil.  There are many, many other ways, but here are the ones I can attest to.The light, pleasant aroma makes it perfect for all over use.  Before cleansing my face, I put a few drops on a cotton ball and use it to remove my eye make up.  After cleansing my face, I use it as a moisturizer.

"I am not a runner but I love having a fanny pack like this to use in place of my purse.  The pack is well constructed, you can tell as soon as you touch it.  There is padding behind the pockets making it stronger and less like to bend while wearing.  There is a clear pouch that allows you to use your phone through it while keeping it securely in place.There are two small pockets on each side of the main case for your keys or other small items.  Behind the main clean pocket is a zipper pouch which is large enough for cash, credit cards and ID.  The belt is elasticized and has a durable plastic clip locking mechanism.  As a fluffy girl (size 24), I am always afraid that items such as these will not go around my waist.  Not problem here.  It fit perfectly and did not dig into my fluff.  I did have to make it the largest size it would go.It came with a bonus scarf.

"My teenage daughter uses her iPhone camera constantly and loves to change up the look of her pictures by using lenses.  This kit contains 4 lenses (macro, wide angle, fisheye, telephoto) with covers as well as magnetic rings, keychain adapters, a cleaning cloth a velour storage bag and a flexible tripod.(NOTE:  on the tripod, it cannot be used with a phone without the additional purchase of an adapter.  It is meant to be used with a standard camera.)The kit comes with no directions but isn't that hard to figure out. The magnetic ring sticks to your phone and then attach the lens to it. I found that every time I tried to take the lens off, the magnet would come off with it.  You could choose to attach it with a stronger glue but I hate to do that on a $500 phone.

"I am one of these people whose brain does not shut off at night.  I find it necessary to take a sleep aid about 5xweek.  I prefer to use something that is all natural rather than the PM pills you find at the local mega mart.  I have been using this product for about a week and here are my findings:- Recommended dosage is 2 pills which contains 6mg of Melatonin and 850mg of various other extracts- Pills are gelatin capsules and are easy to swallow.  They did not leave an aftertaste.- I found the pills were most effective when I took them about 45 minutes to 1 hour before bedtime.- I found that they were more effective if I just laid in bed and watched tv after taking.  When I used my tablet, my brain must have been overstimulated because they simply did not work.  It took 3 hours to fall asleep that night.- I found that I got about 6-7 hours of sleep (which is good for me)- I found that I dreamt more when taking these pills which means that I was in a deeper sleep for longer.- I found that I did not have a groggy feeling upon waking.  I woke up refreshed and ready to start my dat.Overall, I am very pleased with how well this product has worked for me.

"Like many people, I know I need to exercise but I just don't.  I have had both my knees surgically repaired so anything high impact is out of the question.  I was intrigued by this total bar so thought I would give it a try. When I read that it could be used for rehabilitation, I figured it would be a nice start for my fluffy body.I have never used such a device before and was surprised when it arrived.  It is 5 feet tall.  It is made of flexible fiberglass with a rubber handle in the middle and round rubber bumpers on the ends.  A nutritional guide, training booklet and storage bag with carrying handle are also included.  While the training booklet contained pictures, I had some difficulty visualizing the exercise so I found this web sight that has brief videos for each exercise.  http://www.fitryo.com/total-bar/exercises/  It helped tremendously to see the bar in action.I started out by doing 6 exercises.  Depending on which ones you choose, it can be a total body workout.  It took me less than 25 minutes to complete one circuit.  It would have been quicker but I had to re-check a couple of videos for proper positioning.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much of a workout this is.  I was sweating profusely (I am a fluffy (size 24) 45 year old sedentary female).  The following day, I could definitely feel that my muscles had received a great workout.

"As a culinary professional, I am always on the lookout for high quality kitchen tools, gadgets and toys so I was quite happy when I was given the chance to test out this cylinder knife block.

"I have been trying to save money by doing my own pedicures at home.  I have tried various ""home"" foot soak recipes I found on Pinterest but was not really happy with any of them.  As soon as you open the package, you can smell the wonderful aroma of tea tree oil.  It you have never used tea tree oil before, you should.  It has literally hundreds of uses from treating acne and cuts to treating lice to an anti-fungal treatment for athlete's foot and persistent odor.This soak contains 5 essential oils (Spearmint, peppermint, chamomile, eucalyptus, rosemary) in addition to tea tree oil, Epsom salt and sea salt for the perfect combination.  I got out my old plastic foot soaking tub, added a couple heaping tablespoons and added a gallon of the hottest water I could stand.  I put my feet in and moved them around to get the salt to dissolve.  This took a couple minutes.  Then the relaxation commenced.  I left my feet in for about 20 minutes, warming up the water a couple of times.After removing, my feet were noticeably softer.  I then used my home electronic pedicure tool.  The results were amazing (and too gross to take a picture of).  When I finished my feet were the softest they've been in years.  Even more so than when I have them professionally done.

"I love accessorizing my home with additional lighting.  I have found that my 40+ year old eyes require more light for simple things like reading and needle work than what they used to.  This lamp required some assembly.  It took me about 10 minutes to assemble and did not even require a screw driver.  The set included an Allen wrench for use in assembly.  Fully assembled, it is 12"" tall and about 7.5"" wide.While assembly was easy, I encountered some issues.  There were metal screw receivers inside the frame poles.  One of them was not inserted as deeply as the others.  I tried pounding it in, but it would not budge.  When I was screwing in that end, it would not sit flush and the wood started to crack.  (see picture).  I did not feel like I had applied an excessive amount of pressure.  The square support poles also do not line up flush with the top and bottom (see picture).The rest of assembly went well until I put in the cover caps for the screw holes on top.  They were a different shade of white and did not sit flush.  Once is was fully assembled, you cannot see the crack and I had my husband file away some of the wood on the inserts so they would sit flush.  The shading provides a soft light rather than a direct beam.  It would make the perfect night light or bedside lamp.  It is not bright enough for me to read by though.

And here's why:~ They come in three sizes:  1.5 quart, 3 quarts and 5 quarts.  This allows you to choose the best one for your job.  I made a double batch of pancake mix in the largest bowl and it didn't even come up half way.~ They are 18/10 stainless steel.  That means they are constructed of the highest grade of stainless.  They will not warp or bend even after years of use.~ They have silicone bottoms.  You can do all the mixing you want and they will stay in place.  Unlike bowls without this feature, you have to put a wet towel underneath them to keep them from spinning or hold onto them.  The handles are like this also allowing for a great grip.~ There are markings inside each of the bowls with quart and liter measurements.~ The bowls are refrigerator, freezer and dishwasher safe.  You can even use them in a  preheated oven to proof bread dough.~ They nest using minimum storage spaceOverall, I have found absolutely nothing negative in my testing of these bowls.  I have used at least one of them every day since I received them.  They are nice enough that I would use them in my work kitchen.  These would make the perfect wedding or shower gift or birthday gift for the foodie in your life.*I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.

"I like to take care of my own nails at home so I was excited to be given the opportunity to test out this ProSponge set of emery boards.  The set includes twelve individually packaged boards with four different animal prints.  The boards are about 7"" long and about 1/2"" wide.  If you have never used large boards before, you are truly missing out.  They are so much better than the old school tiny emery boards that felt like you are running your nails over sand paper.The grit on the boards is decent but they do not state specifically their grit number.  The boards I generally use from the beauty supply store are 220/320.  These feel a little softer than that.  When you use them, the glide is decent but it feels like the grit wears off easily.  I definitely do not think they are washable or disinfectable like the salon models.  Overall, this is a decent board to keep in your purse or car to fix minor snags and tears.*I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZYJ9DRI6210H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011VGU2YK#wasThisHelpful","RZYJ9DRI6210H","A3N4BJK6GUF8WS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4BJK6GUF8WS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Even though this belt is designed for the frequent traveler, I use it as a frequent vacationer.  I hate lugging around my purse or backpack when out sight seeing and this belt is the perfect answer.  I am a fluffy girl (size 24) and am always concerned that anything that goes around my waist will not fit.  Not a problem with this pack.  The strap is completely elastic and I was able to clip it on without it being uncomfortable or digging into my fluff.There are two zippered pockets that provide tons of storage.  I put my daughter's phone which has a lifebox on it into the largest pocket and there was no issue with it fitting.  There was enough space left that you could slip in a small wallet, chapstick, eye drops or other miscellaneous items I am always in need of.  There is a mesh pocket in the large side as well to keep your things organized.The belt also includes a set of 5 credit card and 1 passport  RFID covers.  In this day and age, you cannot be too careful with your personal information and the covers provide that extra measure of support.

"My 14 year old daughter has recently decided she would like to do Halloween make up for her friends.  I purchased a kit from our local mega-mart and the make up seemed almost dry and was very hard to put on.  She also had a hard time with coverage.  It did not completely cover the area and you could see skin peeking through.Imagine how thrilled she was when she started using this kit.  The paints are soft, go on smoothly and provide full coverage.  The set comes with 2 applicator brushes as well as two sponges and a fine detail brush.  She didn't like how the sponges worked so I gave her one of my make up wedges and that worked perfectly.  There are 8 colors of paints in the kit which can be mixed to achieve different colors.

"Even though I am in my 40's, I still experience acne once a month, if you ladies know what I mean.  My outbreaks are usually those big, red nasty looking bumps on my chin that are not only unsightly, but painful.  In the past, I have used benzoyl peroxide products but they did not really succeed with anything but drying out the skin surrounding my pimple.The product is opaque and dispenses using a dropper cap.  There is no strong odor.  It was readily absorbed by my skin and did not leave a greasy feeling.  It took a few minutes for it to completely dry so if you plan on using it under makeup, you need to give it time to dry completely.  I have been using this product twice daily for two days and have already noticed a difference in the size of my pimple.  It is not as large and not as red. The surrounding skin is not irritated by the product.  I actually put it on my entire chin in hopes of preventing other outbreaks.It was worked so well and is so mild on my skin that I am going to let my 14 year old daughter start using it.

"As much as I hate to admit it, my 45 year old eyes are having more and more trouble seeing fine print and smaller details.  This clip on light has helped with that problem tremendously.  Rather than having to sit somewhere, the heavy duty, extra large clip allows me to clip the light right onto my work space.The lamp has a 14"" flexible neck that allows you to bend the light to just the right angle.  The clip is 3"" wide and opens up to 2 1/4""  Inside the clip are rubber grippers that keep the lamp clamped securely in place.  The lamp plugs in and turns on via a button by the light.  I was AMAZED at how bright this light is.  The picture truly does not do it justice.  It lights up my entire work area so weather I am doing my nails or a crossword, I can see without any difficulty.  The light bulb provides over 20.000 hours of illumination.Overall, I am very pleased with this lamp and have found nothing negative in my testing of it and can recommend it with 5 stars without hesitation.

"Let me start by saying that I have used several travel speakers in the past and have been severely disappointed.  I am so glad I had not completely given up before finding this Tmvel Aquamasti.  Here are the results of my testing this product:PACKAGING - The speaker comes in a heavy duty clear cylindrical container that opens from the end.  The charging cord is located under a sleeve at the bottom end.APPEARANCE -The speaker is gray in color and looks like lug nuts that are not stacked up properly.  This allows the speaker to lay on its side without rolling.INSTRUCTIONS - Complete instructions are included with pictures.BLUETOOTH PAIRING - Hold the button down for about 10 seconds to allow for pairing.  The blue light on the end flashes and the device is called ""AQUAMASTI"".  It synced up to my iPhone 6 and my daughter's iPhone 5C with no difficulty.CHARGING/BATTERY LIFE - I charged the speaker overnight before using. My daughter has used it for the past three days for at least 2 hours a day and it is still going strong.  Directions state 10-18 hours and I believe it!SOUND - Sound quality for this speaker is AMAZING. The sounds are clear and static free. I am so impressed with how great the sound is.  Even at the loudest volume, there is no distortion.  It seems much louder than the 10W that it is.  It even provides a decent bass; something hard to find in portable speakers.  It also has a great range.  I tested out how far away my phone could be before it lost signal.  I have two rooms and a hallway away before it started to lose signal.CONTROLS - There are 5 buttons. Volume down/skip back, volume up/skip forward button, power, play/pause/Bluetooth and answer call/hang up.You push firmly on the buttons.  There is no light or indication that the button is pushed.  It takes a full 10 seconds of holding the button to pair the speaker and to shut it off.DURABILITY - In a word - Phenomenal.  The speaker is rubberized and just looks sturdy.  It is also water proof and can be taken into the shower.  My daughter puts it in the toy net so she can enjoy her tunes while showering.  Heaven forbid, you go 15 minutes without music!PHONE CALLS - I was easily able to answer incoming calls. They sound was crystal clear and my callers were able to hear me without any issues.Overall, I have found nothing negative in my testing of this product and can give it 5 stars without hesitation.  It would make the perfect gift for the music lover in your life, young or old.*I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16B851A0FFCAM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TJ4ZO2M#wasThisHelpful","R16B851A0FFCAM","A3N4BJK6GUF8WS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3N4BJK6GUF8WS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Like many people, I have been trying to eat healthier.  A big part of that is taking my lunch every day rather than ordering take out or eating in the cafeteria.

"We've all seen women publicly ostracized on social media for breast feeding in public recently.  While I find it ridiculous that someone could find it anything but beautiful, this cover provides privacy to the breastfeeding mother and coverage for the uneducated who find it offensive.  The nursing cover latches around the neck and waist by running fabric through a dual ring system.  There are pocket on the front for holding miscellaneous items. My favorite part is the rigid neckline.  You can push it away from your body so that you can see your baby while it is feeding but still maintain privacy.  The bundle also includes a super soft washcloth which measures more than 12"" in diameter.  You could put this in the pocket for face wiping.  My second favorite thing is how compact it fold up into the included toggle closing storage bag Which measures 8"" tall and is soft so it will fold into your purse or diaper bag.The only drawback I have found during testing is that I wish it included optional sizes.  I'm a fluffy girl (size 24) and this would not tie behind me while holding a baby.  It still provided decent coverage, there just was a chance of slipping to one side.

"I am a label freak.  I really like these labels for a couple of reasons.  First of all, There are multiple sizes (30 - 1.25"", 12 - 2"" and 12 - 2.5"").  They are perfect to label jars, containers and totes.  Since they have an erasable surface, you can remove what you have written if you make a mistake or if you choose to put something else in your container.  Simply wipe with a dry paper towel and the label is good as new.  To write on the labels, chalk markers work perfectly.  I used these:  HALLOWEEN Liquid Chalk Markers & 24 Chalkboard-Style Stickers - Ideal To Decorate Your Windows - Use for Decorations, Gifts, Props or Party - Bright Colors and Reversible TipsBest of all, the labels are easily removable.  They leave absolutely no sticky residue and I stuck them on another container so you get more than one use out of them.  My daughter loves these as well.

"I am always trying to find ways to get my teenage daughter to drink more water.  I have a couple of the individual water infusers but to be honest, she's too lazy to use them.  This pitcher is the perfect answer.  The pitcher is 9"" tall and will hold 2 1/2 quarts of liquid when you use the infuser rod.  We used lemons first as I had those on hand.  It took about 4 whole lemons cut in wedges to completely fill the rod.  We simply squeezed each wedge into the rod while holding it over the pitcher.  You don't have to worry about the seeds.  The holes in the rod are small enough to keep them in.  Then you screw the rod into the lid, fill with water, give it a little swirl and you're done!  The lid fits snugly and did not fall off when we poured.The pitcher also included an ice tube.  If you want your beverage chilled without the fruit flavor, simply fill the tube with ice and screw it into the lid.  It keeps your beverage cold without watering it down.  You cannot use both the infuser rod and the ice tube at the same time as they need to screw into the lid.  I wash the pitcher by hand.There are so many applications you could use this pitcher for.  On our next shopping trip we're going to get some mint and strawberries and they them.

"I am trying to grow out my hair and am always on the lookout for products which keep it healthy.  This is the first time I have tried an Argan Oil Shampoo.  The product is quite thick and white in color and dispenses from a flip top lid.  It has a nice clean smell which I really liked.  My hair is quite long but it is also thin. It took shampoo about the size of a half dollar to clean my hair.  The shampoo lathered nicely.  The directions say to leave it on your hair for 2-3 minutes.  I washed my hair first and left it on for my entire shower time, about 8-10 minutes.The product rinsed well.  I did not use any conditioner as I normally do to get a true feel for how this product worked.  My hair felt very clean but it was a littler harder to comb than what it is when I use conditioner.  I put mousse on my hair and styled it with the diffuser.  After drying, I did not have any flyaway hair (which I was expecting without the conditioner) and my hair felt soft and looked very shiny.

"My husband likes to ""manscape"" so I knew he would be perfect to put this trimmer to the test.  Trimmer is simple enough to use, insert 1 AA battery and you're ready to trim.  The nose hair trimmer worked very well.  There is also and LED light which stays on the entire time you are using the trimmer allowing you to see what you're doing.By switching out the heads, my husband started shaping his face fur.  It started out working pretty well but the battery ran down fairly quickly.  It took two batteries to get the job done.  I think that having the light on the entire time drains the battery more quickly.  When the battery started to die, the motor slowed and it pulled his hair rather than cutting it.  We are going to get a lithium battery and see if that will extend the life. It comes with a stand for holding everything plus a cleaning brush and a safety cap.  It seems to be fairly well made and my husband liked that it was wet/dry.

"I have recently started going to a Pulse exercise class and every muscle in my body aches the day after.  My husband and daughter are tired of me asking them to massage my aching muscles so this is the perfect solution.  The roller stick is a nice length, about 19"".  The handles are stationary while the 7 smaller sections move.  One end has an attached loop handle which secures the stick around your wrist.  To use, simply move the stick over the area you wish to massage. The length of the stick allows you to reach any area of your body, including your back and shoulders.  You control the pressure applied by how hard you push.I discovered a second use for this as well.  I suffer from plantar fasciitis and use tennis balls or bottles of water to roll under my feet to relieve the pressure.  Now I can use this massage stick.  I simply lay it on the ground and run my feet over it.  Once product, two uses!  *I received this product free of charge to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.

"My 14 year old daughter has been channeling her inner ""Face Off"" and wanted to experiment with liquid latex.  It was very easy to use.  Simply brush it onto the area you desire and allow it to dry.  My daughter made hers thicker and ran safety pins through it to make it like her skin was pinned.  There is a strong ammonia scent when you open the bottle but that odor seemed to dissipate after drying.  A little bit of this product goes a long way.

"I don't know about you, but we seem to lose these power adapters like crazy.  I have purchased cheaper brands as replacements for the originals that came with out iPhones but more often than not, they get super heated while charging.  My husband is a fireman and he has forbidden us to risk using them.  No problem with this pair of adapters.  They provide the same charging capability (1A) as the ones provided by iPhone.  Our phones are charged efficiently and there is absolutely no residual heating from the power adapters.

"This is a really cute wall decoration.  It's about 15"" tall and 8"" wide and has two small triangle hooks on the back for hanging.  It is somewhat thin though and bends easily.

"What a cute novelty gift!  I prefer a rich, decadent homemade hot chocolate, but let's be honest.  I don't always take time to make it. I don't mind the powdered package kinds but I hate those nasty little clumps that never seem to dissolve.  No longer will that be a problem!!  The mug comes nicely boxed, perfect for gift giving.  It clearly states on the side ""Self Stirring Mug"" which everyone I show gets a chuckle out of.  The bottom screws off and after inserting two AAA batteries and returning the cover, you are ready to go.The mug is quite large, about 4 1/2"" tall and holds 13 ounces of liquid.  A standard hot chocolate packet requires 6 oz. of water or milk.  After adding both, simply press the yellow button on the handle and the three small blades situated at the bottom of the mug spring into action.  They are quite powerful and create a whirlpool while blending your beverage to creamy perfection.  I tried to make a double batch but that ended up in splattered on the counter.  You need a couple inches to allow for proper blending.  The lid has a removable rubber gasket which allows the lid to fit snugly into the cup.  It also has a sippy hole for drinking.This is a super cute idea and would make the perfect gift for anyone who appreciates a well stirred beverage!  *I received this product at a discounted price to test for quality and provide a truthful and unbiased review.

"As a culinary professional, I am always on the look out for high quality kitchen tools, gadget and toys.  I have used several mandolins over the years, both plastic and metal, and this is one of my favorites.  This particular model is metal with plastic blade inserts and guard.  The set contains three slicing blades (1.5mm, 3.5mm and 7mm) as well as two julienne blades (3.5mm and 7mm).  The protective guard has blades which retract as the food product becomes shorter.  The base has a flip out stand on one end giving the unit the customary mandolin slant.Changing blade slides was very easy.  Simply push the red button, slide out the old and push in the new.  The blades are very sharp and I was able to make mounds of hash brown in less than 2 minutes.  I also tested out the slicers with carrots and they worked equally well.  The unit was very easy to clean.  A little soapy water, quick rinse and you are good to go.  The collapsible leg allows the unit to be stored flat in a drawer or in a cabinet.  Four of the blades store in a plastic storage case and the fifth blade stays in the unit.  Overall, I have been very impressed with how well this mandolin has performed.

"As I am growing out my hair, I am finding it harder and harder to find a decent brush that doesn't cause my hair to ""frizz out"".  I particularly like that this brush set can be used on either wet or dry hair without causing damage.  The bristles are flexible and flow easily through my hair.  The bristles toward the center are shorter, the ones on the outside slightly longer which I assume helps with the detangling process.  They curved handle design make them easy to hold.So they did so great with my hair, I had an idea.  I have two long haired dogs, (a shorkie and a Maltese) and thought I would try one of these brushes on them.  I cannot believe how well it worked!  It brushed clear down to their undercoat and there was absolutely no tugging while doing so.  Quite a bit of hair was in the brush when I finished with the shorkie and it lifted out of the brush with ease.  I was thoroughly impressed.

"I am letting my hair grow out and often experience breakage and split ends.  To help with those issues, I have started a hair care regimen.  First, I take biotin every day, moisturize my hair daily with Argan Oil (Magestic Pure brand) and use this hydrating hair mask once per week.  The first thing I liked about this product was that it is foil sealed.  Call me a freak, but I like to know that nobody has opened up and touched my stuff.  After breaking the foil seal, the next thing I noticed was how absolutely wonderful this product smells.  I cannot put into words how to describe it.  It's not floral or musky but very, very pleasant.The product is very thick and creamy.  After washing my hair, I simply work in from top to roots.  The directions say to leave it in for 5 minutes, but I have a lot of hair and leave it in for about 20 minutes.  After showering, I put the cream in, put on a shower cap and do the rest of my bathroom routine while it does it magic.  Then, I rinse.  The product rinses easily and you will immediately feel how soft your hair is.  Plus the smell....oh, how I love that smell!  I use this product twice a week and have already seen a reduction in the number of split ends I am getting.

"As a woman in my mid-40's, I am trying to keep the wrinkles at bay so I am always on the lookout for great face creams, serums and oils.  I have never used a serum with gold foil before so I was pretty excited to give it a try.  The product is beautifully packed in a glass jar and has the coolest dispensing system I have seen in a while.  The product is dispensed by a dropper mechanism that is loaded by pressing a button on the top.  Doesn't add to the quality of the product, but pretty cool none the less.The product is a Vitamin C based serum with gold flakes.  Continual use of vitamin C has been shown to not only minimize wrinkles but to lighten those yucky age spots that happen as we mature.  The serum goes on easily and is readily absorbed into my skin.  It leaves no greasy or oily feeling.  I use it both morning and night and it works well even under make up.  A little goes a long way so dispense it in small quantities to reduce waste.

I have used the spatulas with boiling food items and there was no melting or wilting.  They held up beautifully.  Best of all, they are dishwasher safe. The set also includes  a bonus butter knife.  The knife is stainless and sits in a black plastic handle.  I wiggled the blade and it stayed secure in the handle.  The set comes in a toggle closing bag for storage or gift giving.

"It is not the book that I expected.What I expected was a book that talked about how to process ""big data"" in an effort to find the small inconsistencies that are what is really important.What the book is about is a biopic by Martin Lindstrom about his work as a market researcher.Like Sherlock Holmes, Martin is an expert at observation, often going through trash, bedroom drawers, and personal letters to get at the data.Martin then compiles his team's collected data and helps companies create successful brands.The stories are interesting and engaging.Martin does his best to keep his findings and stories politically neutral, but you can tell where Martin stands on most issues of the day by the end of the book.  He finds the USA is full of fear, and the people are not free -- that is a bit of a hint of his political leanings.  He has also spent a lot of his time in Russia and China -- that should help too.If you can overlook the political commentary disguised as insights, you will probably enjoy most of his stories.Some of the observations are very insightful.

"It is a fun game with a few unique mechanics.I'm always a little skeptical about games based on TV shows, but Homeland is a pretty good game.The play begins with each participant drawing a role card.  There are three roles that players can assume, loyal homeland security agent, political opportunist, and evil terrorist mole.  The winner is determined in one of two ways.  If the terrorist organizations win then the mole wins flat out.  If the Homeland Security folks win then you score points.Each round, the lead player (this rotates from round to round) draws and assembles as many new cases as there are players.The cases have some visible information, e.g., what level of threat they are, and some secret information, e.g., how complex the case is.The cards are designed to fit together in two ways, one way when much of the information is hidden and one way once the case is flipped over to be resolved.The rules are relatively simple.  I playtested this with an experienced gaming group, and we all picked up the rules in less than 30 minutes.The play is quick, and even as total novices we were able to complete a whole game in less than an hour.The game materials are all first rate.I do have a few caveats though.First, it is very, very easy for the terrorist organizations to win.  I recommend playing progressively difficult versions by starting with all of the threats being low level and giving the players more chances to analyze, intervene, and potentially win.  Every time my group played the game, the terrorist organizations won.Second, there is a mechanic where, if the Homeland Security folks win, each player *must* name one player he or she thinks is the mole.  If you pick correctly, the mole loses.Guess what.  With less than six players, the mole is almost always outted no matter how well he or she played.We made up a house rule that you could name the mole (taking the suggested ""minus victory points"" if you chose incorrectly) or you could pass on guessing (like the SAT where you get some points for not guessing).  This gives the clever mole some chance of escaping - not much, but some.All in all this is a good, quick, fun game for the 12+ age range.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15NJC5UZDA2M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1940825539#wasThisHelpful","R15NJC5UZDA2M","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow! I'm giving it three stars (make that two instead after thinking this through), and this is the most positive review.OK, why would many readers not enjoy it?  Well, the book has a false premise.You are lead to believe by the title, the dust jacket, and whispered promises all around that Steve Jones is writing a book that examines the Bible in light of modern science.And, no that is not what the book is about.Basically, Steve Jones starts every chapter with a quote from the Bible and then just broadly goes off and starts telling stories that are loosely, loosely related to the subject of the quote.The book does have some interesting facts, but I would be very cautious about quoting them, because I am not sure if the author is making claims ""tongue in cheek"" or if some of the facts are true.In other words, I know that the author scoffs at religion (he freely admits this in the prologue), but I cannot honestly tell if the whole book is supposed to be a joke on the reader.Also, Steve Jones starts by saying that he is not making judgements about religion in this book and then goes on to scoff at the Bible at points throughout the entire work.The title is probably apt.  The book promises to be one thing, but it turns out that you can't trust a serpent's promise.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UAOJ9VHEOI1R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1605988340#wasThisHelpful","R3UAOJ9VHEOI1R","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The premise is that Dracula was not really a bad guy, just a victim of fate (and a mean older brother), and that Mina Harker actually had the hots for poor, poor, blood sucking Dracula.It is a book in the tradition of ""the Vampire Tapes"" and other novels where Dracula is portrayed as misunderstood.Syrie James does a good job of pulling the story off, and, if you accept the premise that vampires are real, it flows reasonably well.Ms James also pays homage to previous versions of this story, e.g., the Vampire Tapes, by mentioning some of the elements of those books in this story.All in all, it was a fun read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KZ6PRBMACGEJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0061923036#wasThisHelpful","R3KZ6PRBMACGEJ","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is in the same genre as ""Immortal Beloved"" where an entire book and movie were written around Beethoven's final will that leaves substantial property to his immortal beloved - whom nobody knew.In this book, we find the famous horror/mystery writer Mr. Poe in a love triangle that only Mrs. Poe and his paramour understand is actually a love triangle.No actual physical cheating takes place in the printed word.It is much more like a traditional Victorian romance in that all the romance occurs via hints and innuendos.The premise is interesting, and Lynn Cullen has done a good job researching the events surrounding Mr. Poe's life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4AOBAVKLNYUP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476702926#wasThisHelpful","R4AOBAVKLNYUP","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a spoof novel that examines the idea that cheesy science fiction writers might actually be creating reality in another universe.The set-up in the first half of the book is great and funny.All the Sci Fi tropes are there, and our characters are truly baffled by the strange science that manifests on the flagship.The crew figures out that the ""main characters"" (i.e., Captain, First Officer, Chief Engineer, and romantic lead LT) are essentially immortal, but if a regular crew member accompanies them then he or she is likely to die -- and in a horrible (yet oddly dramatic) way.Then, the book gets to the second half where a very fluffy and funny premise is doused in a barrel of acidic seriousness, and John tries to explain how this works and what horrible emotional things happen if the crew visits the actual writers.The climax involves a hideously mutilated writer's son and some hypercubic logic that lost this poor reader somewhere around the Orion nebula.It was a great read the first half.  I recommend reading in that far and not spoiling the wonderful set-up by reading the end of the book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F1RH9XIM2YR5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765334798#wasThisHelpful","R2F1RH9XIM2YR5","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really enjoyed this novel.  Fair warning, it is not what you expect from John Scalzi.The story takes place in either an alternate universe or in our universe far removed in time from the present day.The protagonist, the captain of a god engine vessel, is heading out on a special mission for his Lord, the god of his people.The ships are propelled through space by captured and indentured ""gods,"" supernatural beings of immense power that are able to fold space, power ships, and project weapon fire through space.* Spoilers Follow *The god that the humans have been following is actually a hideously evil being that violates the gods' central tenets of morality.The god of the gods comes at the end of the story to punish the human god.Just when you think things will turn out well, John Scalzi puts on his George R.R.

Todd is a geek who doesn't understand why you can't just use other people and animals like objects.  He is not vicious about it.  Todd simply views them as things.That is what makes Todd a true monster, but Todd is presented in an extremely consistent way.The author also explores time travel possibilities in more detail and with a lot more creativity.The final outcome is mostly predictable, but this is not a literary great work.There are quite a few surprises in the book as Scott pokes fun at geeks, role-playing games, and programmers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HSL11EYCBOQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477821406#wasThisHelpful","R3HSL11EYCBOQN","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

A group of assembled adventurers (a wizard in training, a thief, a warrior, a priestess, [and a dark elf -- in Mythica II]) must invade an ancient ruins and recover an artifact to prevent an EEEEEEEEvil necromancer from recovering the artifact and becoming an unstoppable power.The nice thing about this series is that there are some very interesting characters, several of whom grow over the course of the film.The protagonist is a crippled (club footed) young woman who has been taught magic on the side by Kevin Sorbo's cameo appearing wizard character.  She is also a necromancer.  (There is a clear nature vs nurture theme here that is subtle, but present.

"This is definitely a product for the high end hobbiest or starting professional.First, it uses an XLR microphone connector with potential for 48 mV phantom power.  This is not going to be your first mic if you are starting out.Second, the jacks are all 1/4"".  Most consumer items come in 1'8"" jacks and plugs.I previously owned a TASCAM iUR2 that worked well with my IPad2 until the IOS outran the iUR2 ability to interface.Here are a few Q/A topics to talk through the capabilities of the device.How hard was it to set-up?  It was simple.  You unwrap it, grab your mic, iPad, and iPad power adapter, and you plug them in.Does it run off of the iPad's power? No, you plug the iPad into the iOne using the regular iPad to USB cable.  The power comes from plugging in the mini-USB connector from the iOne to the power supply for the iPad's USB jack.What is the sound quality like?  It is OK.  Most mics need to be run through a pre-amp to get the volume up into the workable range.  I was able to import the CAF files produced into ProTools at 48Khz and 16bits of fidelity.  With that level of detail, I was able to increase the volume, filter, compress, etc. with reasonable results.Is the device compatible with a variety of software packages?  I was able to use it both on my PC and my iPad.  The truth is that I have many other recording options for my PC.  I got the iOne for use with my iPad.  I did not have a good way to record high quality sound since the iUR2 became obsolete.OK, you told me the good things. Do you have any areas where it could be improved?  Sure.  First, you can import the tracks produced by using iTunes, but the audio files are all in CAF format, not AIF, not WAV, not MP3 or MP2, not in ...  Well, you get the idea.  Most of my sound packages could not read the files.  Apparently, you can download to your computer and then reload into iTunes and ship back to your iPad and read using Garage Band to then export as a sound file that is a little more standard.  Fortunately, my copy of ProTools was able to read the file and import it.  Many of you are not going to have a copy of ProTools sitting around.I've heard that it is hard to get information from IOne to other music programs.  Is that true?  There is an export button in the program, but it is looking for a copy of Studio One.  There are no other immediately obvious export options from inside the program.  That said, I just plugged my iPad into iTunes and was able to download the CAF files right away.Pros: one of the few professional recording capabilities that just uses an iPad or iPhone.  The sound quality is good (48 KHz and 16 bits), but quiet.  You will need to do some editing/production work on it.  The device is easy to set-up and start using immediately.Cons: The CAF format for the sound files is not one of the most common.  It might be tricky to convert CAF to AIF, WAV, or MP3 files.  There are minimal instructions that came with the device and not much on-line.  You will need quarter inch plugs with everything to make it work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S1ECZN6QRE9W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KBMAJU8#wasThisHelpful","R1S1ECZN6QRE9W","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the game that Wizards of the Coast always wanted to make.When I received the first, beta-version of Magic the Gathering from Rich back in 1992, I thought to myself this is a card game version of WizWar, where magicians challenge each other by casting spells and summoning creatures to fight one another.After 23 years, this is the board game for Magic the Gathering.I like it.  I like it a lot.As with all WotC products, the quality of the components is very high.Each player take the role of a Planeswalker (wizard) that summons creatures and spells to attack opponents.Once your points are gone, you are out of the game.Last wizard standing is the winner.The rules are simple, but they game is infused with the themes and flavor of the collectible card game.There is lots and lots of room for expansions, but the base rules are less than ten pages long and those pages are liberally filled with colorful diagrams and photos.Great game!

There is the stable of ensemble cast that makes regular appearances and act as continuity, and there is one bad, bad villain that will eventually be defeated by the end of the season.The Florida Crow clan are the villains this time.Seasons one through four are five star performances with interesting plot twists, clever moral dilemmas, and multi-dimensional villains.Season five ... er, not as much.**Spoilers Follow**We spend a lot of time cleaning up complications from previous seasons, e.g., Raylon's part in the mob execution, which is actually resolved in a very unsatisfying way.

"This is the magnum opus of Dr. Dawna Markova.  She has been working in the field of collaboration, organizational effectiveness, and collective psychology for over four decades.  So, the book is filled with stories, illustrations, and anecdotes from someone who has ""been there"" and been effective at it.It is really three separate books in one.  (The book says there are four parts, but the final portion is a section that summarizes the first three and advocates for using all three of the previously developed topics together.)The first portion describes mind patterns.  Dr. Markova describes twelve thinking patters.  She posits that we all have three modes of concentrating on something: focus, sorting, and open.  They are pretty much as their names imply.  Dr. Markova gives examples to illustrate the modes.  Focused implies alert and detailed.  Sorting means exploring and maybe a little confused.  Open leads to imagination and creativity.  She points out that all of these states are necessary, and we all go through them every day.The next thing that Dr. Markova points out though is interesting and different.  She says that these states are triggered by certain types of stimulation: visual, audio, or kinesthetic.  She then divides folks into thinking types based on which of the triggers brings the subject into what state.  You may be a VKA that would mean that visual/written material tends to put you into a focuses state, whereas auditory stimulus would put you into the open condition.Dr. Markova includes many worksheets and questions that you can use to determine not only your own patterns, but those you work with as well.This is very helpful.  If you have a boss or colleague that is reacting poorly to your input, it might be because it is in a format that causes confusion for that person.Interesting.  Truth in lending.  I have not been able to apply it yet, but the idea is intriguing and makes some sense.The second portion of the book talks about ""thinking talents"" and elaborates on 35!!! different talents ranging from ""wanting to win"" to ""believing"" and ""collecting.""  The author provides questions, descriptions, and even a bit on shadow attributes (you might have this if you manifest this kind of behavior).  Once you are able to select the top several talents that describe your most common behaviors, you also try to find out the talents that are most deficit in your own personality.  The deficit talents are those behaviors that tend to make you uncomfortable.The talents are then clustered into quadrants: analytic, innovative, relational, and procedural.As with the first section, with talents, you are encouraged to find out what your colleagues' talents are and see if you are interacting with them in their deficit areas, inadvertently being less effective than you might.I also found this portion of the book very interesting.  There are so many potential talents that it is hard to imagine someone who cannot connect with a few of them.  (One caveat though ... I found myself having interests in so many of the talents that it was hard to focus into a single quadrant.  This might be something that will require social learning and trial and error.)The third big idea in the book was that people tend to have different modes of finding out about the world, inquiring, that map directly to their talent quadrant.The insight is that if you are trying to inform someone with a different talent quadrant than your own, you might want to adjust your information presentation to better match his or her inquiry style.The final portion of the book asked you to use all three of the proceeding concepts by changing how you think about your work environment and your interactions with others.It was a very interesting and well-written book.

"This is a heart warming story of true love, acceptance, and forgiveness.Emmalyn finds herself in the northern reaches of Minnesota and Wisconsin far away from the man she loves, because he committed a crime and is doing the time.This is a wonderful, wonderful story told with skill and will a lot of heart.** Spoilers Follow **The story takes place in the last two years of Greg's sentence.  While Emmalyn makes the best of things, she has some adventures with local characters that both challenge and expand her compassion.When the book begins, the reader is most uncertain about the future of Emmalyn's and Greg's marriage, but by the time we reach Chapter 30, we both know, accept, and are gladdened by the fact that they do get together.Thomas Aquinas said that someone who has never doubted the existence of God doesn't believe in God.  If Emmalyn had never questioned her marriage to Greg while he was in prison then I'm not sure the reader could have accepted that their love was real.Ms. Ruchti, the author, did a skillful job of weaving the realities of northern Wisconsin and Minnesota into the book.  She used local flavor with foods, sayings, and insightful descriptions of the countryside to make you feel as though you were there.While she not pummel anyone with it, it is clear that Ms. Ruchti comes from a religious background in a very positive way.  That positive aspect shines through as a ray of hope and love in the book.All in all, a great read, and a very uplifting story.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NNS9QG6PMSVP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426787278#wasThisHelpful","R2NNS9QG6PMSVP","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a book about games by board and card game players.It is really a collection of pithy statements.One of the points that the book makes early on is that role-playing games are ""toys"" and not games (rule #6), but the book actually has a large number of its pithy statements that involve RPGs.  I'm adding this point up-front in the review, because this is a book about board and card games, not RPGs even though Robin Laws does the foreword.I read the whole book cover to cover while riding the stationary bike at the local Rec Center in less than twenty minutes.  Most of the pages in the book are 2/3 to 3/4 white space.It is going for about $15 at the time I write this, and that is a lot better than the $40 I paid to buy it hot off of the presses.There are some books, ""Defining Fun,"" ""101 Design Methods,"" ""Mastering the Game,"" etc. that you will read, re-read and learn something new from every time you invest the time to delve into the book. Other books are entertaining at the time, but once you read them you have gotten every thing out of them that you can.  This book falls into that latter category.Wil Wheaton, John Kovalic, and other of the contributors are well known in and ardent supporters of the gaming community, and it was worth a read to see their quotes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16WD7ZVRDG5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981884008#wasThisHelpful","R16WD7ZVRDG5K","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a tremendously fun game that almost anyone can play.The goal is to get rid of all your cards.  Each player starts with a pile of face down cards in front of him or her.Each round, the players take turns flipping their topmost card.  If that card matches the face-up card of another player, a contest ensues.Both try to grab the plastic totem in the middle of the table before the other.The winner gives all of this discards to the unfortunate, slower competitor.It sounds simple, and it is, but the cards are fiendishly well designed.  You have to pay careful attention to know when your cards match (and, when they don't).If you grab the totem when the cards don't match, you have to take *everyone's* discard piles!  *UGH!*I've bought more than a dozen copies of this game to give out to friends and colleagues.

"It's an interesting game. I am not familiar with Legion games, but this appears to be a work of love. (My guess is that this is a homegrown game that the author worked hard to get published.)It is a game for two  four players. Each player is trying to become a deity.Each turn has four steps: reveal, marketplace, raid, and reinforce. There are two possible ways to win. You can accumulate for matching mystic symbols or you can pummel your opponents.The game is very evenly balanced (very, very, very evenly balanced). So, the pummel strategy is bound to lead to a relatively long game. The mystical symbol win is a way of guaranteeing that no game goes on too long.The pieces are very high-quality, and it is unlikely that anyone in your gaming group has ever played this particular one before.For the gamer who has everything, this is a great ad, and it is a great gift for that gamer who's hard to buy for.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T804W1QI9RLT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OAFQ3RA#wasThisHelpful","R1T804W1QI9RLT","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this game. It's a deck building game where the players work in a semi-cooperative way. Unlike other semicooperative games, you don't spend any time in this one back stabbing other players.You can play with anywhere between two  six players. One of the nice things about this game is that you never have a turn where you just sit with nothing to do. You must accumulate resources, combat, cunning, or spirit, to vanquish foes, and score points.Many of the classic New England monsters are here for you to pick your wits against.

"I am a fan of the the Diablo franchise.  So, please understand that this review is done with a mixed heart.This book tries to answer the question what led to the events in Diablo III.It is written from the perspective of Deckard Cain.Sometimes less is more, and, when you try to explain where a story began, you cannot effectively do it.In this book, we find that Cain is a relatively misanthropic, maladjusted human being. He doesn't really like children, and, to be honest, he's not very good at life.Yes, the events described in ""the order"" could have led to Diablo III, or they could've led just as easily to Deckard Cain lying under a bench in a large city somewhere with a bottle of hooch.What this book most reminded me of were some of the skits that they used to do on sitcoms making fun of the old radio shows where they would try to re-create what both sides of a phone conversation sounded like. In the old radio shows, you only heard one side of the phone conversation, and the playwrights had to include a lot of information so that the audience could follow. Of course, no real phone conversation would ever play out that way. That was the joke.That is the joke in this book to.It is interesting, but ultimately it knocks Deckard Cain off of the pedestal that many gamers have him on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUVV11E4EN4FT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451645651#wasThisHelpful","RUVV11E4EN4FT","AB3I74FIW58XI","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB3I74FIW58XI?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The powder came in a nicely sealed bag which contained a desiccant capsule. Also included was a plastic dosage spoon which unfortunately was way too big for the recommended dosage. This however was very promptly handled by the seller which sent me a whole packet of correct size spoons (~100mg), they are not labelled on the spoon however. As this supplement is one of the very few that may actually do something for cognitive functions per limited testing, its the closest thing to endorsement by consumer magazines and web md sources that I have seen. It is vegetable not bovine derived. Personally it definitively causes an urge to do, write, or create something about an hour after it is taken and that effect lasts for about 3-4 hours. I only take it occasionally and once a day. Additionally I had a nerve induced tooth/head ache for a long time, after taking this it got slightly better, after taking it for about a week it was totally gone. This was after a year of trying all sorts of non and prescription NSAs. Could have been a coincident, but I am very thankful. I give it only four stars because its difficult to use.

"The Flash cord I received is branded ""focus"", see the picture attached. If anything it may be better for some as the part that mounts on the camera hot shoe has another hot shoe on top of it rather than a smooth top in the description. Again see my photo. This allows you to have two flashes mounted on the camera and with the built in switch control which one fires. Unless one is an optical slave they will not fire at the same time though.I have tested both the top mounted and the cord mounted shoes, and they both communicate with the camera based on the switch position. When the flash is mounted on the off position shoe, the camera says cannot communicate with the flash ; off or incompatible. The TTL functions well as do all the in the camera control functions for all the features your flash is capable of. The cord is about 18"" long coiled and stretches to about 3ft. The locking mechanism is the rotary plastic ring screw, and the camera mount is all plastic shoe.

"This for the most part is the same review as I did for the Neewer branded version of what appears to be the exact same flash. It certainly performed the same way. Interestingly mine did exactly the same thing as in one review below mine. When initially powered up, it made a noise as if it was charging, then it died. I swapped in several sets of batteries, it appears that one of the springs in the bottom of the battery compartment gets stuck. Once freed up, when both the top and bottom of the batteries made contact, the flash came back to life. I now use the built in camera flash as a main light and trigger for two of these little slave flashes which I position on either side of my subject. My estimate of the guide number is 20-30 (ft) at Iso 100. Not very powerful, but great as fill and side lights.Comments applicable from before: I use this slave flash as a fill in light for impromptu portraits. It works extremely well for removing harsh shadows by placing the slave off to one side or slightly behind your subject. To use it along with a Canon DSLR in ETTL II camera mode, set the switch on the back to S2. Then you can use the camera flash compensation +- 3EV to vary the light ratio between the slave and the camera, or leave the camera flash setting at 0EV and move the slave closer or further away.The second way to use the slave is to set the camera flash to manual mode. This requires the slave to be set to position S1. Place the slave where it illuminates your subject well (it even works for hair highlights when used from behind), then you can use the on camera flash power adjustment from 1/128 to 1/2, or the f-stop to control the overall picture look and feel.It is truly amazing how much fun and creativity you can have with this one unit.

"I was interested in this food due to its ""limited ingredient diets"" claim. My dog has some skin issues and some have mentioned limiting the food ingredients as a possible solution. But first and foremost, the dog must want to eat it. Would she even eat kangaroo??I am happy to say, after allowing my dog to choose between this and 2 other foods, that although not her first choice it came in second place. She seems to like it just fine.The labeling states it contains balanced omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids along with high quality protein to help support healthy skin and a shiny coat. Along with the potato and kangaroo, which are the main ingredients there is some brewers yeast and salmon oil along with some vitamins and minerals. Sounds pretty simple and a lower than most fat content only 10%.So while my dog has only been on it for a week, and it is too early to tell if it will help her skin condition, I am crossing my fingers and will continue on this regimen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF2WZOHX5W3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M2IRYQQ#wasThisHelpful","RF2WZOHX5W3S","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The construction does seem to contain only a cardboard stiffener inside the faux textured leatherette plastic cover. The back is hard plastic with a similar faux leather insert. The auto on off function works perfectly. I am amazed that much more expensive covers do not all have this feature. The cover is very hard to remove without tools. I accidentally put it on backwards.

"Whether checking your own blood alcohol level or making sure that your guests know their limits, there are times when having a BAC devices are worthwhile. There are websites like celtickane that will let you input body weight, volume and type of drinks consumed, and elapsed time, then calculate the blood alcohol content. These are what I used to check the calibration..The small portable BAC keychain model has been very well received by consumer test agencies, and was the first unit I purchased. It has a single AAA battery, 13 sec countdown times from power up, fold away sample tube (with removable covers if you want), audible prompts, and an instant display of BAC. However it only has two digits, ie .08. It seems to be not very sensitive to volume of air you blow thru it, it will tolerate high and low velocity fairly well, but will complain with a FL (flow error) display if you do not blow at all.The larger new Pro Model says its police grade accuracy and that it meets DOT standards. To start, ignore the assembly manual part which states be careful when inserting the mouth tube, it only goes in a few centimeters. In actuality it only goes in a few millimeters, but the ridge on the mouth piece seems to indicate it should go in up to the ridge, which would be a few centimeters. Nope, the ridge and the instructions have nothing to do with the insertion length. It only goes in about 1/8. See photo. It is powered by supplied two AAA batteries, also has a 13 sec countdown timer. When you turn it on, the entire mouth tube glows an electric blue However after you are done blowing, you hear some sort of an internal device closing shut, and you wait about 20 seconds for a display to show up. The results are in three decimal format, ie .083. The results are stored in 10 memory slots. It also comes with a storage pouch and several removable reusable tips see photosBased on calculated BAC, both models were within .01 point of theoretical and each other. Initially the keychain unit was reading slightly high (.007 est), and after 30 minutes of consumption (you should not test within 20min of drinking) it was reading .001 low when compared to the Pro model. One advantage of the Pro model triple digits is that as you continue testing, you can see the BAC first climb up, then go down as the alcohol is metabolized. The keychain model does not allow you to see the initial swings due to its limited resolutionBoth models come with excellent guides to BAC and its effects and proper testing. Both will let you get a good idea of BAC vs how you feel. The Pro model definitively seems to be more accurate, the 30 min results matched the theoretical calculations to .001, or exactly the same. You should be very happy with either model.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNAP4UWH1A6N3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R2X59A4#wasThisHelpful","RNAP4UWH1A6N3","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The vacuum cleaner was very easy to assemble, which a good thing. Because some of attached assembly instructions were for a different/older? model. There were a total of three instruction booklets between all of which you can figure everything out though. The machine has very nice construction which is immediately apparent on the brushed nickel multi, multi adjustable inlet wand. There are quality details all throughout; from multiple stowage points, to a tapered self retracting power plug (keeps it from slamming too hard against the stop), to snaps holding the bags (non reusable) and a latch which holds the bag compartment open while you swap the bags.The accessory holder slot on the top of the wand (one of several possible mounts) is very tight. I had difficulty removing it once installed and moved it to the bottom of the wand.The vacuum is very quiet, and has a pleasant turbine like sound when running. The motor actually changes speed when you go from the minimum to the maximum setting. (It varied from 60 to 71 dbA, min to max noise level at 3 ft, which is VERY quiet).The alternating high/low bristle wood floor nozzle (see pictures) worked extremely well. Unlike my upright with always rotating brush, it picked up all of the dust immediately without blowing it all over the place.The vacuum/air powered rotary carpet nozzle worked acceptably well despite not having an electric motor built in. I do suggest periodically manually cleaning off any long hairs which tend to wrap around the roller and may slow it down. That it picked up all of the pet hairs is a good testimonial though.All in all with the light weight, low noise, and very good performance this is as much joy to use as vacuuming can be.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R257JYKSGF29K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S1AGGW2#wasThisHelpful","R257JYKSGF29K","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is what it is. Hopefully you already know what Minoxidil is. While it may not regrow hair for all, if most probably will slow down the loss of hair for most At least on the vertex, top, of the head, the only location for which it is advertised to work. That is my experience. The local Costco quit selling the liquid a while back in favor of the foam. Based on many testimonials and tests the foam is easier to use, but not as effective, and definitively has to be used twice a day. The liquid has a reputation for lasting 24 hours. It does appear that this supplier has a source of fresh Kirkland labelled Minoxidil. The box appears to be exactly like the one I got at Costco previously.

"Excellent vice for small projects that you want to do in the house. This vice is a perfect complement for a small vacuum vice I used on a smooth table top. I had a small metal vice, but unfortunately the clamp opening was only 1, and would not open wide enough to grip the table edge. With a healthy 2 opening, and a removable bottom clamp (see photo) this vice addressed that problem. Another pleasant surprise is that one of the jaws has a small Vee groove cut horizontally and vertically into its face. This allows you to grip round objects without having them try to roll within the jaws. As supplied the jaws are protected by snap on rubber covers which keep the jaws from marring delicate surfaces. These protectors as you can see in the photos have a rubber tab in the back to hold them securely on the jaws, they did not slip off accidentally at all.  The head rotates 360 degrees and pivots down at 45 degrees all the way around. There is a notch in the base that will allow the head to pivot all the way to 90 degrees (perpendicular to the table edge), but will not rotate in that position. Construction is cast aluminum jaws and base, chrome plated steel tightening screws, plastic bottom tightening knob, and rubber protective covers on the jaws and top of the table clamp. All in all an excellent mid size home hobby vice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R58RVPQTU5QE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013E2AQY#wasThisHelpful","R58RVPQTU5QE1","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Both instruments while not constructed with the greatest quality materials, appear to do the job quite well. The TDS meter checked out distilled purified water at 2 ppm, my tap water at 141 ppm and coffee at 900ppm with the X10 indicator flashing for a 9000 ppm actual reading. All are values well within the expected for those fluids.There is a calibration hole in the back with a visible screw, but I did not adjust it as I was satisfied with the readings. This meter comes with a velcro closure vinyl pocket protector style holder.The pH meter comes in a nice translucent hard plastic case. Included are 6.86 4.0 pH buffer solution powders that you can dissolve in 250ml  of water to check calibration. Also a well established homemade calibration solution can be made from laundry Borax powder, it should test at pH of 9.2 (slightly concentration and temperature dependent). Although my tap water reading of pH 8.9 surprised me at first, calibration checks showed the meter as reading only 0.1 high (pretty good straight out of the box). Using the adjustment screw in the back I was able to correct the reading. Notice I did not say I was easily able to correct the reading. The adjustment is extremely sensitive, half turn changed the reading by 2.0 pH units. Subsequent checks with the now calibrated meter on vinegar, wine, lemon juice, soap and coffee all showed results within 0.1 pH of common published values. As a result this set is very well within my expectations and appears to be accurate enough. It is not made of top quality materials but that was not my expectation for the price either.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MSUF0E486HSN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LS712G0#wasThisHelpful","R3MSUF0E486HSN","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a desk filled with inexpensive reading glasses of various strengths. Actually had to put a piece of tape on them to tell me which ones to use for what, IE I have everything from a +1.25 to a +3.0. This is not ideal. In the past I have had prescription safety glasses for work, those were plano on top and up to +2.0 on the bottom, they worked out well but the nose pads and the hinges wore out. These Foster Grant's at +2.0 on bottom and half(?) normal strength on top actually work perfect for me. Almost an exact replacement for my old prescription glasses. Yes sometimes I do have to tilt my head slightly to get perfect focus, but even without doing that they work very well. Be aware that if you have not worn progressive lenses before (bifocal and trifocal are not really the same effect), there will be an adjustment time. Things will seem slightly blurry as the focus changes slightly with head movement. This was the case with my prescription progressive lenses, it took me about a week to get used to them.These glasses are incredibly well made. The lenses are multicoated to reduce glare. They have a blue green coating reflection like good camera lenses if you look at them from the side. The hinges are spring loaded and do have a hinge screw. The tortoise shell is fairly subdued and dark, and the temple pieces are fairly wide in a classical fashion. You do get a soft lined cloth carry case and a cleaning cloth as well. I will still keep a pair of +3.0 glasses for close up work, but these will eliminate the need for switching as often.March '15 update. Dropped from five to three stars. The temple screws have stripped out on their own, cannot be tightened, and the temple pieces are now wobbly. Fortunately the hinge is so thick the wobble is tolerable.April '15 End of month. The tortoiseshell pattern has began to peel of at the nose pad area. It is just a thin coating over clear plastic.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KOK2SH39BZU1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NHUVF18#wasThisHelpful","R3KOK2SH39BZU1","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Great way to to look at the wine tasting kinda like seasons for clothing. I have tried this method by giving the tests at several wine tastings. After much grumbling about the questions not being pertinent and complaints about people not liking any of the answers the conclusions were............ Not really surprising. Those that liked mostly reds were either fall or winter. Those that liked mostly whites were spring or summer. The problem with trying to categorize will work best with beginner wine drinkers, or people that do not like to experiment much. Once the world of wine ""opens"" up to you, I would say that that you will enjoy more than three quarters of the wines mentioned. And of course it is here that the book shines, the answer key is arranged in a circle, such that spring follows, winter, etc. So it should become clear that the best way to pick wines is not just by the season, but pick wines that are adjacent to each other on the wheel. (Then pick a good example of one exactly diagonally opposite, and see if you truly do not like that style).

"I thought this might be worth trying based on its claims of a unique protein source (bison), and sweet potato as the main carbohydrate source. These are ingredients not found in your run of the mill dog foods. I am hoping that by limiting and changing the sources of food she eats she will scratch less. I don't think she has been on this diet long enough to tell yet, but she does seem to like it.One thing they could improve upon is the size of the food. This food is in the shape of a disc, slightly larger than half inch in diameter. (See photo) Since she is a small breed it seems a little difficult for her to chew, although she does eat it all.. The claim is that it is suitable for all breeds so I think a smaller pellet size would be easier for small breeds to chew.Overall it seems a good product with a lower fat content than other foods,and quality ingredients.

"In summary I have lived with GPS units from Magellan, Garmin, TomTom, Lowrance, Mio and Rand McNally. They all have their strengths and weaknesses. This Magellan is no different. However as I detail in this unfortunately necessarily long review, the 5430 while being long on looks and speed, falls short on some features and user friendliness which make a difference in the long run.General Info:The advanced instruction manual actually IS available on the Magellan website. Just search for 5340 NOT 5430, their misprintTakes about 25 seconds from powered off to ready to acquire signal and same for warm boot.Connecting to a computer disconnects the GPS, you can then browse the android directory, but cannot really do anything there. Do not modify this.Connecting to a wall USB charger allows you to use GPS indoors.Sensitivity is very good indoors. Lock is indicated by the vehicle symbol arrow turning Blue, NOT the red X at the top of screen which is no traffic info indicator.The 5430 Android OS uses a home hard button, at many screens you may be stuck at wondering how to get out of them, there is no BACK or cancel soft key. Use the hard home key at the top of the shell.In first 20 miles of route driving the device did not use landmark guidance at all. Just as well, the example of turn right at the X gas station is not likely to stay current/accurate very long, and the map updates have been years behind in my experienceTotal space reported on the GPS 2.9gb, free space 1.1 gb, inserting a micro SD card, did not change either number. The GPS and the SD card appear as two hard drives to the computer.The detachable mount pivot ball is the same diameter as a Garmin, in case you have a favorite dash mount you want to use. See photoAlthough not specified, you can use lat and long for a go to destination. In the address box simply type for example; 30.0, -91.0Pluses:Great screen resolution at least 640x480, I like the gloss screen, have not had glare problems yet.Very good ahead of the turn spoken directions-best timing I have had.It does let you know which side of the road the destination is.Does offer search options like along route, or near destination.Fastest, shortest, or least freeways routing options, graphically and instantly appear after a successful destination search. This screen also instantly shows estimated distance and arrival time for each option.Fastest screen scrolling by finger of any GPS I have had.Multi destination Route Optimization works well.Minuses:Screen too white, not enough contrast in the color scheme. Although the device directory includes something called Jupiter with colour schemes, there is no way to modify the schemes.Volume is barely adequateOn a short test drive Speed/light cameras warning got two of 5 warnings wrong, there was never a camera there, ever at any point in time.You cannot click on POIs showing on screen to tell what they are. Have to search nearby instead.No utility screen showing signal precision or satellite status,.NO way to import existing POIs. At this time for many people this will not be a first GPS, but rather a replacement or an upgrade. I literally have hundreds of POIs, such as friends, parks, historical sites, unusual tourist destinations, anything that has ever appeared on the food network, etc. The only way to add them is to enter them manually one by one, or to use Magellans web interface and to import them one by one from web pages.Spurious make a U turn directions were given even when following a route exactly.Screen is a tad too responsive, merest brush against a letter causes unwanted input, or a wild screen scroll.Map utility data screen does not show issue date, no way of knowing how old it is without using the Magellan web site and computerTraffic reception only works for big cities. Ie In my state capitol city of 300000 people there was no FM traffic signal (but plenty of traffic).The mount is hard for me to use. The power cord is mounted on the suction cup holder. You have to slide the GPS into the holder while trying to maneuver the power cord into its receptacle. They ARE NOT aligned well and not easily assembled.The power shut down for me unexpectedly several times, may have touched something inadvertently, the red charging light would blink on and off. My bet is that the power cord as described above is not making a good connection. They actually talk about this problem in the quick start manual (why not fix it instead). Would have been MUCH better if the power plug was totally independent of the mount.When searching for POIs, and when the GPS does not find any (say a restaurant by name). It just sits at a blank screen. Would be nice if it said no results found Note that when searching for items by name, click on the results places box ratrher than default addresses. Looking up a library missed the nearest one. This bothered me so much that I finally found the nearby library under public buildings then libraries. To use a keyword search I had to use libraries not library. No string subset search? Really?Moreover recently found items are NOT on a GOTO menu, you have to go to home screen, then address book first before you can select from you history, only then can you add it to the route or set it as a destination. For me at least this is backwards.Overall I liked the interface responsiveness, search speed, and the screen. The entire unit just looks very good. This comes at a price, shortcomings of the interface features, and the lack of POI import. These can be fixed with a firmware update. However as is, the 5430 is not as easy, or intuitive, or feature rich to use as other dedicated GPS units.March 2015 Update. Since this is an Android device, unless you force it to shutdown by holding the power button extra long, normally it only goes into Suspend mode. As a consequence battery life is terrible. Unless you turn it all the way off, in a couple of days the battery will be completely dead.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37R3MVT6DR1ET/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JUHUN0G#wasThisHelpful","R37R3MVT6DR1ET","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have always used an electric razor, and most of the time they were the Norelco brand (last one was 7310XL and before that a 5861XL) and at other times Remington. To start off with the shaving comfort is comparable (I shave dry), but with a slight edge to the Norelco, it seems like the XR1340 dual concentric blades seem to leave  a slight razor burn. Also while the Norelco took an average of 1min 15sec to get a smooth face, the Remington needed a few more scrapes and a total time of 1min 30 sec.Ergonomics wise I had lots of issues with the XR1340; starting with the charger which is a clamp on shell that you snap around the shaver (vs a simple plug in cord). This clamshell often seemed to work loose from the contacts, the charge light would go out and I had to open it up, re snap it shut and wiggle it on the shaver to re establish charging. There is no remaining charge percentage indicator, but with a lithium ion battery you can always top off the charge if you will be away from an outlet without a fear of damaging the battery.Second, to clean the heads you pry a finger nail under one of three recesses and then pry the head off. I always got the feeling that I am about to break the head into three pieces (on the Norelco you push a single button and the head pivots open). To close the head back up, you have to align three pins and then evenly push the entire assembly back on. I say evenly because on several occasions I snapped two of the three heads back on and one was left slightly open. This resulted in the shaver shaving poorly and only after shaving for much more than a regular time did I realize that the head was not on all the way. Finally, for a thorough cleaning, to remove the rotary elements, you pop off the head, and then slide a uni directional piece of plastic from the top of the rotary elements. It pretty much snapped and flew onto the ground every time I tried to do this. This was not the problem though, putting it back on was. It only goes back on one way (vs any position in other symmetrical retaining design shavers), and its not a simple task to figure it out. I wish it was color coded at least. At least the cutting wheels are color coded, gray, blue and black, such that you can always return them into the correct slotted cutting head once they become honed into place.So overall I got a similar shave, but it took a slightly longer time. Ergonomic wise, I had lots of problems. And finally value wise, unless you have to have the special edition paint scheme this shaver does not offer any features that you cannot get from the XR1370 or even XR1330 (slightly less battery run time) at a substantial saving. If the ergonomics I talk about bother you, I suggest checking out the PT370 (replaced the 7310XL).","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R289Z5X0BSXH51/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NBZQ6YU#wasThisHelpful","R289Z5X0BSXH51","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Right out of the box the Diamondhead sights feel sturdy, which was my main worry since they were polymer and flip up. However every part of the sight is thick and does not feel likely to crack or break. There is also no play in the sights in the up or folded position, the springs are strong and keep everything in place. The sights are also very easy to operate. The spring release button is easy to press and the sights snap back down after you apply enough pressure.With an easy install and solid feel, all that is left is the sight picture. The sights are easy to look through and require no tools to adjust. What I like most about the sights is how the diamond shape aiming much quicker and easier. Everything seems to line up quicker and it is obvious where you are aiming.The only downside to the sights is their photo luminescent inserts. They only work well when you shine a very bright light on them, and even then you have a very short for them to glow. Because of this, I would not recommend these be bought for the sole purpose of low light shooting, tritium sights are well worth the extra expense for that purpose.Overall, the Diamondhead sights felt very solid and performed well. The sights seem to naturally line up and are easy to adjust, but the NiteBrite inserts are definitely not the selling point for the sights. 4.5 of 5 or 5 since there are no half stars","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HLY2NC0X6XL1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JM6RDZ8#wasThisHelpful","R2HLY2NC0X6XL1","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This fan looks terrific in any dcor. Be it classical or modern. College dorm or a grand mansion. The polished nickel finish is class, as they say almost a museum quality piece. The base is solid, the blade guard is a two piece wire grille, with a stainless band holding it on. The blades are not cupped for efficiency though, and only have the trailing edge bent up to generate air flow. In keeping with the minimalist look, the speed adjustment on the base is a slide switch, let to right, off, hi, med, low. This is only indicated by a line mark of slightly longer or shorter lengths. As a matter of fact at first I could not tell if the speed was really changing, but it was, only not very much. Low is 8 mph, medium is 9.5 mph and the high is about 11 mph. I really wish there was a lower speed just to stir the air around.As is, the fan is moderately quiet, the left right rotation is engaged by a traditional knob that you pull up or push down on the top of the motor. There is almost exactly 90 deg of travel left to right. The vibration is very low at any speed. The energy consumption varied from about a low of 33 watts to a high of  38 watts, so this is a really low cost to operate appliance.Overall this is a terrific looking, and a solidly constructed fan.

"I have eaten many protein bars, mostly as a food supplement when hiking or in situations where stopping to eat was not convenient. Most of the time it was not truly enjoyable, as the taste was reminiscent of flavored sawdust. With time it became an acquired taste, with Cliff Bars being the preferred product. (Clif Bars: Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch of 2.4 Oz - 12 Bars(2 boxes)). I got these V8 bars from Amazon as a periodic recalibration regarding what is available on the market. I compared the V8 chocolate peanut butter, the Cliff chocolate peanut crunch and Nature Valley sweet and salty peanut granola bar (Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut Granola Bars 48 Count Value Box). I looked at the nutrition and flavor. The protein bars are the serious/sports at 10g protein each contenders, vs the granola snack food item Nature Valley, which has only 4g protein. In the photo left to right:Cliff Bar, V8, Nature Valley.Nutrition:For the most part Cliff and V8 are very similar in nutrient composition and cost per bar, but these are the areas where they differ by a good amount; Cliff is 38% heavier (2.4 vs 1.7 oz) V8 gets more cal from fat (38% vs 24%), Cliff has 61% more sugar and 18% more sodium. Cliff also has 78% more carbs.Vitamin wise they are close as well with the exception that Cliff has almost five times the vitamin E and C. Cliff shows quite a few minerals such as iodine, magnesium, selenium, etc which the V8 does not.Taste:I had set up a taste test with several people, and of course the tasting notes were all over the place. Cliff: Good, not too sweet or bitter. Tasteless and sawdust like. Dense, strong grain taste with some peanuts and very little chocolateV8: Waxy, predominantly bittersweet chocolate taste, little peanuts. Almost candylike.Nature Valley: Very sweet and gooey. Very strong peanut and caramel nougat taste. StickyOverall: Unless you have a very strong preference for gritty nutrition or a seriously sweet tooth, the V8 protein bar appears to be an excellent compromise of taste and nutrition. Surprisingly it had less sodium and sugar than the Cliff. Perhaps the best part is that if you are carrying the nutrition for several people, the V8 will satisfy the largest percentage with just one item.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSKNA7X5N2NH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NL606MC#wasThisHelpful","R2VSKNA7X5N2NH","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set pretty much combines the essential elements for enjoying wine at a level above that of simply popping the cork out of the nearest Merlot to the check out counter. NOT that there is anything wrong with that! The point is, that as we start enjoying ever more complex flavor profiles of more and more variety of grapes we find that certain tools make for a more complete experience. Of course I would suggest that everyone starts  with a wonderful tool called the aroma wheel invented by Ann Noble, which will allow you to identify and express the many flavors in the wine. Second, perhaps a wonderful , useful, beginner-master wine tasting book such as the One minute wine master The One Minute Wine Master: Discover 10 Wines You'll Like in 60 Seconds or Less, And finally this kit. The opener is a no nonsense, solid feeling tool with a best two step levered pulling mechanism there is. Other than on a fragile cork (a two bladed puller is suggested MONOPOL Two-prong Cork Puller ""Ah-so"" (Waiter's Friend), Superfine Polished, Satin Finished, in Gift-box - Made in Germany) this will tackle the most stubborn cork. The vacuum preserver will allow you to extend the life of an opened bottle for perhaps up to a week (drinking, chilling and nitrogen are other possibilities). I have found that some wines that are opened too young, say a big Cab that's less than 5 years old sometimes benefit from this table aging. The aerator also allows for what I would call accelerated ""aging"", so a wine that is ""closed"" in, say does not have much nose/smell/bouquet may be improved by using this device. Be aware that some wines may taste worse after this treatment, they go flat. And lastly the carafe. This will allow for keeping the wine at a perfect serving temperature, whites more so than reds, by judiciously adding a right level of ice cubes to the central cooling chamber. It also serves as a serving and decanting carafe. This is a much better and less messy way than utilizing an ice bucket. I have found that it can be used to properly chill a bottle of white in about 10 minutes. Do be careful though, as the glass portion of the carafe is made of very thin glass and an accidental tap of the center stainless steel chamber against it can end in a disaster.Overall as I said it is a terrific way of adding to your wine enjoyment. The four stars refers only to the lighter duty plastic components, and not to the functionality. Highly recommended.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20BPWIXHTKNRA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NXJI54S#wasThisHelpful","R20BPWIXHTKNRA","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yes this is a very attractive coffee pot (fits right in inside a stainless trim kitchen), and despite a large array of convenience features, it can be as simple to operate as pushing one button to brew (the on-off button) coffee. I really like the safety feature of the power button being near the top, as my old coffee maker had it on the base, such that anything that was slid on the counter, quite often inadvertently turned on the power, and it was only the vaguely hot burning smell that alerted you to the event. This is further enhanced by the auto one or two hour turn off, the beep which alerts you that the brew cycle is finished and the timer that shows how long since the brew cycle completed.The enclosure is fairly large, it is 14"" tall which extends to 23"" tall with the cover open. I had to slide it out from under the cabinets to fill with water. While pushing it back under the counter I sloshed some water out from two holes in the back of the unit which prevent you from overfilling the reservoir. Note that on my unit 12 cups as measured on the carafe was a little over 10 cups as measured on the side gage of the coffee maker. If you use the side markers and fill to 12 cups, you WILL overflow the carafe (voice of experience).Brewing comments; For the coffee enthusiast, the temperature of the water dripping on the grounds is about 195 deg F. This is on the low side of recommended (195-205) for best extraction, but assures that you will not get any burned taste. This was confirmed by taste which was medium strength. There is a ""strong"" option button (has to be tuned on prior to main power button to engage) but this button only seems to extend the brewing time 50%. For example four cups took exactly four minutes to brew under regular and six minutes under strong setting. This appears to be the same function as the 1-4 vs 4-12 cup setting, the coffee gets more time to brew.Miscellaneous:Programming is very easy. You do everything before turning on the main power. IE push program, set the start time, push auto. The ""strong"" and the ""auto off"" (one or two hours setting) have to be used before the on button is pushed, they will not have any effect once the brew cycle is started.The sneak a cup function simply closes a drip valve to the carafe when the carafe is removed. It has a fairly strong spring in it and about half the time I put the carafe back in place, it pushes up against the spring which in turn pushed up on the coffee basket container which in turn popped open the top lid of the maker (some steam escaped).The tea function does truly remove the coffee basket from the water path, so you will not get residual coffee flavor in your tea if you brew both. The tea reservoir is moved into the pot, and the pot cover seals the leaves in the basket (mostly, if you pour the tea without removing the basket you may get some leaves in the cup). The tea brew time is 5 minutes PLUS the time to run the drip cycle (~1 min/cup), so for 12 cups you will have up to 15 minutes total brewing time, which may be too strong.The blue clock backlight is bright enough to serve as a nightlight in the kitchen. The manual recommends to unplug the unit when not in use. This will reset the clock.It is definitively better than average due to the features, looks and sturdiness. What keeps it from getting a perfect score is inconsistent volume labels, and the lid intermittently popping off when the carafe is moved. If you have the space under the cabinets, or on the open counter this is a good mid priced coffee maker.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E19BVFK7K75H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LU2I43C#wasThisHelpful","R2E19BVFK7K75H","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Totally dead after 23 months and maybe two dozen charge cycles. Worked well for about a year then the capacity dropped to about 50 percent when compared to the Canon. Today I put it in the charger and it was totally not registering as inserted. Put it in the camera, the camera would not turn on. So my initial joy at having a great low cost battery is very much diminished.

"Bushnell Trophy Cam EssentialIntro Note: I got one of the updated firmware cameras out of the box. Serial numbers less than B140610000 will need to be updated due to a date/time bug. The camera will now keep the date and time even when turned off. If you remove the batteries though, the settings will be kept, but the date and time will have to be reset. Regarding the batteries, my camera worked just fine with the Eneloop rechargeable batteries (which are not recommended, manual suggests Alkaline or Lithium). With 8 Lithium batteries, potential run time is up to a year.This trail cam is truly an ""essential"" model. It does the basics very well and the rating is relative to its cost and intended purpose. The photo quality is much better than I expected. The range of the motion detect, with the added bonus of taking interval based photos will work very well for a game trail. The video capture is basic quality only, and the glowing night vision led's may give the camera away.Out of the box setup was truly intuitive, (I did not have to read the manual first). I do wish the labels on the setup buttons were more legible, or that the buttons were oriented as described in a cross pattern, rather than all in a row. Each time I wanted to change the setup, I had to bring the camera into bright light. I used the camera with both a tripod and the included strap, both worked well.Performance: The daylight photos have great detail and color, at the 5mp (850k size) and 6mp (950k size) resolution (look much better than my GoPro Silver 3+ at 10mp). Even the 3mp (625k size) pictures look very detailed. I could easily tell the difference say between a raccoon and an opossum at over 100ft. That is probably due in part to the fairly narrow 50degree field of view. In very bright light there was substantial washout of highlights. Night photos are susceptible to motion blur. The lens is specified as  f3.1 but the camera Exif data reports it as f2.8. I don't know if I would trust the Exif data all that much as it always showed ISO 100, and 1 second shutter speed no matter what. Every brand of SD card I had worked just fine, and the camera will accept up to a 32GB size.The camera switches to night mode with a click and does so at an early dusk. The IR night vision LED's glow red similar to a small portable heater red when they light up.  So if you are looking in the direction of the camera you will see them. On the other hand they did have a good range, I would fully agree that they are good out to 60 feet, compared to black led's which are spec'd out to only 45 feet. The flash does not seem to throttle down a lot, and images of objects at less than 5 feet will be very washed out.The motion detect trigger range is very interesting. Based on heat difference of moving body compared to the background it could be as little as 15 feet (human body against a warm sunlit background), to 45 feet (same body against a shady background, or as much as 150 ft (lawn tractor against shade). I usually set it to capture 2 consecutive photos on trigger (one second apart, this pretty much assures one good one) then set it to wait 10 sec before next trigger (both settings are adjustable. There is a sensitivity setting, which includes an auto mode, which worked well. The camera is aware of the outside temperature to shift the sensitivity. It can record this temperature (photos only) along with date and time (both photos and video) on the display.The video resolution is adjustable from 320x240 up to 720x480. Even at the highest 720 resolution (6.5mb per 5 seconds) the picture is not great. Its usable, but if you are at all interested in video, I recommend that you buy one of the trail cams that offer 1080 HD video, it will have six times better resolution.The field scan (taking photos at predetermined intervals of every 1 to 60 minutes) works very well. If there is something just outside of motion detect range, you will now have an opportunity to see it as well.In summary this trail camera fits its purpose and price very well. Unless you need high quality video and have no tolerance for any IR glow (in which case I suggest Trophy cam HD Max Bushnell 8MP Trophy Cam HD Max Black LED Trail Camera with Night Vision, twice the price though) it should suffice for both game and surveillance.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWRDNSNDLLE2J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IID3O0Y#wasThisHelpful","RWRDNSNDLLE2J","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kobi K8L6 Led bulb.If user images are back up, please take a look at my photo comparing the Kobi K8L6 bulb to a Sunbeam 40 watt and 60 watt incandescent bulbs. As you can see at 455 rated lumens, the Kobi brightness falls about exactly half way between the 350 lumen 40 watt, and 560 lumen 60 watt bulb. So do check the light output of any bulbs you are considering buying. All of the bulbs I looked at were rated at 2700 degree color temperature, and indeed they all looked ""warm white"" similar. The dimmable part of this bulb works well, no flicker, but if you do not need it there may be a cost saving available if you buy it without that feature. (Yes the K8L6 bulb I received clearly states 455 lumen 6 watt vs 350 lumen in the above description). My chandelier has glass panes above the bulbs that reflect light. such that despite these bulbs directing the light upwards, the overall table illumination was pretty much the same.The annual led operating cost saves you about four dollars per year on electricity, but you do have to consider the initial higher purchase cost, and then weigh in the 22 year led longevity vs 2 year longevity for the incandescent bulb. Still all things considered you may be recouping your costs anywhere between  three and six years.  If your home heating system is electric you have to consider that in the heating season all of the electricity that the led bulb is saving you (the waste goes into heat in the incandescent bulb) will have to be made up by your heater. So in winter the led bulbs do not ""net"" save as much.  I measured the bulb temperatures after ten minutes, the led bulb base was 160 deg F (the dome was about 110), while the incandescent bulb glass was about 250-270 degrees.All in all, after all of the number crunching and teeth gnashing is over, if you are going to live in your house for more than three years it makes sense to ""invest"" in these led bulbs as they do provide a real payback with no shortcomings.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PJG14ZRMT29D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9WRUNQ#wasThisHelpful","R1PJG14ZRMT29D","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary: Superb construction, Truly, short of surround sound receiver set-up, best all in one high quality super easy to hook up sound solution, better than a sound bar, and no need for a sub woofer. If you do not want the complications of a receiver and multi speakers, or if you value room aesthetics with minimal sound quality trade offs, this is the way to go. The trade offs are too mellow highs with no adjustment possible and no ""simulated"" surround sound mode. The THX sound test available on some discs sounds excellent. All of the speakers, including the rear, in the THX test, except the subwoofer provided output.Details- PlussesLooks good, solid, supports even 55"" Samsung (see photo, 75 lbs is the limit), easy hookup with just two wires, power and optical sound connector.The slight elevation from the TV siting on top helped out my viewing angle from the couch.I did not give up TV sound (instructions suggest turning it off}, on my set you can simply turn it to zero. The combination of high end treble, and Bose low-mid range gave me the best overall sound.The Samsung TV has adjustable SPIDF audio delay and I was able to sync TV and Bose sound perfectly with no echo. When I use both, I get a great sound stage with bass, and if I throw in some delay, it really sounds like a huge sound stage.Turning on the cable box, TV, and Solo 15 all with one button push works great. The remote is solid, somewhat large.Minuses:You Give up TV digital control and effects such as Samsung Tru Surround Sound (it really opens up the sound stage and Solo 15 sounds narrow by comparison, when TV sound mode is set to normal they sound similar),Auto level equalization, the TV when set to Normal does a good job of holding down overtly loud commercials, Solo 15 does not have an equivalent functionGreat bass, and good midrange, so so trebleNo equalizer, can use a little 5kHz-10kHz boostBy using the TV's only optical out you give up surround sound decoding in the receiver, I now use the optical from Blu-ray for that.Should have pass thru on the digital out if you want to utilize additional speakersThe remote code for Yamaha did not work with my receiver. I had difficulty following the booklet code search instructions. The keys feel sticky and the bottom of the remote is rounded. Its the only remote I have where you cannot push a key with one finger while its lying down on the coffee table, the remote will simply flip over.Neutral: Dialogue mode for me just sounds different, and not clearer, certainly sounds weird with some programs such as football games. The biggest effect is that it cuts out the low frequencies, where any boominess may obscure the dialogue.In the past the Blu-ray fit between TV and the top of entertainment center. Now had to move it since it overhangs the speakerWish list: Speaker top on/off and volume buttons, LED volume indicatorBlue tooth connection with a possible Android/Ios app to control internal equalization.I like it, certainly better than average, but short of five stars. With Bose this is a second generation Solo speaker (Solo 10 was smaller), perhaps with the next one they will add the app driven equalization and digital surround sound effects option for those that like them.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZYXYYJ3VW9B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N1SSX6Q#wasThisHelpful","RDZYXYYJ3VW9B","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tired of shaving and waxing unwanted hair, I thought I would try a new approach.  Looked into hair removal via a dermatologist, but the expense involved made me pause.  I have always been interested in the IPL at home removal systems which seemed much more affordable and can be used at my leisure.  So I decided to give it a shot.The Lumea is a light weight  unit that is not bulky and has a good solid feel to it. After reading the directions and warnings, which have MANY exclusions as to WHO should not use it (dark skinned or blondes/redheads with light colored hair), nor should it be used on the face (I had planned to try it on my fine mustache hairs), I decided to try it on my bikini line area.  Starting at power level 2, I gradually went up to level 4 before I felt a little hot stinging upon zapping my skin.  I decided to leave it at level 4 for now.  The light is very intense and I could see it around the unit as I zapped (probably not a good idea to keep looking at it).  The entire experience was not painful at all, and I experienced no redness or irritation afterwards.  This is my first time using it.  I plan to add follow up comments as I continue using it.  Overall its been a positive experience so far.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBHQ3XQS65XHA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LJO6DYS#wasThisHelpful","RBHQ3XQS65XHA","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Swiffer Wetjet wood starter kit comes unassembled. Assembling it was not too complicated (but getting the aluminum handle push buttons to lock into their holes did require strength), although after putting it all together, I realized it required 4 AA batteries. This seems unnecessary, surely a pull-trigger would have worked just as well, and been more environmentally friendly. On top of that they do NOT recommend rechargeable batteries. For me the regular Ni-MH batteries did not work, but the ""hybrid"" pre-charged type worked just fine.The position of the spray button definitely needs relocating, as many a time it accidentally was touched while just trying to move the swiffer to another area, and out comes unwanted spray.As far as cleaning goes, it seemed to do an OK job although the thin plastic skirting around the edges seemed to make a grating noise against the wood floor which was very irritating to me. As I was mopping I noticed it seemed to leave a dull film on the floor. As others have mentioned, the two power spray nozzles do not spray evenly. My left one squirts about three feet in front, while the right one barely makes it six inches. The cleaning solution bottle it comes with is non refillable so if you use other liquids it will have to be hand squirted on.All in all I can't say I was overly impressed, and there is definitely room for improvement.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35ZG6UFIE68HX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004W36BAE#wasThisHelpful","R35ZG6UFIE68HX","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Five Star's notebook offers a few but very convenient advantages over other notebooks. The one thing you will notice in comparison to other notebooks is that the inside pockets are big enough to hold printer sized paper. Other notebooks can hold lined sheets just fine, but printer sized papers will have to be folded. The notebook also does have a little higher quality paper that reduces the ink bleed of very free flowing pens or fountain pens. You might not notice a huge difference, but the less ink bleed, the better.Five Star have also reinforced the pockets and used a plastic cover. Both of these won't seem very useful at first, but prolonged use of notebooks usually result in torn pockets and bent corners, which will not happen as much with this notebook.This is one school commodity where you can afford the best and not regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VE5DJ09GUCVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JKRKFQI#wasThisHelpful","R3VE5DJ09GUCVO","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Belkin Slim Style keyboard is a step below their Ultimate keyboard case. On the low cost side I would rather go with the Fintie Ipad Air keyboard Fintie iPad Air Keyboard Case - Ultra Thin Folio Key Removable Bluetooth Keyboard Case Cover for iPad Air 5 (5th Generation) - Purple, while on the upside I would stick with the Belkin Ultimate keyboard case Belkin QODE Ultimate Wireless Keyboard and Case for iPad Air (Black).  Personally I am sticking with a separate keyboard (the Apple aluminum wireless Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B) and a separate smart hard case. This is a matter of personal taste, so please make sure that you actually try your Ipad in a keyboard case. The up, down, left, right scroll keys do not really scroll unless you turn on Voice Over in settings, but that is a limitation of IOS, not of this keyboard. Also Belkin's website warns against some possible lockups when using the keyboard with IOS 7+ (but all IP Air are 7.0+?), I did not experience any lock ups. They also say that the Search button no longer works. It worked just fine for me. I am enclosing a couple of user images to illustrate the keyboard layout and the curved back mentioned below. The actual function keys are not the same as pictured in product description.Here are the consideration when deciding on the Slim Style Cover.Pluses: The rubberized plastic, pleather, finish feels quite nice to the touch and when closed it feels quite solid.When closed, the Ipad retaining ""ears"" hold the keys away from the screen, on the other hand this makes this case slightly thicker than the Ultimate case (even though the specs say 0.9 thick for both). I tried quite hard to shake the Ipad out of these straps, but they worked quite well.Bluetooth pairing was very easy. Although there is a dedicated pairing key, all I had to do was turn the keyboard on, and the Ipad showed a new bluetooth device in settings. Click on pair there and that was all there was.The key action feels quite nice, I found it similar to the Apple wireless keyboard.Available in more colors vs Ultimate.Minuses: The micro usb charging slot is located against the back. This makes it impossible to use any charging cable, you have to use the very slim supplied Belkin cable only.The battery life is only 60 hours vs 160 for the ultimateThere is absolutely no user manual for the non standard additional function keys. See photo. What in the world is the flower key above the ""6""?The hinge is very floppy, using the Ipad in a tablet format with the keyboard behind the back does not feel comfortable.The cover is not smart, opening it (power switch on or off) does not turn on the Ipad, and closing the cover does not turn off the Ipad. Turning the keyboard on while open does open up the Ipad last used screen. There is a dedicated sleep and wake button on the keyboard.The base with the keyboard definitively curves up on the sides. This makes the keyboard rock slightly when typing on a flat surface. Not a deal breaker, but it does not feel solid.Overall the slim style cover does what it sets out to do. There are nicer solutions out there though. And if you use the pad as a touch device mostly and only occasionally do a lot of typing, consider a separate keyboard altogether.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CWOMTBMC4257/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EUY4ZLM#wasThisHelpful","R3CWOMTBMC4257","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is not meant to be used as your only guide or first learning resource for the CCNA. It offers very short explanations for the questions asked, so the book alone cannot be used as a replacement to a training course. However, if you have already taken a training course or are somewhat familiar with routing and switching, this book can be an excellent refresher and reference.The questions are also asked in the same format (e.g. choose multiple correct answers for a question) that is used for the actual CCNA exams, so you already know what the questions on the exam will be like. The author suggests taking the two smaller exams and sectioned the book into two parts, one for each exam.You are also given a one year subscription to access practice questions online, making studying easy wherever you are.Using this guide in combination with a training course and Cisco equipment (or a simulator) will give a solid foundation for the CCNA and a good understanding of how to set up and configure a network.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33VFSQOUN5M24/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=111879429X#wasThisHelpful","R33VFSQOUN5M24","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dog flea shampoos generally contain one of the following active ingredients: Pyrethrin, or Permethrin (synthetic Pyrethrin) Limonene (Foster and Smith website has a good article describing them). Sprays and collars may contain Fipronyl or Imidacloprid, or similar.When searching for a flea shampoo you can start with the Pyrethrin ones as this is a naturally derived substance from chrysantenum flowers, and they have a long record for safety. This one of those products. Previously I used Adams d Limonene shampoo Adams d-Limonene Flea & Tick Shampoo, 12-ounce, also naturally based, but it seems to have lost its effectiveness after a few good years.Once you choose the active ingredient, check the concentration (I have seen pyrethrins at .045% to .15%, this one is .05%) and the scent. To be effective follow directions in starting at the head (so the fleas don't run and hide in the ears), finish with foot pads, and leave on for 5 minutes.The Fresh `n Clean, especially in the gallon size, is an economical shampoo to use weekly (maximum recommended frequency). The scent is very subtle, to me it's the least scented shampoo I have used. I would describe it as ""fresh linen"" like air sprays with some lanolin and soap bubble solution thrown in. It lathers well, maybe even better than average (at the recommended 1.5 tablespoon per 5 pounds of pet).  The dog liked just fine and appears not to scratch as much as before, and I have not found any more fleas after two weekly applications.For a comprehensive flea treatment also consider your yard and carpets and keep the safety of your pet in mind.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GRNGSFQP31AT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HH2VA7G#wasThisHelpful","R2GRNGSFQP31AT","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Initial Impressions: There is much to like about the Marley Get Together speaker. It feels solid, the bamboo half inch thick front baffle with laser etched logo screams class. The controls are minimalistic, four buttons and a light, yet they are intuitive. Push power, push pair button, connect on your device. While the 3.5"" drivers are exposed, with the beveled opening the whole assembly looks like a piece of art. Possibly a 1"" mesh black grid wire may have complemented the baffle and protected the drivers, but that is subjective. I like it the way it is. The controls are dependent on what device you hook it up to, with what version of bluetooth. With a LG phone and Ipad Air, both the device and the speaker volume controls work. With a 2nd gen Ipod Touch and a Sony Android media player only the volume controls on the speaker worked (hence a small remote control would be useful).Performance: The speaker has an internal battery, good for up to 8 hours when charged. It did not come charged, so the tests were done using the supplied power adapter. By the way the speaker has a USB port for charging the music device. As mentioned in the manual, it may not supply enough power to fully charge the device. The Ipod Touch was fully happy and showed charging, while the Ipad showed Not charging, but was, just very slowly. I did note some drop in volume when switching from power supply to the battery.When I initially played some music the first impression was wow, this is loud. The second impression was that while there was much apparent bass, it was somewhat boomy. The highs were brilliant, and the midrange somewhat restrained. This bothered me as this did not fit in with the overall quality of the speaker. I wound up experimenting with various placements of the speaker and with plugging the rear bass reflex port with poly fiber pillow stuffing (an old loudspeaker builders trick). I am enclosing a photo of what I did, and a test plot of why I did it. Basically if you place the speaker as supplied less than 12"" from a wall, you get two strong frequency peaks, one at 130 Hz and one at 210 Hz, and so the speaker sounds boomy. When placed away from the wall, with the port ""stuffed"", the peaks are mostly tamed. You will not get deep bass, these are after all only 3.5"" drivers, I would call it fairly decent response from 90Hz to 19,500Hz.  I actually got the best sound when I used these speakers outdoors, where also I was surprised that the bluetooth range was out to 50ft.In summary: Great looking speaker, which when placed correctly and modified slightly, gives very creditable performance for its small size.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MLT6FEWL0W5W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ESJ9PQE#wasThisHelpful","R2MLT6FEWL0W5W","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"THE battery of choice for electronics, similar to Eneloop XXThe precharged (sometimes called hybrid) NiMh (NOT simple conventional NiMh) batteries are about the best alternative to Lithium AA batteries for electronic devices such as digital cameras. These Amazon Basics are similar to the Eneloop XX high capacity cells at a lower cost eneloop XX 2500mAh Typical / 2400 mAh Minimum, High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries. My tests show (see picture - using La Crosse BC9009 smart charger) that they can last up to 75 minutes or 27% longer in digital cameras compared to the older generation 2000 mAh Amazon Basic Precharged and Eneloop 2000 mAh batteries. An excellent deal.In depth explanation: The reason is  that despite the high capacity claims of the NON precharged variety NiMh batteries, they self discharge, and even when they are used right after a charge, they tend to loose voltage more rapidly. With smart electronic devices, they will shut off when the voltage drops below a certain predetermined level (this has been between 1.15 and 1.20 volts in my experience). As a result a higher capacity conventional NiMh battery may give a dead signal quicker than a hybrid/pre charged NiMh battery with a lower rated capacity. You can see this on my picture where the highest rated capacity 2600mAh La Crosse battery was the first to drop below the cutoff point in my test. True it would have lasted the longest in a flashlight (when freshly charged), but not in an electronic device. The precharged cells are now in a third generation where you can choose very high capacities, or up to 1800 recharge cycles. These Amazon cells are the high capacity, and lower 500 recharge cycles rating. The graph is Lacrosse conventional 2600 mAh, Duracell precharged 2000mAh,  Eneloop precharged second gen 2000 mAh, Amazon second gen precharged 2000 mAh, and the current Amazon Basics 3rd gen 2400min 2500 mAh rated precharged batteries (Top light blue plot).

"Very balanced sound, insanely long cord, chill colors. These disappear on the head after about 5 minutes - they are that comfortable. Much more full sound and more bass than Sennheiser HD 219s Sennheiser HD 219 S Headphones with Integrated Microphone for Smartphones, Black(similar size and weight), but not quite as ""dazzling and luscious"" as the Aurvana 2 (around the ear and much larger) Creative Aurvana Live! 2 Headset with 40mm Drivers and In-Line Mic (Black). MUCH better clarity than Sony ZX300 (economy, similar style and fairly highly rated) Sony MDRZX300/BLK Stereo Headphones. The removable audio cord is micro plug on the headphone side and mini on the device side (similar to the Aurvana 2) Frankly these have an amazing amount of bass for over/on top of the ear headphones. I would say that for neutral studio sound they are dethroning my RP-DH1250-S Technics headphones Panasonic RP-DH1250-S Technics Pro DJ Headphone. The construction is lightweight, but very solid. Metal screws, hinges, and stainless steel abound. Very easy to quickly fold into the included semi hard case.In summary VERY comfortable for long listening sessions, and hard to beat for flat un-emphasized frequency responseI also want to mention a couple of songs that helped me out in critical evaluation. Please use bitrates greater than 160kbps when listening to MP3. Common 128Kbps rates cut out the highs much too early starting at 14,000Hz.Sarah Brightman - Phantom of the opera. Incredible low end organ opening and clear soprano vocals allow you to judge both bass and treble,.....as well how well the headphones handle clarity. You don't want the lows to muddy up the highs. Andrew Lloyd Webber CollectionAaron Neville - Feels like rain.  Incredibly well recorded track useful for judging stage presence. Also at 1:50 to 2:00 listen for an incredible tenor on backing vocals saying ""feels like rain"". A good set of headphones should  clearly bring this out of the background and the low timbre should give you goosebumps.

"Realistically the device is only a command relay to send command from your remote device to the web and then to displays what comes back from the web it on the Tv screen. That is why it works well for items that it gets directly from the web like a Youtube video. I also wanted it to share the webpage that other family members were looking at when using Amazon or bidding sites for shopping. We all wanted to see the descriptions at the same time. It is not a screen ""mirroring"" device. You will eventually see what the laptop user sees, but when they scroll, it takes several seconds for the tv screen to catch up. Still useful, and I changed the Tv resolution from HD to VGA+ to make it faster, and that helped some.In summary it has its uses, but think of it as mostly fancy remote control that will make your Tv, semi smart with web apps that you may not have had before. At the price a wonderful toy for the techno geek.9/20 observation. I saw a great Youtube compilation on the PC and wanted to show it to all on the large screen using my tablet to cast onto the tv.

"I have tried Bose, Sony and Sharper Image noise cancelling phones, so I had a realistic expectation of the noise reduction. No they do not cancell all noise. But they are very effective at reducing hum and drone type noise. For example air conditioning fan, plane engine drone, tire road noise, wind noise, microwave hum, etc. They do not reduce conversation sounds, lawnmower noise, or other impact type noise. The moment you flip the switch to on you get a sensation similar to ear pop in an airplane and then the background sounds seem to move to another room. Everone who tries them get a bid smile on their face when they flip the switch to on, even with no music playing.The sound is very good, but there is a slight background electronics type hum. Lows, mids, and highs are actually very good, but again not terricic.

"It was with much anticpation that I awaited the delivery of these earbuds. They came in a nice box rather tahn a baggie which was a surprise. I am not a fan of the cloth covered cables as these are the most prone to tanglimg earbuds I have ever owned. The complex shape od the bud themselves offers many snag points as well. Just be careful, and after all it was the sound I bought these for. Ant this is the real crux of my story. The description says ""bass enhanced"". Compared to what? The old style Apple earbuds?While the 8320 mids and highs are accurate, they are not ""crisp"". The bass is there but it only shines with real bass heavy techno and hip hop tunes. At other times its no more than just there. Based on their reputation I turned up the volume, took out the buds out of my ears and set them aside for ""burning in"". About six hours later I came back for a comparison. Not much better.

"Precharged is the only way to go, With Amazon Basics being best. Here's whyWhen shopping for batteries you generally have a choice of Alkaline, Traditional NiMh, the precharged (sometimes called hybrid) NiMh, and Lithium. Currently if you want rechargeable batteries that only leaves the precharged and traditional NiMh as being readily available. While you may be tempted to buy the traditional kind due to its somewhat lower cost and higher capacities marked on the label, please look further. I have compared several currently available AA batteries, A La Crosse 2600mAh traditional, and the following precharged; Amazon Basics 1900 mAh, Sanyo Eneloop 1900 mAh, and Duracell 2000 mAh. (Used La Crosse BC-9009 battery charger/analyzer)You probably have heard that traditional NiMh batteries self discharge (in my experience about 5% the first day and then about 1% per day) and may be tempted to say, that's OK, I will use them within a day or so of charging. (After six months or so this type is just about discharged) If its for a flashlight that's OK, however if its for an electronic device, there is a much more important characteristic I want to point out. Electronic devices and cameras especially will cut off when they detect a VOLTAGE below a certain minimum (Pentax, Canon, Nikon AA cameras), in my experience anywhere below 1.15 and 1.25 can be detected as a dead battery.I have tested all of the batteries above and plotted the results (see the customer image). The HIGHEST rated capacity La Crosse (2600 rated vs 2330 tested) would report as dead @1.15 volts after only 175 minutes or less than HALF its rated capacity (1090 mAh effective vs 2600 rated). My highest rated Amazon Basics AA would reach that cut off point at 330 minutes, or almost twice as long! (1885 mAh effective vs 1900 mAh rated). The Eneloop and the Duracell were second and third best.So in conclusion even if you use them right after charging, in electronic devices the precharged battery is the only way to go. Amongst precharged batteries the Amazon Basics AA for me tested out even better than the previous champ the Eneloop.Add On for the AAA batteries which I also got (Amazon combined the reviews). These also tested excellent. After 3 conditioning discharge and recharge cycles I got capacities ranging from 795 to 817 mAh. In this case the comparison was 1000 mAh Duracell, 1000mAh La Crosse and 900 mAh ""Digital"" brand. All were conventional kind. The Digital drops to 1.27 volts in a week and tests at just over 500mAH, or only 55% of rated. The Duracell is really bad for self discharge dropping to only 1.22 volts in a week at 700 mAh. The La Crosse dropped to 1.29 volts in a week and tested at 800 MAh. So not an exact comparison, but the Amazon Basics were at 1.31 volts after a week, and tested at highest capacity, for both effective and actual. Five stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5SG15V1COQZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CWNMR5Y#wasThisHelpful","R1M5SG15V1COQZ","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Eugene plays probably the most rhythm heavy blues that I have heard, other than the Legendary Arthur Alexander Lonely Just Like Me. This album is all about uplifting ballads, head bobbing, body swaying tunes and chords that flow like honey. Of course it also gets a little gritty as well especially on Nelly Bell, an ode of all things to his ""Nissan Truck"". Its not corny at all despite the subject, and both the guitar and bass riffs are outstanding. Richard Thompson sang about Vincent Black Lightning motorcycle (folk), there are endless rock tunes about hot rods, why not a blues tune about a truck?

"I am very pleased with this cookware set. The pots have a quality feel to them, with the weight being not so light that would indicate a cheap thin gauge metal, yet not so heavy that it breaks my wrist to handle them when filled with food.  The base is aluminum encased in stainless steel, and they heat evenly and are plenty thick, which is great because it will prevent the frying pans from warping, as the thinner pans are prone to do. The size of the bottoms fits 6"" and 8"" electric burners perfectly. (I do miss gas very much)I like the back enamel exterior - it is actually a very practical color, and I'm hoping it will not show the slight discoloration near the base that usually builds up over time.  The handles are quite comfortable to hold and hopefully will be as durable as the cookware.  The glass lids seem very thick and sturdy, being encased in a thick metal rim, and the riveted handles have a quality feel to them as well. One thing I wish they had is a slight relief on the top in the pot and some openings in the rim of the cover to allow you to drain the water when cooking pasta. The 3 qt stockpot is ideal for that as well as rice as it fits perfectly on my 6"" back electric heating element. The 8"" skillet is perfect  for small meals for one or two people, however I find the 10"" skillet somewhat of an odd size.  The teflon coating on the skillets is very good, but not as good as my top rated T-fal E9380864 Professional Total Nonstick Oven Safe Thermo-Spot Heat Indicator 12.5-Inch Fry Pan/Saute Pan Dishwasher Safe Cookware, Blacka much more practical size, and consequently I would recommend that you get one of those as well.Overall my impressions so far are that this set is very sturdy and well made and should last a long time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFQ8E9RJFJM1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNTYWGK#wasThisHelpful","RFQ8E9RJFJM1X","AXU3VKZE848IY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXU3VKZE848IY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I participate in a lot of headphone and earbud reviews, so testing these involved a lot of swapping and consequently lot of tangled cords. All well worth it as my much more expensive Technics and Sennheiser on the ear headphones were proven not to be as well rounded in key areas of comfort, imaging and frequency response. Frankly these had even more highs than some of my favorite Sony IN the ear buds, which I have never experienced with over the ear headphones before. These truly had everything going for them from the lowest lows to the highest highs. Imaging was incredible with each instrument and vocals placed solidly on the sound stage. Bass is very solid and not over emphacised.Only slight concerns, efficiency is fairly low (only the Sennheisers were less efficient), and the funny appendage antenna cushions take a little getting used to.

"Its been 5 long years since New Jerseys finest released The Monitor centered on the American Civil War and sounding in the words of one critic like ""Born to Run's drunk stepchild on an epic spree"". The release of The Most Lamentable Tragedy by Patrick Sickles and Co is even bigger in conception and even more unbalanced in its outcomes. To start it is a 29 track long rock opera essentially telling the tale of Sickles torment with manic depression. In this abundance of music, there are some of the greatest rock tracks of recent years combined with a couple of horrors and fragments of music which act as breaks between the main songs.The first proper song on the album is a continuation of one of the tracks from The Monitor namely the wonderful Clash style thrash of No Future Part IV: No Future Triumphant. Everything that is great about this band is present. There is enough energy to light a town and Sickles vocals shred like a chainsaw through a tree. Brilliantly, they match this on the next track Stranded where in the riotous chorus Sickles summarises his own predicament when he screams Thick bold stains/on your sick young brain/ just take your Ritalin/then you can play the old hits again. Alternatively Lonely Boy sounds like the best Graham Parker music that he never wrote. At the centre of the whole album is Lost my mind a cover of a Daniel Johnson song that appears to accurately chart Sickles trials and tribulations with on-going and intermittent depression, it a personal manifesto coming to terms with his mental illness. It is followed by a range short tracks including the pure punk of the 49 seconds of Lookalike the best song ever written about a doppelganger, which quickly leads into a the high-speed reprise of Lost my mindTwo songs on the album exceed the nine-minute mark. Once again More Perfect Union picks up on of the threads from ""The Monitor."" It starts quietly then builds to a brilliant melodic sing-along populated with T-Rex sounding power chords. It ends in a punk crescendo that sounds like the E Street band on crystal meth. The other long track is (S)he said, she (S)aid anchored by a heavy metal riff and is a anthem that one day you hope you will see this band deliver in a killer on stage version. Sickles pulls it all back to a simple piano on ""No Future V: In Endless Dreaming but it remains utterly compelling. Two other tracks show Titus Andronicuss ability to produce fine melodies albeit within a dirty barroom setting. Initially Fired Up is splendid first division power pop and hugely enjoyable. Secondly, neighbours in this reviewers immediate vicinity are now humming the infectious single Fatal Flaw as it has been played that often and loud. Quite why Sickles then needs to record two covers of Auld Lang Syne and bludgeon Shane McGowans Pogues classic a Pair of Brown Eyes is questionable. It probably shows that he cant always effectively steer the sheer weight of music in his head. Yet he makes up for this with songs like Im going insane which is a mixture of punk and prog. Why not round it all off with a 6-minute' sea shanty in Stable Boy? Finally, if you can resist the charms of Come on Siobhan then you are a steel-hearted monster.The Most Lamentable Tragedy revives the horrors of the rock opera and gives the concept a full blood transfusion. Granted some of it is a bit hit and miss, and if Sickles could get it into his head that less is more that might be a blessing. But ultimately who cares? This is hard-core, messy, loud, anarchic, dirty, shambolic feast of brilliance from a band whose sheer enthusiasm bowls you over and leaves you gasping for air. There is nothing within rock music that comes close to the wonders of Titus Andronicus ability to put pent up rage to music and deliver a rousing affirmation of why the genre occasionally delivers true redemption.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2M258WDEKGENC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WY8J11K#wasThisHelpful","R2M258WDEKGENC","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There comes a time when being seen in public with your dear old mother is not always deemed to be the height of ""cool"". That may be about to change with the arrival Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear. This mother-and-son folk duo comes from a background of plying their trade in Kansas City coffee houses. They have built up a following and have, according to Rolling Stone, created a buzz that sees more famous acts beating a path to their door to pay homage. This was further sealed by an appearance on the David Letterman Show, which set tongues across the music business wagging.Their debut ""Skeleton Crew"" is a record that oozes charm and old-fashioned simplicity. There is nothing earth-shattering present other than high-quality songs by a pair of fine musicians whose family connection give them an affinity that others can only dream of. All these elements are present in the wonderful opener ""Live by the Water"" where Ward's sonorous tenor and the sterling backing by his mother, Ruth Ward, come together like cheese on toast. In one sense, it is best to forget the relationship present since these are musicians who would thrive in the company of any peers and whose music has rawness and urgency that is a joy to consume. Other tracks present like the well-trailed ""Silent Movies"" emote such enthusiasm that you are swept along by its sheer energy. Some of the songs are more reflective not least the solemn deep blues of ""Undertake and Juniper"" which of the standouts on the album which is utterly compelling. To fair wherever you drop your needle on this record rich rewards follow. The country shuffle of ""Yellow Taxi"" demands a small stage, a hot night, a good supply of a local brew plus an audience with a ""ear for a fine tune"" and a willingness to sing-along. Others, like the slow wintry ballad ""Dead Daffodils"" alternatively. appear to tap into deeper folk roots with Madison's vocal scoring on all counts for its range of emotions and wonderful storytelling. Finally the longest song present ""Down in Mississippi"" is the album's tour de force evoking the era of civil rights and Jim Crow. In addition, this is a full duet by mother and son which works to perfection.""Skeleton Crew"" by Madisen Ward and Mother Bear stands as a debut album that is a quiet revelation. As stated above the relationship between the two protagonists is a special one but the true unifying force bonding these special musicians together is their deceptively understated yet forceful music. In songs like ""Sorrows and Woe's"" they prove to be a find that is both surprising and very welcome indeed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27J5QVXF9KQSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V0CLQ32#wasThisHelpful","R27J5QVXF9KQSS","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Jim James and his Kentucky veterans ""My Morning Jacket"" are back for their seventh album after a four-year break. ""The Waterfall"" sees the band throw in the kitchen sink and other accouterments on this new record. There are traces of alt-country, power pop, soul and some psychedelic indie rock to boot. It also stretches out over a deluxe version comprising four extra tracks all nicely performed.The album kicks off with the ultra positive ""Believe (Nobody knows)"" where it is clear that Jim James is in fine voice as he drives the song forward with a huge vocal. Much more interesting however is the second song ""Compound Fracture"" a soulful track that seems to be infused with the spirit of Hall & Oates, no bad thing in this reviewers book. It is followed by the gentle acoustics of ""Like a River"" which is one of those classic meditative tracks which James has always thrown into each MMJ release. The single ""Big Decisions"" is good old fashioned classic rock although the song is completely eclipsed by ""Only Memories Remain"" a seven minute plus wonder which would have happily fit on a Marvin Gaye album. This soulful edge to the band is, of course, a feature of their live shows where they regularly throw in covers ranging from ""Careless Whisper"" to ""Hungry Heart"". It is the sign of a band not afraid to acknowledge their influences and treat audiences with a veritable jukebox of back catalogue classics and surprising songs drawn from across the gamut of pop music. This reviewer is, however, most content when James slips the band dynamics and unleashes an acoustic beauty like the wondrous ""Get the Point"" this album's match for earlier joys of tracks like ""The Librarian"".As with all MMJ albums, a number of songs don't quite make the grade. The title track ""In its infancy (The Waterfall)"" takes ages to get going and when it does it is rather repetitive; the same is true of ""Tropics (Erase Traces"" although this is a better-constructed song. So there, you have it, ""The Waterfall"" confirms that this Kentucky band continue to defy genres and yet produce music that is cohesive and a joy to explore. This is a sterling effort by a great Amercian band who following previous experience will now probably shoot off in all directions to pursue solo projects. Let us hope that it doesn't take four years for them again to return to the studio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RN1U5S8OMJHVB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U6PYYFQ#wasThisHelpful","RN1U5S8OMJHVB","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"That hoary old beast the classic live double album was very much the product of the 1970s with records such as ""Frampton Comes Alive"" permanently camped in the US charts, whilst others like the ""The Who - Live at Leeds"" captured a band at the pinnacle of their raw stage power. Last December, Matthew Houck's band Phosphorescent played four shows at the Music Hall Of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York and whilst not quite matching Townshend and Co, this is a sterling concert performance and well worth seeking out.At the heart of the performance is Houck's brilliant music from the last album ""Muchacho"". There has of course already been a set of acoustic live versions of these songs from a ""try out"" concert in St Pancras London which was included in the deluxe version of ""Muchacho"". For this set however the full electric band members of Phosphorescent are present and in addition there is the presence of a string quartet on the wonderful ""Song for Zula"". Others songs from the Phosphorescent repertory fare equally well in a live setting. A beautifully ragged ""The Quotidian Beasts"" sees Houck voice strain but not break adding to the songs vulnerability. Earlier songs like ""Tell me baby have you had enough"" have been road tested to the point of perfection over the years and work superbly on stage. The fragility of the ""Wolves"" confirms it as one of Houck's best songs especially the refrain""They tumble and fight / and they're beautiful/on the hilltops at night/ain't they beautiful"". It is a wondrous 10 minutes and utterly absorbing through its passage. It is also great to hear other Houck classics like ""A picture of our torn up praise"", the wrecked country of ""A New Anhedonia"" and ""Right on/Ride on"" in this rawer concert environment. Like the old Grateful Dead, it is apparent that Houck and chums are artists who can get their live performances to match and often surpass the studio cuts. Best of all is a epic, knockout version of ""Los Angeles"" nearly hitting the eleven minute mark and once again showing that Houck may well be the spiritual heir to Neil Young.""Live at the Music Hall"" is obviously a holding exercise until the next full Phosphorescent outing (hence the 4 stars). In that sense this as much a live ""Best of"" as a new original contribution. It can however be usefully purchased by old and new fans of this great band. The music here is infused with genuine power and grace. It is underpinned by Houck's tangled and fraught view of the human condition. The outcome is as ever, the music of Phosphorescent glows in the dark","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FYA02EEWJZU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QT6LBWK#wasThisHelpful","R1FYA02EEWJZU4","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Natalie Prass couldn't have chosen a better home than the Spacebomb Records imprint to take forward her music. It is label run by her school friend Matthew E. White who recorded one of 2013's best records, the brilliant ""The Big Inner"" that harked back to the great days of Stax records. It has a recording studio in Richmond Virginia, with the idea that artists signed to Spacebomb will fully utilise all these musical facilities including the house session players. Prass herself is a classic singer songwriter. She does not possess the biggest voice in terms of musical thump but the sheer golden sweetness that emanates from her vocals more than compensate for this.This debut album is a hybrid between the musical ethic of ""Dusty in Memphis"" combined with the more fragile soundscapes of artists like Julia Holter and Vashti Buynan. It is an heartbreak album detailing love gone wrong and imploding. Throughout the musicianship is impeccable yet this is is because the songs are so good. Prass has assembled a suite of nine tracks which are confessional in nature but remain up-lifting. Opener ""My baby don't understand me"" is an utterly gorgeous tale of breakup where Prass forlornly questions ""Where do you go, when the only home that you know Is with a stranger"". This is all set against the backdrop of a soul stew of gentle horns. it is followed by the funkier more pop orientated ""Bird of Prey"" which again is beautifully paced as the Spacebomb musicians colour in the song with swirling organs and the economical use of horn. This mixture of musical flourishes and Prass sweetness is epitomised on ""Your Fool"" a song which sounds structurally simple but achieves a melancholic pop bliss that many more established artists never reach. There is also variation with the ethereal ""Christy"" heading off into territory where Joanna Newsom is currently the major landowner. Others like ""Why don't you believe in me"" and ""Never over you"" are hewn from a classic country soul template and are effortless. Best of all is ""Violently"" a slow burn that is near to perfection. Quite how this slight 28 year old woman conjures up some of that power that was at the heart of ""Otis Blue"" is a miracle. ""Reprise"" alternatively is softly spoken and instrumental infused version of the earlier ""Your Fool"" but distinctive enough to stand in its own right. One small misstep could be the closer ""It is you"" which on first listens jars as a slice of Disney-esque schmaltz amongst the sweet soul demanding a certain mood to fully appreciate its charms.Natalie Prass and the Spacebomb collective have again proved that it is possible to delve into a well known musical tradition whilst infusing it enough modernity to be highly relevant thereby pushing that same tradition in a forward direction. As stated it would be easy to argue that with all the consummate musicians present that it would be difficult for Natalie Prass to record a bad record. Looking through another lens however it is clear that that Natalie Prass inspired these players with her music and they complimented her beautiful vision. This is a truly great debut album and one which you will want seek out post haste.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KLL813N13PFP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RLR1VXU#wasThisHelpful","R2KLL813N13PFP","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was only a couple of months back that Richmond VA's Spacebomb label released what sounded like one of 2015's brightest prospects in the debut album from Natalie Prass. The inspired grand master behind the label is Matthew E White a musician who taps into old Stax and Memphis music whilst giving it a shining contemporary edge . Having reviewed and enjoyed his wonderful debut the ""Big Inner"" over the last two years the prospect of new record came with onions and relish. The good news is that ""Fresh Blood"" does not disappoint and in some respects is a much more mature album than its predecessor.The fact that White has musicians behind him who could play Stravinsky's ""The Firebird"" on spoons and still make it sound great is a real bonus. The Spacebomb house band is a finely tuned soul machine which builds on White's compositions and takes them from good to grand. The 32 year old White has an acute musicians ear and nowhere is this clearer than on the mighty ""Rock n roll is cold"" a track so full of joyous verve, infectious chorus back-up and rolling piano that it positively dares your boldly parts to resist. Other tracks swimming in an old Memphis stew also work brilliantly. The album closer ""Love is deep"" could have been performed with equal measure by artists like Winston Pickett. It is a beautifully economical and well constructed track which could act as a useful point of entry into the wider album. ""Holy Moly"" is based on spoken lyrics and the track builds to a proper good old Gospel soul finish. Also falling into this category is the sumptuous opener ""Take care of my baby"" which is an utter delight. Furthermore ""Tranquility"" proves that White can match that vintage sound of yore which Curtis Mayfield once dominated. Within this tight formula White is capable of serving up classic songs with relative ease. Tracks like ""Vision"" shuffle along with an underpinning soul vibe that is inherently funky and well paced. Perhaps if there is one complaint it is that the quiet power of the music rarely scores highly in the excitement stakes for all its admirable clarity and referential linage,Matthew E White has once again taken the music of soul pioneers and proven that he and his Spacebomb compadres can deliver a seductive and accurate modren soul vision for this timeless music. ""Fresh Blood"" is an album which builds on the themes of his debut ""Big Inner"" and proves that this music packs a punch. As the Evening Standard have argued ""If his debut, Big Inner, was a cult classic, this is tasty enough for mass consumption, a sweet spot between Isaac Hayes and Bon Iver"". Seek this album out and while you are at it also extend a listen to Natalie Prass since with records of this quality Spacebomb are clearly the leading label of 2015 to date.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXWK7TJQZ7HS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RSZFFFK#wasThisHelpful","RTXWK7TJQZ7HS","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 starsRespect to both artists on this tribute album to Elliott Simith. They somehow managed to record the 12 compositions together over three years in between constant touring as separate musicians, grabbing any spare opportunity to lay down a track whether it be in in their homes or hotel rooms. The question is whether Seth Avett of the Avett Brothers and his friend and fellow artist Jessica Lea Mayfield pull off the feat of taking Smith's intimately personal songs and add real value to them as opposed to mere reverence? The answer is not quite. Clearly both artists love the music of this troubled genius whose tragic suicide in 2003 robbed music of one of its greatest songwriters. In addition Avett and Mayfield rightly try to bring a new sheen to these songs rather than present ""Elliott Smith Karaoke Favourites"" which is the right approach. The problem is that while it works well on a number of songs on others the fragility of Smiths damaged approach which has led his biographer to describe the musician as the ""Torment Saint"" cannot be accurately captured. As a result the intimacy of Smiths songs somehow gets lost in the process.The album starts with Mayfield leading on ""Between the bars"" Elliott Smiths most famous song. It is a respectful cover and Mayfield has a nice ghostly quality to her voice, but it is not a patch on the original. Much better is Seth Avett's lead on the Beatle-ish ""Baby Britain"" which pounds along nicely, equally his take on the superb ""Angeles"" is the albums highlight where everything is stripped back to his sensitive vocal and plaintive guitar. Indeed it is Avett's versions which generally shine most brightly. ""Lets get lost"" radiates affection for the original and the fragile harmonies with Mayfield hit the mark. Alternatively others like ""Twilight"" are turned into an alt country ballad by Mayfield, whereas Smiths original was one of his most personal vocal performances with one of his greatest recorded hushed, layered vocal delivery. To be fair to Mayfield she bounces back with an excellent ""Angel in the Snow"" but the attempt to ""rock up"" the acoustic rage of ""Roman Candle"" misses by miles. Avett closes the album with ""Memory Lane"" which is one of Smiths most desperate songs. It deals with his time in a treatment centre ( ""this is the place you end up when you lose the chase."") but one he wrapped up in the sweetest of guitar melodies, giving the song a sense of irony. Avett alternatively treats it as a melancholy piano ballad accompanied by strings and largely pulls it off, closing a interesting album and worthy project.To stress again the two artists involved have toiled over a labour of love with this album and if some of it doesn't work that is because Smith was such a unique generational voice that he is almost impossible to cover. Thus while this reviewer would not swap any of the songs on this album for the originals, Avett and Mayfield's covers are undoubtedly worthy of investigation and if they lead you to the source of this inspiration it will be a job well done.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UIBC2X7Z3JMO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S8DVVW2#wasThisHelpful","R1UIBC2X7Z3JMO","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following previous albums where she managed to raise the bar on just about every release Laura Marling goes electric and points towards a new phase of songwriting. There is no longer any need to debate the importance of Marling to contemporary British music. She is one of our most revered artists who at this rate will have accumulated a massive body of stupendous work by the time she is forty. For the duration of this new album ""Short Movie"", Laura Marling remains firmly enconsed in Los Angeles and has sought to slow down her hectic rush to release music. The result is another tremendous album but one that doesn't quite match the sheer grandeur of its predecessor ""Once I was an Eagle"" or her best album to date ""I speak because I can"". (In this reviewers humble opinion).Still any music from Laura Marling is a real treat and there are great songs present. Opener ""Warrior"" has a Laurel Canyon feel to it under the electronic atmospherics and is a powerful start. The second song is ""False Hope"" which sees Marling gravitate in the direction of the musical arena which P.J. Harvey has dominated. It shows Her completely comfortable and at ease with a more brittle edged rock feel. Other tracks like the wistful acoustics of ""Feel your love"" could have happily sat on previous albums and as ever the vocals are delicious. Not all is well as the approach of ""talking"" the lyrics of ""Strange"" with a American twang creeping into proceedings does grate slightly and while the moodiness of ""Howl"" creates an interesting almost ""Indian"" sounding vibe, it is not her best work.Much better is the playful title track where Marling starts with self deprecation ""I got up in the world today/Wondered who it was I could save/Who do you think you are?/Just a girl that can play guitar"". Equally the slow blues of ""Don't let it bring you down"" is beautifully discursive and powers up throughout. Those smitten with the acoustic heartbreak and laments of previous albums will find more exquisite songs in this tradition especially the poignant ""Walk alone"" a clear standout which is nearly matched by the jaunty acoustics of the wonderful ""How can I"". It is great to see Marling branching out in new directions and in ""Gurdjieff's Daughter"" she has penned a song that shows a clear path for the future. It is sort of Mark Knopfler meets Fiona Apple and is strangely compelling.""Short Movie"" shows no halt in the forward march of Laura Marling. While it does lack the conceptual strength and seamless power of ""Eagle"", there is plenty here to confirm what a mature artist Marling has become. On balance you sense that ""Short Movie"" may be the starting point or a transition into different forms of musical exploration. Marling like all great artists will undoubtedly take some significant forks in the road both now and into the future. With music of this quality it will be a journey that will be challenging but massively rewarding.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9I8BUPUPDH12/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R8SN5U4#wasThisHelpful","R9I8BUPUPDH12","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All the signals were present on the recent Staves EP Blood I Bled that they were raising their game and producing a much fuller sound. Part of this undoubtedly derives from the move from Watford to Wisconsin, or to be more precise Justin Vernons (Bon Iver) studio in the remote and snowy outskirts beyond the city of Eau Claire.On this second album If I Was the sisters have produced another gorgeous album of folk rock with those voices that stand comparison to First Aid Kit and Laura Marling. It is a reflective and wintry album, slightly at odds with the first blooming of spring. but those close harmonies bring enough sunshine to the listener. The rousing opening track Blood I bled comes from the aforementioned EP and has nice echoes of the Fleet Foxes. It is followed by Steady which the band describe as a Frankenstein's monster, stitched together from one of Jessica's melodies and a chorus Camilla had been knocking around for more than a year. It is excellent and while Vernons fingerprints are all over its backing atmospherics the sisters make it one of the most mature songs they have penned to date. The plaintive heartbreak love song No me, no you, no more is as still as the snow falling and segues beautifully into the gentle acoustics of Let me down. Other songs like the single Black and White take new directions and is a tougher rockier affair than those which precede it. Another Teeth White just about stays on the right side of sounding like a First Aid Kit cover.The three part harmonies on Don't you call me anymore are to die for, while the gloriously wistful Make it Holy has that military sounding backbeat that Vernon employed with great effect on the second Bon Iver LP. There are points on the album when the sheer sweetness and dazzling harmonies threaten to overcome the listener. Horizons and Sadness don't own me veer in this direction but somehow the sisters pull off fine results. Best of all is Damn it all. It is certainly the most produced track on the album but it is a truly excellent song that builds to a huge crescendo.If I was comes out on the same day that one of The Staves spiritual heirs Laura Marling releases her new album. Both were once pigeon holed in the ""nu folk"" bracket but have broken free of the shackles of this label. The Staves have are still musically finding their way but this album shows a huge step forward in confidence and maturity. It is most pleasing to report that in the journey from their eponymous debut to this well recorded follow up, there is no evidence of a sophomore slump to report.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C1IERYYFHCUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TGDL4Y8#wasThisHelpful","R3C1IERYYFHCUT","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"From Melbourne Australia, we are gifted the wonderful Courtney Barnett. Strangely her debut album appears to be Number One in Amazon's ""grunge"" chart. To say this does a disservice is the same as saying the last day of the Six Nations was dull. Barnett's music is much more in the tradition of Stephen Malkmus than Eddie Vedder. It is populated with a dry wit that can take some of everyday life's most mundane situations and turn them into brilliant observational pop. The clues were there in her previous EPs not least the echoes of Syd Barrett in ""Avant Gardener"", undoubtedly the greatest pop song ever written about an anaphylactic shock.""Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit."" is a blast of fresh air and melodic sunshine from a far-off continent. Barnett's Australian accent is not disguised and her songs are full of smart observational lines and quirky titles. She has melodies to spare and enough savvy to tip a wink to commercialism. Thus the opener ""Elevator Operator"" has fine pop sensibility amongst its angular lines where Barnett comes across like an Antipodean Justine Frischmann. It is brilliant but blown out of the water by the rocking single ""Pedestrian at best"" where Barnett's lyrics triumph. In the chorus she exclaims ""Put me on a pedestal and I'll only disappoint you/Tell me I'm exceptional, I promise to exploit you/Give me all your money, and I'll make some origami, honey/I think you're a joke, but I don't find you very funny"". It is one of those must hear songs that only come along once in a while. In a perfect world it would top the charts. Amazingly the album does not sag after this high point. The sardonic and slowly drifting seven minutes of ""Small Poppies"" never loses interest although the economy of the joyous ""Aqua Profunda!"" proves that less is more. Equally ""Debbie Downer"" tucked away at the end of the album is all swirling organs and a gorgeous pop melody which Best Coast must have missed along the way. Any song with the title ""Dead fox"" is going to arouse curiosity. It also provides Barnett with a chance to come over as a female Lou Reed and again record another first in penning the best song ever recorded about roadkill. Her preoccupations are undoubtedly Australian, but the observations are universal.This is a swaggering, confident and often very funny debut album from a performer destined to be embraced by those with an ear for a ""sharp tune"". This applies whether she is echoing an artist like P J Harvey on songs like ""Nobody Really Cares If You Don't Go to the Party"" or doing 'serious"" with the existential roar of ""Kim's Caravan"" providing a guitar squall that fellow natives The Drones would be proud of. Courtney Barnett has arrived and produced an exhilarating debut album. The one liners consistently hit the bulls eye. In ""Depreston"" she tours a ""California bungalow in a cul-de-sac."" and offers the advice that ""If you've got a spare half a million/You could knock it down/and start rebuilding"". Overall this wonderful debut is full of self-effacing reflection, pinpoint irony and songs to ensure that the download button has a busy evening. In short the ultimate slacker turns into the ""Wizard of Oz"".","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TDNEPTACBELF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSL4DA6#wasThisHelpful","R1TDNEPTACBELF","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It is less than 12 months ago that the Chicago musician and guitar wunderkid Ryley Walker released his debut album ""All Kinds of You"". This record was a musical stake in the ground announcing a huge talent who could tap prime sources like Bert Jansch and John Renbourn yet make music that ticked all the boxes for a modern audience. This follow up album ""Primrose Green"" sees Walker breath out and particularly start to reference great songwriters like Tim Buckley and John Martyn. In doing so we see the development of his expressionist vocal style and emerging proof that despite all the obvious influences at play Walker is incrementally moving onto his own ground and will be a major force in modern music.""Primrose Green"" starts with gusto on the exuberant title track with its clear 60s vibe. Behind Walker are a set of seasoned Chicago jazz musicians who colour in all the relevant shades across the this album not least the wonders of double bassist Anton Hatwich. Nowhere is this more evident than on the standout ""Summer Dress"" which harks back to the fusion of folk, blues and jazz that owes a debt to Tim Buckley's ""Starsailor"". The rolling guitar motif of ""Same minds"" is well executed while ""Griffiths Buck's Blues"" will have any technical guitarists scratching their heads in wonder. There are echoes of Nick Drake on the jazzy ballad ""Love can be cruel"" while another standout ""On the banks of the old Kishwaukee"" introduces summer sunshine into proceedings. Walker also lets rip on electric guitar on the powerful ""Sweet Satisfaction"" a song, which could point the way ahead for a new direction in for his music, although it does echo John Martyn's ""I'd rather be the devil"". Finally the acoustic strum of ""Hide in the Roses"" brings gentle closure to proceedings with Walkers expressive vocals sounding almost British in origin.Ryley Walker is not as yet the finished product and is still seeking his own ""sound"". Accusations could be levelled of him that he could tip over into derivative territory if he continues to plunder these influences. Equally his lyrics do not always match the wonders of the music. And yet there is promise on this sophomore album in overflowing abundance. ""Primrose Green"" is an exceedingly fine piece of music by musicians who love to ply their trade. When all the mighty forces link together for Ryley Walker he will be unstoppable.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCH9PQY6ZOG7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RUT38KS#wasThisHelpful","RCH9PQY6ZOG7N","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thankfully with his seventh ""official"" album ""Carrie and Lowell"" one of America's greatest singer songwriters returns to peak form. Sufjan Stevens has recorded an album, which is about coming to terms with love, loss, regret and a son yearning for a mother he never really knew. It is a record about bereavement, the randomness of life and will deeply resonate with anyone who knows the difficulty of closure and the search for hope. As subject matters go it is not the usual warp and weft of popular music but Stevens is not the usual pop artist. ""Carrie and Lowell"" comes fully formed as a 10 song suite of beauty and meditation. In his fascinating recent interview with Uncut, Stevens also stressed an important caveat. As he stated ""I'm not exploiting my misery- if that's how it seems I have failed as an artist"".The album sees Stevens returning to that crystalline wintry indie folk of the ""Seven Swans"" era. It starts with ""Death in dignity"" a lilting gorgeous lament where he reflects ""Spirit of my silence I can hear you/But I'm afraid to be near you"". It is followed by ""Should have known better"" which must rank as one of his greatest songs. It tells the tale of an incident when his mentally troubled and alcoholic mother abandoned her four-year old boy in a video store. It builds from acoustic beauty to a repeat chorus so beloved of his approach on ""Illinoise"". In effect both these two opening songs set the template for the album with prospective reviewers scrambling for new words to describe the utter loveliness but also the hurt contained herein.Perhaps the most ""upbeat"" song is ironically entitled ""Drawn to blood"" full of religious imagery and biblical allusion. It is the ""Fourth of July"" however, which stops the listener in their tracks. Underpinned by repeating percussive keyboard cycles it is the albums most beautiful song cut from the same mould as the ""Owl and Tanager"". Here he questions those childhood angelic perceptions of parents as sits next to his mothers deceased body. ""Sitting at the with the halo at you head/Was it all a disguise like junior high?/Where everything was fiction, future and predication/Now where am I? My fading supply"" He repeats the words ""we're all gonna die"" until the song dwindles to silence. The remaining tracks are all first class including the bitter sweet ""The only thing"" and the stunning hymn like ""No shade in the shadow of the cross"". Here Stevens references his own personal demons including the devastating line ""There's blood on that blade/F*** me, I'm falling apart/ My assassin, like Casper the ghost/There's no shade in the shadow of the cross"".The past few years have been frustrating for those who subscribe to the view that Sufjan Stevens is the most unique and original musician ""treading the boards"" in modern music. The multifarious bleeps, electronica and 25 minute mini symphonies of 2010's ""Age of Adz"" marked an album of incredible highs combined with the sound of failed experimentation, while last years self-indulgent Sisyphus collaboration was a huge misstep. In ""Carrie and Lowell"" he is back to his best with an album of exquisite beauty. It is a deeply personal and brilliant record and will deeply resonate if the pain of grief has touched you. Ultimately his key theme is to dedicate his songs to those we love yet who elude us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R104BEBSZN98UV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S24RSBK#wasThisHelpful","R104BEBSZN98UV","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music of Willy Vlautin has been described as ""The Great American road novel in music"". This is even more apt nowadays as Vlautin has himself become an accomplished author chronicling the hardships and heartaches of everyday life with a writing style that is highly evocative of the American West. His band Richmond Fontaine have of course ploughed a similar furrow in their dusty Americana in great albums like 2006's ""Post to Wire"". The Delines and this new album ""Colfax"" is a side project from this work although it does not mark a radical departure. The band has been formed by Vlautin to showcase songs with a country soul bent and also the wonderful voice of vocalist Amy Boone from the band The Damnations who inhabits and owns all these tracks with a combination of toughness and vulnerability, Also coming along for the ride is Jenny Conlee from The Decemberists as well as fellow Portlanders Sean Oldham and Tucker Jackson.The album has echoes of last years brilliant Son Volt album ""Honky Tonk"". It is eleven tales of languid country songs with a first class honours degree in dissecting rundown bars, back roads, dirty motels and the half light of the canyon. Into this backdrop you add the hardy perennials of liquor, drugs and failed relationships. Vlautin is a master storyteller and these songs are actually some of his more accessible with the soulful elements of Boone's voice taking them into a different sphere. The songs are uniformly great. The slow country blues of opener ""Calling in"" effectively sets the tone for the reminder of the album. Songs like ""The Oil Rigs at Night"" have a sultry character not usually to be found in Vlautin's work. The excellent ""I won't slip up"" could be happily covered by Tom Waits, but even more so the gentle piano bar room ballad ""Sandman's Coming"". The track ""State Line"" is effortless alternative country with Boone coming over as a cross between Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline. The track which showcases her voice best is the hugely atmospheric ""Flight 31"" which sees Boone aboard a flight to Toronto and telling her hard luck lullaby. Finally in the excellent ""Wichita Ain't So Far Away"" she pleads for her estranged lover to return and declares ""that night don't feel like a prison light when your with me"".Frankly Vlautin can write this stuff in his sleep. The great news is that he is actually getting more accomplished as the years pass. ""Colfax"" is a real pearl of an album full of haunted romanticism and people dealing with the problems that dominate our daily existence combined our alarming propensity to make them much worse. An album recommended with hesitation or doubt.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGITEPDG43DME/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JLDSNBK#wasThisHelpful","RGITEPDG43DME","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh this is splendid stuff! Ryley Walker is a 24 year-old singer/songwriter and guitarist from Chicago. His debut album ""All Kinds of You"" is out now on the Tompkins Square and while he may hail from the Mid West his musical centre of gravity could more accurately be located at The Trades Club in Hebden Bridge. Walker wears his influences on his sleeve and they are largely British in origin. In this album echoes of John Renbourn, Davy Graham and the master Bert Jansch are scattered over the grooves (so of course is the American style of John Fahey). In vocal terms it is variants of the two ""Tim's"" namely Hardin and Buckley that abound.It starts with the passion of ""West Wind"" all swirling riffs and gusto, and then quietens for the lovely ""Blessing"" a song about the pain of loss with vibes of Jansch's music stamped all over it. The mood lightens considerably on ""Twin Oaks Part I"" where Walker shows his tremendous guitar picking skills and then moves into one of the album standouts. ""Great River Road"" is a travelling song, a tale of a journey around the mid West following the Mississippi through Wisconsin and Minnesota'. Like his great contemporary Sam Amidon Walker takes old templates and revitalises them, with this song setting out his refreshing personal vision. Mentions in dispatches should also go to the epic baroque folk of ""Clear the Sky"", the weaving folk blues of ""Fonda"" with its exquisite guitar and piano lines, then finally the instrumental joy de vivre of the concluding track ""Tanglewood Spaces"" draws the curtain down with a fitting closing.At such a young age Walker is a musician to watch. His vocal style is not quite entirely his own as yet but that will come. His guitar playing alternatively is masterly and on the evidence of ""All Kinds of You"" who knows what great heights he will scale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R67YQYW70URNM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3SW1CQ#wasThisHelpful","R67YQYW70URNM","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was becoming obvious around the time of Sharon Van Etten's 2010 release ""Epic"" that we were witnessing the journey of a singer songwriter from obscurity to major league contender. Van Etten's last album ""Tramp"" verged on magical with songs to tussle with, live with and eventually fall in love with. She has never been shy to share her deepest emotions but on this new album she lays herself bare. ""Are we there"" represents a troubling emotional crash put to music. It is the story of a relationship wrecked by the demands of career and dark hints of abuse. Instrumentally the album is her most piano based yet and whilst the songs are about hurt they are nevertheless accessible and uniformly great. The opener ""Afraid of Nothing"" starts with a simple piano note, a lightly chiming guitar and a brilliant vocal from Van Etten. It is great song and draws you back time after time but better is to follow.  The real killer track on the album is ""Your Love is killing me"" a staggering six minutes plus of musical catharsis.  It commences with a funereal organ and oozes raw power from the off and what about those lyrics? They are littered with anger and regret not least ""When I let you walk over me/You tell me that you like it/You love me as you torture me/You told me that you liked it"". Not since ""Blood on the Tracks"" has a wrecked relationship been charted with such devastating force.The fireworks, which follow, are not as explosive but there is great music to be discovered. The gentle ballad ""Our Love"" is almost sweet by comparison, yet even here she confesses that ""I'm reliving my own hell / someone throws the ladder down / Still don't know what I have found in our love."" After listening to the excellent ""I love you but I'm lost"" this reviewer now understands why Van Etten is often described as a cross between Joni Mitchell and P J Harvey. Her music touches the deepest theme of heartache yet always has an edge. Van Etten's use of the National's Aaron Dresner as producer adds to this not least on the pounding grandeur of ""You know me well"" and the aching beauty of the exquisite aching piano ballad ""I Know"".  Van Etten does end the album on a lighter note with ""Every time the sun comes up"" where she cheekily questions ""People say I'm a one-hit wonder, but what happens when I have two? The track fades out, as captures Van Etten finally breaking into laughter, a final moment of light relief to cap all the preceding drama.""Are We There,"" confirms Sharon Van Etten as one of the cream of the crop amongst the current lavish abundance of great American female artists.

"3.5 starsSinger Joseph Arthur was a friend of Lou Reed and like the experience of others the death of great man hit him hard. Thus this new album ""Lou"" is personal tribute although Arthur's notes to the album shows that he is keenly aware of the danger of about turning Reed's passing into an opportunity. His template is therefore largely acoustic and low key, driven mainly by guitar and piano. It throws up covers of some of Reed's most famous songs with varying degrees of success.On initial listens there is the concern that there potential train wreck about to happen not least if the first experience of this album is to drop your record needle on Arthur's performance of ""Heroin"". Frankly it sounds like a parlour game where someone has spookily challenged him to sing Lou Reed in the style of Neil Diamond! Repeated listens see improvement but it is disconcerting all the same. Much better is an excellent version of the underrated ""NYC Man"" from ""Set the Twilight Reeling"" where Arthur firmly imprints his own stamp on the song. Equally while ""Satellite of Love"" is no where near the brilliance of the original the stripped back version here is respectful and distinctive. The baroque swirl of the Velvets ""Stephanie Says"" is injected with a new sensitivity by Arthur and is hugely enjoyable.This reviewer rates Reed's 1989 ""New York"" album as one of his best and a reason for this is the song ""Dirty Boulevard"". It is one of Reed's great New York tapestries of drugs, decay and poverty based on a street character Pedro who lives out of the Wiltshire Hotel. Reed's original has a great crunchy riff and you can feel the all the characters located in the New York squalor. Arthur's version is nice enough yet all the elements that made the song so special are largely absent in his version. Finally what about the ubiquitous ""Walk on the Wild Side""? It takes a brave artist to cover a song quite so famous. Arthur however does a sterling job, he strips it back to a straight piano ballad without the no ""coloured girls"" backing and largely pulls it off. As the most well known Reed songs on the album it is a shop window for others although it is the less well-known songs like ""Sword of Damocles"" and nice reinterpretations like ""Wild Child"" that fare best on this collection.Joseph Arthur is a multi talented artist and performer and there is no doubt that ""Lou"" is a heartfelt genuine tribute to an artist he loved. Arthur has chosen a range of songs particularly some of the lesser known from later albums which actually do them great service. The problem comes however covering songs so associated with Reed that anything else does not quite suffice. ""Lou"" then is a sincere album undertaken for the best of reasons and while there are couple of serious missteps to navigate it would be harsh to overly punish these.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30XB3LID7JOB0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IU6HQO4#wasThisHelpful","R30XB3LID7JOB0","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone who heard Owen Pallet's last album ""Heartland"" knows the meaning of true love. It restored your faith in music. True you had to cut through the bizarre concept behind it of a themed album about an ultra-violent farmer named Lewis in the fictional world of Spectrum. Yet a number of other great albums have silly concepts, indeed it is understood that the Beatles recorded one? Pallet is a violinist par excellence and a musician not unlike Sufjan Stevens who is renown for orchestration which has underpinned some of the work of the Butlers in that Canadian beat combo Arcade Fire. More a composer than pop star Pallet has gone more conventional for this 2014 album ""In Conflict"" with no concept other than the strength of the songs.On balance ""In conflict"" is a much darker beast that ""Heartland"". there is nothing on her that makes you punch the air with the sheer exhilaration such as the greatest song of 2010 ""Lewis takes his shirt off"". that is not to say that the album is not rewarding. Opener ""I'm not afraid"" is a complex pop structure with a piano segment that sounds like ""Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence"" and Pallet's lush vocal delivery. The title track is kind of Rufus Wainwright meets Beach House affair and full of sumptuous layered melodies. A track like a ""Song for five or Six"" is possibly the nearest thing here that could have fitted on Heartland with its complex synths and pounding orchestration. The highlight however is a song that is gloriously simple and entitled ""Passions"". If this were a beautiful girl it would completely turn your head. Detailing some of Pallet's most personal reflections to date at one point he regretfully reflects that ""As we try to get it on in bed/ you've given me your home and head/ You put on The Queen is Dead/ But I just want to talk instead/ Compassion, compassion"". Perhaps the notoriously celibate Morrissey has that effect during copulation although the song itself is a thing of beauty. Others like ""Riverbed"" do echo the instrumental force of bands like Grizzly Bear. Sadly not all of it works ""Internal Fantasy"" for example sees the synths drown out Pallet's vocal and it all feels rather messy, whilst the ""Sky behind the Flag"" sounds like a song that Godley and Creme might have considered for a B Side.If you approach ""In Conflict"" as a straightforward comparison with ""Heartland"" the latter played the stronger hand. Yet this is Owen Pallet the gifted composer, the voice of an angel and musical polymath. He is never dull and frequently sublime. This album may lack the cohesion and joy de vivre of its illustrious predecessor but it is damn fine music and will serve well until this wonderful composer finally paints his inevitable masterpiece.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RATAB5FSTDNSF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IG2ZEQO#wasThisHelpful","RATAB5FSTDNSF","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lee Bains III and the Glory Fires are to be located in a proud linage of Southern Rock that stands in the tradition of the Allman Brothers to the Drive by Truckers. There first album ""There is a bomb in Gilead"" tickled this reviewers fancy not least soul stews like ""Opelika"" and the gentle alt country of ""Roebuck County"". Bains new album ""De-reconstructed"" is an altogether noisier and scuzzy affair somewhat akin to being hit over the head with a pool cue in a bar room fight. Here the bass is way down in the mix and guitars are so ragged that that they could chop wood. First track up ""Company Man"" takes no prisoners and would rouse the local environmental health department out of its lethargy if played on high volume. If anything the title track is even louder with echoes of the souther R&B of the Black Crowes and demonstrating real fire in the belly of this band. In this uproarious mix the band ponder the troubling question of what is the modern Southern Identity, the dichotomy of magnolia sweetness and meth labs. In songs like the ferocious ""Burnpiles, Swimming holes"" they come across like a mix of vintage Rolling Stones and the Stooges. When the whole thing slows down and takes a pause at the sixth track ""Whats good and gone"" its almost a blessed relief to pause for breath although that ignores the brilliant pile driving ""The Weed Downtown"" which immediately precedes it and is an album standout.""Flags"" is designed to revisit the turbulent hot spots of Southern history not least the journey from the antebellum South to women's clinic bombings. It is a rough and tumble, almost punk rock three minute anthem of a wonderful cacophony of noise. Finally the swampy ""Mississippi Brother-land"" shows that Mr Bains knows his Patterson Hood songbook well, whilst the last song ""Dirt Track"" is a funky old thing with a bit of a Tumbling Dice vibe thrown in for good measure. ""De-reconstructed"" is a nasty, noisy album full of heat and burning light conclusively demonstrating that the South will rise again. If you like your rock 'n' roll as dirty as a NFL game in a thunderstorm stop here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGH7M85FWUXT7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY30L7W#wasThisHelpful","RGH7M85FWUXT7","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Speaking honesty the development of Conor Oberst has not been the happiest of journeys. Hie early Bright Eyes material promised so much that the ""new Dylan"" label was thrown around with abandon, here was songwriting talent destined for musical greatness. Thus an album like ""Lifted (Or this is where the story is)"" seemed to prefigure impending sainthood. When ""I'm Wide Awake its Morning"" came alone the stars aligned and Oberst completely nailed it, but since then ....""disappointing"" is the word. This applies to his work since 2007 not least horrible albums like ""Outer South"" and while many speak warmly of the ""The People's Key"" it has been played so little on this reviewers ""stereo"" that it should received loneliness counselling in the CD rack.Whatever happened to emotional intensity of Oberst's earlier work is a matter for musical detectives but does this new solo album at last show that there is life left in the old dog? ""Upside Down Mountain"" is often a charming and wistful album with an smattering of excellent songs but also some pretty average fare. The song ""Hundreds of Ways"" was the pre release from the album and is all jolly alt country with Oberst's trademark vocals and themes of death and socio paths. It is fine but nothing to write home about. The same sentiments apply to ""Enola Gay"" where Oberst tells us that this ""world is neat and getting neater too""and this is from the man who wrote ""Lua""? On other songs like the ponderous ""Lonely at the top"" Oberst's reflections on love lead to you to reflect that perhaps he should just go out sink a bottle of Jack Daniels and get over himself. With lyrics like ""Freedom is the opposite of love/ you will never keep it through the paranoia"" its like listening to musing of a precocious teenager who has just discovered Proust.Thankfully there are enough songs here to keep the faith in Oberst's talents. The brilliant opener ""Time forget"" is one of his best songs in years with that latent regret of which he is master of placing into its words. Equally ""Artefact No 1"" has slightly Elliot Smith feel to it and is truly lovely. The standout however is the excellent ""Desert Island Questionnaire"" packed full of echo and great lyrics. Alongside this is the pop sensibility of ""Zigzagging towards the light"" you feel that redemption may still be within his grasp. By any standards ""Upside Down Mountain"" shows that its worth staying the course with Oberst. With the red hot Jonathan Wilson at the control desk, plus the charms of Swedish wonders First Aid Kit on a couple of tracks there is enough to engage and retain interest. The best parts of this album heavily outweigh the weaknesses and whilst not a return to the stellar standards of earlier works the spark is still contained within","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34X04HQ7VDZJJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IRJHIRE#wasThisHelpful","R34X04HQ7VDZJJ","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"t was obvious to anyone who listened to the excellent ""Pale Sun Rose"" and ""Out of the Darkness, the two pre released tracks from Matthew and the Atlas new album ""Other Rivers"" that a overt change in direction was occurring. Riding on the irresistible wave of Nu-Folk gave Matthew Hegarty and Co a fashionable sheen for a while. But the band has wisely decided to jump from that rapidly sinking ship and take an electronic turn that places them somewhat closer to the Wild Beasts than Mumford and Sons albeit with a much lower vocal range.The dramatic electronic hymnal ""Everyone dies"" contains enough of the folk tinged appeal of the old band but is combined with Moby styled synthesized backbeats. The song builds to a huge crescendo as Hegarty repeatedly chants ""you said everyone you know, one day ill surely die/but everything that dies in some way returns'. The haunting ballad ""Another Way"" featuring Matt Corby showcases the rough timbre of Hegarty's distinctive throaty vocal and his powerful evidence of his song writing prowess. Other highlights include the pulsating album standout ""Counting Paths"" which reeks of a ghostly atmosphere, whilst the anthem melodies of ""To the North"" could trouble the charts if released as a single. There are a couple of points on the second part of the album that doesn't quite live up to the excellence of the first but taken as a whole this long awaited debut is well worth a musical peek inside.Those who loved the folky knees up of previous songs like the exuberant ""I will Remain"" may be deeply disappointed by ""Other Rivers"", but sit and listen a while to that great smoky voice of Hegarty and his slow burn emotive music and try not to be impressed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21XAT0VZLN3ND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JOE4H4S#wasThisHelpful","R21XAT0VZLN3ND","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Laura Veirs last album was the child friendly traditional songs of ""Tumble Bee"" which had it moments but was aimed at a very specific audience. In one sense then ""Warp and Weft"" is her first proper album since the summer pastures of 2009's wonderful ""July Flame"". If you don't own, or have yet to hear the title track or ""Make something good"" the lovely duet with My Morning Jacket's Jim James then seek medical help. This is the Portland's singers ninth album and one of her best. James is back guesting on the album. as are the two chanteuses Neko Case and K D Lang plus fellow North Westerners the Decemberists. The most immediate impression of this album is that its a much less laid back affair than ""July Flame"". Electric guitars and punchy solos punctuate many of the songs and there is even a slice of Alice Coltrane style jazz in ""White Cherry"" which has the considerable merit of being highly listenable. It's mantra, of ""Abundant life, that's this life."" closes an album of true wonders.Back at the beginning is the acoustic ""Sun Spot"" with Neko Case making an impressive guest appearance. It does reprise some ""July Flame"" sounds and is a sterling start with Veirs vocal mixing soft and grit, combined with great electric guitar backing and strings that take it out with a bang. The next song ""America"" is essentially a rock song with a grungy bass. It is much harder fare than Veirs usual template and enters the heated debate on gun control when she observes ""Everybody's packing heat in America / Training their barrels on the city streets of America"". The great storytelling of ""Dorothy of the Island"" is a real standout punctuated with a rocking guitar solo although the haunting ""Shape Shifter"" matches it with high emotion as Veirs sings about the approach of cold frost and winter. The welcoming title of ""Say Darlin Say"" betrays a jagged song with a edgy guitar motif, while ""That Alice"" is good old folk rock with a guitar solo straight out of the Crazy horse songbook. An Asian tinge impinges on the straightforward Americana of the stellar ""Sadako Folding Cranes,"". The songs beauty almost defies its terrible subject matter as Veirs has coined a ballad about Hiroshima bomb victim Sadako Sasaki that tracks the terror faced by this infant as ""She is blown out of the window/She is two years old/This is our cry, this is our prayer."". The penultimate track ""Ten Bridges"" is more of the type of gentle folk lyricism that is Veirs calling card and offers a nice breathing space as the album draws to a close.Veirs has stated recently that ""this record is an exploration of extremes - deep, dark suffering and intense, compassionate love."" It was recorded while she was pregnant and contains all those hopes and dark fears that respectively inspire and haunt prospective parents. It amounts to a record for which she should be immensely proud as it is by far her most satisfying album to date packed with expertly crafted songs for your listening pleasure.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SZIYKNA1W2UG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DRCYCDY#wasThisHelpful","R1SZIYKNA1W2UG","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"California singer songwriter Julia Holter is three albums in and improving on each outing. ""Loud City Song"" is the album where she paints a much more accessible musical canvass. This does not diminish the fact that this is a complex and often celestial work which demonstrates a sharp musical mind at work. Those who own her previous albums respectively ""Tragedy"" and ""Eckstasis"" will generally approve of this new one since it rekindles some of the best moments contained in those records and develops them further. In doing so she has not lost her cutting edge and songs like the fragmentary avant garde jazz of ""Maxim's II"" will still leave the listener scratching their head and wondering what chemical aids were its source inspiration. It is a song easier to admire and love but there is plenty here in this album that draws its inspiration from the 1958 film adaptation of French novella `Gigi' to swoon over. Take the hauntingly beautiful ""He is running through my eyes"" where Holters whispery angelic voice shimmers across a tragic slow piano driven tale and that leaves you desperately wanting more. Its the sort of song that Kate Bush once used to write although its doubtful that she ever quite managed a opener like ""World"". This song is anchored by multi track vocals and barely seems to move its pace is so mesmerising. As the brass and string backing rise up all you can do is be dragged into its intimate meditation.Holter is no stranger to covers not least her glorious version of Fleetwood Mac's ""Gold Dust Woman"" which she effectively deconstructed on Mojo's ""Rumours Revisited album"". Here she tackles ""Hello Stranger"", a 1963 hit single by R&B singer Barbara Lewis. It is one of the best songs of career thus far. Over a floating soundtrack of a wall of synths her voice echoes out like an enchanted sweet siren dragging you towards the musical rocks, with the tune exercising a vice like grip on your sensibilities. It is wonderful stuff and the album highlight. On another level ""This is a true heart"" is also unique for Holter easily marking her most commercial pop song to date. This reviewer hated ""In the Green Wild"" with a passion on first listens with its almost humorous spoken lyric over jazzy bass lines, but at the halfway point it morphs into an entirely different song with Holter's pop sensibility again at the forefront. After repeated plays the song crushes any resistance. The severity of ""Horns surrounding me"" is again one of Holters more darkly challenging moments although it is not beyond redemption. Finally the closing seven minutes plus of ""City Appearing"" is almost a summation of the whole album, at times playful and sweet, at others times stately and then a descent into a powerful post rock climax.In ""Loud City Song"" Julia Holter has created an album that bewilders, surprises, beguiles and passionately stirs. She is an artist to be spoken of in the same breath as Julianna Barwick and Johanna Newsom. As such she may attract and repel in equal measure. This album however is her most mainstream work thus far and will be drooled over by critics for the artists audacity in mixing everything from cacophonous climaxes to ethereal ghostly soundscapes. If austerity is biting perhaps the un-initiated may wish to try it out before purchase through a internet network. For those already smitten it awaits your rapt attention.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGBU240OL2GUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D6762TW#wasThisHelpful","RGBU240OL2GUO","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It was no less that the great Damien Jurado who recently stated that ""When I die, I want to be buried with my Glen Campbell record collection. That's how much I love Glen Campbell"". It's a sentiment many share and fully endorse. There is no need to dwell here on the fact that this is Campbell's 65th album and that he has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's realistically curtailing any significant further musical output. Some may also point that it re-treads familiar ground in revisiting his greatest hits. But it is the nature of the return to these classics that makes this record so special. It was Johnny Cash in American Recordings who set the template for such records and in ""See you there"" initially recorded during the 2011 ""Ghost On The Canvas"" sessions, Campbell has matched that standard. This is no maudlin outing that dwells on his debilitating condition but a celebration of some of the greatest songs penned in pop music sung by one of its most distinctive and best voices.In one sense this is Glen Campbell for the alternative country generation. Nowhere is this clearer than on his take of Jimmy Webb's greatest song ""Wichita Linesman"". The original lush string arrangement is absent and instead Campbell sings it as a barroom ballad. His voice still sounds like musical honey and the depth that comes through age adds a juggernaut sized level of poignancy to a great performance. Those other Webb classics are equally well done. ""By the time I get to Phoenix"" is stripped back to gentle acoustics with the odd strain in Campbell's performance adding to the songs sense of regret. ""Galveston"" is even more bare bones with the slide guitar and accordion lending it a much more contemplative and reflective feel.The sterling producers of this record, Dave Darling and Dave Kaplan, have recognised that the key instrument on the album must be Campbell's voice, thus the excellent version of ""There's no me... without you"" from the last album works brilliantly. The most radical overhaul is on ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" which is given a Neil Young style arrangement underpinned with a basic distorted electric guitar strummed in the background and it succeeds. The version of ""Gentle on my mind"" does suffer somewhat from the clipped vocal delivery that Campbell employs but its solid enough. The almost Roy Orbison style dramatics conveyed on the original ""Hey little one"" are replaced by a much more mellow tone, yet at aged 77 Campbell's ability to hit those high true notes is just remarkable. This reviewer has never been a huge fan of the song ""True Grit"" but at last this version captures it in a pure country setting and is a big highlight on an album packed with them. The one new song on the album is the religious ""Waitin on the coming of my lord"" and is a full restatement of Campbell's faith. It is the gorgeous version of ""Postcard from Paris"" that adds the icing to the musical cake, a beautiful song that finds a fresh way to spell love. For good measure on the Amazon download there are three additional versions of the songs on ""See you there"" with ""Waitin on the coming of my lord"" given a full Mariachi treatment.Glen Campbell is a musician who has paid his dues and much more. He has gone through dark days and made his share of headlines. As his recording career draws to a closing chapter it would be easy to slip into pure reverence. In the same vein the context of his illness could produce condescension by awarding a sympathy mark or two. To stress however this is a superb album that sees Campbell performing in his own impeccable style with a voice that remains a wondrous instrument and conveyor of pure feeling. Some will favour the original versions of these songs, and opinions of this album may differ vastly. Yet ""See you there"" is an album of an artist determined to squeeze out all the fantastic songs he has left within him and in in doing so demonstrate that musical integrity is the mark of true greatness","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MT327OXIXX08/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CSCIZRI#wasThisHelpful","R3MT327OXIXX08","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It appears following the massive success of their debut ""Barton Hollow"" the Civil Wars decided to take their name at face value and commence an outbreak of raging hostilities. Their European tour was cancelled just about as they were to perform in Cardiff (the unused tickets are a souvenir) due to ""internal discord and irreconcilable differences of ambition"". Watch the video for the new single ""The one that got away"" and it clear that for Joy Williams and John Paul White the one place they don't want to be is with each other.It is not essential of course that musicians like each other to make music. Fleetwood Mac, Oasis, Metallica and the Eagles are examples of bands in states of personal dysfunction that have made great records. But the Civil Wars persona went deeper, creating a stage act based on what appeared to be a platonic friendship that hinted at an even deeper chemistry. As it stands there is now no hiding from the fact that this new album is the musical equivalent of strained peace talks that have completely collapsed. What is the impact on the music?""The Civil Wars"" is a harder and darker album than its predecessor, although not a radical departure from that ethic. There were times on ""Barton Hollow"" that the sweetness threatened to engulf so this is not necessarily a bad thing. The album starts with the pounding ""One who got away"" a slice of almost Buckingham/Nicks drama underpinned by a telling story and ending with a fierce band work out. With Williams vocal dominating the lyrics tell it like is ""Oh I wish I'D never seen your face/I wish you were the one/Wish you were the one who got away"". Next up ""I had a girl"" is a piece of hard rocking swampy blues with White hinting a much tougher approach that could follow if solo status beckons. ""Oh Henry"" later in the album reinforces this. Alternatively tracks like ""Same old, same old"" tread familiar ground as an elegant if uninspired ballad. Much better is the Police sound-alike ""Dust to dust"" with lovely understated vocals by both musicians and the country swing of ""From the valley"". The quiet/loud dynamics of ""Devils Backbone"" is a highlight, which brings together all the elements that worked so well on ""Barton Hollow"". The Civil Wars have always performed excellent covers and their version of the Smashing Pumpkins ""Disarm"" may lack the drama of the original but makes up for it with the tenderest vocal performances on the album. They deconstruct Billy Corgan's song of parental angst down to the beauty of simmering gentle acoustics and it works. On the two concluding tracks we have the Civil Wars of old with Sacred Heart"" sweetly sung in French by Joy Williams and the gorgeous duet of D'Arline"" to bring it all to a conclusion.In the last analysis The Civil Wars have effectively reprised a harder version of the winning formula on their massively successful debut. On balance it works again and this is an excellent album that does feel more consistent if less immediately appealing. It does however beg the question that if all was well in the ranks of the Civil Wars where they go next without essentially repeating themselves. Sadly we shall not find out the answer since it appears that this is probably the last outing from the Civil Wars as a performing band and solo careers beckon. As such it is a fitting epitaph to a band who made their mark and whose music will endure even if they are not performing it together.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SQ5E8YT79WD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E3Q14KW#wasThisHelpful","R12SQ5E8YT79WD","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joe Pernice goes back to the future on this new Scud Mountain boys release ""Do you love the sun"". He has had more bands than Sir Chris Hoy has gold medals, not least the wonderful Pernice Brothers, Chappaquidick Skyline, Big Tobacco and the recent musical marriage made in heaven on the collaboration with Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake in the New Mendicants. It was nonetheless way back in 1996 where this songwriter of quiet genius unleashed onto the world his first band the Scud Mountain Boys and their epic ""Massachusetts"". It is an album which deserves to sit alongside the truly great alt country records like Wilco's ""Being there"" , Gillian Welch's ""Revival"", Son Volt's ""Trace"" and a host of others. If you have yet to hear ""Lift me up"" or the seminal ""Grudge ****"" your life is not complete. You will melt to Pernice's vocal and the description by NME of a ""golden voice of damaged, regret oozing from every word like wounded honey... rendering glorious the utter inevitability of failure."" still holds true.This first album then in over 17 years sees the band pick up the baton where they left it in 1996. It is an album of forlorn, weary, and congenially intimate songs underpinned with sly humour and melodies to spare.The band are Joe Pernice (vocals, acoustic and electric guitars), Stephen Desaulniers (vocals, acoustic guitar, and bass), and Bruce Tull (electric guitar, lap steel, pedal steel and they fit together like Cosmic American lego bricks. The warm harmonies of the title track set the mood with gorgeous lifting vocals carrying the track to its conclusion. The second song ""Crown of Thorns"" sounds like it could have derived from the Johnny Cash's American Recordings sessions its that good. Sung by Desaulniers it drips heartbreak and regret as a lonesome pedal steel howls in the background. The songs pass by without incident yet they creep up up on you like Clematis winding its way around your listening sub consciousness until you are caught up in its weave. Thus songs like ""Mendicant"" and the bittersweet ""Orphan Girl"" (not the Welch version) truly pay repeated listens. The uber mellow ""She falls apart"" is one of the saddest Pernice vocals put to vinyl and an album standout. This reviewer has always found John Barry's theme from the film ""Midnight Cowboy"" a haunting tune but why we need essentially a straight cover of it on this album is questionable particularly when Pernice must have an bank vault full of tunes at his disposal after all this time. It is a minor complaint and amends are made with the last two songs the plaintive ""Drew got shot"" and the pure country of the excellent ""Your Mine"" an fine album closer. Overall ""Do you love the sun"" is a short album clocking in just over 30 minutes but packed with quality. It is not known if Pernice intends to keep the Scud Mountain Boys show on the road following their return after such a long hiatus. The sincere hope is that we have not heard the last of this excellent band. These are fine tumbleweed-blown melodies backed with musicianship that is as clever as the devil and twice as pretty","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FX0D6I4KNLK8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXN3TWI#wasThisHelpful","R2FX0D6I4KNLK8","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Husker Du exploded out of the twin cities in the early 1980s and the world was never the same. In Bob Mould and Grant Hart the band contained the Lennon and McCartney of hardcore and like the Velvet Underground every one who came into contact with them formed another band. Sadly they imploded in the late eighties in a toxic mix of unresolvable creative and personal tensions between Mould and Hart. Tragically this period saw the bands manager David Savoy take his own life and Hart's various addictions expand. The rest is history and while Mould's solo career has been more high profile and successful it is good to see Hart back on top form. Many would argue he was the melodic core of Husker Du and the songs contained on this new double album ""The Argument"" do echo past glories.There is a big concept behind Hart's new album which entails reference to William Burrough's take on Milton's ""Paradise lost"" and Adam and Eve's fall from Eden. Frankly for this reviewer concept albums tend to register very high on the irritation register but to be fair to Hart whatever his intent on the records backdrop he has produced a lengthy album containing some glorious songs packed with melody some of which have a distinctively Bowie style flavour. The one that impacts immediately is ""Morning Star"" a wonderful piece of indie pop, commercial enough to be a single and demonstrating from the start that Hart is back on form. The electronica of ""If we have the will"" could have happily appeared on ""Lodger"" and its swirling organ backdrop is entrancing. A clear highlight is the song ""I will never see my home"" and regretful ballad where the limitations of Harts voice actually suit a very dark theme of portraying Satan as a lost figure cast away from his native home. There are lighter moments not least the best song Buddy Holly never wrote the pounding ""Letting me out"" and the very beautiful ""Is the sky the limit"" with its slow steady build up to a big finish. The album is a double with 20 tracks but on occasions some judicious editing would not gone amiss. ""Awake arise"" for example is the sort of dour track that all concept albums suffer from as their creators get far too involved with the source material . ""Underneath the Apple-tree"" is just plain daft with its 1920s tin pan alley feel and twee affectations. The jaunty ""Shine, shine, shine"" has also yet to impress. There are however enough goodies on offer here to counter the weaker moments. The urban blues of ""So far from heaven"" has a Beatles feel to it circa Abbey Road, while Dylan influences populate the excellent closer ""For those too high aspiring"".""The Argument"" is an ambitious and often theatrical album which sees its creator literally pouring in his heart into its construction. It is a fascinating and largely well executed album that should lead music critics to adjust the scales between him and Bob Mould, properly recognising that Hart was no mere second string. As Hart himself recently commented ""people seem to think they can't like me and like Bob's music...they have that there was this bad guy in Bob's past who was vanquished by Bob like a dragon"". It is clear from ""the Argument"" that this particular dragon still breathes fire.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R20NHFS1G9OKES/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CU8OYMK#wasThisHelpful","R20NHFS1G9OKES","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mixing country music with other genres is a risky business and many in Nashville still look askance at that wicked concept constructed through the devils work - namely country rock. Imagine then mixing country with British Dub step music or spliced with electronica? It sounds plain daft but in the hands of the tall and imposing Daughn Gibson a native of the state of Pennsylvania it is a rather dubious cocktail which brings forth a nice taste on the palate. Gibson was a former drummer in the stoner metal band Pearls & Brass for a number of years and prior to that a box packer, trucker, bookseller and no doubt on the 7th day he rested. ""Me Moan' follows his 2012 debut ""All Hell"" which this reviewer has not heard but my well seek out on the solid evidence contained here.Gibson's voice is also a central factor. The charitable will detect echoes of the great Scott Walker or Nick Cave, the less charitable will point to the resemblance to the deep tones of the lead singer with the Crash Test dummies or even an Elvis impersonator. Let us extend the milk of human kindness/reason and argue that Scott Walker is the template here. This is reinforced by the general excellence of the songwriting. Thus this album comprises great songs like the rolling pounding piano driven closer ""Into the sea"" where Gibson's voice is at its very best. Even more radical within the somewhat narrow confines of country is ""Phantom Riser"" which does a decent impression of Depeche Mode. The deconstruction of a genre continues on ""We won't climb"" which is almost a slow dance track and yet it still works proving pedal Steel and pulse drums as unlikely bedfellows. Despite the swirling backdrop a more straight forward country tack is ""Kissing on the blacktop"" where Gibson's baritone is an the forefront pushing the song forward. Mid track ""The Pisgee Nest"" is much heavier affair and sounds more like the gothic country that the Handsome Family specialises in. The penultimate track ""All my days off"" is the one that constantly draws the needle to the play button for this reviewer. It is a soft aching ballad full of regret and angst but underpinned by a lovely melody. As for the the pedal steel backdrop its almost to heartbreaking to describe.Not surprisingly not all of this works and some songs like the ""Right Signs"" sounds like Yeasayer with a deep voice. Equally some parts of this album are easier to admire than love. But full marks to Daughn Gibson for the sheer gall of his experimentation/ambition. All music fans will now wait with baited breath for his future musical output with the hope of a forthcoming country and death metal mix!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14TY340BQDEBA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00COQU0UI#wasThisHelpful","R14TY340BQDEBA","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"You have got to admire the Smith Westerns. This band from Chicago have plugged away improving from album to album with their mix of dreamy pop songs and hummable tunes. There is no showy post punk pushing the envelope with the Smith Westerns in fact if you were to find a British equivalent in terms of their music ethic then possibly the great Teenage Fanclub would come the closest. ""Soft Will"" is the bands thrid long player and their best yet. With summer around the corner and the threat of sunshine this album arrives at a particularly appropriate juncture. It is jam packed with harmonies and musical highs not least the lovely opener ""3am Spiritual"" where the band question that ""It's easier to think you're dumb/Like you were/It's easier to think you're no fun/Who would know?"". It is the type of song that Primal Scream aspire to in there poppier moments but never quite pull off. The following song ""Idol"" is even better with chunky guitar chords and infectious chorus that will burrow inside your brain like an old stoat.Highlights abound throughout the album. The slight Oasis feel to great songs like ""Best Friend"" almost send you back to the halcyon days of that bands first two albums before the horrible Beady Eye and High Flying Birds came to pester us. The song ""Glossed"" alternatively has an almost Syd Barrett era Pink Floyd ambience to it and makes for an album standout. With so much to offer on the lyrical/melodic front the instrumental ""XXIII"" does seem slightly pointless but this small slip is rectified by the heartwarming ""Varsity"" with its echoes of Phoenix. Finally the sparser sounds of ""White Oath"" wet your appetite for future outings from this power pop quartet comprising singer-guitarist Cullen Omori, his brother and bassist Cameron, guitarist Max Kakacek and drummer Julien Ehrlich. There is nothing groundbreaking or radical about ""Soft Will"" (some may also sorely miss the previous T Rex inflections) but it confirms real progression for this solid band who are coming of age. It also reminds us of far more wistful nostalgic times and puts the melody firmly back in the centre of your heart.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AKZTOU3RS3ZV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DFU5WPK#wasThisHelpful","R2AKZTOU3RS3ZV","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Anyone with an ounce of musical nous would be well advised to check out the music blog of Denver music aficionado Heather Browne aka ""I am fuel you are friends"" for regular wondrous treats (you may also wish to tip a nod to the excellent Amazon UK Reviewer ""The Wolf"" for first class honours talent spotting and a lovely review on that site). Field Report are a bunch of musicians who recently performed a Chapel Session on Heather's Blog. This is where musicians are called on an impromptu basis to perform freely distributed sessions of their albums material. Field Report recently graced said Chapel Sessions with their presence and performed three songs from their wonderful debut plus an impassioned Neil Young cover ""Borrowed tune"" which left this reviewer pondering the immediate purchase of their debut album. After shelling out for the record the mystery deepens why Field Report are not a beloved musical institution since this is one of the finest albums of 2012. Bless them Uncut have just caught up and reviewed the album in their excellent August 2013 edition and lauding it with an 8 out of 10. They have also given a free track of the band on their monthly give-away CD the sumptuous ""Taking back Alcatraz"" a narrative about Native American activist Richard Oakes and his famous occupation of Alcatraz Island. ""If I die / At least I made a choice,"" sings the bands leader Chris PorterfieldField Report's claim to fame is that they are the least known ""third band"" to come out of Eau Claire, Wisconsin's DeYarmond Edison after Bon Iver and Megafaun, The formers inspirational leader Justin Vernon produces this debut which on balance is actually better than his own self titled sophomore album in terms of understated beauty. Field Report is an anagram of its creator Chris Porterfield and the nearest echo to this albums vibe is possibly the early Ryan Adams around his ""Heartbreaker"" purple patch but infused with a strong hint of the magical melancholy than Vernon captured the wintery beauty of ""For Emma. Forever Ago"". Throughout this album Porterfield lifts parables and history lessons and turns them into great songs. He also understands the importance of atmosphere in music not least in the poignant ""Chico the American"" and album standout. It is the stirring heights of opener ""Fergus Falls"" that drags you into this album to a such level that you wonder what you ever did without it not least its rousing finale. It starts with an an elegantly picked banjo and the killer opening line ""This is the one in which I miraculously pulled out/Of a free-fall dive over Fergus Falls, Minnesota/And this is the one like 10 years ago/That I told you about/Where my wings iced up in the fall, as it gets colder"". The song is a steam of consciousness and proof that fantastic songs simply fall out of the sky at times. A rougher tougher version is also available in an earlier iteration from Porterfield's old band ""Conrad Plymouth"". You need both and in addition the Chapel Session version. Other stellar songs here include the haunting ""Evergreen"" which almost demands some falling snow it conquers up such a late autumnal ambience. The closer ethereal ""Route 16"" echoes the sort of solemnity that the Low Anthem captured on their sparse and eerily slow 2011 album ""Smart Flesh"" and like that album is haunted by ghosts. ""Circle Drive"" alternatively shows that Porterfield knows his Paul Simon songbook well, while the lovely alt country ballad ""I am not waiting anymore"" has classic written all over it. On Field Report the band has touched such lofty heights you are almost nervous that they will never follow us. For now then let us hold our breath, enjoy what we have and celebrate a truly great album.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PHJB77BWRAI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008S9X5UW#wasThisHelpful","R37PHJB77BWRAI","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"One of the high points of recent years for those with a love for ""real music"" was the pairing together of veteran blues/gospel singer Mavis Staples who enlisted Wilco's Jeff Tweedy, a fellow native of Chicago to produce the Grammy-winning ""You Are Not Alone"". This was one of the finest albums of that or any year and Staples blues take on the double pairing of ""Too Close To Heaven/I'm On My Way To Heaven Anyhow"" was so deep it was almost primal. What great news then to see the two re-unitied and producing what is for all intents and purposes a follow up but with an even stronger gospel base. Staples is now well into her seventies and her voice remains an instrument which undoubtedly has the firm backing of the Lord providing its divine inspiration. It is by no means perfect, sometimes falters and there is the odd blemish but all this adds to its raw power rather than detracts from it. The mood of the album is subdued but infused with raw emotion. Tweedy's production assists this by stripping back the arrangements almost to bare boned acoustics. It is not completely susprising bearing in mind his own recent production duties with slow core masters Low, that Tweedy starts off Staples with a cover of one of their most recent songs the ethereal country of ""Holy Ghost"". The pattern of this song devised by Duluth's most famous band works perfectly for Staples voice and it is a brilliant start. Even better is the menace that Tweedy introduces into the old spiritual ""Every step of the way"" and that voice infuses it with an emotion that most singers strive for but never achieve. Much more surprising is the sprightly take on Funkadelic's ""Can You Get to That"" which does on initial hearings appear slighty out of place but eventually fits the album like a glove.Mavis Staples voice can range from a churchy low register to an hurricane which could tear the roof off. This album tends to play to the former element in more restrained acoustics of songs like ""Jesus Wept"" and the lovely slow funk of an album highlight the cover of Nick Lowe's ""Far Celestial shores"" which has Tweedy's musical stamp all over it. The more traditional gospel songs here also work brilliantly not least ""What are they doing in heaven today"" and another song associated with Doc McKenzie and the Hi Lites ""Sow Good Seeds"". Perhaps if there is one slip on the album its the rather standard version of ""I like the things about me"", but Staples is to much of a great artist to sustain a prolonged slip. The final two songs on the album comprise a great acoustic guitar driven ""I woke up this morning (with my mind on Jesus) "" that shuffles along beautifully and finally the albums title track brings it all to conclusion with a fitting showcase of deep slow blues which should really see a statute erected in Washington DC to this great singer while she is still alive to tell her how much she really means to us all.It is rumoured that Staples is working on her memoirs and she has a treasure torve of stories and inspiration to share. She recently talked of her love for Dr Martin Luther King and stated on the wider musical front ""that I feel so honoured that I have worked with Curtis Mayfield, Bob Dylan, the greatest poets in the world. So I've had just a wonderful, wonderful life. If I leave here tomorrow, I have nothing to ask for, I have left with everything done that I wanted"". This is a fine reflection but we must hope that there remains a good few years left in the tank of this remarkable singer because any one who makes music this good over such a long time deserves a few more decades to come.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RX3ZJQAYVZNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C9PQ7I8#wasThisHelpful","R2RX3ZJQAYVZNE","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Sunbather"" is going to knock the family portrait off the wall, strip it of the wallpaper and cause subsidence in your house foundation. Deafheaven have created a post metal behemoth here that is so large it may auger gravitational collapse and a musical black hole. This second album from the San Francisco band of noise merchants comes with songs that roll in at well over 10 minutes and which assault your musical sense in a way which was last achieved by Josh T Pearson's soaring aural assault in Lift to Experience's ""Texas Jerusalem Crossroads"" or the works of fellow Lone Star state residents Explosions in the Sky. On these songs George Clarke's rasp screams over the pile driver arrangements which sound like shattering blasts of pure cacaphony. Yet uplifting melody and triumph lurks here not least in the wonderful heights scaled on the opener ""Dream house"" whose crescendo builds to a sense of scale and power in its nine minute plus which is completely overwhelming.Thus to describe or to compare this to black metal anymore (particularly the unholy Scandinavian variety) is to miss the point; this is post rock like Slint but done at warp speed. The closer ""Pecan Tree"" leaves you gasping for breath. In its 11 minute plus duration its like experiencing a sonic apocalypse which literally pulversises your senses and stops your daily deliberations. Much heavier is the epic mid track ""Vertigo"" this time at 14 minutes resembling a mini math rock opera with influences and traces of Black Sabbath, Husker Du and previous greats, and with Clarke's fellow band members Kerry McCoy, Derek Prine and Daniel Tracy whipping up such a fierce musical tornado that you should head to the ground shelter. When it comes to the shortest track on the album ""Irresistible"" its like a single in comparison to its lengthy counterparts and provides shelter from the storm from what follows but at the same time it shows how the band are confident in their own skins that amongst all this full on assault they can interject a lovely guitar lament. The eerie neo religious chant of ""Windows"" does feel more like an interlude which some may find a distraction. Amends are made however with the pulverising title track that has pitch-warped guitars almost being overcome by fuzz and static. ""Sunbather"" is a bold and thrilling album from a band whose music has gone into another league on this release. People of a certain age may question the sanity of those who love this undiluted wall of noise produced by Deafheaven, but you the listener will smile politely safe in the knowledge that something very special is going on here and if others can't recognise that then aren't they the poorer for it?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FTV0ZKSSN1ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCEHX5W#wasThisHelpful","R3FTV0ZKSSN1ZJ","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At long last Jason Isbell has delivered that great classic album that he always threatened to make. From his days as a key component in the Deep South's best band the Drive By Truckers to his excellent debut ""Sirens of the Ditch"", Isbell has produced songs of the highest quality and delivery. Yet even die hard Isbell supporters began to lose faith in later albums culminating with the mixed bag of 2011's ""Here we rest"" which languishes on this reviewers I Pod like an abandoned prisoner with only ""Alabama Pines"" allowed out in the exercise yard. The new album ""Southeastern"" is the product of Isbell going through recovery and cleaning up his act on the Jack Daniels front. More importantly he has found a soulmate and fell in love with musician Amanda Shires who plays on this album (his previous marriage to the DBTs Shonna Tucker fell apart and contributed to his departure from the band). It appears that cupid's intervention has done him a power of good since the fog that enveloped ""Here we rest"" has lifted and every song on this record basks in radiant clarity. Isbell's often-underplayed strength has been his ear for a classic ballad including stunners like ""Dress Blues"". On ""Southeastern"" they populate the album in abundance, not least ""Cover me up"" a tough song about addictions and passion with has nice Beatles like undercurrent melody. The line ""girl leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leaving this room 'til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom."" is classic. What is also noticeable is how much his voice has improved. The good ole Southern twang is still there but its now more mainstream American if that makes sense and it works. The pace picks up with the brilliant uplifting piano driven ""Stockholm"" where the female backing vocals drives this lovely alt country song with a slight tinge of the music of his friend Ryan Adams. The quality barometer does not drop throughout the whole album so let us single out some songs for special attention. Firstly ""Travelling alone"" is classic old school country and will wear out jukebox needles in bars across the mid west. Even better is the album standout ""Elephant"". Honestly you should sectioned if you don't seek this one out at once. It tells a tale of a devastating tale of a couple dealing with cancer that is the elephant in the room in a relationship that is fading away. At one point Isbell sings with aching poignancy that ""When she was drunk she made cancer jokes/she made up her own Doctors notes/surrounded by her family I saw she was dying alone"". It is brilliant and will send Isbell's songwriting credentials to the top of the premier division.More songs which have immediate appeal include the sauntering guitar acoustics of the lovely ""Different Day"", the blustery rocker ""Flying over water"" that features guitar solo so stinging it almost hurts and the punchy Southern honky tonk rock of ""Super 8"" which would have fitted nicely into ""Exile on Main Street"". But again it is an acoustic song that demands attention namely ""Song she sang in the shower"" which references Pink Floyd's ""Wish you were here"" and will break hearts when played across the radio waves of country music stations. Somehow he matches it with ""New south Wales"" with Shires adding an plaintive fiddle backdrop melting together with in Isbell's precise guitar picking. The serious business album concludes with the bluesy ""Yvette"" with a great Isbell's vocal and the gorgeous closer ""Relatively Easy"" gives the album an optimistic acoustic endingJason Isbell's solo albums to date have occasionally touched the highs of his Drive By Truckers songs where at a precocious age he was writing unimpeachable songs like ""Goddamn lonely love"" and the great Southern anthem ""Oufit"". With ""Southeastern"" he moves from solid to brilliant. It is a redemptive album full of catharsis and pain but with some fun along way. It is a bit like life in that regard but predominantly a soundtrack to everyday heartaches. Isbell is now 34 and ruefully reflected in a recent interview to the New York Times that fame came far too early in Drive by Truckers days and he wasn't ready for it. With the release of ""Southeastern"" there is a growing vibe in the US at the moment that this album may represent a significant turning point that demands 50 states attention. How many country singers get a full-blown profile in the Wall Street Journal? Thus perhaps Isbell's new found maturity has arrived at precisely the right time since it looks like fame is about to knock loudly at his door again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R8ZOX5RPZE6U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CCEHS48#wasThisHelpful","R8ZOX5RPZE6U9","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you are a connoisseur of country rock this album is the equivalent to a winning ticket on State Lottery. Gene Clark like his contemporary Gram Parsons shares that common lineage of membership of America's most timeless band The Byrds. Both can stake an equal claim to the founder of the country rock movement and unfortunately these two musicians were equally deeply troubled souls, leading brief lives of excess. Clark wrote some of the Byrds best songs and was the man who penned ""Eight Miles High"", but who left the band over internal rows and ironically because of the fear of flying on tours. By early 1970 Clark had decamped for the pastoral rural idyll of Little River, California, accompanied by Carlie McCummings who he later married. It is here he penned the 1971 solo album ""White Light"" a record of stripped back largely introspective folk songs which was a true American Beauty and an abiding classic.""Here tonight; The White Light Demo's"" are finished acoustic versions of songs which are about to be fully recorded with a band. It is Gene Clark essentially unplugged and sitting in front of you with a guitar with blinding clarity but not too much studio polish. Omnivore the record label releasing this work are to be hugely commended for their care and diligence in making these demos such a sparkling feast of music. The details are as follows, of the tracks, six (""White Light,"" ""For A Spanish Guitar,"" ""Where My Love Lies Asleep,"" ""The Virgin"" ""Because Of You,"" and ""With Tomorrow"") appeared in final form on White Light. Two (""Opening Day"" and ""Winter"") appeared in final form as bonus tracks on the 2002 A&M/Universal reissue of the album. One track ""Here Tonight"" is an alternate version of a song that appeared on the Flying Burrito Brothers compilation ""Close Up The Honky Tonks"". And three songs ""For No One,"" ""Please Mr. Freud"" and ""Jimmy Christ"" have never been issued previously in any form. Liner notes are by John Einarson, author of the tragic ""Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of Gene Clark"" (Backbeat Books, 2005).What about the music? For a start the recordings are pristine versions of complete songs (""With Tomorrow"" is a short but complete version). More than this they add to the originals in the same way that the recent and excellent Townes Van Zandt demos did for that singer. This album does in effect reveal the art and meticulous song craft Gene Clark. The bare bones approach allows the wonderful timbre of his voice full reign and many of the songs feel a whole lot better (no pun intended) without the somewhat dated band arrangements of the period. Highlights include the aforementioned ""For no one"" which is a thing of beauty that builds from a slow guitar and ghostly harmonica. The stripped back versions of the seminal ""Spanish guitar"" and the breezy Dylanesque ""White light"" offer the listener real quality rivals to the existing versions. The simplicity of his tender love song ""Where my love lies asleep"" actually betters the existing version with Clark's warm vocals at the forefront and when he sings ""Through the hallways of wonder/Down the steps of the deep/And the secrets that drum/Where my love lies asleep"" you curse the mighty forces that took such a great singer from us. The bluesy ""Here tonight"" is again an unadulterated joy and shows that Clark in every sense anticipates by thirty years modern alt country singers like Ryan Adams, Dylan Leblanc, Ray LaMontagne and Sam Beam. The gorgeous version of ""Winter in"" actually serves to rescue the song from the rather poor arrangement on the original ""White light"" where the band feels like an add on, while ""Because of you"" completely slays this reviewer on each play. It can be argued that Gene Clark actually succeeded in realizing Gram Parsons ""Cosmic American"" music vision especially on his masterpiece ""No Other"". The release of ""Here tonight; The White Light Demos"" is not just an essential addition to the work of an already legendary songwriter it extends the already huge reputation of Gene Clark and is a foundation stone in the genesis of alternative country rock.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RQFC1I4FM6T0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BAO98Z8#wasThisHelpful","R2RQFC1I4FM6T0","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Its official - we can now fully celebrate the fact that within our midst is the supreme modern songwriter with her remarkably short but productive career ranking her alongside the greats. The journey of Laura Marling from the sensitive bedsit balladeer of ""Alas I cannot swim"" to the epic solo sweep of this new album ""Once I was an eagle"" has never faltered or been side tracked. Her intensity of purpose has been such that her albums now punctuate time as landmarks and it is a damn painful wait until the next one.Largely dispensing with her band, Marling has looked inwards and shines an often-dark light on her personal and romantic situation. The word ""confessional"" has always been a label applied to her but there is something altogether more penetrating and often hurtful at play in this record. Producer Ethan Johns has again let her songs expand and breath. This is exemplified in the first seven songs where Marling and Johns let them flow and in essence they morph one into the other in an almost seamless sequence. In the hands of a lesser songwriter this could be a stifling bore but Marling performs small miracles in these compositions. One unifying factor is a link through a frenetic guitar motif which harks back to the Indian themes of the Dharohar Project, but despite this these songs stand in their own right as an powerful statement where Marling snarls, emotes and accuses ex lovers of the ultimate romantic failing - sheer disappointment. In the stunning title track she ruefully reflects ""I will not be a victim of romance/I will not be a victim of circumstance/Chance or circumstance or romance/Or any man who could get his dirty little hands on me"". Slightly later on the uber powerful ""Breathe"" a song packed with menace she confesses ""How cruel I am to you/How cruel the things I do/How cruel you are to me /How cruel time can be"" and you reflect that getting on the wrong side of Marling is not a wise place to be. The tension ratchets up on ""Master hunter"" where she echoes Dylan and proclaims ""Well if you want a woman who can call your name It ain't me babe/No, no, no, it ain't me babe"".The pressure cooker atmosphere does let up following the albums eighth track interlude. The rolling bluesy acoustics of ""Undine"" are more in tune with the type of approach employed on ""I speak because I can"", while the sad reflective acoustics of ""When can I go"" with a hint of organ is a Marling trademark song and a obvious single. At this early stage ""Pay for me"" with its sweet melody sounds like a standout while ""When you were happy"" is almost spoken and the wordplay is dazzling. The album finishes with ""Little Bird"" where Marling's confidence absolutely oozes through and the song almost demands the repeat button. Finally the sixteenth song on this album that extends over an hour is ""Saved these words"" a slow builder that leads up to almost a Led Zep style neo folk barrage while Marling almost lays down a challenge when she exhorts a new lover to recognise that ""Life's is not easy/and you're not master, son/when you're ready/into my arms come"".Marling has of late decamped to the West Coast and there are many American influences here. She has admitted in a recent interview that ""I don't know whether I've sort of fallen out of love with English charm, the reservedness of it.... Having reviewed Marling's previous albums the easy thing to do was to search for peers and Joni Mitchell was the most obvious of these. But on this new album Marling is her own woman. What is incredible however is that Laura Marling remains in her early twenties and the sheer scale of her song writing maturity and achievement.

"Albums by those American flag-bearers The National should be viewed as distinct chapters of a much larger book which is still being written. There are no sharp ruptures between their records and each develops in its own way and pace after repeated plays contributing to a rock solid oeuvre of songs. Simply put their records couldn't be by anyone else, you judge them on the strength of the songs and whether on the musical ledger book the majority of those pressed onto vinyl continue to be in credit column.""Trouble will find me"" is by any standards the least rocking and most melancholic National album to date. If you love the National of ""Mistaken for Strangers"" or ""Bloodbuzz Ohio"" this album only partly plays to that constituency, alternatively if songs like ""Daughter of the Soho Riots"" or ""Runaway"" floats your boat a treat is in store. This reviewer will start with a couple of negatives since this album starts and falters. There is something about the repetitive lyric of opener ""I should live in salt"" and the almost looped lines of ""You should know me better than that"" which as yet to prove a great listening pleasure. Equally ""Demons"" sounds like so much like a ""paint by numbers"" National song that it is almost a parody not least with Berninger's mournful lyric. Then thankfully by third song everything comes right and just gets better and better. The pounding ""Don't swallow that cap"" with its creeping melody and throaty Berninger vocal signals a step change. Its followed by the lovely acoustics of ""Fireproof"" with a shape shifting band accompaniment and restrained singing plus the classic line ""You tell me I'm waiting to find someone who isn't so hopeless - there's no-one."" The familiar evocative baritone of Berninger is to be located on the powerful ""Sea of Love"" where yet again can be found proof that drummer Bryan Devendorf is the beating heart of the band. ""Heavenfaced"" is just sublime. Other songs like the complex ""This is the last time"" mutate into a great Sharon van Etten-featuring orchestral coda from a more convention almost bluesy start. ""Graceless"" sound like it could have been happily located on ""Alligator"", but more profound the is American beauty of the brilliant piano ballad ""Slipped"" where Berninger reflects ""that I don't need any help to be breakable"". The albums final quarter is easily the best part of the album and to this reviewer's ears includes three instant National classics. The sweet guitar coda on ""I need a girl"" leads into a tender vocal but images of people losing it and driving cars into gardens give it a darker edge. It will be one of those great National live anthems but if anything it is topped by the two final tracks the superb piano driven haunting lament of the album standout ""Pink Rabbits"" a tale of lost love where the singer ruefully reflects ""You were staring down the street cause you were trying not to crack up/Bona Drag was still on/Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out"". Finally the album is rounded off by the epic ""Hard to find"" surely one of the great National songs in all its morose beauty.""Trouble will find me"" is a brooding beast of an album from the best American band this side of Wilco. The National In short are a band who now clearly understand their own inner logic and have figured themselves out. They produce intelligent and emotionally weighty records which confirm the Dessner brothers are among rocks finest composers. The Guardian recently commented about the bands progress that "" what they have perfected, over the course of six albums, is a kind of glistening melancholy, a strangely beautiful dourness"". These words are well written hence you must promise to listen to this album to find out what they mean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IZBMRDETCJ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CRW2066#wasThisHelpful","R3IZBMRDETCJ3","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"On the surface this record could be seen as chalk and cheese for John Grant fans. 2010s ""Queen of Demark"" was a lush melodic beast from the former Czars man with echoes of Jackson Browne, Rufus Wainwright, Billy Joel and even Neil Sedaka; this was assisted by the presence of country rockers Midlake as his backing band. Listen to ""Pale Green Ghosts"" and it is the presence of bubbling, thumping synths which immediately provide the dominant overriding theme. Please don't get the wrong impression though this is not ""John Grant goes disco"" and for those who hugely admire him as a songwriter with a penchant for witty, caustic, self deprecating and often brutally honest songs the general excellence of ""PGG"" will not disappoint.The excellent opener and title track sets the theme with an almost Depeche Mode style techno grind and when accompanied by the best baritone in rock music it hits the bullseye. John Grant has had a troubled past and his recent stage declaration in London that he his HIV positive is a brave if sad admission. Yet this album has at its core the relationship break up with a former lover which he wrote about in ""Queen of Denmark' which manifestly cuts like a open wound and any reconciliation is impossible . Listen to the haunting ""Vietnam"" which Grant has explained is a song about how his past lover annihilated him by showing how little his emotions mattered. His bitterness is raw and on full display not least in the powerful chorus which states ""Your silence is a weapon/It's like a nuclear bomb/It's like the agent orange used in Vietnam/It's accompanied by an apathy/It's deafening through the years/You know it is complete and perfect/And you wield it without fear"". A new anthem for Grant is also included the often-hilarious ""GMF"" (use your imagination!). Here Grant's ability to craft a lyric that leads to a loud snort is evident not least his observation that ""Half of the time I think I'm in some movie/I play the underdog of course/I wonder who'll they'll get to play me, maybe/They could dig up Richard Burton's corpse"". Other standouts include the gorgeous cosmic ballad ""It doesn't matter to him"", the sheer power of the Sinead O'Connor backed ""You don't love me anymore"" and the brilliant synth pop of ""You don't have to"" and ""Ernest Borgnine"" electronica meets dirty saxophone. True ""Sensitive new age guy"" is rather too much like Visage for its own good, but everything is forgiven for the superb seven minute plus closer ""Glacier"". It is one of the best things recorded this far in 2013, a huge piano driven lament, jammed packed with strings and a lyric that will break your heart. It must rank up there with the best things that he has penned as the rich ebb of Grant's voice plays over a dramatically slow piano and emotions run high""Pale Green Ghosts"" on repeated listens reveals huge inner depth showing Grant continued dalliance with his demons, relationship break-ups, his open homosexuality which was a key theme on ""Queen of Denmark"" and now his health remain on-going battles. Its mix of electronic pop combined with Grant's ability to produce some of the best baroque balladry this side of Rufus Wainwright ensure that this wondrous record is a haunting album of heartbreak and recrimination.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/REOZT19ROCVKO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B9LNK5G#wasThisHelpful","REOZT19ROCVKO","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having seen this film well over a month ago its pleasing to report that the blood pressure tablets from a good GP worked and that it is time for payback. It was Saturday night, there wasn't much on in the cinema and it seemed like a good idea at the time. As it turns out this films stinks so much Vue should have provided the cinema goer with a complimentary nose peg. Let us set aside the cynically crass exploitation of the tragic Chernobyl disaster and the ethics of this. What we have here is a rotting carcass of a film that should be entitled ""A Good Day to Give The Die Hard Franchise a Decent Burial"". Trying to describe the plot is like trying to balance on mercury and whoever wrote the script really deserves a decent spell in a Siberian labour camp. Bruce Willis's first ""Die Hard"" film was all a bit special and of course it had Alan Rickman in it to make him look good and out act everyone in sight. To be fair to Willis he was then a endearing cheeky chappy who did a decent turn and who understood that acting wasn't all about how much blood covers your tight fitting dirty vest. Sadly this execrable mess about Bruce rescuing his son from a Russian mobster with a CIA twist thrown in for good measure is just a series of incredibly loud action scenes (the film comes with a compulsory migrane) and dialogue so jug headed they ought to make Willis the Emeritus Professor of Cliche at Harvard University. By the films conclusion you almost develop a soft spot for the Russian Mafia.Those of you who treasure the wonderful ""Team America World Police"" will recall the parody scene in Paris when in pursuit of ""terrorists"" our heroes destroy the Eiffel Tower and Louvre and kill just about every French citizen in sight. But that was done with puppets and was a brilliant p**s take. In this film we start with a huge first-act car chase through Russia where Willis kills more innocent bystanders than the bad guys could ever hope to and begs the question isn't it time that this level of brainless overkill in film was consigned to the dustbin of history? Willis now stands in the same league as Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the acting stakes and as for poor old Jai Courtney this makes his performance in ""Spartacus: Blood and Sand"" look like Sir John Gielgud in comparison to lame brain on offer here. This reviewer had a Chinese meal after the film ruined by its lingering memory and can testify that there is nothing sweet about this film - its all sour. This review is written as a public health message to prospective buyers - you have been warned.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSJV2W9BGGHE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CFQN12Q#wasThisHelpful","R3FSJV2W9BGGHE","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With hindsight we would do well to remember how many critics thought that Vampire Weekend's eponymous debut might be their first and last record. The ""Upper West Side Soweto"" template did seem to offer limited development opportunities and suspicions lingered that this was just a slice of novelty cultural tourism by (at best) a bunch of privileged preppy white boys and at worse four Ivy League bozo's. Their excellent sophomore album ""Contra"" started to suggest a band with much greater staying power who were moving into very interesting darker corners. Now their third album ""Modern Vampires of the City"" confirms a new album that is an undoubted keeper by a band who must now be ranked as best amongst their peer group. Repeated listens confirm an almost perfect pop album strong on infectious song-smithery, populated with hooks large enough to catch Tuna and lyrics so smart you can award an A+ diploma to each track. Yes MVOTC is essentially about New York but within its vinyl grooves are songs which tackle themes of faith, death and after-life albeit with a broad smille on their face. While at one time the band may have seen ""the dawn in the colours of Bennetton"" this superficiality has passed and the opener ""Obvious bicycle"" it is so beautifully melancholic that it could appear on a Mercury Rev album. The same applies to ""The Unbelievers"" which sounds like Buddy Holy's ""Peggy Sue"" rewritten for the 21st Century with a splash of world music thrown in for good measure. Ezra Koenig's skills are brilliantly honed on an album standout ""Step"" which is both a doo-wop track with harpsichord and shows that he has studied his Brian Wilson songbook well. It is a gorgeous song that cries out for the repeat button. The foot is further pressed down on the gas pedal for the buoyant single ""Diane Young"" surely destined to be the 'alternative' pop record of the summer? It is worth checking out the ""making"" of this song on the net which forms part of the excellent series of videos where the band enlist as their ""Director"" the actor Steve Buscemi to hit the streets to hustle New Yorkers into buying tickets to their Roseland Ballroom concert.Darker hues are fleshed out on the rubbery pop of ""Everlasting Arms"" a lush pounding song with a infectious drum undercurrent, wobbling bass and on repeated listens a rather funky sheen. Then we have the ubiquitous ""Ya Heh"" which has just about colonised every music blog for the last month with its regretful lyric of ""America don't love you"" and huge cartoon character backing to the infectious chorus and an ending to die for. Lookout in addition for ""Hanna Hunt"" which shows how Koenig's songwriting craft is maturing at warp speed not least the wistful line ""If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah, there's no future, there's no answer."" The ultimate sign of a great pop band in this reviewers humble opinion is to construct a pop song at around two minutes and make it indelibly mark.. The 1.45 seconds of the last track ""Young Lion"" achieves this with a gentle rolling piano and melody that sticks like superglue. Granted it is still early days with ""Modern Vampires"" and one of the longest tracks on the record ""Hudson"" has yet to really land a blow. This is countered by the sheer fun and outrageous audacity of ""Finger love"" which could happily grace an Animal Collective album and fit like a glove. The spoken interlude in the song is followed by Keonig recalling ""Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye/I don't wanna live like this, but I don't wanna die"". Finally ""Worship you"" reminds you of the theme tune for the old series Bonanza, surely always a great sign?While ""Modern Vampires of the City"" may not be the best album of 2013 (time will tell) it is by a country mile the most enjoyable listening experience of the year thus far. It is a life affirming album by a band entering their prime. The good news is that any doubt around the longevity of Vampire Weekend is dispelled by this record. This fact alone should be a cause of celebration. A while ago one Amazon reviewer had the audacity to describe Vampire Weekend as the new Talking Heads. They are two very different beasts but in the context of this new album we get a huge pot pourri of whimsical, esoteric lyrics combined with a mix of elements of punk rock, art rock, avant-garde, pop, funk, world music, and Americana. Does this sound familiar? Whatever the case ""Modern Vampires"" is a completely joyful album which you are going to want to own pronto.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0RXFEYT4AEQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BB22GQM#wasThisHelpful","R3P0RXFEYT4AEQ","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With the ongoing interest in the solid ""The Next Day"" it comes as no surprise that the record label EMI determine to strike while the irons hot when it comes to all things Bowie by releasing a five CD box set cash in entitled ""Zeit! 77-79"" covering that miraculous halcyon period badged loosely under the name of the ""Berlin Trilogy"". In addtion they add a copy of the 1978's live double rather tediously entitled ""Stage"". The price of the set in a five disc package comes around the $20 mark signalling a budget release with no bonus tracks, the approach of CDs all residing in a jewel case (rather tightly fitting in the box) with the original sleeves but no new remaster. What you must decide is whether your old CDs need replacing with a relatively inexpensive non remaster or if you are new to Bowie whether this convenient box set wets your appetite? They do have the merit that the double live ""Stage"" is the 2005 Tony Visconti remaster with ""Stay"" and ""Be My Wife"" added. Thankfully the running order is also corrected to reflect the order the songs were played at the actual gigs (the original release and subsequent CDs had a chronological running order). The other albums use the 1999 EMI remasters as their sound template. As for the ""Berlin trilogy"" substitute that label for another threesome the names of Bowie, Eno and Visconti and more accuracy can be achieved for these albums are ""Team"" Bowie at their magisterial and creative peak.""LOW"" 1977 - It is the collaboration on the album that counts. On ""Low"" not only did Brian Eno play keyboards on six of the eleven tracks and co-write ""Warszawa,"" but he acted as the rigorous intellectual challenger to Bowie at the height of musical powers and craft having fled from the cocaine blitz of his years in Los Angeles. Visconti's sheer precision in terms of production duties does to some extent make any remastering exercise superfluous. ""Low"" stands today as an astounding musical intervention. As the BBC has rightly stated ""without Low we would have no Joy Division, no Human League, no Cabaret Voltaire, and no Arcade Fire"". It is one of those era defining albums which requires mandatory ownership for any self respecting music lover and a respectful wink to the great Guardian Angels of music. It is probably best to start from the icy shades of ambient soundscapes like the beautiful ""Art decade"", the tinkling melodic synths of ""Weeping Wall"" and then gravitate to the cool funk of the title track, the almost Tony Newley sounding hard rock of ""Be my wife"" and one of Bowie's best songs ""Always crashing in the same car"". This album is a veritable feast of modern sounds for modern days and easily one of the best of the latter part of a defining musical era.. Is it any surprise that the great composer Phillip Glass reconfigured its wonders in his own brilliant interpretation of constructing the Low Symphony?""HEROES"" 1977 - This reviewer can still happily recall the shock of listening to this album a few months after falling in love with ""Low"" and sitting in in awe and rapture. John Lennon was quoted as saying just before his death in 1980 his ambition was to ""do something as good as 'Heroes"". Recorded with Eno at Hansa Tonstudio in what was then West Berlin this album succeeded, as much as any piece of music can, in capturing the chill of cold war tension of what then appeared to be the eternally divided German city and its huge granite wall of separation. Even more than ""Low"" it drew on the German innovators like Neu, Can and Kraftwerk but also drew in sounds of world music before it was invented such as the rare beauty of the Japanese sounding ""Moss Garden"". The magisterial title track inevitably is the key which unlocks the whole record, but soon your love for songs like the brilliant rock of ""Joe the Lion"" about performance artist Chris Burden and with Robert Fripp on fire on guitar grows exponentially. Add in the imposing grey darkness of ""Sense of doubt"" and the superb funk of ""The Secret life of Arabia"" and a masterpiece unfolds in front of your eyes.""STAGE ""1978 - This is David Bowie's second live album after 1974s ""David live"", recorded on the Isolar II world tour and capturing concerts from a number of large US cities. It sees the emergence of the ace ex-Frank Zappa sideman Adrian Belew on guitar who later filled Fripp's shoes in King Crimson. It contains great versions of ""Station to Station"" and a huge metallic funk version of ""TVC15"". ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" tracks are done proper justice but unsurprisingly none sound quite as good as the originals. The Dame hams it up on Brecht's ""Alabama Song"" although it sounds out of tune in parts and the inclusion of five crowd pleasing Ziggy tracks is ok but not essential. Nonetheless ""Stage"" is not the waste of space that many critics derided at the time and captures the Bowie stage act in all its wondrous flaws and brilliance.""LODGER"" 1979 - This album was largely written off by critics at the time. It was recorded not in Berlin but actually put together from sessions in September 1978 at Mountain Studios, Montreux, Switzerland and March 1979 at Record Plant Studios, New York City. It is for many Bowie aficionado's one of his most underrated album and has over time grown to be recognised as a truly great album. During the period Eno has just returned from producing Talking Heads and according to one critic ""Lodger"" is ""the record where David most wholeheartedly adopted Brian's oblique strategies and embraced errors and random events"". The glam single ""Boys keep swinging"" is fine, but what sucks you into ""Lodger"" is the strength of songs that grow on repeated listens. The Talking Heads sound is all over the brilliant ""Red Sails"", the almost spoken ""African night flight"" is great fun, while the pounding ""Look back in anger"" is proof that Bowie rocks as good as the best. Edging all others is the standout ""Repetition' later to be covered by the Au Pairs and which owes a clear debt to the Velvets. While ""Lodger"" is not as good as Low or Heroes there is no shame in this for in its own right it stands as a brilliant album in the Bowie canon.If David Bowie had prematurely passed away after the period 1977-79 he would be hailed as greatest rock innovator of modern times. Like many great artists he blotted his copybook in the 1980s with horrors like ""Tonight"" and ""Never let me down"" plus the horrible Tin Machine, but recovering from sad failures are the touchstone of true genius and better was to come. In any case it was always going to be downhill from the lofty heights reached in the German Capital. These albums radically expanded the boundaries well beyond the label of ""rock music"" and even with seminal albums such as Television's ""Marquee Moon', Wire's Pink Flag"" and the Clash's debut album released in 1977 nothing can remotely touch the double combination of the pure sound and vision of Low and Heroes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y6R12LCGW69S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BQ8ZWO4#wasThisHelpful","R1Y6R12LCGW69S","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For the first time since 2007's ""Children Running Through"" Patty Griffin has recorded an album of original material and its quiet wonder. ""American Kid"" is an album of songs largely dedicated to her extraordinary father, a former Second World War veteran, Trappist monk and parent of seven and is a deeply personal statement which in turn makes for one of her finest and most introspective records. Her voice throughout is in turns sweet, haunting and pristine and she is backed by a variety of premier division musicians not least North Mississippi Allstars/brothers Cody and Luther Dickinson and fellow Band of Joy member Robert Plant. Indeed there has been much online speculation about whether Percy and Patty are married or not? Griffin has recently dismissed this but they are clearly soul mates and Plant sings backing on three of the album tracks.Griffin bookends this album with two songs about the death of her father that are raw yet considerably lifted by her searing vocals. The album commences with open-hearted ""Go Wherever You Wanna Go."" infused with lines which reference her fathers life and a nod to his journey to a higher spiritual plane. It is a genuinely lovely feast but is easily matched by the closing sweet melancholy of the bluesy ""Gonna Miss You When You're Gone,"" where she wears a broken heart on her sleeve and we respond by trying to hide that large lump in our throats. In between Griffin shows that she is now every bit the equal of the great country singers like Gillian Welch and Emmylou Harris with some stellar songs. One of these is a superb duet with Plant on ""Ohio"" a haunting alt country lament with an excellent accompanying video. "" The album's only cover, Lefty Frizzell's classic ""Mom and Dad's Waltz,"" is very well executed with a sparse sounding guitar and mandolin accompanying Griffin's tremendous singing. More hard edged support comes from the Dickenson brothers on the more rocking blues of ""Don't let me die in Florida"" where Griffin shows her versatility. In the midst of all this we get effortless Griffin acoustic ballads like the aching ""Wild old dog"", the slow country of ""Mom and Dad's Waltz"" and the deeply sad piano lament ""Irish Boy"" which is just plain wonderful. The mood is lifted by the old time jaunty skiffle of ""Get Ready Marie"" but overall the ambience is sombre and often cathartic and some songs like the hurting ""That kind of lonely"" and ""Not a bad man"" about her fathers enlistment are almost too sad to endure.""American Kid"" is a deeply personal record and feels like a form of musical exorcism for Griffin. It represents a mature statement by a superb musician coming to terms with the big themes of life, its comings, it's everyday pleasures plus its painful departures. Throughout she proves she has one of the best and most emotive singing voices in modern music and now sits right bang smack on the top of the pinnacle of Americana music. Honestly this reviewer can't recommend ""American Kid"" highly enough.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WWC7OWQYCKFW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BPXKWCM#wasThisHelpful","R2WWC7OWQYCKFW","AQV142R2H69QK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AQV142R2H69QK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My reaction to this film parallels those by the three-star reviews of 09/12/14 and 09/14/14. This is a fast moving action film that has some good fight scenes and more than a few tense moments, laced with a bit of thoughtful philosophy. Nonetheless, the plot tries to pack in far too many elements -- many of them reaching into other previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, so that Crossover Syndrome gets to be too much: you have to be aware of and remember events in other films in order to make full sense of some of what happens and is said in this one. Chris Evans continues his perfectly nailed depiction of Cap, and Scarlett Johansson is impeccable in her role. In the end, however, this becomes too much of a mish-mash that is wrapped up through the expedient of things-blowing-up while keeping a number of threads still very loose. In that sense, this is often seems more an all-purpose prequel than a film that tells a complete, satisfying story. But it's still okay, and more than watchable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LA75HEYYO35F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0090SI3EI#wasThisHelpful","R3LA75HEYYO35F","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My reaction to this film largely parallels that of the 1 October 2014 three-star reviewer. This is one of two films to emerge from the Starz original series The Chair, in which two first-time directors were given the same source material with which to create their own film. The other effort, by YouTuber Shane Dawson, turned out to be an incredibly unfunny, mawkish hot mess of a teen raunchy comedy wannabe. This one, directed by Anna Martemucci, at least has adult sensibilities and aspirations, but in the end fails to be terribly engaging or satisfying.The fault lies partly with the male lead, Tobin Mitnick as Scott, who strikes me as a latter-day Richard Benjamin: likable in his way, but unable to make me believe he's not an android. His performance conveys very little emotional depth, and I found him not terribly interesting, and actually longed to see more of Philip Quinaz as Scott's older brother, who came off as a subdued but at least intriguingly quirky guy. Meanwhile, the female lead, Rachel Keller as Tori, does reasonably well but is somewhat camouflaged amid a small group of other young women, all of whom seem almost indistinguishable from one another. The story, meanwhile, veers from aimless to forced, and I had to force myself to keep watching to the end.Given the circumstances of the film's making -- part of a reality show, limited budget and shooting/casting constraints, plus a first-time director -- it's not a half-bad effort, I suppose. In absolute terms, however, it's nothing special.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OII6MGPVOW74/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIIO39U#wasThisHelpful","R3OII6MGPVOW74","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is one of a series of Saint reprints in uniform paperback editions, in this case a collection of three novellas from the 1930s. A freewheeling buccaneer happy to right wrongs and bring justice to the deserving -- even if it means breaking the law and more, Simon Templar (aka The Saint) is the epitome of dashing devil-may-care combined with brutal efficiency.

"About the only good thing one can say about this film is that the title is a great example of self-reference. I first learned about the movie -- and Shane Dawson -- through the Starz original program The Chair, which is a follow-up of sorts to the Project Greenlight series of many years ago. Two first-time directors, one of whom is Dawson, were given the same script and allowed to alter and run with it as they saw fit, within the limits of budget and filming in Pittsburgh. The series was interesting to watch as two train wrecks running in parallel with each other, though this is by far the worse of the pair.Dawson appears to have been somewhat of a YouTube prodigy, but like most prodigies, his art (using the term very loosely here) has failed to mature. Indeed, one can't even call this film sophomoric; it's thoroughly infantile. Dawson's sensibilities are those of a fifth-grader who has discovered the art of talking dirty and thinks that repetition of brainless utterances constitutes wit. The humor, if it can be called that, is cliched and stupid and, well, just not funny, unless you're amused by people defecating in public, vomiting on others, or displaying buttocks or genitalia through windows. It's not so much that it's offensive; it's just n-o-t f-u-n-n-y. The supposedly serious portions, meanwhile,  are so maudlin, cliche and forced that there's no appropriate single-word description that applies to this film other than stinkburger. Its high collective rating is due entirely to mass voting by Dawson's internet fans, and one shudders at the thought that there are over 200 people who actually find this boring piece of crap engaging or worthwhile. The only thing remotely good is Cherami Leigh's depiction of Tori; too bad she didn't have adequate material to work with.The physicist Wolfgang Pauli would sometimes dismiss a theory by saying that it wasn't even wrong. This film isn't even bad.","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RA2OYTD936X3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIIXE5Y#wasThisHelpful","R3RA2OYTD936X3","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This second season of DCI Banks includes three stories on two discs, each of the stories consisting of two one-hour portions. Even more so than in season one, the photography, casting, and sense of brooding is simply excellent. I do have quibbles here and there. As at least one other reviewer declared, Banks is too emotional -- and in my opinion, suffers from occasional bad judgment -- to completely enthrall me. Minor character tics and flaws can be endearing, of course, but sometimes as I watched these episodes, I winced at what I thought were bad calls by Banks.A good part of each story is really concerned with the private lives of one or more characters, which is a plus, except that at times I felt that intimate angle pushed the mystery itself out the window, leaving it almost like an afterthought. And more than once, there were loose plot threads or unexplained aspects that gnawed just a bit too much. Still, this series is so well-produced that one can overlook those negative personal reactions -- at least, I can. A fine series, made better by the replacement of Annie with Morton.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22SKPTYWOKGS3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D49YDR0#wasThisHelpful","R22SKPTYWOKGS3","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This set contains the second half of the only season of this ITC series from 1967-8 revolving around McGill, a disgraced American agent in Europe who takes on freelance assignments. I didn't watch it during its original run, but viewing them now is a wonderful exercise in time travel, for the photography, sets and music evoke the real spirit of the late 60s, at least as represented by quirky action shows. And quirky is a good word to use with this show. McGill often accepts jobs from questionable clients with ambiguous morals, the stories sometimes begin in midstream and not infrequently end ambiguously or with the sense of another shoe about to drop. Ron Grainer's main theme is catchy in the extreme, and the musical backgrounds and cues are reminiscent of programs like The Prisoner and Danger Man. (And, in fact, apparently Man in a Suitcase employed many crew members from Danger Man (aka Secret Agent) when star Patrick McGoohan moved on to make The Prisoner.)And nothing is more quirky about the series than Richard Bradford, who plays McGill. A dedicated method actor, Bradford lurches about and smugly emotes without let-up. Yet, from start to finish, the offbeat plots, the music, and the presence of a number of ITC and other familiar character actors in support makes this a must-watch for the period afficionado. I give it four stars because, well, it's not perfect: at times it's got a cheesy look, story details become improbable or slightly questionable, and there is that frenetic dance scene in The Whisper. Nonetheless, this one is fun and engaging.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3475FMKL83Z1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005VB61HO#wasThisHelpful","R3475FMKL83Z1X","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of two seasons revolving around a young aspiring Scottish journalist trying to make her way in 1980s Glasgow, hindered by a less than perfect family situation and male colleagues who are afflicted with varying degrees of chauvinism. David Morissey and Peter Capaldi are part of a nice ensemble cast. Indeed, the supporting characters are perhaps the best thing about this story. The central plot is grim and compelling, though many of the characters' actions in pursuit of a solution would today be questionable or illegal. Jayd Johnson is excellent as Paddy Meehan, the young would-be journalist, though like at least one other reviewer, I was put off by other characters describing Meehan as a ""fat lassie"" when the actress is decidedly not plump. In the end, I found the story stalling at times, but the character portrayals more than made up for it. If I could, I'd give this 3.5 stars: more than just okay, but not quite superior.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27DA4758VO3D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KOW4ATG#wasThisHelpful","R27DA4758VO3D4","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My reaction to season two of Line of Duty is so completely at odds with the preceding reviewers that I suppose you can consider me an extreme outlier in this case. I'll certainly grant that the casting is very good, and the performances are in the main excellent. There's an excellent underlying tension and slow build-up of relationships among the elements of the story, but in the end, that story becomes so involved and far-fetched that despite the perhaps unmatched degree of plot reversals and surprises, I lost real interest in this along the way, with only a small nagging curiosity egging me on to the end. Along  the way there are a few ""conveniences ex machina"": for example, the supposition that an upper story hospital room -- and an intensive care room at that -- has windows without screens that can open. Plot twists are generally a plus, but this series reaches way too far in the cause of twist for the sake of twist. If your gullibility is high and you enjoy surprises, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're the type of person who analyzes plot and frequently asks questions of the stories you read or watch, this may not be your cup of tea. Again, it's well-acted and produced, but the storyline is quite a stretch. I didn't care for it.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S1OWAW4C7F9J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GWXI2EU#wasThisHelpful","R2S1OWAW4C7F9J","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife is a mystery fan and has read Louise Penny's works, and she was eager to watch this dramatization. In the end, she liked it, more or less, though she did note some differences between this production and the original novel, something which other reviewers have commented on. Coming to this with no experience of having read the original material, I confess that I was put off from the very beginning by what I thought to be a very strange tone. I can't quite put my finger on it, but the manner in which the main character interacted with locals and with his staff struck me as unprofessional at times and puzzling at others. I also thought that the somewhat communal life of the principal local characters wasn't clearly defined, leading me to be left a bit at sea in terms of understanding those relationships. Finally, I found the resolution of the mystery quite unconvincing, though it had the novelty of being supplied by someone other than the main detective. All in all, this was a nicely atmospheric story, but one which really failed to paint a convincing and compelling portrait of the central character.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3TSRP91MIBIA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LH98QTK#wasThisHelpful","R3TSRP91MIBIA7","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Hinterland is in large part a Wallander wannabe, and actually does a fine job of it on several fronts. The photography is astounding. The characters are well-drawn and compelling. The atmosphere is all-enveloping. The plots themselves are rather good, with one exception, and was easily hooked and held captive all the way through. And yet...Brooding and grimness are ""in"" these days, an age dominated by the spirit of all those doleful Scandinavian crime writers. And I am taken with that mood, except that sometimes I feel that in Hinterland, as in other series, silent staring is used to make us fill in the blanks with our own imagination. That's certainly a justifiable dramatic strategy, but Hinterland perhaps over-uses that technique, so that a good part of each episode consists of people just staring at each other or at the landscape.There are some back stories present, but we get only hints of most. Mathias had a brother who is presumably dead, and he doesn't want to talk about it. He also appears to have had a pair of daughters, and a wife who won't speak to him. I'm guessing the daughters are dead as well, but we don't know yet. One of Mathias' assistants has a poor relationship with her daughter, so far presented as a pretty stock example of that kind of disfunction. And then there is the creepy Superintendent, who appears to have something to hide -- perhaps something ghastly and criminal. Maybe we'll get to that in season two. Anyway, the back stories are proceeding glacially and in this first season take on the qualities of a somewhat tedious tease.I mentioned plot earlier, and on the whole, the episodes hold up reasonably well -- except for the last one, which includes a number of plot holes, major loose threads, and highly unprofessional and seemingly unmotivated behavior by Mathias. It's one huge mess, but the others are fine. If you take to brooding atmospherics, this set will take you to heights you may not have known existed. If you are one who is entranced by plot rather than style, this will be enjoyable but not the brilliant tour de force that some see it as.For me, it's not perfect, but superbly executed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17TB1AOPULD5V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J3M54AW#wasThisHelpful","R17TB1AOPULD5V","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As noted by a few other reviewers, the lack of extras or commentary is a big negative for this set, and of course we also have the annoying ""Volumes 1 & 2"" format instead of the complete first season. Still, these early Mason episodes are marvelous to watch. The early 50s faux noir ethos is in full display -- there's alcohol, hats, cigarettes, and dames with secrets, not to mention those marvelous period automobiles. The stories are enjoyable, though more than once there are serious plot holes, and I have to agree with Mr. Burr that the courtroom antics get a bit out of hand. Nonetheless, this is one example where there is substance lurking behind the glow of nostalgia, and -- allowing for the era and the formulaic endings -- this set is a great ride.

"I've found that many of the television programs of my youth do not hold up well across the decades. This, however, is not one of those. Based on characters from a series of 1940s films, this early 1960s series chronicles, at times in soap opera manner, the hardships and triumphs of an intern (Richard Chamberlain), who stands in awe of the senior Dr. Gillespie (Raymond Massey). The stories are well-written, and the direction is top-notch. In addition, we get to see several actors who later achieved television or movie fame, or in a couple cases, aging cinema actors strutting their stuff on the small screen. And to top it off, the music is by Jerry Goldsmith, back when he was known as Jerrald. Although at times dated, as well as occasionally heavy-handed and mannered, this one truly does stand the test of time and is rewarding far more often than not.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12M1GNMJRVBFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDV4Q9A#wasThisHelpful","R12M1GNMJRVBFJ","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the pilot of the DCI Banks series, and it's not included in the U.S. DVD set of the first season -- perhaps Aftermath is considered Season Zero. In any case, I found the story quite uninteresting despite its sensational subject matter: Five girls are missing, and by chance police break in on what they think is a domestic violence case but is actually the home of the killer and rapist, for in fact four of the five girls are in the basement, and the perpetrator's wife lies beaten upstairs. During the resulting confrontation, one of the discovering policemen is killed.It's a brutal but promising start to a grim drama, but in the end the main plot thread is pretty simple, and in fact the police sort out almost everything rather early, except for the whereabouts of the presumed fifth victim, a mystery which is solved through brute force rather than deductive skill. In the meanwhile, there are side plots involving a concerned father who's also a sleazeball, a neighbor who is more involved than we initially suspect, and police politics.At the end of the day, as I said, the plot is actually rather simple and not that interesting, and the side-plots don't had a whole lot, either. The characters are complex, but frankly that of Annie is rather repulsive, and Banks himself doesn't come off well, either. She's ambitious and amoral, while he is too impulsive. My wife has read some of the novels on which these television dramas are based, and according to her, in many instances some significant changes have been made. Be  that as it may, although I thought the Season One set was good, this pilot stinks just a bit, to my taste.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR3RSMDMXQ2HY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D49YBTA#wasThisHelpful","RR3RSMDMXQ2HY","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This series began with With the Lightnings, published more than 15 years. A well-written and nicely plotted military SF novel, it was followed a couple years later by Lt. Leary, Commanding, not quite as good as its predecessor but still rewarding. From then, through eight additional installments including this one, the series had its hits and misses while generally spiraling downward in a confused mess of formula, repetition and very odd sentiment. This is the first one I can say I actively did not like.Daniel remains a likable character, with a few self-admitted, endearing flaws around the edges but retaining all the qualities one expects in the standard hero. Adele, however, has grown increasingly repulsive. In one instance, she regards an enemy captive who happens to be a farmer recruited for the opposing side as a contemptible fool, but why? She knows nothing of his personal characteristics -- only that he is a farmer. Does that, by itself, make him a fool? A fool, by the way, who is expendable without second thought. And, while dismissing her fellow humans, she constantly reminds herself that she is, after all, Mundy of Chatsworth. One hoped at the beginning of this series that this intially awkward, scarred being would find redemption. Instead, she has become a self-absorbed fascist. Her personal servant Tovera, meanwhile, has always been a cartoon character of sorts -- a psychopath who jokes about killing while being slavishly devoted to Adele. Indeed, everyone in the crew dotes on ""the Mistress"" to a rather ridiculous extent.The plot of this novel is thoroughly confusing. I found it difficult to keep every faction straight in my head, and it didn't take me too many pages to simply not care anymore. There is no combat in space this time around, just some minor dirt scuffles and a lot of introductions and negotiations, and as usual, Adele magically gets into everyone's database or control system to take charge of opposing weapons or gain crucial information -- the same ho-hum deus ex machina magic that we've gotten used to in this series.What is truly excruciating, however, is the absurd level of repetition in the writing. Once more, we get multiple reminders of the usual items: Adele's little sister was murdered and beheaded, Adele is troubled by images of the people she's killed, Adele has found a family with the RCN, and so on ad nauseam. This tired series started out beautifully; at this point, however, it needs to be put out of its misery.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q8LSJNR9IM9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1476736391#wasThisHelpful","R1Q8LSJNR9IM9E","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"By and large, this season of adaptations from the Alan Banks novels of Peter Robinson is well done. There are three two-part stories in all, each one dark and brooding in its way, although according to my wife, who has read the books, there are some significant alterations in at least one of them. The Annie Cabbot character comes off, to me at least, as rather annoying in the first episode, and less so in the other two. Banks himself, meanwhile, shows poor judgment at times, but that does make him human, although a human who stares a lot. The landscapes, photography and acting are all first-rate, but I found the scripts a bit flawed here and there. That might be due to fitting a possibly intricate story into a couple of hours, or just poor writing -- I can't tell which. There are some loose threads here and an inexplicable now and then. As one mild example, in one episode a battered body is found in a club restroom, but loud music and dancing continue as a police underling phones in to Banks to report the incident. When the others arrive, the dancing is still going on, and there appears to have been no attempt to sequester the crowd or otherwise secure the scene. Little things like that keep one wondering on the side, but on the whole, this is an engaging trio of English mysteries that is anything but quaint.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NSF91LV39M48/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00D49YDDY#wasThisHelpful","R3NSF91LV39M48","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This double helping of schlock features two films that are hardly classics. H.G. Wells' The Shape of Things to Come has nothing to do with Wells' novel of the same title, other than a couple character names. Mankind has colonized the Moon after the robot wars laid waste to Earth, but it is dependent on an anti-radiation drug manufactured on a planet named Delta Three for continued health. Trouble is, Jack Palace in a cape has overthrown the governor of Delta Three -- Carol Lynley, for god's sake -- and is sending empty cargo ships to crash into the lunar settlement. Barry Morse and his son, along with a female tech and a refurbished robot named Sparks head off on an unlikely mission to solve the problem. Veteran actor John Ireland suffers the indignity of a small role as Senator Smedley, and it suffices, I think, to simply note that this is a Canadian science-fiction film. It's incredibly lame but still watchable. The same compliment cannot be given to the companion piece in this set, Luigi Cozzi's Contamination, sometimes known as Alien Contamination. This one has alien eggs aboard an abandoned cargo vessel, a hard-nosed female security officer, a wise-cracking New York cop, and a ton of disgusting exploding bodies punctuating the boring stretches. Not my cup of tea.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAW2CUVH4FDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00862WFK2#wasThisHelpful","R3HAW2CUVH4FDJ","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think the Booklist reviewer got it completely right. If you are a casual Civil War buff or are more concerned with the military aspects of the conflict rather than the political, cultural and philosophical ones, this book is probably not for you. On the other hand, if legal and philosophical fine points are your daily bread, you'll likely gobble it up with gusto. After briefly explaining that most anti-slavery Americans put their hopes into a policy of containment that would cause the institution to wither and die, the author spends most of his book detailing fine points concerning the treaties that ended the American Revolution and the War of 1812. These provisions had to do with American slaves emancipated by British forces and demands by the former owners for a return of their ""property"" or compensation for its loss. Debates over these issues, both between Americans and British people and among Americans themselves helped lay the groundwork for U.S. emancipation as it eventually occurred in practice.I found the book interesting in the beginning, but by the end of the first third, repetition began to set in for me, and while the overall thrust of the book casts an interesting perspective on the intellectual run up to the Civil War, I confess I found the second half to be a long-winded exercise in going over the same points again and again. Following that good first half, the book just withered away for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROJF8THH0ZHWC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393239934#wasThisHelpful","ROJF8THH0ZHWC","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Project Runway spinoff stresses all the bad elements of its parent, including the principal one: Angst over Art. In the original Runway, Tim Gunn mentors the designers, who often spat and denigrate each other. Here, Gunn mentors three past Runway participants, who then act as mentor to their own small group of designers. So now the designers can spat, the mentors can spat, and the clothes get moved even farther to the back of the stage. Indeed, Project Runway is all about personal validation, rather than validation of one's art, and it wouldn't be part of the Runway franchise if we didn't have tears and self-pity and pretensions of hipness, which we get in spades this time around. There's an episode of disgusting bullying by people who themselves claim to have been bullied (including one of the mentors), as well as a moment involving a confession of attempted suicide that seems to be nothing but a pathetic bid for sympathy to avoid elimination. Tim Gunn, who has now become a caricature of himself, acquiesces in the bullying, not at all to his credit. Then there are the judges, a second rate trio if there ever was one, including one loud-mouthed person who is nothing but smoke and mirrors. I won't divulge the ultimate winners, of course, but I will say that the show partially redeems itself by selecting correctly at the very end. If you enjoy the slummy aspects of Runway, this will appeal to you. If you hate the fact that Runway is like professional wrestling, then you might want to steer clear.","2.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L8R2ZVPQZQA7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HQUI8AQ#wasThisHelpful","R3L8R2ZVPQZQA7","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an illuminating look at the literary and cultural influences that shaped Tolkien's creation of Middle-Earth and its stories -- principally The Lord of the Rings. The book is easy to read, is graced with good illustrations, and the author's text is well-organized. Snyder deals not only with the Tolkien texts themselves, but also adaptations, most notably the Peter Jackson film versions. There is a danger here of having those adaptations overshadow the originals, but Snyder doesn't really allow that to happen, while granting the subsequent influence of the cinematic renditions on popular culture. All in all, a good journey.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A6O7I7WSK04W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402784767#wasThisHelpful","R2A6O7I7WSK04W","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Comprised of decidedly second tier Golden Age heroes, this counterpart to the Justice Society boasted only one character with anything resembling super-powers: Shining Knight. The stories have the expected form: A menace comes on the scene and the Legionaires divvy up the challenges, then each tackles his problem in a chapter, followed by the next, and then we have a summing up. The tales are reasonably good, and the villains are for the most part intriguing. The artwork shines as well, each hero's individual chapter portrayed by a different artist (Mort Meskin, George Papp and others) before Ed Dobrotka takes over all the interior art starting with issue No. 4. Although the relative lack of super-powers is a downside to this title, in my view, the talent of the art collective that worked on this title, plus the writing -- in part by Bill Finger -- manage to move this volume up the scale.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KEKHCLJV48PE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401204015#wasThisHelpful","R3KEKHCLJV48PE","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There have been complaints about the reproduction of the art in this volume, some of which I agree with. Frankly, overall, I think that what you get in this volume is closer to the original in feel than if reconstruction and glossy paper had been used. However, there would have been some benefit to making the book just a bit larger. The artwork is so busy at times that, at the reduced size, it becomes a bit of a jumble. Meanwhile, the stories are quite good -- several notches above standard Golden Age fare -- but I confess that the Guardian is a pretty ho-hum hero, and he's not around much of the time. Admittedly, that allows the boys, who are the real colorful characters, to take center stage, but it also means that the artwork, although dynamic, lacks variety when there's no costumed hero present. Still, there's no denying either the classic S&K borderline grotesque aesthetic, or the good stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AXX4JNKMNJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401225934#wasThisHelpful","R2AXX4JNKMNJR","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This second volume of Atom Archives includes issues that I had never read before, since this run occurs about the time I stopped reading comics as a child. All the stories included were written by Gardner Fox and pencilled by Gil Kane, with Murphy Anderson doing most of the inking, replaced by Sid Greene on occasion. These issues also saw the initial team-up of Atom with Hawkman. The Atom's stories were among the most verbose and highly detailed among DC super-heroes of the time, and I think that sometimes the plots might have gotten just a bit too intricate. On the other hand, the characters come across as highly textured, and Jean and Ray, and their relationship, was one of the best of DC's Silver Age. Gil Kane's artwork is a joy to behold, especially when inked by Anderson, but Greene was no slouch, either. Compared to Volume 1, I find these stories a bit more gimmicky, perhaps, and while some may have liked the teaming of the Atom with Hawkman, it frankly doesn't excite me. Still, there's a lot of talent on display here.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23PINM0OZAEOV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401200141#wasThisHelpful","R23PINM0OZAEOV","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed this performance very much, but I confess that my preferences are still the rendition conducted by Bruno Weil, for period instrument performance, and the vintage ""modern""recording on Sony directed by Bernstein. Hickox's version is magnificent, and you can't go wrong choosing it; it's just that my tastes lean me toward those other discs instead -- I find Weil's more focused and Bernstein's more grand without being heavy. This performance is quite wonderful in its own right, though, and the sonic presence is excellent, arguably better than my two aforementioned favorites.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17MPZXPBHKU5P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000000A6C#wasThisHelpful","R17MPZXPBHKU5P","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This volume reprints the work Simon and Kirby performed on the revamped Golden Age Sandman character. In his Forties reboot, Wesley Dodds picked up a generic superhero costume and a young male sidekick, as well as the standard S&K manic energy. Much has been written about the reproduction of the art, most of it quite negative. Although I agree that it's uneven and comes out a bit muddy at times, I don't think the reproduction overall is that bad, and on many pages is actually pretty good -- with the use of non-glossy paper, I think the look and feel is closer to the original. The stories themselves are very active, usually exaggerated affairs, and like the art, perhaps just a tad bit busy, but these are tales that have often been written about but never readily available, and just being able to read them is a huge plus.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32ZK62PDRFLFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401222994#wasThisHelpful","R32ZK62PDRFLFX","AZC562U18BK2S","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AZC562U18BK2S?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reading these stories by Fletcher Hanks is like being in a dream where the salt shaker on the table is really your father, even though it looks like a salt shaker, and the final answer to everything always stays behind your back, no matter how fast you turn around. In similar fashion, the seemingly crude artwork and even more apparently crude story lines seem to mask a deep, delicate and detailed psychological reality that can be perceived but not quite expressed. Perhaps I'm not making sense. Suffice it to say that this book and its companion volume, You Shall Die By Your own Evil Creation, give a peek into the mind of a man perhaps better characterized as a creature of self-torture who introduced some very primal elements into his storytelling art.

"The reviewer of 03/04/04 has given such an eloquent general appraisal of this book that I'd first refer you to his brief essay. One aspect of the Superman and most other superhero sagas of previous eras was that they really didn't have an end. There would be changes, both slow and abrupt, transformations and costume changes, but (almost) never the seismic shifts that occur in real life, with gut-wrenching losses, deep spiritual realizations, and the acceptance of finity as opposed to infinity. This was Alan Moore's take on how all that might take place for Kal. Pacing, layering, shifts in perception -- everything is about as right as it should be. And as painful to read. This is the moment when the son of Krypton came down to Earth, for real.

"I usually shy away from underwire bras, they tend to dig into all of the wrong places on me, especially under the arms. My work is fairly physical so I need a really comfortable bra to wear on a daily basis. I'm very happy this bra is an exception, super comfortable with plenty of support for my size (36C). This bra feels very light as the name claims (""Ultra Light Illusion"") and will be great to wear during the hot Summer season this year. The cups provide a smooth look which looks nice under t shirts and is ""demure"" enough to wear under some of my more sheer tops. This is a very natural look, no seams or lace to detract or distract from a smooth look.I like that the cups are generous towards the outside and don't flatten there, no ""spillage"" if you get what I mean. I have shoulders that are wide rather than narrow and the straps hit just right. I am tall (5'10"") and the proportion of this bra is just right for me, and the straps are long enough. I hardly know I'm wearing this bra! I do plan on coming back for more in the nude and other colors - the seafoam and purple are very pretty. Keep in mind that this is an ULTRA LIGHT bra, not for heavy support. If it were, it wouldn't be nearly so comfortable.

"Like other reviewers here with one star ratings, this pie shield destroyed my pies. I have been baking pies for over 30 yr and have never had one turn out as badly as this. I tried the shield a few times and still got the same results, regardless of the temperature I was baking at. It flattened and shrunk my fluting and burnt the daylights out of the edge. I primarily bake my pies in an electric oven, and make butter pastry crusts on my pies. I don't ever bake frozen pies, this shield may be useful for that, but not in my case with the kind of homemade soft pastry my family loves.

"These birds are just adorable and they feel like porcelain rather than resin. It's too bad they are out of stock since a few family members have fallen in love with them and would like a pair for themselves. The color of the birds is very shiny & vibrant, they look and feel very high quality. The photo here on Amazon is pretty accurate as far as the color but they look even more charming in person. I love the wings and tail, which look like leaves instead of feathers. They are a perfect size, neither too large or small for displaying. They would make a very thoughtful and wonderful gift for a bird/Nature lover!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M5WPUJ0EYIAO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ISAAA04#wasThisHelpful","R1M5WPUJ0EYIAO","A2GA64WZK8PKBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA64WZK8PKBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This mat works really well for making standard size pastry for pies, I like that I don't need to use as much flour as my old mat. It really resists sticking unless your pastry isn't chilled, you WILL need to use more flour in that case. I only wish it was WIDER. I still have to use wax paper on the edges to make a quiche (quiche pans can be much larger than pie pans!) which sort of defeats the purpose of using the mat. I still find the Sili Bake handy for certain types of baking. It's slip proof, and the diagrams on the mat save me from having to dig out a cookbook for certain measurements. I store it in the box to keep it clean and prevent any denting from my other cooking utensils. Sili Bake sent me a nice PDF of some basic recipes too, after I purchased, which was a nice surprise. Highly recommended, especially for pie bakers.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R32H97XLY1189I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IY1C7D0#wasThisHelpful","R32H97XLY1189I","A2GA64WZK8PKBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA64WZK8PKBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have been looking for a substitute for King Arthur's Instant Clear Jel and I'm so glad I found this version by Barry Farms. There's a very decent amount here (much more than KA's) and I like that the sugar and citric acid have been left out, this is just plain ol' clear jel. This product is fantastic for making pies, works so much better than ordinary cornstarch or flour. Simply mix - I like to toss with your fresh fruit and other ingredients and add to your pie crust. This gives a lovely ""jam-like"" consistency to pie fillings and will firm up the juice if you're using berries or wet fruit so you avoid a soggy crust. There are no instructions but you can find recipes on KA's website for a general idea of how much it takes when you bake a pie. For example, I used 1/4 cup in the last 10 inch apple pie I made, 2-3 TBSP would be appropriate for smaller (or flatter) pies. You may need to experiment a bit with your baking, I like that this Clear Jel doesn't clump or harden like regular cornstarch if you use a bit too much, it mixes very well. It also works very well with low pectin fruit. The price is very reasonable too! Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3F3GXPXWF914F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00015UC52#wasThisHelpful","R3F3GXPXWF914F","A2GA64WZK8PKBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA64WZK8PKBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I like this oil additive, I noticed the most difference with idling when it was used on my 25 yr old Toyota. This product MUST be used with an oil change, so keep this in mind before you order. My husband was quite curious about this company's products since he's a fan of NEO products ( a brand used on formula race cars which we've used in the past) and wanted to know more about it. We visited the STA-BIL website, they manufacture a multitude of products for cars, motorbikes, and marine usage. As I've mentioned, I notice a much smoother idle, particularly when my car is cold. As far as wear and tear on the engine that will take some time to see if that's really so. I have used products like this for many years ( with great results) with both conventional & synthetic oil so I feel very comfortable with trying this brand.I honestly feel it's the sort of product that needs to be used with EVERY oil change to really make a difference long term. My husband had some questions and emailed the company twice with no answer, so I'm docking a star due to that. I believe this product would be especially useful if you live in harsh weather (either hot or cold), your engine needs a bit more TLC, or for whatever reason you need some additional protection (like my son, who drives his car across country a few times a year and drives a great deal for his work).","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE36ZNXW9P3ZL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UWZITU6#wasThisHelpful","RE36ZNXW9P3ZL","A2GA64WZK8PKBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA64WZK8PKBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have naturally coarse, slightly wavy hair that tends to frizz, especially in humid weather. This product allows my hair to fall into nice, soft ""beach waves"" that have movement but are less defined than using a waving iron (or a permed look). After shampooing & conditioning my hair (and making sure the majority of the water is towel dried, this is an important step!) I spritz the Fekkai Beach Waves onto my hair and SCRUNCH. I find that turning upside down and giving the hair underneath several good scrunches with this product works really well on my long hair, and gives it extra fullness, especially at the crown. I spend a little extra time scrunching my ends so that they have a nice soft curl to them as well. When my hair dries it looks fantastic. The ends have the same look as when I've freshly trimmed my hair. My hair is left with a light, citrusy ""tropical"" scent that isn't overwhelming. In about 30 min., the scent fades which is nice, I don't like heavy or overwhelming scents. I LOVE that this product doesn't dry out my parched hair, which has always been an issue with other salt sprays. My favorite has been a spray made by Schwartzkopf, but I can only use it for about 4 days maximum, and my hair starts feeling dry and my scalp is itchy. I have a medical condition that causes my hair and scalp to be dry so I'm sensitive to products that perhaps other people can use without a problem.For a bit of shine, I apply the Fekkai Pre-Soleil (Sunscreen for hair), another product I adore in this same line. My beach waves still hold up after applying this on top, which is wonderful....my hair needs a bit more product to get some shine. These 2 products in addition to the Fekkai Shea Hair Masque have my hair looking beautiful during the hot, dry days of Summer (an exciting thought since it usually is a bundle of frizz that I must braid to control).This size is perfect for popping into my gym bag or travel but I'd like an even larger size for regular use. I have waist length, thick hair that requires a fair amount of product regardless of what I'm using. That's the only drawback for me. I use at least 4-6 sprays on my hair + 3 for the ends after a fresh wash (less on dry hair), so I probably will go through this product fairly quickly. Other than that, I'm super pleased with how pretty my hair looks, and it's a time saver for those situations when I want my hair to look nice but don't have the time or energy to iron or curl it.

"I'm very happy with this ""at a glance"" planner and started using it the moment it arrived. I'm a right brain person who's usually frustrated with the layout style of most planners. Yet this planner is absolutely perfect for me in it's minimalist style, very easy to read and the layout makes sense. There's plenty of space for writing out my important day-to-day events with high quality paper & binding of the planner itself. There's a nice pocket stashed in the back for notes and papers. Being that the planner is very new and ""crisp"" there does seem to be a bit of stiffness in closing the front cover, however, that should loosen up over time with usage. I like the spiral binding and the neutral colors (it feels almost like leather) although my granddaughter tells me she needs to ""make it pretty"" for grandma. I'm going to let her do just that. That being said, this planner is professional enough for business and/or casual enough for personal use. 5 stars & highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F26B79O28WYP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UCC6XZM#wasThisHelpful","R2F26B79O28WYP","A2GA64WZK8PKBC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2GA64WZK8PKBC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These napkins really are pretty! Definitely a ""Madras Plaid- ish"" (or Buffalo Check) looking style. They are made of very dense feeling cotton similar to a lightweight canvas, and are made in India. The colors are very bright and cheerful (the squares are 3"" X 3"" rather than small squares) and they hold up well to washing. They felt a bit stiff when they arrived but feel much nicer after a wash and are ready to use. They DO need to be ironed since they are 100% cotton. They look perfect with my red and chrome retro kitchen look. I have the feeling that they will look good for some time (due to the quality) and might even look very cool when the color fades a bit. I have some pillow shams in my living room with the same colors and design which match perfectly. They would look great with just about any decor particularly Country or Western style. Definitely festive and fun for picnics, barbecues, and Summer gatherings.

"I'm actually a bit surprised at the effectiveness of this herbal complex. I do have adrenal fatigue coupled with hypothyroid, a very common ""combination issue"". I noticed results right away. Yet, I don't find this product to be ""stimulating"" in the least. So if that's what you're looking for you'll be disappointed. It's very common for people with adrenal fatigue to reach for stimulants (like caffeine) yet that makes the fatigue worse in the long run. I've made this mistake myself in using ginseng, etc.The Adrenal Complex works differently, it levels your energy instead of creating ""bursts"" throughout the day. It feels subtle ( calming and relaxing ) yet is powerful in other ways. I noticed the greatest difference in not feeling sleepy/tired at about 3pm in the afternoon. My energy usually takes a nosedive at this time and I've dealt with it for YEARS. Even getting my thyroid straightened out didn't help. It's great (no, super great!) that I no longer have this problem thanks to this supplement. My level of ""awake-ness"" is the same all day long.I'm also not greatly fatigued after working. Much of the time I do fairly hard physical labor, and this supplement keeps me on an even keel throughout the day as well as the day after. I no longer suffer post work or workout exhaustion. I just feel ""normal"".I also had some residual swelling on my thyroid even after taking natural dessicated thyroid (my thyroid levels are optimal now). So I can only guess that my adrenal glands played a part in the swelling. There were no abnormalities otherwise, but it had me concerned. A few days after taking this supplement, the swelling is going down.It's important to note that Schizandra is classified as a sedative/hypnotic adaptogen remedy in Chinese Medicine. Again, it is NOT energizing. It harmonizes your natural energy instead. It really depends what your issues are as far as whether it will work for you or not. It's effects are SUBTLE and build over the long term. Most traditional Chinese remedies work this way, and can be frustrating for those looking for an instant gratification. I did not have any issues with sleep, either. I can't say that my sleep is better or worse, I take Cherry for that now and it works for me in getting me to sleep when my mind is overactive. Since I'm very physically active during the day, I'm definitely tired enough to sleep and my mind shuts off nicely with Cherry. I used to take a remedy called ""An Shen Bu Xin Wan"" for sleep (more for the hard core insomniac), that stuff really works (!) it also depends upon WHY you have insomnia. I stopped taking it when I got my thyroid back on track.The recommended dosage is 2 tablets twice daily between meals. That's 4 tablets per day! I find this is correct, I can't imagine taking less than that. So, it's effectiveness might be impaired if you take the tablets with meals or are taking too few. The tablets are very digestible (I have very sensitive digestion) so there are no issues there. I take 2 in the morning before I eat and another 2 later in the afternoon. Your needs may be different than mine, you can adjust accordingly. My husband, however, takes his tabs singly throughout the day, that method works better for him. His work and lifestyle is much more sedentary than mine, so that may be key.All in all I'm very happy with this supplement for the reasons stated & highly recommend it if you've been diagnosed with Adrenal Fatigue, especially coupled with thyroid or other Endocrine disorders. Give it some time to do it's magic! And by all means, do some research if you're taking any medication that might interact with Chinese Herbs....this is really important!

"This is a time travel adventure novel for the dinosaur-loving middle grade reader.  It should appeal to both boys and girls because there are characters for both.

"I really wanted to love this book, but it didn't wow me.  I wanted to love it because I loved the premise -- what is going on in the lives of the teens who aren't the Chosen Ones during the epic battles of good and evil.I do need to make clear that I am far from the target age group.  Teen readers may like this book a lot more than I did but I'll be surprised if it becomes the latest teen mega-hit book.The story is told in a clever format that left me cold.  The story of the Chosen Ones is largely restricted to short paragraphs at the beginning of each chapter and cameo appearances by the ""indie kids"" in the lives of the main characters in this book.  I like the idea that what would be the ""main"" story in most YA fantasy books is such an insignificant part of this book.  But it made the book feel very disjointed while I was reading.The main characters in this book are siblings Mike and Mel and their friends Jared and Henna.  Considering that they are supposed to be the ""average"" kids, they didn't seem very ordinary.  Mike has a bad case of OCD and Mel nearly died from anorexia.  Jared is the farthest from normal -- and really makes the whole idea that these are the regular kids laughable.  I won't tell you what is special about Jared because that would be a spoiler.  The worst part is that I never felt invested in any of the characters and thus didn't care too much about them.As a Christian, it really bothered me that the families of Mike, Mel, and Henna supposedly attended a very conservative church, but their faith was virtually nonexistent either in their values or their behavior.  Had the author not made a big deal about it and one plot point involving mission work, you would never guess that religion had any part in their lives. As is often the case in YA books, the parents play little part in the teens' lives.There is some teen snark (always appreciated by me) but not nearly enough to offset what I didn't like about the book.  I wanted to give a content warning to parents who monitor their teens' reading.  There is discussion of some teen same sex experimentation and also some teen drinking and hetero sex.  The sex is not graphic but it is there.  Some occasional swearing but not nearly as much as some YA novels.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YJ1CE0XPCJOC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062403168#wasThisHelpful","R1YJ1CE0XPCJOC","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The nylon on this pack is really light.  I don't care much for the gels so I'm glad the pouch that holds a tiny bottle for gels comes off with a velcro strip so I can remove it.  There is another removable pouch that fits my cell phone.

"I really enjoy Sandford's Lucas Davenport series so I was interested to see how he would do with science fiction.  After reading this book, I think he should stick to mysteries but there will be many people who really enjoy it and I'll explain what I didn't like about it so prospective readers can decide whether they will be in the group that thinks this book is really good.I should make it clear that I don't read science fiction for the science.  I grew up with Star Trek and Star Wars, not hard science fiction books.  And I don't care if the science in the stories is shaky or nonexistent.  I want a good exciting story that captures my attention.This book will please people who want legitimate science in their science fiction.  The story is set in the relatively near future (2066) so there are no wormholes or warp drives that sent spaceships vast distances in very short periods of time.  Working out how to power a ship for a trip to Saturn in the least amount of time takes up a good part of the book.  That was mildly interesting to me, but I'd have been happy with more action and less science.There is also a lot of political ""drama"" in the book but it doesn't provide a lot of thrills and suspense until very late in the book.  There are some interpersonal conflicts, but again they are all fairly lukewarm for someone who was hoping for a thriller in space.  The main character is a young rich guy who is viewed as a dilettante but has more depth to him.  However, I never warmed to him as a character because he was neither ""bad boy"" not ""good guy"" enough to give me any strong feelings.  Some of the other characters seemed to come out of Central Casting as stereotypes so I never got invested in them.For me this book was ""meh"" because the science dominated and I wasn't all that interested in it and the thrills were minor and very late in the book.  Hard science fans are certain to enjoy this much more than I did.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1E2E5OPK5E3QH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399176950#wasThisHelpful","R1E2E5OPK5E3QH","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Although a technologically advanced spaceship is the central character in the story, this science fiction novel is more about a totalitarian government and interrogation of a suspected terrorist by a homeland security-type than it is about space exploration.  The ship has a crew of three, but Althea the engineer is one of the main human characters.  The other two characters who make up most of the action and dialogue are Ivan the suspected terrorist and Ida Stays, the female government agent who comes to question him.  Although I enjoy books with female main characters, I never clicked with Althea and Ida (inexplicably called Miss Stays by the other characters) was simply unpleasant.One thing kept bothering me throughout the book.  Everything hinges on Ivan and his partner tricking the ship into letting them board the ship.  I simply couldn't believe that a ship so advanced and secret didn't have better systems security.

"I enjoyed this book, but it definitely was not what I was expecting.I can't give too much away without spoiling major plot points, but just be aware that this is NOT really a legal thriller -- at least not the usual type where the lawyer gets involved in a case or a mystery, she is in peril related to the case/mystery and then solves it.  There are some of the elements in this book.  The main character is a lawyer and she does get involved in a cold case of a serial killer who has never been caught.  And at some point in the book she is in peril.But the author takes this book in a very different direction.  I probably would have enjoyed it more if it had been a more typical legal thriller like what I expected.  I really like legal thrillers, especially ones with a female main character.  The first half of the book seemed like it was going to be a legal thriller except that one of the characters was a little creepy and the main character did things I thought were reckless.  About halfway in, the author takes this book into a whole different direction.  It is a direction that not everyone will want to go, but I can't tell you what that is without spoiling the book for those who haven't read it.All I can say is that if you just want a normal legal thriller, this is probably not the book for you.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BR3GNXERKQ3S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250072751#wasThisHelpful","R2BR3GNXERKQ3S","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I thought this was an interesting book for middle grade readers -- especially boys, but I wouldn't recommend it for everyone.The interaction between Walter and Charlie is really quite delightful to read.  The dialogue is snappy and the two boys are so different in personality, it is a little like a middle grade Odd Couple.  This relationship, so to speak, was my favorite part of the book.And the author surprised me.  I was so sure I knew where the story was going, but the author dropped in a twist and that made me happy because figuring out what is going to happen too soon spoils some of the fun of a book.The reason I hesitate to recommend it whole-heartedly is because of the demons who are almost continuously attacking Charlie.  I am not of the flavor of Christianity that sees demons or the devil behind every adversity.  Nonetheless, I am not completely comfortable with being too casual around the subject, even in light children's fiction.

"I thought this YA novel was interesting and liked it, but I didn't love it.  It primarily is a historical Gold Rush-era novel, with a little bit of fantasy/magic.  Leah, the main character, has the ability to sense gold.  She and her parents keep this ability a secret but things happen that make her leave her home.The fantasy portion of this book is a big part of what drives the plot, but a very small part of the book itself.  The biggest part of the book is a journey story -- both the physical journey Leah sets out on and the emotional journey she goes through on the way.  She is a likeable character but a lot of the other characters were either stereotypes or just in the background without a lot of dimension.  The hazards and details of the journey were probably the most interesting part of the book.Even though I didn't love this book, I would definitely read the next book in the trilogy to see what happens next.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R109X7015D6B8F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062242911#wasThisHelpful","R109X7015D6B8F","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is the kind of book that people are likely to have wildly differing opinions about, depending on whether they have the right frame of reference to get the humor.  To be able to ""get"" the humor, I think you need background knowledge in two areas to understand what the author is poking fun at:  the fantasy novel genre and what I'll call ""British-isms.""  In addition, there is bonus humor if you are fairly familiar with the current trend of more serious childrens and young adult literature.  I have read enough fantasy and childrens/YA to get the humor there but as an American reader, I'm pretty sure I missed a lot of what was funny about the descriptions of Murdstone's village.I almost wished I could have a version with footnote explanations so I could get all the laughs.

"Most furniture covers are sized for specific pieces of furniture and cover one item at a time.  This is a better and more effective version of just throwing a big sheet of plastic over a bunch of things together.I live in Minnesota and really should bring my patio furniture inside during the long cold snowy winter, but I don't have any room to do so.  And it is expensive to buy covers for everything I have.  With this, I can pull my chairs up to the table, close the patio umbrella and lay it on top of the table, bring the umbrella stand under the table and drape this cover over the whole thing.The vents and the straps will keep this from being lifted off by the wind, though it is quite heavy due to the combination of the weight of the fabric and the water resistant undercoating.  You may want to use two people to get this adjusted, though the handles will help move it around to the right spot.  ETA:  11/13/2015:  We had a lot of wind yesterday and this morning I looked out the window and saw this on the ground next to the table and chairs it was covering.  Clearly it is not too heavy for the wind to lift and the vents don't prevent it from flying up.  Perhaps the issue was that it was strapped to some light aluminum chairs that were also tossed about, but I will need to re-do the straps that I thought would hold this down.Because it does leave the very bottom of my table and chair legs exposed, I think it is better for a climate where rain is the issue, not deep snow.  But this is a good start and about the best I can do without having a place to bring my patio furniture inside for the winter.  I have been using http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D2VUOSW for two winters now and it is still going strong and not showing wear.I think this would be 5 stars for climates milder than Minnesota winters.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37E43IUBYE6G5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010MU07FA#wasThisHelpful","R37E43IUBYE6G5","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This book takes place decades earlier than the Ruth Galloway books so there will be no crossover visits from Ruth.

"When I first saw this product, I was skeptical and though you could do the same thing with a magic marker.  But when I tried it, I was surprised at how well it works.We all get a lot of things in the mail that we don't want to put into recycling with all our information on them because of the worries about identity theft.  If you don't have a shredder at home, you have to save them up to bring to a retail shredding place or tear them in pieces and try to separate the parts with identifying information from the rest.  And when a prescription bottle is empty, I peel off the label and tear that up before putting the bottle into recycling.This product is an easier solution to the problem.  And its faster and works better than just crossing things out with a black marker.  This is an inked roller with lots of seemingly random little letter facing different directions.  The ink path is a little more than an inch wide and it wide enough to cover most address boxes in one path.  It doesn't completely cover with ink but the little letters are very close together and camoflauge the letters and numbers you want to obscure.  I think it is better than simple black marker because it you hold the page up to the light you can't see/read the letters underneath.I used this on some credit card mailings and, with one exception I'll discuss below, it rendered all my personal information unreadable.  I also used it on a prescription bottle and it covered up all but the same kind of lettering.The instructions list some things that don't cover well with this product and that includes (in addition to some specialty papers) characters with raised price, characters printed in color, and characters in a large font size.The large font size characters were the things I noticed that didn't cover well.  The name of my prescription medicine on the bottle was in much larger print and it was still readable and one of the lines of non-personalized text on the credit card that was in the area of what I covered up was also still readable with some concentration.I think this product is good enough that I will get one for my 81 year old mother to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MX8U5YPY6L30/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GFU1EJK#wasThisHelpful","R3MX8U5YPY6L30","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a lovely little book, both aesthetically and spiritually.  I like the author because she doesn't hide her issues -- and depression is something I struggle with as well.These daily readings start with a short writing by the author and then have several short passages of Scripture that fit the topic of her writing.  They can easily be done in the 5 minutes of the title or you could spend more time meditating on the Scripture verses.I really liked the design of the book -- the floral border on the cover is also a page border on the first page of each new devotion.  I know the way a book looks isn't nearly as important as the content, but I do enjoy a book with a nice design.The book has 50 readings so if you do one every day, you will be done in less than 2 months.

"For some time I have intended to read Harry Turtledove's alternate history novels but haven't gotten around to it.  I thought this book of stories and essays would be a good introduction to the author and perhaps get me so excited to read his books that I'd move them up in the ""to be read"" list.Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Part of the problem was that the stories and essays in this book seem  so random.  I couldn't sense a theme or anything that connected them.  It felt as if someone just grabbed a bunch of stories that hadn't been published in a while and then tossed in a couple essays to add some more pages.One of the essays, about how to write alternate history, was the most interesting to me because it gave me some insight into how the author approaches the novels I am interested in.If I were to judge simply by this collection of stories, I would completely lose interest in reading the alternate history novels because I just wasn't that interested in them.

"When I shop for a doll for a very young child, I want one that is easy to cuddle.  Many dolls have a soft body but have hard plastic heads and limbs.  This doll is completely soft and cuddly except for the ""pacifier,"" which has sharp edges under the fabric.  The fabric of the ""skin"" feels very soft to the touch as well.I have only one concern about this doll for very young children (it is suggested for ages 1+).  One of the features of the doll is a magnetic pacifier (with the corresponding magnet sewn under the fabric of the doll's face.  I worry that a child young enough to still put things in its mouth could chew the magnet out of the pacifier and swallow it.  Also, as noted above, the pacifier has sharp edges.If this is a doll for a child under 3 (and especially under age 2), I would cut the ribbon that holds the pacifier off the doll's wrist and not have it be part of the doll.  It is a cute feature but I think it is too risky for a very young child.As noted by another reviewer, there were a number of loose threads on the doll.  You will want to brush away the loose ones and cut off any stragglers before giving this to a very young child.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P8CO3CYH3852/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T68PZ7K#wasThisHelpful","R3P8CO3CYH3852","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Lately it seems as if YA novels are all serious with themes of dead or dying teens, depression, suicide, or bullying.  And there certainly is a place for serious YA novels.  But sometimes you just want a fun read and this is the perfect one.Will is more anti-hero than hero.  He's already an experienced con artist who has used his skill to scam his way into a scholarship at a prestigious private school.  But he discovers there is already another con artist there so they have a contest for the right to stay at school.  The target is an obnoxious wealthy student who is so bad you want Will or Andrea to fleece him even though it is wrong.The novel is written in the first person voice narrated by Will and it is well done.  Will's personality comes through his ""voice"" and you just have to like him even though he is a con artist.I thought this book was a lot of fun.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1H9LMZJHLY4JK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544320204#wasThisHelpful","R1H9LMZJHLY4JK","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I enjoy the Troy Pearce series of novels because although there is plenty of physical action, the technology is important enough to the plot to be a character in its own right.I think it would be a good reason to have read the earlier books to better understand the relationship between the former president Margaret Myers and Troy Pearce (and also the relationship Pearce has with the current President Lane).  Also, there is unfinished business from the book immediately prior to this one (Blue Warrior (A Troy Pearce Novel)) that is a major motivation for one of the villains in this book so it would be helpful to have read that book as well.I find the idea of drone warfare and other technological warfare to be both appealing because it takes place without a lot of human soldiers lives at risk and also completely frightening because it makes war too much like a video game.  Either way, the author uses technology (both current and not yet functional) to write an entertaining thriller.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KQXOF8TG7P9U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399173986#wasThisHelpful","R3KQXOF8TG7P9U","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have tried the self tanners that work by somehow making your own body produce some color on the skin and they never seem to have much effect, at least not in a single application.  If you need to look tan in a hurry, this might be the product for you.  It acts by putting a stain on your skin.You definitely want to buy the applicator recommended by the manufacturer because otherwise the palms of your hands will be stained brown and that would not be good.  Out of the tube, the product is a deep brown gel.  I had a light tan on my legs and when I applied it, they were noticeably darker.  Because it is a stain, it also made the sun damage spots on my legs significantly darker.I got two completely different reactions to my ""tanned"" legs.  My mother thought I had a really dark tan and my teenage niece thought my legs looked fake bake orangey.Two more thoughts -- the product smells very good and takes an annoyingly long time to dry enough that you don't need to worry about staining your clothes (they recommend that you wear dark clothes after applying) or furniture.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2WAOAZJDXVSEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NIQALAC#wasThisHelpful","R2WAOAZJDXVSEH","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Because this is a re-telling of the Cinderella fairy tale, much of this book will seem all too familiar:  a young woman whose father has died, leaving her as the servant of her abusive stepmother and stepsisters.  But Mechanica, as the Steps mockingly call her, is no ordinary young woman.  She has inherited her real mother's skill at making mechanical inventions with a touch of magic and is determined to get a sponsor for her own shop.Along the way she makes some special friends and falls in love.

"Here in Minnesota we have a short growing season and a very long winter.  During the summer I can grow herbs outdoors but there isn't enough natural light through my windows to grow healthy plants indoors.  This grow light should allow me to have fresh basil all winter.As described, this light has some tiny white lights, tiny red lights and tiny blue lights arranged together.  When turned on, it is sort of like a bright white light with a little blue and red.  I don't think it would work well to have it in an overhead fixture because the light would be too diffuse.  I intend to have it over just one plant but wish the manufacturer gave instructions as to the optimal height above the plant.Just a note about the coolness of the light.  Because LED lights are so much cooler than incandescent bulbs, I was expecting the aluminum body to stay much cooler than it did.  I put it in an antique lamp that had a downward facing arm and a glass shade.  The body got warm enough to transfer heat to the glass shade and after several hours of being lit was hot enough that I didn't want to unscrew it from the lamp until it cooled down a little.  Granted, if it had been incandescent, I'd have burned my fingers just touching it, but it still surprised me how warm it was.  So you'd still want to keep the fingers of small children away from this light when it is turned on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3J7OYA04MTO55/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z04X0XU#wasThisHelpful","R3J7OYA04MTO55","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Given the number of books in the Temperance Brennan series plus the author's responsibilities for the Bones TV series, it wouldn't be irrational to wonder if she has any good ideas left much less time to write a good book. Despite all that, this book is one of the best in the series.For anyone who has not read the series yet, I have a couple cautions. First, the Temperance Brennan of the books is nothing like the character in the TV show, so don't expect them to be the same. Also, as great as this book is, don't start with it. This book has a lot about Tempe's relationships and you need to know where she is coming from to appreciate what is going on. And you need to know the character's work arrangements (which are very different from the TV show) to understand that as well.  You may not need to start at the very beginning (though that is never a bad idea), but read at least a couple books before this one.I don't want to say any more about the story than is in the publisher's summary because I hate spoilers. This book kept me so interested I didn't skip ahead to the end, which is a good thing because I didn't see the ending coming.If you are already a fan of the series, you will love this book. If you are new to the series, read at least the one, maybe two books before this one to get enough context to enjoy it fully.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZF9NCDNON1V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345544048#wasThisHelpful","R1ZF9NCDNON1V8","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the last book in the Shattered Seas trilogy that started with ""Half a King."" I really liked the first book, liked but didn't love the second and thought this book was OK but not the great ending I was expecting.Partly this is due to the way the author structured the series. Harvick has been a major character in all three books but not ""the"" main character. Thorn and Brand were the main characters of Half the World but had fairly minor roles in this book. Skara and Raith are the focus of this book. The changing focus meant there was no one character that I could really get invested in over the course of the trilogy. I also didn't like how Yarvi's character changed in this book. Perhaps it was always there through the whole trilogy but I didn't like him in this book.One good thing is that the nature and identity of the ""Elves"" and what happened to them becomes quite clear in this book. I won't get any more specific to keep from spoiling it for someone who hasn't read the series, but if you had been suspecting based on the clues in the first two books, you'll get a lot more information in this book.Even though the ending disappointed me, this is still a very good trilogy to introduce someone to epic fantasy. I think of it as Epic Fantasy Lite because it is more accessible.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFZF817DWUAT9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804178453#wasThisHelpful","RFZF817DWUAT9","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"To start this review, I need to point out that I am not in the target age range for this book so I am reviewing it from more of an adult perspective.  I read a fair amount of YA fiction because I have a niece in that demographic and am always looking for good books for her.  This is not one I will be recommending to her.I really enjoyed the beginning of the book.  Jillian is snarky, self reliant and doesn't make any attempt to conform to the usual high school norms.  To support herself while her father is away, she has taken over his fake paranormal investigations business.  Her younger cousin (whose parents are stereotypical ""give me a hug"" adults) is eager to assist her.  I thought this was all very funny.Things start to turn when school starts. Jillian finds something upsetting in her locker and the new hunky guy (Sky) seems fixated on Jillian and she gets a missing person case for the business.  Sky is a little too stalker-ish for me and even though his behavior is explained later in the book, it felt a little but creepy to me.  As Jillian gets farther into the new case, things take a turn for the woo woo (paranormal).  I enjoy urban fantasy so paranormal itself doesn't bother me, but it needs to feel like it fits into the world of the book.  I thought it was ok until near the end of the book when the story went from snarky fun with a twist of paranormal to something else.  I'm not going to spoil the story for anyone but for me it turned the corner from funny and snarky to ""seriously, that's where you want to take this series?""Teens and young adults in the target demographic might not have any trouble with the direction the book (and thus any future books in the series) goes, but I didn't care for it.  I probably won't read future books in the series.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JWZM68SSGVUA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1616954345#wasThisHelpful","R2JWZM68SSGVUA","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book has so many elements that make it a fun read for both boys and girls in the middle grade  range (and also for younger children who are advanced readers).The two main characters are best friends Emma and Herbie, so both boys and girls are able to experience the adventure vicariously through a character of their own gender.  And there are sailing ships that go to distant unknown planets, sometimes sailing on the water and sometimes flying.  And children going off to rescue their parents, which is always appealing to younger readers.  Plus a ship crewed by orphan children, an evil queen, monkeys who build things, dragons and pirates!Emma and Herbie are in danger but it never feels too scary for younger readers.  With all the serious subject books on the market now for middle grade readers, a good dose of swashbuckling fantasy adventure just seems to hit the right spot.This book was a great start to the trilogy and I am looking forward to the next books.

"My arms are quite tan from gardening but my legs were still fairly pale so I wanted to use a product to give them some color without spending more time in the sun.This product is easy to apply.

"I enjoy space opera and love books with strong and feisty female protagonists so I was expecting to like this book a lot.  Instead, it didn't really work for me.Kayla makes a living fighting other women in a violent sci-fi world version of mud wrestling with a name that Amazon's censors won't let me write and wearing skimpy costumes and a lot of paint. But she has a secret she is hiding that results in her being manipulated into fighting in a contest to determine which woman will be chosen as the Empress Apparent.I lost interest in the story about the time I realized that title was more about marriage than having any independent political power.

"I have to start this review by saying that I LOVE the Bose earbuds.  This is my third set, though it is the first noise cancelling version.  I have an earlier version of the Bose SoundTrue In-Ear Headphones, Black and have been using them regularly at work and out walking for a few years and absolutely love the way they feel in my ears.More recently, I got a set of Bose SoundSport In-Ear Headphones for iOS Models, Blue that I use with my iPod Nano and while working out at the gym.  Again, they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever worn -- I really hate the kind that I feel you have to jam into your ear to keep in place.  I love the feel and fit of these so much that I can't see myself ever going back to the other kind of earbuds unless I need a really cheap pair for a specific purpose.I have never used noise cancelling headphones and had assumed that the big over-the-ear design was a big part of the noise cancelling feature.  Because of that, I assumed that in-ear buds wouldn't be very good at it.I work in an open office with coworkers' desks just feet away and the noise from my coworkers can be very distracting at times.  Even though I am a fan of the Bose earbuds, I was really surprised by how well these worked.  These don't 100% cancel all the sound around me, but they either cancel it or mute it down to almost nothing.  My supervisor (who has a fairly loud voice) came into the work area and started making an announcement while I was wearing them and listening to NPR.  I could hear something very faint and pulled my earbuds out.The interesting thing is that with the noise cancelling turned on, you can turn down the volume of what you are listening to, which should save your hearing.These come with 3 sizes of the in-ear piece and fit is very important.  I loaned my sport earbuds to someone with larger ears than mine (I use the small size) and I could hear music leaking out of the earbuds.  For noise cancelling purposes, finding the size that fits your ears best is even more critical to keep noise from leaking in.  Also, if you have never used the Bose earbuds before, there is a specific left and right side to them, which is important for fit.There is a switch on the microphone so you can be aware of your surroundings while using the noise cancelling, but I didn't like that.  There is a slight hum in the background that I didn't care for (but I think it might actually be the hum of the ventilation system, not from the earbuds.  If I don't want to use the noise cancelling, I think I'll have one of my other sets.  However, if you want to wear these while out biking, walking or running (note that the extra noise cancelling piece is a little unwieldy for fitting into a pocket or armcase), you would want to use this setting to make sure you hear oncoming traffic or anything that might affect your safety.These will be a regular part of my work station.  The quiet will help my concentration.These are quite expensive but if you don't want to use the big over-the-ear headphones and need the noise cancelling, they are a great choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HAYLJ3CMLJ0F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X9KVVQK#wasThisHelpful","R3HAYLJ3CMLJ0F","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third book in the Fina Ludlow series that started with Loyalty (A Fina Ludlow Novel).  Even though the plot stands alone, I strongly recommend that you not read this book before the others, especially the first book because there is a lot in this book that either would be difficult to understand or would spoil the plot of if someone hasn't read ""Loyalty.""I generally like the main character, though her overly casual love life bouncing between her friend Milloy and her cop friend Christian Melendez seems a too much like Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum and her back-and-forth love life.  It has reached the part where her casual sex with these two guys just annoys me and that is the main reason I dropped my rating down from earlier books.  Other readers may not have an issue with this.I also had a pretty strong hunch who the ""bad guy"" would be and was correct, though my motive guess was wrong.  There are plenty of red herrings along the way.

"There are two things to discuss about these bars:  the taste and whether they are a good idea.I love cheesecake and enjoy salted caramel, so I thought these would taste pretty good.  Maybe it is because I have cut back on the amount of sweets I eat and maybe it is because my taste bud were expecting something fruit flavored, like strawberry or cherry to go with the cheesecake taste, but the caramel didn't taste as good as I had expected.  It just seemed a little too sweet and bland for me.  As far the flavors of Fiber One bars, I prefer the Fiber One 90 Calorie Bar, Lemon, 5.34 Ounce over this one.  If I wanted the cheesecake flavor, I think I would like the strawberryIf you just love salted caramel, you might like the taste better than I did.  So the next question is whether these bars are a good idea.  Each bar has 150 calories, 6g fat (3.5g saturated fat),  24g total carbohydrates, 10g sugars, 2g protein and 5g dietary fiber.  If you want to treat yourself to a sugary snack, the protein and the added fiber make this a better choice than a regular cookie and much better than a candy bar.For me, these would be a very occasional snack.  I am trying to limit my sugar intake as well as my processed carbohydrates.  For about the same calories but fewer carbohydrates and much more protein, I can eat a Fage 2% Cherry Greek Yogurt and get my fiber elsewhere.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F4ZBZ2LDTJXH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VLSZAYG#wasThisHelpful","R2F4ZBZ2LDTJXH","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I saw this had been shortlisted for the Waterstones Children's Book Prize, I thought it must be a book for middle grade readers.  But this book was entertaining for an adult and I think it is better for teens or older because it has some fairly advanced vocabulary words and, more importantly, there is a lot of violence.The Wildensterns are a fairly bloody thirsty clan -- they have rules for when and how you can murder someone ahead of you to move up in the order of succession.  I know there is classic children's literature that also has a lot of violence but this felt older to me as I read it.Violence aside, this is a captivating story.  I had expected it to be more steampunk, especially from the cover art, but there is just enough to be intriguing without being overdone.  I'd love to talk about the steampunk elements but doing so would spoil a fun part of the book so I'll leave that for the reader to discover.There is a mystery in the book as Nate needs to uncover who killed his older brother because he has been blamed for it -- and accused of doing it outside the permitted rules.  There is subplot involving Irish rebels and some ancient Wildenstern ancestors.So often YA novels start to feel like copies of each other but this one is a complete original.  More importantly, a large percent of YA books are written for female readers and this is one that guys will really like as well.  I highly recommend this one and  am looking forward to the next book in the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12NEO39SU2UWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1497665701#wasThisHelpful","R12NEO39SU2UWA","A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2X2WTEVCZ5L8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have previously reviewed Bill Harris's book The new science of super awareness; the present book is an earlier one also informing us of the benefits of the author's audio technology system, Holosync.I got this book free from the author in connection with my purchasing the first programme in the Holosync Solution, though I was not asked to provide a review.  (I think Bill has so much success he doesn't need any more advertisement for his system.)The book is wonderfully and clearly written and provides us with a comprehensive overview of this life-changing technology. Bill calls it the last personal growth tool you'll ever need, and I am absolutely finding this to be true. Purchasing this technology is the best thing I've ever done. I will be doing Holosync for the rest of my life, and my only regret is that I didn't find it sooner.We are told that Holosync stimulates a profound acceleration in mental, emotional and spiritual growth. In the Holosync system we listen to at first one mp3 for half an hour, and later 2, one after the other, for an hour in all.The system works like regular meditation, except that it is 8 times stronger. Regular meditation carried out over 30 years will give you the benefits of Holosync, but most of us don't have the time.Holosync is like exercise for the brain and helps by pushing your brain to develop and create new neural pathways. But unlike physical training, the benefit gained is permanent, and this exercise doesn't have to be repeated in order to maintain the benefit acquired.Bill explains that the changes that occur are revolutionary. The over 2 million Holosync users have all had their lives changed (for the absolute better) beyond recognition.The main benefits are:1) It greatly raises one's threshold for managing stress.2) It increases our creativity.3) It increases our acceptance of people and situations,4) We simply feel better  we experience feelings of joy, inner peace and happiness.5) We understand ourselves better,In my experience, when listening to the mp3s or CDs you don't actually meditate, you just listen to the recording. At first you may fall asleep, but that doesn't matter, you will still benefit.You will benefit from the very first level of the system, but if you appreciate the progress made, you can then go on to further levels.  The first level takes from 4-6 months to complete, while further levels take from 6 months to a year to complete.With use of Holosync, dysfunctional emotional problems such as anger, depression, anxiety and substance abuse begin to fall away. Your mind becomes clearer and enthusiasm and zest for life grows. You will feel a greater connection to the world around you, and a deeper connection to God/the Divine.The author recounts how he was hostile, angry and anxious before years of daily Holosync meditations finally transformed him.He states that regardless of your current or past personal circumstances, it is not necessary to live a life of suffering and unhappiness.However, you cannot rush through Holosync; an hour a day is what is advised. You will have to work through change - things will come up to be integrated, and you may occasionally have to skip the meditation for a day or two, until you feel better.Holosync creates even deeper meditative states than are possible through traditional techniques. Holosync users experience alpha, theta and delta brain waves, and are able to remain alert and aware even in the delta state, though delta is a sleep state.Listening to Holosync synchronizes the two brain hemispheres, which means that both sides work together.We are given information about alpha, beta, theta and delta brain waves, though I don't remember finding any about the exciting gamma brain waves, which is the fastest pattern, much higher than beta, and which increase intelligence, compassion and loving kindness.This is simply a most exciting book, the best I've yet read about the brain and that's saying something.Bill presents his nine principles for conscious living 1) the principle of letting whatever happens be okay 2) the principle of threshold 3) the principle of chaos and reorganization 4) the principle that the map is not the territory 5) the principle of responsibility as empowerment 6) the principle of conscious change 7) the principle of witnessing 8) the principle of good and bad generalizations and 9) the principle of the neutral universe (N.B. Here I disagree I find the universe to be friendly, though it sometimes leads us to bad things in order to grow).As regards witnessing, Bill teaches us to step back and look at what we are feeling, as a technique by which to manage negative things coming up during the Holosync process. As we are also instructed through the work of the illustrious David R. Hawkins, we should let go of resistance (and thus suffering).At the end of the book we find innumerable letters from grateful Holosync users describing their progress and development.I thus highly recommend this excellent, brilliant book about the brain and the benefits of Holosync. If you decide to use Holosync you will not regret it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNXDRHMDLB8WM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0972178015#wasThisHelpful","RNXDRHMDLB8WM","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is about Gladys Davis Turner, who worked as a secretary for Edgar Cayce, the famous sleeping prophet.Gladys' story is recounted from the time she was taken on by Edgar until his death.While in a state of sleep, Edgar channelled readings for his various clients, presumably from the Akashic Records, though this term is never used.Many of the readings gave advice on how to tackle the clients' health problems, though I have to say I found this advice very difficult to understand.The language spoken by Edgar in this state was very old-fashioned and biblical and difficult to construe (these readings took place in the 20s and 30s).Lives were saved by Cayce's readings and when he became more well-known, people flocked to him for one. His own health was not good, and he did not always follow the advice given in his own readings, particularly on what and what not to eat.Gladys herself was a humble soul, very devoted to Cayce, and the work; she was overtaxed by all her duties. Not only did she attend to conducting the readings and filing them, but had to carry out many chores. She felt that she was not really seen or appreciated as a person, neither did she feel that her work was adequately respected.When Gladys herself received a reading, she was told that she had been egoistic in a previous life, and now had to be selfless like Christ, and continue to love her work, to appreciate others, even though she herself was not appreciated. I am to show love; whether others do or not; it is my duty, my business, to show love!She had been Edgar's daughter in a previous life in the Ra Ta period in Egypt when he was a priest called Ra Ta. She had also had a life in Atlantis as a member of the household of the ruler of Alta, and had helped bring the highest civilization and knowledge to the common people.We are also informed about Gladys' family, and the sons of Edgar and Gertrude, Hugh Lynne and Edgar, or Ecken.The readings tell us that life  is from the One Source, or as we would say nowadays  We are all One,We are also told that colours are  the spiritualization of tone or sound.Edgar's household, which included Gladys, was continually hampered by lack of money, and housing problems.Eventually, Edgar became overburdened by the amount of readings requested of him, had to stop giving them and succumbed to ill health.The book gives an interesting picture of the work of Edgar Cayce, and his daily life and problems.However, I found it in part somewhat boring, due to the constant lists of names of innumerable persons who were only peripherally involved in the lives of the family. Parts of it were thus not so readable also in view of the old-fashioned language spoken by Cayce in the readings. And I often couldn't work out which persons the author was referring to of the long list of characters mentioned.There were, however, several interesting episodes, including when Edgar and those with him got arrested for fortune-telling.To sum up, the book is invaluable as regards the documentation of Cayce's life and work but is marred by too much superfluous detail.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QBB42BW5XCWA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000GKQ242#wasThisHelpful","R2QBB42BW5XCWA","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was fortunate to receive the book free for purposes of review.I found it highly enjoyable and an easy read. In fact it is as easy to read as a children's book, and I understand it is intended for young adults. I don't really fall into that category, ha, ha, but this only goes to show that it is suitable for all age groups.We follow the life and heroic adventures of Max Andrew Diver, who from an early age has had amazing lucid dreams in which he flies to various destinations throughout the world, and probably further. He sometimes finds himself at the edge of a different world. At one stage he begins to collect physical objects in his dreams and bring them back home, for example, he brings back a magical bracelet he found in the Giant's Causeway.Max's father, Captain Thomas Diver, is a renowned pilot and astronaut, while his mother Cynthia, who died when giving birth to Max, was an anthropologist who specialized in cryptozoology  the study of such creatures as the Yeti, the Loch Ness Monster and Bigfoot.Max was born with the caul, that is, a removable membrane like a rubbery bubble of skin attached to his newborn head. It has special powers of protection and perhaps it is it that gives Max such exceptional powers as regards dream travelling.The nickname Snooze was given to Max by his father because he could fall asleep anywhere, anytime.Max has a good friend, of the female persuasion, with the unusual name of Tuesday Monday, who is extremely knowledgeable in paranormal matters, and whose mother, a (good) witch, explains to him that he has a double aura and two life lines on his hand, showing that he lives in two worlds and has literally become two people.Captain Diver is lost at sea, and Max experiences in one of his realistic/real dreams that he disappears into a vortex.The list of characters includes: Professor Andrew Icarus, a likeable and friendly anthropologist, and former lover of Max's mother (before she married Thomas Diver, of course); Dr. Morrow, a mysterious character who seems to want to exploit Max's superpowers; Raul, Max's college roommate; Zana, a friendly Sasquatch (Bigfoot), with whom Max communicates telepathically; and Maxwallah, Max's twin.The book is full of alternative science. We learn about space-time and time-space, traveling with the dreambody and reciprocal theory.The other day I synchronistically and serendipitously caught an interview with the author, Sol Luckman, in which he talks about these concepts and reveals that they are not by any means his own invention but actual science, and refers to the books of Dewy Larson, which he also refers to in Snooze; here we can learn more about the above-mentioned concepts.Max takes off (in the dream world) in search of his lost father, who is apparently alive but in trouble. There he meets not only with his own twin, but those of others (and the author explains in the interview that this matter of our having twins in other universes, or whatever, is also science (as far as I understand).I absolutely recommend that you read this original and fascinating book, which contributes to expanding our world and consciousness.  I now look forward to reading the author's other books, both fiction and non-fiction,","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MHIS8GKDVS0P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0982598343#wasThisHelpful","R2MHIS8GKDVS0P","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the third of the author's books.It is immaculately written like the other two, and continues the author's revelations to us about how to tackle the Akashic Records.However, I must say the same as I said about her second book, Healing through the Akashic Records, that I felt it to be extremely theoretical and not much practical use to me, at any rate.Linda again gives us the basics for accessing the Records, including the necessary Opening and Closing Prayers. She repeats the three precepts we must remember when in the Records: Judge Not, Fear Not and Resist Not.We learn about making peace with ourselves and others. When first accessing the Records and presenting her challenges, the response was consistently a loving expression such as Of course or No wonder, so she advises that we use these terms ourselves, in order to practice loving acceptance of ourselves and others.She realized that her human limitations could not corrupt or destroy the perfection of her soul. Every action whether it resulted in injury to herself or others was her best attempt to connect with more love.Linda presents us with five concepts, each representing a distinct Pillar of Light: Incarnation, Authority, Discipline, Responsibility and Commitment, There is also a central Pillar of Light, Grace, and a separate chapter is devoted to this.Unfortunately, I found this book, like book No. 2, to be hard-going and thus not easy to read. It is filled with wisdom, but, again, I didn't find it to be particularly practicable with regard to accessing the Records. I found it too theoretical, and a bit difficult, requiring much concentration to get through it. And I didn't actually manage to get through it all.So I can't recommend that you read the book, though if you deeply appreciated Healing through the Akashic Records, you may well feel the same about this one.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFHTZ5NFHAI80/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401946135#wasThisHelpful","RFHTZ5NFHAI80","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I much appreciated Linda Howe's first book How to read the Akashic Records. This is her second one; it is written at an extraordinary high level and thus seems to have been channelled directly from the Records, which it probably was.The book is immaculately written  Linda is exceedingly articulate. The level was so high that I did not personally find it easy to read, nor, particularly, easy to digest.Thus, I was somewhat disappointed that the book wasn't practicable for me  it didn't really help me to progress further in the Records, or find out how to receive healing from them, which was my goal in reading it.We learn about the absolutes of the Akasha  Judge Not, Fear Not and Resist Not.These admonishments are not easy to integrate into one's consciousness. We need to keep noticing whether or not we are doing these things.We also learn that acceptance of our woundedness is our landing pad into healing. The healing I require is physical healing, and I realize that emotional healing is the precursor to this. But I lacked references to, and advice about, physical healing.An early chapter repeats the basic instructions in the first book, and this includes the necessary opening and closing prayers. This means that the book can stand alone, though I would advise neophytes to buy the afore-mentioned book, which is an excellent and thorough introduction to the Records.Linda provides us with a four-step progression for transformation  Awareness of Self, Self-Acceptance, Appropriate Action, and Choice, and devotes a chapter to each.At the level of Awareness of Self, we wake up to the fact that we are ourselves  we become aware of our Innermost Self. The practice of Self-Acceptance begins with the spiritual discipline of extending unconditional Love to yourself. Appropriate Action is the level at which you address the business of taking action on your own behalf. As regards Choice, Linda states that out of all the other possibilities in the universe, your soul picked you.Our attention is drawn to Self-Abandonment and its causes. One of the laws of the Universe is that no-one can give you what you cannot give yourself. We can become disconnected from our Innermost Being, even though we have not had a highly dysfunctional childhood. A poor sense of self-awareness can cause a range of symptoms.As part of our work in Self-Acceptance, we learn in all situations to say Of course, - Of course I feel that way, Of course I did that. I have begun to say this, and it does seem to help.At the end of each chapter Linda presents what she calls Akashic Reflections, which are small exercises containing suggestions of what to ask for in the Records,Linda admits that we do not realize instantaneous healing with this work. We need to grow into our healing.Part Four of the book deals with Working with the Ascension Matrix and contains chapters on Gratitude, Grace and Generosity.Unfortunately, I don't own this book, otherwise I would immediately begin to re-read it, which would assist with its digestion and full comprehension.It is a wonderful book, filled with wisdom, but, as stated, I did not find it very practicable. I would advise potential readers to start with Linda's first book and read this one afterwards.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SBXEFXST834K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=160407096X#wasThisHelpful","R2SBXEFXST834K","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete this book before having to return it to the library,It certainly wasn't like other books about the Akashic Records I've read. Perhaps there was more about the Akashic Records at the end of the book (that I didn't get to).The authors did seem to be in possession of considerable spiritual awareness and knowledge, but I found the book to be a bit haphazard, moving from subject to subject, and interestingly enough, not in my view particularly relevant to the matter of the Akashic Records. Perhaps there was more about the Akashic Records at the end of the book (that I didn't get to).It is well-written, and I would recommend it to the reader interested in acquiring general knowledge about spiritual matters.If I had owned the book, I would have kept reading it, but didn't find it exciting enough to buy.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q5BUH810AAE1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1592579965#wasThisHelpful","R1Q5BUH810AAE1","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book just has to be assigned 5 stars, since its authors are both the late Wayne Dyer and Esther Hicks, or rather Abraham.Already in Wayne's introduction, we are given the valuable reminder that You become what you think about all day long. And also Abraham's admonition The Universe doesn't hear what you say; the Universe hears how you feel.Wayne talks about himself, what he has experienced, and what he has worked with, including his books, and Abraham comments on these things.One of the most interesting chapters for me is the first one, where Abraham explains who they are. (Abraham is a collective consciousness, thus the they.) Though I must say it is still difficult to comprehend this, even after their explanation. They seem to equate their identity with Source Energy, and say that we can all connect to this- it's a matter of tuning to a high frequency and doing it often enough that there is consistency to what you are receiving.When Wayne asks them if they are equivalent to God, they give an extremely vague answer, unfortunately. Or perhaps it's not vague, it's just hard for me to understand.They seem to say that when we leave the Earth, we form part of a Collective Consciousness  and that Source Energy is what Man wants to call God. And we all have direct access to that. It sounds like they're just saying, that we're all God. And that we're all Abraham. Or what?When we've achieved a high-flying vibration, where we're not ornery or upset, we allow inspiration to flow. Now we are extensions of Source Energy. The thoughts that we are thinking cause us to emanate a vibrational frequency that the Law of Attraction is constantly responding to. Only things of the same vibration can join us. If we are emanating an ornery vibration, we are surrounded by ornery people; they have rendezvoused with us because we are perfect vibrational partners.There is a 17-second rule that if you focus as little as 17 seconds on a thought, more thoughts like those come into your mind, This applies of course no matter whether you focus on positive or negative thoughts.Wayne talks about his father, who abandoned his (Wayne's) mother and her three small boys. Abraham tells him that this was the way Wayne had planned it, since he was a freedom seeker to the core of his being and didn't want anybody bossing him around.Abraham says that once Wayne's father had returned to the Non-Physical, he was in that place of Pure, Positive Energy and was always with Wayne, always loving him, always proud of him.Source is flooding this Energy of Well-Being toward us at all times. There is only love on the other side  only Pure, Positive Energy, love and clarity and passion and eagerness.If you want to have keen awareness of your Guidance, you've got to practice tuning in to the vibrational frequencies of your Source.Wayne states that some of the most profound changes in his life came when he was at the lowest places. Abraham explains that it is because one doesn't know what one wants until one knows what one doesn't want. The contrast launches some very big rockets of desire and puts you in touch with your Emotional Guidance System.If we were more unwilling to put up with negative emotion, our lives would go a whole lot better. We shouldn't let so much bad-feeling momentum mount before we recognize that we could have it another way.Watching the violence and horrors of the world causes you to practice the vibration of it, and thus you will rendezvous with more of it.You have to care about how you feel. Then if you start down the wrong track, you will feel the emptiness.Things are always working out for us, always.Most beings are trying to please each other, and have given their Guidance System away long ago.Abraham tells us: We in the Non-Physical are multidimensional. We are Consciousness, and whenever you  focus, we are always there with you  but it is necessary that you tune yourself to the recognition of us.The frequency of Source Energy is always there and can be received by us, but for us to realize it, we've got to be up to speed with it.Wayne recounts his blissful John of God experience, when he was healed of his leukemia. He looked at people through the eyes of Source, was in a state of bliss and all he wanted to do was give and give  to serve.Wayne begins to rail against GMOs, and is reprimanded by Abraham for focusing so much on the problem instead of on the solution. We need to focus not on what we don't want but on what we want.I would not call this book indispensable, but it is enjoyable, very readable and full of wisdom. I highly recommend that you read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SD6DFVYMFOH9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401948448#wasThisHelpful","R2SD6DFVYMFOH9","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first volume of The Orphan Trilogy, and the only volume as yet available as a physical book. I look forward to reading Volumes 2 + 3, when they also appear in physical form.An organization called the Omega Agency have bred a series of orphans with superior genes and trained them from birth to be cold and cynical assassins. They have been assigned numbers instead of names (presumably) to depersonalize them.The book relates the story of the most gifted of these orphans, Nine. He has made the decision to flee the organization, find out who he really is, and make a life of his own where the Agency cannot find him.The two leaders of Omega, Kentbridge, who had been a father figure for Nine, and Naylor, are hot on his trail, together with a female orphan, Seventeen, who had always been envious of Nine's favoured position and wishes to terminate him.Nine arranges the sale to the Chinese of a valuable treasure in order to finance his future secluded life on a distant island. However he finds himself obliged to take with him a desirable Frenchwoman, Isabelle, who inadvertently learns of his destination. He cannot bring himself to kill her and thus must drag her with him as he flees.Nine's escape is aided by his amazing talent for assuming innumerable disguises, as taught him by the Agency.The book distinguishes itself by its not only being an exceedingly readable pageturner of a thriller but also being one in which the protagonist is portrayed not just superficially, as is the general rule in such books, but as a more fully rounded character, a young man who is attempting to become a normal person, despite his more than tainted upbringing.He begins his first real relationship with Isabelle, and his feelings for her are reciprocated.This is a work of fiction, but figures and organizations from real life, such as the notorious Bilderberg Group, are mentioned. Various aspects of life we are aware of from conspiracy theories, such as mind control, form part of the book's content.I hope that the main theme of the book, that of the existence of these trained orphan assassins, is fiction, but it would not surprise me if it were not.The book is well-written, though the authors should perhaps brush up their basic French skills.I strongly recommend that you read this thrilling and illuminating book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O0OLZ01LD7D9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0473193132#wasThisHelpful","R1O0OLZ01LD7D9","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little book instructs us how to make our lives easier by enlisting the invaluable help of the spirits of creation. We learn how to ask these spiritual beings to help us with both small, everyday matters and larger projects  anything and everything.The book is well-written and inspiring. The author, Jean Slatter, gives us access to the Universal Yellow Pages. The hardest thing for me about this method was finding the best, most relevant names for the beings from whom I require help. However, Jean assures us that we don't need to worry about the nomenclature we use: the beings will understand what we mean.Worksheets are provided at the back of the book on which to fill in the names of the committees and committee members we need.Jean recounts many amusing stories of how she and her clients received help.She holds imaginary staff meetings in her car on the way to work, telling them of her intentions for the day. After hiring a spiritual secretary, marketing rep and bookkeeper, her practice flourished.I myself have a spiritual health committee, a spiritual Akashic Records Committee (to help me hear the Akashic beings clearly) when I go into the Records), a spiritual abundance committee and a spiritual bus-catching helper (I don't need a whole committee to help me catch my buses), and am planning to have many other helpers and committees.So far, I've found out that I must avoid consuming peanut butter (to relieve scleroderma), I have won a small legacy, and become more inspired to detox my body. Yesterday I got my printer back from being repaired and asked for help to find the apertures in which to insert the various tubes, or whatever they're called (you can tell I'm not particularly technically minded) and printer ink containers. I find that sort of thing extremely challenging. The printer ink just wouldn't fit where it was supposed to  I asked for help, and my fingers suddenly shoved it upwards of their own accord, and it said click!When asking for help, we must do so with intention and trust that the Universe will support us. We should picture the cosmic forces as loving friends who are easy to talk to and understand what we mean.We should adopt a playful attitude. We are the very extensions of God Himself, and He gives us unlimited support from the Heavens. We just need to ask.We should cultivate an attitude of gratitude and ask that the heavenly assistance be brought to us in the perfect way for the highest good of all concerned.We should have faith, and just know that what we ask for will happen. We can have whatever we ask for. This is the essence of true magic. It is important to define your wants and desires, but also to let go of them  stay unattached! Be patient!Life will just seem to work out, where previously it was difficult. Things start falling into place, seemingly miraculously.Jean tells us that the angels want to be included in our life  they want us to call upon them. We repay them for their help by our love and joy.We are creators with God and the Spirits of Creation, and it is through us God experiences and creates. This makes us extremely important  the Universe is counting on us!I find this book easy-to-read, enjoyable and inspiring. If you use the principles advised by Jean, your life will be transformed. I have previously asked for and received help from the angels and my household deva, but this book has helped me to take this work to the next level. I feel great relief that I can obtain this invaluable help to resolve all the problems in my life, every day, just by asking. Of course, sometimes it takes time for the beings to deliver what we need. The process helps me to learn about TRUST which is one of the most important qualities we need to acquire. This is an invaluable little book, if you're ready to ask for angelic help!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LGJ1UWX837SF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=157731512X#wasThisHelpful","R1LGJ1UWX837SF","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't usually read this kind of book, but felt I needed some light reading and picked up this book from the library.Previously long ago, I'd read some thrilling books by this author, but didn't find this one particularly exciting. It was also Volume 2 in a series, so I should have read Volume 1 instead, but it wasn't available.The story is set at the end of the First World War. The action begins in the Orkney Islands, in the North of Scotland, where we meet the protagonist, Max, who is apparently some sort of Secret Service man or the like. He is after something termed the grey file, which apparently lists various members of Max's organization who are double agents, or not to be trusted.Max chases/is chased by other spies through Scotland, and eventually the action shifts to Paris. There are lots of characters, most of which were difficult for me to distinguish from each other, and one could never be certain whether they were goodies or baddies. i.e. on Max's side or not. Max is attacked by others, and not averse to defending himself violently.As mentioned, I didn't find the book exciting, but still I kept turning the pages, and couldn't really decide to give it up, so I must admit to it being readable.There was an unexpected ending, and not really an ending, since we would have to read the next volume in the series to get that.In my view the best feature of the book is Goddard's impeccable writing. I won't actually recommend the book  you will probably find several of the author's other books much more thrilling.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZDURT019JMYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ITVYXZK#wasThisHelpful","RZDURT019JMYZ","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is not a book about Quantum Entrainment, as I had assumed it would be.It is a philosophical book, very abstract, but containing several useful, practical exercises. The author himself describes it as a ""poignant and practical guide to inner personal peace"". He says it is written in simple language, and that may be, but I found some parts of the book quite challenging to comprehend.Kinslow tells us about his early life in Japan, when he practised judo, and his sensei taught him how to quiet the mind. He also describes a spiritual, blissful experience he had as an adult when sitting in a caf; the state of inner peace and bliss lasted for five weeks or so.Just as I have previously experienced when reading the works of David R. Hawkins, when reading of Kinslow's experience, I myself entered a wonderful, blissful state.Though, as stated above, this is not a book about QE, we do learn how to stop our thinking, if we haven't learnt it before from the QE books. (Stopping one's thinking, or quieting the mind, as Jo Dunning calls it, is a key initial factor in the path to enlightenment.)Kinslow promises that in reading the book we will learn ""to overcome physical and emotional pain and the fear of death"". I already had no fear of death, and I don't know if I've learnt how to overcome pain from the book, but then I haven't really had time to practise the exercise he provides. The theme of the book is ""Being is more effective than doing."" Being is the act of not-doing. Not-doing means that we first become aware of pure awareness and ""then watch as our world is created through the Self"". Knowing the Self dissolves problems and the accompanying sufferings. The result is inner peace and prosperity.K talks about ""Self"", ""I"" and ""I Am"", which are the same thing, and ""me"", the part of us that ""has a body, a mind, a history, and future hopes and fears"". To know Self is to become free of hopes and fears. Your Self, the ""I"", is the witness. ""Me"" is ever changing, and ""I"" never changes. ""I"", the Self, is first felt as a gentle peace. He tells us that one day we will be amazed to find that inner peace shows up right in the middle of some traumatic event.We learn how to stop thinking by asking ""Where will my next thought come from?"" There comes a break in our thinking. We are awake, waiting, but there are no thoughts in that gap.We just need to observe the gap between our thoughts on a regular basis. The gap is pure awareness - awareness of nothing.We are told how the regular experience of Self will begin to change our life.Problems effortlessly dissolve when one becomes aware of Self, and the symptom of Self-awareness is inner peace. Moreover, K asserts that ""Awareness of Self is the fulfilment of your deepest desire"".Unproductive thinking about the future creates anxiety and worry; it is impossible to worry about the future when paying attention to the present moment.One chapter is entitled ""Your problems are not the problem"". The problem is the mind. Though the Self cannot be used to correct problems, when we observe the Self, we ""live free of the negative influence of problems"".K refers to Arjuna in the Bhagavad-Gita, a story of good overthrowing evil, but ultimately a story of seeking and finding Self. Arjuna had a problem he could not solve, so he surrendered and waited for Divine guidance - he retreated to a state of alertness without thinking or performing action.In a chapter about overcoming physical pain we are given an exercise/experience showing us how to find our subtle body. K tells us that doing this exercise induces healing. It keeps us anchored in Self, and should help us overcome pain when practised regularly. In another exercise we learn to observe physical pain, which encourages it to dissolve.In a chapter about enlightenment, we learn that enlightenment is ""simply a shift in perception from me to not-me"".This is a deeply philosophical book, which may require focus and concentration to comprehend. Several readings of the book will also help. Before I read this book I had experimented with Kinslow's QE, and practised finding Eufeeling with some success, but sometimes Eufeeling eluded me. After reading this book, however, it became much easier to find Eufeeling, in fact, I can practically always find it, in the midst of active life with open eyes. (For an explanation of Eufeeling read Kinslow's books on Quantum Entrainment.)I would highly recommend that you read the book.I'm now greatly looking forward to reading Kinslow's latest book - ""When nothing works, try doing nothing""","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L6KE5G0ZAJJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401931987#wasThisHelpful","R3L6KE5G0ZAJJR","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free in return for a review.This is a first novel with an important theme  that of the potential toxicity of the everyday products we use whether due to negligence or the desire for profit.The protagonist, Meg Morgan, is a scientist employed in a chemical company and has the task of evaluating the safety of a new chemical; however, she soon suspects that all is not as it should be.Meg expresses her doubts to her colleagues, but is constantly assured that they are unfounded and the chemical is perfectly safe.However, Meg is a conscientious person and pursues her suspicions. This is not made easier by the fact that she is soon in line for promotion and her sceptical views are not appreciated and their expression may spoil her chances.There is a sub-theme about a little boy who becomes seriously ill after using a particular shampoo, and also a romantic theme which counteracts the cheerless topic of toxicity in our household products.Unfortunately, the book is marred by the presence of many grammatical mistakes, typos and wrong use of words.The author is herself a scientist so she knows what she's talking about.If you want an easy, enjoyable read on an important topic, try this book!","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1PB4TOACEN8MW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=149295859X#wasThisHelpful","R1PB4TOACEN8MW","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free in return for a review.The author suffers from multiple, severe chronic conditions for which there are no known cures.In 1991 he experienced a spontaneous recovery from a severe bout of flu by the power of the mind. He didnt do any trying, he knew it was going to happen. Though he was not able to replicate his cure, the episode made him realize the power of the mind to improve health when nothing else works.This is a book for those, like the author, with multiple health challenges, particularly autoimmune diseases. The author discovered mindfulness and the book contains mindfulness-based mastery practices which will bring you increasing states of well-being.Mindfulness practice entails becoming aware of all the thoughts, images, emotions, and sensations we experience, moment by moment. It also entails becoming aware of all our behaviour from moment to moment.Dr. Berkelhammer tells us that the root cause of disease is physiological stress.Unnecessary suffering results from three related mechanisms:1) An unhealthy relationship to our inner subjective experiences, consisting of one or more of the following: a) cognitive fusion (an overidentification with our thoughts, emotions, images and sensations) b) judgement (criticism of self and others) and c) lack of awareness of thoughts, emotions, etc.2) Experiential avoidance: avoiding unpleasant thoughts, emotions, etc.3) Behavioural constriction or restriction. This is when in our quest to avoid or escape distressing thoughts, etc we choose not to engage in actions we value.Mindfulness practice can address all of these causes of unnecessary suffering.The author explains in depth the state of cognitive fusion, which is the state of mind in which we are so fused with our thoughts that they appear to be synonymous with fact: the literal truth. This is the result of not being in full contact with the present moment.Mindfulness practice, which tackles the problems of cognitive fusion and experiential avoidance, has considerable health benefits. It normalizes heart rate, heart rhythms, blood pressure and oxygen consumption, and helps you to become aware of your unhealthy habits and problematic behaviours. MBSR (Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction) is as effective as drugs in treating hypertension.The author states that practicing mindfulness is not complicated but it is not easy, since it requires an uncommon level of commitment. For those suffering from chronic health problems, mindfulness helps by allowing you to disengage from unhealthy thinking patterns, the end result being improved physiological functioning. The goal of mindfulness practices is to learn to live in full contact with the present moment.I must admit that I found this book exceedingly difficult to read and thus did not get through to the end. However, I found it to be impeccably written and its content to be of absolute importance. It has got me interested in mindfulness and I have in fact found a teacher to help me with it, but not as yet got started.The book is a good introduction to mindfulness and explains how valuable it is to those with health problems. But you will need considerable commitment, not only to get started on mindfulness, but to read the book, since it is not an easy read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBO0G9LYQUI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0991243706#wasThisHelpful","R2HBO0G9LYQUI","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didnt enjoy or appreciate this book as much as the other Silva books Ive recently reviewed, nor do I understand what precisely the term mental dynamics means in this context.Whereas in the other Silva books we learn Joss various techniques, I found this one to be more philosophical and discursive, and less practical.In the first chapter we learn the basic method of meditation - slowing our brain waves to around ten cycles per second of brain-wave activity. We are told that this is the state of being in which the mind tends to separate from the body, and the bodily intelligence with no interference from mind, adjusts and heals itself. This healing state of mind is called Alpha.The second chapter is entitled Switching your viewpoint to love. To use love as a force in our life we need to change our attitude or viewpoint toward the troublesome situation or event.Ive noticed that many of those leaving extremely negative reviews of Silva books on Amazon, for instance, express their dissatisfaction in very derogatory and unpleasant terms. These people have missed the loving aspect of Joss teachings, and it is thus no surprise that it is difficult for them to use the method successfully.We should use the affirmation Every day in every way Im getting better, better and better.We learn the five rules of happiness: 1) If you like a thing, enjoy it. 2) If you dont like a thing, avoid it. 3) If you dont like a thing and you cannot avoid it, change it. 4) If you dont like a thing, cannot avoid it, and cannot or will not change it, accept it. 5) You accept a thing by changing your viewpoint of it.Jos then teaches us the seven mighty principles. These are immutable laws of nature and cannot be changed or destroyed.We are introduced to the Golden Image technique, which can be used, for instance, to get rid of a bad habit.We learn to rid ourselves of unwanted past programming, and then to reprogramme.Before anything you want to happen can occur, you must desire that it happen, you must believe that it can happen and you must expect it to happen.There are chapters about weight control, motivation and procrastination and solving family problems.There are interesting stories from Joss personal experience in most of the chapters,I found this to be quite an interesting book, just in my view not up to the standard of the other Silva books, since it doesnt seem to contain all the many basic methods and techniques.If you love Joss books, you may not want to miss this one, but I personally did not find it to be an essential work.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7IKMIS63HUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671735624#wasThisHelpful","R2K7IKMIS63HUB","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Indigo children are a new kind of children who have been coming into the world in recent years. They are termed Indigos because their auras have been found to be indigo in colour.I've been somewhat disappointed by this book due to the fact that Lee Carroll did not seem to want to let us know about his role as channeller of Kryon, as though this was too ""weird"". Also, the role and function of Doreen Virtue, a main contributor to the book, as an angel expert I felt was extremely underplayed, as though this too was weird.  Also, there were so many different contributors to the book that I was somewhat confused as regards who was the author of whatever section I was reading.However, all in all I found it to be a useful book providing much valuable information about Indigos.I most appreciated the listing of the most common traits of Indigo children:1) They come into the world with a feeling of royalty.2) They have a feeling of deserving to be here.3) Self-worth is not an issue. They often tell the parents who they are.4) They have difficulties with absolute authority (without explanation or choice).5) They simply will not do certain things, for example stand in a queue.6) They get frustrated with systems that are ritual-oriented and don't require creative thought.7) They often see better ways of doing things and thus seem like ""system-busters"".8) They seem anti-social unless they are with their own kind. School is often extremely difficult for them socially.9) They will not respond to ""guilt"" discipline"" such as ""Just wait until your father comes home!""10)  They are not shy in letting you know what they need.Many of these children have been diagnosed with ADHD and ADD, since they have excessive amounts of energy, bore easily, have a short attention span and cannot sit still unless absorbed in something of their own interest. Many will be labelled as hyperactive trouble-makers who won't listen.""Indigos came to serve the planet, their parents, and their friends as emissaries from Heaven - bearers of wisdom, if listened to.""They appear to stay happy, are very spiritual, and have their own agenda.They demand much attention and can't figure out why others operate in anything other than love.The advice given is to treat Indigos with respect, help them create their own disciplinary solutions and give them choices about everything. "" ... if you give them authoritative, dictatorial orders without good, solid reasons, these kids will take you apart:""Indigos are open and honest - this is their greatest strength.There are sections written by various persons who themselves are parents of Indigo children and have thus special insight into them.We are advised not to medicate these children with Ritalin since it is obviously harmful, in that it causes biochemical imbalances.Instead, we could give the children a dietary supplement called Smart Start, which contains chelated minerals, antioxidant vitamins and ""botanicals"" (whatever these are, presumably something derived from plants). Many parents have found that this supplement helps tremendously. Other useful supplements are also recommended, particularly blue-green algae from Klamath Lake (before reading this book I had actually just ordered this supplement for myself to help me with detoxing).To sum up, I found this to be an important book in the understanding of these Indigo children, particularly since I have a grandchild who seems to be one. It provides helpful information and advice on how best to tackle them, and I would recommend it both to those with children with ADHD or ADD symptoms, or those who suspect their kids to be Indigos. (However, it is pointed out that not all Indigos have ADHD or ADD, and all those with these symptoms are not Indigos.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GL68V6GA1UPZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1561706086#wasThisHelpful","R1GL68V6GA1UPZ","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was Jos Silva's first book on the Silva Mind method. It is what I would call a ""must-read"". Learning this method should be made obligatory in all schools and be offered to children at an early age.Jos Silva learnt all that he presents in his Mind Control method in the course of working with his own children, years ago, to enable them to do well in school. When he experimented with mental training exercises, the children's school marks quickly began to improve, and, amazingly, they began to answer his questions before he had asked them - they had become clairvoyant!In this book, Jos begins by teaching us how to meditate, to reach Alpha, the state in which our brain waves vibrate at between 7 and 14 cycles per second. We create a mental screen on which we can visualize/imagine our goals, and project the bodies of the subjects we wish to heal, including ourselves.When imagining what we want, we need to desire that the event take place, believe that it will take place and expect it to take place.When we work in Alpha, we are in touch with Higher Intelligence and can only create good things. If, for example, we should try to give someone a headache, we are the ones that would get the headache, and/or we would snap out of Alpha.We hear how Jos once won 10,000 dollars after receiving a set of lottery numbers in a dream, and we learn how we ourselves can programme for dreams to solve specific problems - though he doesn't promise that we will win the lottery!There's a chapter about using our mind to improve our health, and we learn, specifically, how to get rid of headaches.We're informed about what I regard as the most exciting part of Silva, the method we now apparently are taught in the Silva Intuition Course, where we tune into unknown people, spot whatever problems they may have, and correct these problems.I learnt the Silva Method many years ago and had much success with it, but now I've taken a refresher course. Though much practice is necessary, I've had a few successes. For example, I tuned into a woman, saw that she had something crooked in her spine, and then immediately after saw the spine straighten out and correct itself. I learnt later that she had had back pains for many years, so I trust the problem has now been corrected. When we see these things clairvoyantly, and very clearly, we are in no doubt that what we see is real.One method of healing we learn in the book is as follows:1) Go to your meditative level and project the person onto your mental screen with whatever ailment is troubling him.2) Place another image on the screen to the left, showing something being done to correct the problem (or correcting the problem yourself).3) Now project onto the screen - still further left - a vivid image of the person in perfect health, filled with energy and optimism. By visualizing with conviction in Alpha and Theta you are causing. Visualize the results you want as being already achieved.Even persons addicted to hard drugs such as heroin and cocaine can be healed through the Silva method. I myself easily got rid of the smoking habit many years ago through a Silva technique - I programmed for 30 days that I would stop on a certain date, and when the day came I simply stopped from one day to the next, and never smoked again - in fact I could not.Although this books is from 1978, it is just as inspiring and useful now as back then. You are taught how to tackle all varieties of problems in yourself and others.I firmly recommend that everyone read this basic book on the Silva method, and perhaps also some of the others. Even better, you could participate in one of the Silva courses available throughout the world, as I understand.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGI18CW2U93UP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671739891#wasThisHelpful","RGI18CW2U93UP","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My edition of this book is from 1986, but it is still relevant today. It contains special, detailed information pertinent to business managers. Although I am not one, I still found it relevant.In the Silva Method we learn how to activate the right hemisphere of our brain by going to Alpha, where our brain waves pulsate at between 7 and 14 cycles per second. When we are in this state it is easier to programme for what we want in life with good effect.We learn how to use subjective communication with those with whom we are having difficulties. This form of communication is also done in Alpha, and is much more effective than objective communication (which is ordinary verbal communication).We go to our alpha level at night and programme to awake at the best time to programme for this problem person. When we wake up automatically, we go to our level again and imagine we are talking to him about the problem in a kind and loving way. We also move the picture slightly to the left and see the person drinking whatever he usually drinks. You programme him to activate the new, desired behaviour with every sip he takes,We learn various techniques to effectivize our programming with our co-workers,We must have both desire, expectation and belief if our programming is to work. This is the basic concept.We can prepare for a successful meeting with an important person by, for example, in Alpha, visualizing an expert, who will act as a consultant, by our side. We talk to the important person and present our concepts and ideas to him/her. We should consult with the expert if we are in doubt as to which points to cover. Ask, and ideas will come to us. Present these to the important person mentally. See him/her reacting favourably and positively to our presentation. He or she is receptive, understands the points we are covering, and accepts the proposal.The right hemisphere is our connection to the non-physical plane. This is the realm of Higher Intelligence. The expert is symbolic of this greater intelligence to which we have access.The two main principles behind successful subjective communication are 1) Communicate at Alpha 2) Communicate as if you and the recipient were one. We are part of an intelligence continuum that permeates the universe. We are all one. Jos knew this, even back then. When using subjective communication, avoid polarity. Avoid statements that put down or criticize. Communicate what is right, rather than who is right. Be truthful, be fair, be aboveboard.I found this book to be more advanced and complicated than Joss other books on the Silva Method, with many specific techniques and procedures suitable for use in a business with its own form of problems and potential difficulties. The programming we learn must always be beneficial for all concerned. If not, it will not work.It will be extremely useful for the business manager, who will by means of these techniques be able to communicate effectively with all his co-workers and business partners/contacts in a positive and helpful way, including changing to new, more acceptable, forms of behaviour.The book explains all the basic Silva techniques, but it may advisable to begin with a couple of the more basic books, such as The Silva Mind Control method, or How to get help from your other side.I thoroughly recommend this book to all business managers or the like.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28Z1QPS1W2DV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=013811000X#wasThisHelpful","R28Z1QPS1W2DV9","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Silva Method is the famous transformational method, whereby we learn to go to a deep meditational state, Alpha, thereby activating the right side of our brain, and by means of visualization/our imagination create the life we desire.The best, of course, is to take a Silva course, or courses, but I found this book to be extremely readable and helpful.I took many courses, and read the books, many moons ago. On re-reading this book, I see how the late Jos Silva was a man way ahead of his time, and in fact a highly developed being and a genius.Jos terms this help from the other side, or from God, our invisible means of support.Even back then he knew that the present age is a period of awakening, of expanded consciousness. Joss research, courses and books have enabled many millions of people throughout the world to expand their consciousness.The Silva Method is a way of relaxing the body and the mind and then using the slowed-down brain-wave frequency and the stepped-up right brain activity to produce some positive result.Picturing mentally, that is, using visualization and imagination, is a right-brain activity, and the right brain is connected to the other side. Jos tells us that our mental computer is then connected to a larger computer, and our need is heard, and then filled.We learn how to count ourselves down into the Alpha state, where our brain waves vibrate between 7 and 14 cycles per second, and are given a series of exercises, whereby we gradually learn to do more and more mental programming.We are taught to cancel out worry and replace it with positive, solution-oriented thinking. We learn how to programme for dreams that can help us find solutions to our problems.We pick two counsellors, one male and one female, whom we can consult when engaged in our healing work. These counsellors are in contact with what Jos terms Higher Intelligence, and can answer all our questions. We heal both ourselves and others.Jos also teaches us how to programme ourselves to obtain a deeper state of awareness by merely putting the thumb and first two fingers together (the Three Fingers Technique), so we can immediately access Alpha in a waking, Beta, state, when we need to solve pressing problems here and now.I remember once, years ago, when hurrying from the train and having only a few minutes in which to catch a bus, I had at the same time to buy something necessary from the station kiosk. I came running towards the kiosk, saw there was a long queue there, and placed my fingers in the required position, repeating mentally Let the queue spread, so I get to be first. (I know it sounds selfish, but I really needed to buy the item and at the same time catch the bus.) Suddenly, those in the queue seemed to lose focus, some left it, some apparently decided they needed to buy something more and went to get it, and others just turned away slightly. I ran in, and was served first. This technique is really wonderfully helpful, when youre in a rush or a critical situation.The book contains chapters on solving people problems, health problems, money problems and complicated problems.We are taught the invaluable tool of using subjective communication. This is communication between yourself and another party when in Alpha. You relax and imagine you see the person and hold a conversation with him/her in a loving way that suggests a solution to some mutual problem. This communication goes via the senders superconscious mind to the receivers conscious mind.I have used subjective communication many times with success, and have also used it successfully when wanting a loan from my bank, which had previously been denied me (even though this was not a mutual problem),You can use subjective communication with your spouse, children, parents, in-laws, employer, fellow workers, law enforcers or friends. Remember to communicate in a loving way.We learn an important technique called the Glass of Water Technique, which can be used mostly for people problems.What I have here presented are some of the basic precepts and techniques dealt with in the book. But it contains much, much more than these.I highly recommend that you read the book, which is clearly and simply written and very readable. Jos includes several fascinating success stories from his own life and experience, and it is thus in no way a dull book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U7S39KJMY9WF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671679449#wasThisHelpful","R1U7S39KJMY9WF","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All three of Monroes books are unique and amazing. To my knowledge, he was the first to explore OBEs at length and to report about them.This is Monroes third book. The only problem I have with it is his prevalent use of acronyms without always letting us know what they stand for, or not at first.He tells us about his INSPEC (Intelligent Species) friend, whom he generally met with past the H Band noise.  This is the peak of uncontrolled thought that emanates from all living forms on Earth, particularly humans. It is Ms opinion that this Noise contains not only current time thought patterns, but all that ever existed. Passing through it quickly is advisable.M wonders who his INSPEC friend really is. He has a strong light around him. Is he an ET? He reads Ms thoughts, and replies that he is not an ET as M means it. M describes him as a brightly glowing figure that some  would interpret as a god, an angel. He is told that he doesnt have the experience to understand who he is. M just needs to ask and help will come. He is not from another planet and is not God.M then receives from the being a surge of enormous energy, an immensely powerful vibration of very high frequency. He terms this a ROTE, short for Related Organized Thought Energy, a sort of ball of condensed thought and ideas.The INSPEC tells Monroe that though his (Ms) goal now is service to humanity, when he is no longer human, his desire will focus in another direction. M finds a new goal  to go and be in what he construes as Home.After meeting with the INSPEC again, he is allowed to return Home; there he experiences many-hued cloud towers  music  a thousand instruments, thousands of voices. He finds patterns in a repeating loop, everything exactly the same  nothing new, nothing different. He sees curls of energy playing games, joins in, but tires of it. He doesnt want to be around in the same clouds forever, with the same music over and over. He realizes theres nothing there for him now. Thats why he left and now he doesnt want to come back. He returns depressed.INSPEC then takes him to an era on Earth where human organization is different. There are about 2 million people there. He is told that it is a place of the past, about a million years ago. The people do not wear clothes, but it is not a primitive society. They communicate by telepathy and control the weather. There is no conflict, and the people dont die.He asks the INSPEC if he could be shown one non-physical non-human intelligence which he can easily talk to. INSPEC then guides him to one  he flies out past the moon and sees an extremely large flying saucer. Out of this steps a short, chubby man who absolutely resembles W.C. Fields! This hologram invites M aboard the vessel. He apparently is not Fields nor a human. He explains that he is an exporter, who gathers jokes, which his civilization apparently needs. (This all seems very strange to me, but that is what the being explained.)Then M asks to visit the most mature and evolved human in physical earth, living in his time reference. Suddenly he is in a room with a being whose sex he cannot determine and whom he thus refers to as a Heshe. The beings radiation of light is astounding  it is like standing in bright spring sunlight that was filled with every human emotion that ever existed. Heshe has only lived the one lifetime  one continuous lifetime for 1800 years. M feels he has met the being previously. He gave up eating and sleeping years ago.

"I received this book free in return for a review.The subject of the book is vitally important, since in this day and age most of us have bodies filled with toxic substances, and suffer from many life-style diseases. The doctors cant cure us, so we need to cure ourselves, and the solution is to detoxify ourselves  cleanse our bodies of all the toxins weve filled ourselves with through our atrocious eating habits, as well as the many weve picked up, inadvertently, from our environment, including the personal hygiene products and cleansing substances we use.For the invaluable information in this book I would have given 5 stars, had it not been for the fact that I found the style of the book so heavy that it was exceedingly difficult for me to plough through it, and in fact didnt make it to the end. Of course, this could have been because I wasnt totally ready to commit to detoxifying.The author tells us his personal story. He smoked heavily, including numerous marijuana joints a day (though marijuana has now been revealed to have curative properties); he also snorted cocaine and drank too much wine. He was diagnosed with lung cancer and decided to heal himself by consulting alternative practitioners and cleansing his body. He took herbs, fasted and did colonics. He sat in a sauna, and had his liver and gallbladder flushed.He realized he also needed to release long-suppressed anger and fear. He had had a lifetime of abusive habits and excessive drinking led to non-viral hepatitis.He intended this book to be a basic self-health-care manual that outlines what a high-level health maintenance programme should look like.He shows us how to:1) Greatly reduce the incidence of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimers2) Vitalize and energize our aging experience3) Greatly reduce our reliance on allopathic medications4) Greatly enhance our mental function5) Release old traumas and give new meaning and purpose to the latter part of our life.The author discusses adrenal fatigue, metabolic syndrome, leaky bowel syndrome, yeast overgrowth, microorganisms, heavy metal poisoning and digestive disorders.He advises us to find an alternative health practitioner to support us in our healing process. Unfortunately, I couldnt find a good one, neither did I have the financial means to consult one. He strongly believes in the benefits of colonics, which he himself obtained much help from. (I myself cant avail myself of this treatment, since I have Crohns and no colonic therapist in this country will treat Crohns patients.) He also recommends ionizing foot baths, which I myself have tried and will use again. I had strong detox reactions to taking such foot baths, which signified to me that they were extremely effective.There is a chapter on weight loss and weight management.Moroney gives us the five important laws of total body detoxification:1) It takes physical energy and a powerful commitment to detoxify the body.2) You cannot detoxify beyond what you are willing to release emotionally.3) Total body detoxification is an essential component of any consciousness-raising and healing effect.4) Suppressing emotional pain and trauma creates energy blocks in the body that attract and hold toxins, which will be released only when the blocks are dissolved.5) The greater the amount of toxins stored in your body, the more sensitive you are to environmental onslaughts and the less capable you become at coping with stressful situations.There is a section on methylation, which can be inadequate or excessive and lead to all sorts of disorders, but unfortunately I havent at all understood what methylation is, except that it is a chemical conversion procedure.The book contains a list of seven donts:1) Eliminate refined flour and sugar 2) Eliminate trans fats 3) Eliminate foods containing excitotoxins  aspartame, MSG, etc. 4) Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake 5) Dont drink pasteurized cows milk and limit dairy products as a whole. 6) Limit your intake of grains and starches, particularly wheat and soy 7) Avoid drugs and medications, unless your life depends on them.There are chapters about disease beginning in the colon, the lymphatic system, liver-gallbladder cleansing, detoxifying the kidneys, heart disease, etc, etc.A negative factor was that I did not find any reference to coconut oil, which is an essential nutrient, particularly to prevent and cure dementia. It is the absolute best oil to use in cooking. Nor did I see any reference to the importance of drinking water, though I may have missed such reference.To sum up, this book contains the main essentials of detoxification and nutrition, as far as I can see, and the author understands and stresses the importance of the mind-body connection.However the book is no easy read, especially, perhaps, the later chapters. I wont directly recommend the book owing to the latter factor, but if you are determined to detox, the book will provide you with useful pointers and perhaps you will be able to carry through a total detoxification process. Good luck!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FAVC5XIZNQV9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0972433511#wasThisHelpful","R1FAVC5XIZNQV9","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the latest of the Kryon books, and since its about 2013 and beyond, the information disclosed is very relevant to us now, in 2014.We are reminded that the new Mayan cycle (which began on 21st December 2012) represents the potential for the highest consciousness that humanity has ever seen. Lee Carroll states: There is a great shift going on and a full recalibration of everything we have become used to as old souls and lightworkers on Earth.We are told that the rescue of the 33 miners in Chile in 2012 was a profound metaphor for the birth of mother energy in South America, and it was the FIRST MASS COMPASSIONATE EVENT that has affected the planet, and that represented the energy of joy and celebration. The energy of compassion changes the planet. No 33 is the last identified master number. The number 33 means The Compassion of the Christ. The earthquake said to be the contributing factor to the mines weakness happened at 3.33 a.m. After the cave-in, there were 33 days of drilling before the 33 miners were found. And there were many other such synchronicities in the story involving the number 33.In the channellings contained in the book, Kryon continually refers to us, the listeners and the readers, as old souls.This recalibration is about being able to stay on this planet in health and in happiness without drama or fear.Kryon informs us that old souls have such profound self-worth issues because for hundreds of years weve been beat up. In an older energy, everything we did was met with resistance. Now this is changing. We are going to have to love ourselves more. There is a Universe inside us called cellular structure with trillions of pieces of DNA. These pieces are starting to react and are becoming ready for our instruction sets to be given.Self-worth is a programme! We have to tell ourselves what we want. Dear cellular structure, I deserve to be here. This is my time .. Im important in the scheme of the earth . Get rid of inappropriate, emotional issues that keep me from moving forward into my beauty and power.Kryon sees a healed planet, eventually with new science  a planet where there is no permanent disease and where clean water is never an issue. He sees a time where all humans have electricity.Everyone will not become enlightened. We match bearers represent less than one-half of one percent of the human population.Very slowly. A softening is taking place, moving the energy of the planet more from the masculine into the feminine. It is balancing the imbalanced.Africa is going to be the New World within 75 years.Old energy dies kicking and screaming. Old energy does not surrender ever.There will continue to be earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and storms.He tells us that Tesla and Einstein are back. I presume he means they have reincarnated again.There is an interesting, short chapter by Lee Carroll on what it feels like to channel Kryon.The change of consciousness on this planet has changed the centre of the galaxy: There, there is a black hole, which is a duality. And it knows who we are.Theres a discussion about evil. Kryon doesnt say evil doesnt exist, but that all the darkness on the planet has come from human beings.A note to us lightworkers  if were constantly creating light, darkness does not have a chance. Darkness cant touch us.Were also illuminated about the Crystalline Grid. Everything that takes place on the planet, which humans create, stays here as energy. Every situation where energy is created stays in the Crystalline Grid.We are a piece of the soup of God, which is measured in innumerable parts, yet all is one. When you are in touch with your Higher Self, youre in touch with all the parts of you.This is just an iota of the material presented in this latest Kryon book. In short, it is another exciting book that will keep our eyes glued to its pages. Most of the channellings are from 2012, but a few are from 2013.Enjoy this new Kryon book, which I highly recommend!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JEZEGOMTFUXN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1888053224#wasThisHelpful","R2JEZEGOMTFUXN","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a book about Reconnective healing, the second one by Eric Pearl, and the first by Frederick Ponzlov. The latter is the channeller of Solomon, who here provides us with further information about this exciting new form of healing, and much more.Frederick Ponslov, or Fred, as he was referred to in The Reconnection, has been channelling for many years but, as far as I know, this is the first time his channellings have appeared in print.Solomon is actually the sum total of two different entities. The entity that first spoke through Fred was Aaron, while the intelligence Pearl and Fred have called Solomon appeared later.Solomon speaks in the first person singular and at other times in the first person plural.He repeats points throughout the book. We are informed that the material is written on many levels, with layers of meaning.I did not find this material easy to read or comprehend. At the beginning, it seemed as though Solomon was speaking only to Eric, the author, but finally I began to understand that he was talking to all of us. Solomon speaks in such a metaphorical, abstract and vague way that often it is hard to know what he actually means.Solomon says that they have been here for us before, and have always been here. He is only an intermediary to greater energy. He tells us that we are a chain leading to the centre, That Which Is. He is here to help us remember who we are, the greatness that we are and the greatness that is in all human life-forms.He says that his energy comes from a different space, from unending Source.There is no separateness between us: we are all here as one. We have our own vibration  but we are of the same sound.We are told that they are here for us, have come here to help us. We need to help integrate all we take in, and take care of this energy and nurture it.He informs us that people will desire the energy, but when they come in touch with it, they will go into reaction, start to resist, and then go into complacency, and that this is denial.He says: There is an energy that comes organically from your own life force. I assume he means the reconnective energy.There is much to come. It will happen organically, on its own. It is going to be wonderful.Process gets result, The path we are on is taking us somewhere special, and we must trust that it will open our hearts in a grand way.We were put on this planet to experience joy. The bottom line is to become compassionate with other people.I found this to be a deep, immaculately expressed, but rather abstruse book. I will need to buy it and read it again, perhaps again and again, in order to properly digest the material.I highly recommend that you read this insightful book once you have read Pearls first book, The Reconnection and connected with the energy, but perhaps not before.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXGMJ86K26LT8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401942954#wasThisHelpful","RXGMJ86K26LT8","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unfortunately, I didn't find this book particularly readable at first, which is why I didn't manage to get it finished before I had to return it to the library.However its theme/message is of utmost importance. We all need to let go, to surrender our personal will to the Divine Will, and to be in the moment.Life becomes easier when you learn to let go. ""Burdens will lift or lessen."" Surrendering ""involves reprogramming old habits and being willing to let go of the drama.""Dr. Orloff has seen the transformative effects of surrender on her patients' health as well as on her own. She asserts that surrender is a secret to health and beauty.We need to practice both intellectual, emotional, physical/sensual and spiritual surrender.The author divides the book into 13 parts, the 13 surrenders.The 1st surrender deals with redefining true success, power and happiness. Stop comparing yourself to others and build self-esteem.The chapter on the 2nd surrender comprises four vital insights into power and letting go. 1) We need to break the trance of the reptilian brain and surrender old behaviours and ineffective communication styles. 2) We need to surrender to our spiritual power, using soft power instead of hard power, i.e. activating endorphins, the feel-good hormones, oxytocin, the love or cuddle hormone and serotonin, the happiness hormone, instead of adrenalin, the fight-or-flight hormone, testosterone, the sex and power hormone and dopamine, the pleasure hormone. We must get out of our mind and into our heart. 3) We need to wield light powers, not shadow powers. 4) We must learn when to practice power versus powerlessness.The 3rd surrender consists of manifesting the heart of money: seeing beyond material seduction and fear. We are given three strategies to transform our relationship with money. With regard to money, we are divided into three types. The Worrier, the Procrastinator and the Spending Addict.The 4th surrender is learning the art of reading people. Here we surrender to new forms of knowing. The 5th surrender is cultivating impeccable communication. This is a surrender because you learn to know when to be assertive and when to let go. This chapter includes a useful section on how to communicate with anger addicts, passive aggressive people, narcissists, guilt trippers and gossips.The 6th surrender is about honouring soul mates, soul friends and animal companions. Intimate relationships challenge us to open our heart and become a more confident and more giving person.The 7th surrender relates to exploring the divinity of your body and sexuality. This chapter includes keys to a positive body image and weight.Igniting your sexual power is the 8th surrender. It comprises basic strategies of sexual surrender, one section about claiming your sexual power and one about surrendering to the ecstasy of orgasms and exploring ""sacred play"".The 9th surrender deals with discovering the sensual essence of the natural world and includes a section about surrender to the Earth and meeting your power animals and messengers.The 10th surrender is about harmonizing with illness and pain. Surrender doesn't mean giving in or giving up. Illness can wake you up physically, emotionally and spiritually. ""Surrender means knowing you are not just your diagnosis, your genes, your pain, your addiction or even your body. You are a radiant soul."" The surrender the author suggests is to harmonize with illness and pain, not to resist them. ""Resistance can amplify suffering whereas flowing with symptoms diminishes them.""The 11th surrender is experiencing radiant aging: the secret of slowing down time, while the 12th surrender is making peace with death and the afterlife.Much of this is fascinating, invaluable. The author asks the question: ""What is your perfect death?"" No, 6 is ""Having an orgasm"". No. 7 is ""Death by chocolate"". Ha, ha!Each chapter contains useful exercises, various tests and a surrender affirmation.Finally, she offers us this prayer of love for the planet:""Bless all of the earth's creatures, light, dark, or struggling. Bless all the twinkling beings in and around us. Love is large enough to hold us all. Joy is expansive without limit, leaving no one out. May our surrender, or bliss, come from loving ourselves, each other and the earth.""This is a valuable, well-written book, and I would absolutely recommend that you read it. You may need to read it a couple of times in order to integrate its content. The book will help you lead your life easily and effortlessly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL4XRJZ02TVDY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307338207#wasThisHelpful","RL4XRJZ02TVDY","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an immensely valuable book for those with an auto-immune disease (I have several). The author, who is a doctor, herself developed Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and this meant that she had to cure this auto-immune disease herself, since traditional medicine had no satisfactory answers.She found out that the four steps to healing and preventing auto-immune disease are:1) Using food as medicine2) Understanding the stress connection3) Healing your gut4) Supporting your liver.The ingestion of gluten is believed to cause auto-immune disease, and genetic modification of crops like corn, soy and wheat exacerbates the problem. Modern-day diets in general trigger the development of auto-immune disease.Also, a diet high in animal-based foods such as dairy, eggs and beef can promote inflammation and throw off the balance of good bacteria that live in your gut.Potential triggers are chronic stress, hormone imbalance and infections.The author discusses gluten, celiac disease and gluten sensitivity and foods bad for your immune system, such as sugar and saturated animal fat and trans fats from processed foods. She informs us about the benefits of an anti-inflammatory diet, and other ""good stuff"", including essential fatty acids, vitamin D, selenium, zinc and green tea. Each part of the book includes a workbook for each theme and beneficial recipes.We are informed of which foods to avoid and which to include.There are three valuable chapters on stress, and tests to enable us to assess our degree of stress.We are told about leaky gut syndrome and how to heal our gut. Important additions to our diet are coconut oil and probiotics.The author includes three chapters on supporting your liver, and edifies us about toxins such as mercury, lead, plastics, pesticides, prescription medicines, heavy metals, vaccinations and xenoestrogens - the latter being chemicals that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body.We need to detoxify our body, and remove metals by means of glutathione. Heavy-metal chelating agents include chlorella, cilantro and fibre.This is an absolutely valuable, excellently-written book on healing auto-immune diseases, perhaps the only one of its kind. I highly recommend that you purchase this book.

"This is a book that could actually change your life.Dr. Pearl was a successful chiropractor when he began to have strange experiences (he had in fact since birth, and probably before, had strange experiences).He began to treat people by waving his hands intuitively through their aura, after which they moved their head, eyes and other parts of the body in unexpected ways, and also channelled messages for him. Miracles happened  his patients were cured of incurable ailments.Pearl had been advised to get hold of a moldavite crystal, and it turned out this stone had the ability to open up communication with angels, entities and beings from other planets. Pearl states: I put the stone in my pocket, and the channelling started.The messages channelled by the various patients were the same:1) We are here to tell you to continue what you are doing.2) What you are doing is bringing light and information to the planet.3) What you are doing is reconnecting strands.4) What you are doing is reconnecting strings.5) You must know that you are a master.6) Weve come because of your reputation.Now he is telling us how to connect with this energy, or rather he says that this will happen merely by our reading the book. This has happened to me, and I was also fortunate to get help and healing from a friend, which has strengthened my connection. I feel the energy in my hands, and sometimes in my head. When connected, sometimes my right foot moves involuntarily, and I feel a coldness in my right leg, or both legs.With this method you do not send energy, but receive it. Pearl states that it is not faith healing, and it greatly surpasses energy healing. Reconnective healing is not a technique. It transcends technique. You are this healing energy, and it is you. It emanates from you the moment you focus your attention on it. You work with it by noticing it, by allowing your attention to fall onto it.The book includes instructions whereby we can heal ourselves and carry out distant healing.If you dont feel you completely get the hang of the method, you might be lucky to find someone in your area who can carry out the Reconnection for you. This will connect you with the healing energy.This important book is clearly and amusingly written. Pearl has his own distinctive, humorous style. I highly recommend that you read it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BLSKH0LRN00F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401902103#wasThisHelpful","R2BLSKH0LRN00F","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a follow-up on Monroe's classic work ""Journeys out of the body"". Here I would like to say that Monroe's three books as a whole constitute a unique contribution to scientific knowledge: our understanding of the Universe/universes takes a great leap forward after reading them.As the author states in chapter 1 of this book regarding OBEs, ""You can visit a friend three thousand miles away, you can explore the moon, the solar system, and the galaxy ... you can enter other reality systems only dimly perceived and theorized by our time/space consciousness"".He has found that his innumerable OBEs have led to his body rejecting all chemicals, including alcohol, prescription drugs and caffeine. During surgery he rejects the anesthesia and wakes up (not very nice). When gambling (playing cards) he knows what the cards are without seeing them, so always wins.He tells us about his work at the Monroe Institute and the development of hemi-sync. This creates simultaneously an identical wave form in both brain hemispheres. (You can down-load a hemi-sync mp3 from the Monroe Institute's web-site.) Using the process can apparently remove psychotic symptoms, improve sleep and memory, inter alia. It has ""a great ability to focus and hold attention"".Monroe informs us about the Gateway Programme, in which various states of consciousness were investigated. Focus 10, for example, was ""mind awake, body asleep"". ""Participants learn to move into what is called Focus 12, where all physical-data input is shut off and the consciousness can reach out and begin to perceive in ways other than through the five senses."" The Gateway Programme first surmounts the Fear Barrier (fear of the unknown, of change).The borders between this and other reality-energy systems are crossed. Reunions with ""dead"" friends and family are reported, as well as encounters with other forms of intelligent energy not generally recognized.The basic effect of the Hemi-Sync process is to provide an access to many levels of consciousness simultaneously.  (I don't really understand this, I admit,)We are given reports by people in the Programme who have had various amazing experiences.The so-called Explorer team makes innumerable visits to inner space, or whatever it is. Reports from these visits, as they occur, are not only given in this book but also available as free downloads from the Institute's web-site.Explorers communicate with and are helped by beings they encounter and given much interesting information. For example, plants exist on levels 1-7, animals on levels 8-14. Levels 15-21 ""are what you call human life on this Earth"". A person that progresses to level 21 cannot go higher unless he is willing to give up human form. Levels 22-28 are the levels you enter upon death.One Explorer is told that part of one's energy may be used to develop a personality and one may have several personalities going on at the same time, being developed at the same time in the physical reality. She is informed that she has one that is old, one crippled, one male, but she is not ready to know where they are.Our energy can inhabit other places than Earth, and is aware of all these other places. We do not inhabit bodies like human Earth bodies but ""other forms of things or beings"". One is ""like a gelatin kind of thing ... slimy kinds of things"". These forms we inhabit are thousands of light years away.Monroe writes that all of the Explorer material poses more questions than it answers, and I can confirm this.Beings encountered have the ability to remove the energy essence of a human from his physical body without ""disrupting his biologic systems"". They utilize the vocal cords to communicate with us and have total access to the ""memory storage lodged in the individual"". They can and did move that extracted human essence to various other sites/realities and returned it in safety. The entire history of humankind and Earth is available to them in the most minute detail.All other intelligent species than man, either in the physical universe or in other energy systems, use non-verbal communication (NVC).Monroe encounters a high glowing being reminiscent of God (but, apparently, not God) who calls him ""Mister Monroe"" and provides him with information in NVC. He meets with this being several times and is greatly reassured by their contact, until he is told that they can no longer meet. (As far as I remember, it is because Monroe has now reached the stage where he can find out things for himself.)Monroe (who is often referred as RAM) also has continued unexpected meetings with a character called BB who is looking for someone called AA. Sometimes Monroe saves people in these realms, but generally they suddenly disappear again. BB or Monroe perhaps too originally come from a planet/system/place called KT-95.The book contains detailed, scientific information relating to Monroe's and the Explorers' voyages. These voyages are fascinating and provide new information. Drawbacks are that Monroe presents the material in such a way that it is often difficult to comprehend, and his use of abbreviations and special terms, not immediately defined, complicates matters greatly.However, nonetheless, I highly recommend that you read this unique, illuminating book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNWK9XQ8HNPHQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385231822#wasThisHelpful","RNWK9XQ8HNPHQ","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dain Heer is one of the main figures in Access Consciousness, and this weird book (to use a term Dain often applies to himself and others like him) presents the basic precepts of Access.I have previously heard Dain Heer on shows on the net, so Access and Dainss way of being are not new to me. Even so, I did not always find this book easy to comprehend, Though I absolutely agree with everything I did get.As indicated by the books title, Dains basic concept seems to be, if you dared to really be you, this would change the world. And he is definitely doing his bit.We are told that this is not a book of answers, but of questions. We are introduced to several basic questions we can start asking the Universe:1) How does it get any better than this? (to be asked both when something good, and something bad, happens)2) Whats right about this Im not getting? (I understand that by getting he here means understanding)3) What would it take to change this?4) What else is possible?5) What would it take for this to turn out better than I could have imagined?6) Who am I today and what grand and glorious adventures am I going to have?Dain contends that when we start asking these questions, great things will start to happen.One of the main features of Access is the clearing statement, which is formulated a bit strangely, but when youre working with the problem or matter to be cleared, it is, again, contended, that clearing does in fact occur. My life hasnt changed because of Access, but I have several times felt a bit lighter during a clearing.The clearing statement is:Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, POD and POC, All Nine, Shorts, Boys and Beyond.Another of Dains contentions is that something that is true for you always makes you feel lighter, while a lie always makes you feel heavier.So you can always check whether to believe what people say, and whether you should do this or that. I must confess I cant always feel whether something makes me feel lighter or heavier, but apparently practice makes perfect. And the words in this book do make me feel lighter.Dain wants to change the world, and he divides us who live in it into two categories  humans and humanoids. Humans constitute the majority  those whore satisfied with things the way they are, while humanoids are those like Dain who want a big change in the world. Humanoids are the ones this book was written for  those who are willing to step into being the difference that you are  the non-judgment, the caring, the joy, the peace, the connection and the awareness of a different possibility.We need to stop being judgmental and to claim our own potency. We need to let go of the idea that we are wrong. Throughout our life we have taken on ourselves beliefs that we are wrong, but these beliefs actually belong to others.What we need to do is at times to ask the question Who does this belong to?.  If we feel lighter, then whatever it is were thinking of isnt ours and should be returned to sender (whoever sender is). The contention is that 98% of all our feelings and thoughts dont belong to us, and should be returned to sender. You, being you, are light. You trying to be someone else are heavy.This book is a different sort of book. I would conjecture that Dain has a strong Uranus in his horoscope. Even the set-up of this book is different and strange. When you think youve got to the end of the chapter, you havent  there are a couple of pages more. Dain even uses language differently  he keeps talking, not about who you are, but who you be.I find the book refreshing, and am planning on taking at least the first Access course. I recommend that you read the book, if you think you also are a humanoid , and want to be you, and change the world (and you must be, if youre reading this review).","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RI0MSBKQZKY2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1939261023#wasThisHelpful","RI0MSBKQZKY2N","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This has proved to be an extremely important book for me personally, since David Hawkins has with his information set me on a palpable path of self-healing. More about this later.Hawkins continues to refer to his map of consciousness, where the various states of mind have been allocated values ranging from 0-1000. All those calibrated as having values below 200 are negative states and regarded as levels of falsehood, while those above 200 are levels of truth. Above level 200 one is no longer a victim. Enlightenment calibrates between 700 and 1000.The various states are calibrated through kinesiology or muscle-testing.Hawkins has previously suffered from innumerable life-threatening conditions. He healed himself by letting go of resisting the pain and various symptoms of the conditions and cancelling the mental label. He affirmed: I am an infinite being, and I am not subject to that. I am only subject to what I hold in mind.I already knew about this precept of affirming that one is an infinite being and thus not subject to illness, poverty or other calamities from the late Japanese master Taniguchi. I have read and reviewed several of his  valuable - books in the Truth of Life series. This assertion/belief forms the basis of the Seicho-No-Ie movement, thousands of members of which have healed themselves of innumerable otherwise incurable diseases. Though I greatly appreciated these teachings I was apparently not at the time ready to be healed.What was illuminating for me in Hawkins book was his instruction that we let go of resisting the sensory experience. Again, this was not new to me, since Abraham (as channeled by Esther Hicks) also tells us that we can easily heal ourselves of all diseases simply by letting go of resistance. However, I found it difficult to do this and did not feel anything while trying to do so. Until reading this book, that is.The author explained that he had healed himself of all his diseases within time periods of a few months up to two years (for one disease) by using this technique. When I tried it I felt immediate relief from my pains. They were still there, just as before, but it just didnt matter. This was just as Hawkins had stated would be the case. Not only that but each time I let go of resistance to the pain a wave of energy flowed through me, activating various detox/chemicalization reactions in the form of a gentle itching and various minor symptoms throughout my body, so I knew healing was occurring (I experience these symptoms each time I receive some sort of healing). This wave of energy was accompanied by a strong feeling of well-being, at times ecstatic/blissful, together with the sensation of a hand being placed on the top of my head.I am continuing to experience this ecstatic wave of healing throughout my body and am deeply grateful to Hawkins.Im not saying that everyone carrying out this process on him/herself will experience this reaction. Hawkins himself does not mention it. I have been working on myself in various ways during the past years and now everything seems to be coming together. It is like a miracle for me, and it was this book that triggered the healing.I found this to be a fantastic, illuminating book, since the author is so open about his personal experiences and because of the way he explains how he personally was successful in healing himself, we are enabled to believe that we can heal ourselves too.There are chapters about how to cope with fear, losing weight, depression, alcoholism, cancer, etc, etc. The process of letting go of resistance can be used for everything, indeed one can let go of resistance to life itself. It has transformed my life.A valuable section of the book is the final one entitled About the author, where Hawkins describes his life and his wonderful spiritual experiences/higher states of consciousness. I personally experience the ecstatic/blissful wave of healing just by reading a page or two of the book, or even a few lines for that matter. He refers to a sweet, delicious band of energy continuously flowing up the spine and into the brain. This resembles what I experience when reading the book.Again, I certainly cant promise that everyone or even anyone else will have this experience, but, particularly if you have severe health problems, I would absolutely recommend that you read the book and try out the letting go of resistance technique.The author, who is an extremely intelligent and gifted man, has experienced so many serious health issues and calamities in his life that it is as if he has experienced these things precisely so he would have to work out how to deal with them (which in view of his giftedness he was uniquely qualified to do), just so he could through his writings subsequently inform us of the solutions he found, thus contributing to our healing and development.Now Im going to work my way through all David Hawkins books, since Ive now become addicted to his work!Read the book!P.S. Ive just discovered that I previously reviewed a book by Howard Raphael Cushnir entitled Unconditional Bliss, where I chose the title for the review as Let go of resistance, accept everything and eventually experience bliss. I now see that this is true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CDN1AKSW3UJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0971500797#wasThisHelpful","R3CDN1AKSW3UJI","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the Kryon books and I generally give them 5 stars. However, I didnt find this one as rewarding as I usually find these books. This was mostly because I read it too late  it deals with the energies of the years 2000-2012, and we are now in 2014. Thus, the book wasnt captivating as it otherwise would have been.In the first part of the book Kryon gives us a metaphor about the human train, about how we have changed tracks. We took a higher track, leaving the old one and all its old energy predictions behind.Kryon talks about the circle of the now. Our path is not a straight line, but a circle. I wont say much more about the main content of the book for the above-mentioned reason.The book consists of channellings before the millennium change, channellings after passing the marker, i.e. after crossing to the year 2000, up to June 2000, together with additional chapters not comprising Kryon material. These latter include a short article by Jan Tober about the death phantom (which I didnt really understand) and an interview with Jan Tober by Rick Martin about the Indigo children, which I found illuminating.These children are characterized by having a blue aura (hence the name), being hyperactive, wild, with amazing energy, and extremely intuitive and creative. They often get ADHD and ADD diagnoses. They may require supplements of magnesium, B6 and amino acids. They come from the tenth dimension with a message of love. They are wise and know they deserve to be here. They act like royalty.Jan Tober channels Tobias of the Kryon Entourage.The final chapters of the book include material by Marc Valle and Woodie Vaspra about the work they are carrying out to organize a World Council of Elders of indigenous peoples so as to make their wisdom available for the good of all humanity. This is something Kryon has suggested on at least two occasions when addressing the U.N.To sum up, this book is obviously worth reading, since its a Kryon book, but I wont directly recommend that you do, since, as stated above, its a book we should have read years ago, when it first came out!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K8L5CGC7LOCO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1888053119#wasThisHelpful","R2K8L5CGC7LOCO","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The author has penned many books on related occult subjects. I found this one ok, but not brilliant. I didnt get to contact any angels or spirit guides, but I did feel a shift in that I now feel I can and eventually will obtain contact with these, and that is a good start.The book is divided into two parts, the first on angel guardians and the second on spirit guides. In Part One we are provided with information about the history of angels and about seven Archangels. These are Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Sariel and Remiel. I missed Ariel. Metatron is also mentioned. He was originally a human being, Enoch, who was transformed into an angel. The author refers to him as King of the Angels. Were also told about the Queen of Angels. The Virgin Mary. This must be the one I know as Mother Mary, but Webster doesnt mention this appellation.We are given useful instructions on how to invoke the Archangels.Were told that our guardian angels will communicate to us through our thoughts and feelings, our intuition and our dreams. Though Ive asked many times, I have never seen or heard from my guardian angel in my dreams. I did once in my youth get a sudden knowing of something I had to do, which I did, and this turned out to save my life and that of others too. This was perhaps my guardian angel, though I didnt know that at the time.One chapter that I didnt appreciate was about how to create your guardian angel if you cant contact it by the other methods mentioned. The author suggested that angels were just thoughtforms and therefore we could create one. This may be so, but I didnt like the idea. I like to regard the angels as real.We learn which Archangels correspond to our star signs. Michael rules over Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, Gabriel over Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces, Raphael over Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, and Uriel over Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. The author gives us four methods by which to call the Archangels to us. He doesnt suggest that these also are thought forms, but I expect he thinks they are, since they also are angels,He provides us with a prayer by which we can help heal others. It reads May the healing power of Jesus Christ descend upon (persons name) and may the holy angels encompass him (or her). This prayer activates Raphael and the other healing angels to come to the persons aid.Part One contains several additional interesting chapters, including one on creating an angel altar.In Part Two of the book we learn about spirit guides, which the author tells us are people who have passed over into the next life. They are here to help and guide us when we ask for advice. We should ask for help only when it is really necessary.Spirit guides are usually, but not always, deceased relatives. I feel it would be nice to know who these are, and how many we have.Much information is provided about spiritualism, including about the Fox sisters and the famous medium Daniel Dunglas Home.A chapter about ways to contact spirit guides contains sections about planchettes and Ouija boards, automatic writing, table-tipping, using a pendulum, etc. In other books we are warned about using Ouija boards for fear of picking up negative spirits. (In my youth a friend did so and couldnt get rid of it again.) I will try automatic writing again myself.In automatic writing the pen moves over the page directed by a power other than the conscious mind of the person holding it.I did find this book worth reading, but just not particularly exciting. The author provides various useful exercises and pieces of advice which could help us in our quest for contact with our angel guardians and spirit guides,","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T6HI3F8RN604/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567187951#wasThisHelpful","R2T6HI3F8RN604","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an important book.By means of communication through mediums and channels, Robert Schwartz examines the subject of pre-birth planning by having these interview angels, spirit guides and the souls of selected persons exposed to severe life challenges. We are given access to pre-birth conversations and thus gain direct information regarding how we arrange difficult life events beforehand with all the involved persons.Six types of challenges are dealt with, a chapter being devoted to each. These are physical illness, parenting handicapped children, deafness and blindness, drug addiction and alcoholism, death of a loved one and, finally, accidents.I was previously aware of the concept of pre-birth planning, but this well-written book has illuminated the matter clearly for me and I have been much comforted by reading it. Partly, I have myself considerable health challenges and have been aware of the fact that they had meaning, but have now been confirmed of this. The book has comforted me. Also, the book has taught me to respect brave persons I encounter who I understand have chosen their hard lot in life for purposes of growth.In the first chapter about physical illness, we meet Jon, who chose both to have AIDS and be gay. Jon planned the experience of having AIDS, not just for his own learning, but for the growth of his entire soul group. The progress we as personalities make on the Earth plane expands both our individual souls and every soul in our group. The disease of AIDS is about splitting a desire for unconditional love with the belief that one does not deserve it. Jon came down to his life to heal shame  the belief that he is not deserving of unconditional love.The author asks an angel what it would say to someone with AIDS who is trying to understand the deeper spiritual meaning. The angel replies Remain very open in your heart. Follow that which comes only from the heart, and in this way many healings will occur on levels that are beyond your understanding. I feel this is valuable advice.Of the souls in Jons soul group, Jon agreed to be the one with AIDS, while the others were incarnating around him to judge him, reject him and refrain from providing him with unconditional love.AIDS points to a pattern of self-hatred among humankind  movement away from light, and a belief in the Self as the body and separate from All That Is. AIDS is healing humanity.We also hear about Doris, who suffered from self-loathing and had a toxic self-image. She developed breast cancer. Through her illness Doris learnt the correct use of sexual energy, acceptance of the female form and self-love.Doriss cancer is neither a failure nor a punishment. It is a form of healing, not illness,As Jon and Doris released shame and self-loathing and chose instead to love themselves, they made it easier for every person on Earth to replace self-judgement with self-love. They created a vibration or resonance of love that radiated well beyond their immediate sphere. By surmounting the challenges we planned before birth, we create a resonance that heals humanity.In the chapter about parenting handicapped children, we hear the story of Jennifer, who has two handicapped boys, one with Aspergers Syndrome, bipolar disorder and ADD, the other one with severe autism and who is blind.The two boys were brothers in a previous life, where they also were Nazis. They chose to come back communicationally disabled to learn what it is like to have the truth and be unable to communicate it, since before they had the truth and deliberately buried it.In the chapter about deafness and blindness we are given the story of Penelope, who has been completely deaf since birth, She knew she was meant to be deaf to better understand the neglected. The medium, Staci, finds out that being deaf gives Penelope the opportunity to be more in touch with her inner experience, intuition, thoughts, even the physical symptoms and feedback her body gives her. It helps her to know herself.We also learn about Bob, who is blind. His life plan was designed to give him a deeper understanding of self-love through both its lack and the experience of its subsequent creation.The chapter on drug addiction and alcoholism is particularly illuminating, since this is a group whom we often judge, wondering why they dont just pull themselves together and refrain from submitting to their addiction. The persons involved planned not only their addiction, but the specific addictive substance. We are told that for those addicted to drugs it is essential to honour your past, know yourself, learn about who you are, and then love yourself.We learn to see drug addicts not as such but as courageous souls who undertook the life challenge of drug addiction to learn self-nurturing.Pat, the alcoholic, had carried into this life the energy of fear. His plan was that fear would cause alcoholism, which in turn could lead to a healing of fear. He planned not only his alcoholism but the surmounting of that addiction. He had lost his connection with the All That Is, with God, with his own divine nature and spirituality. The return to seeking and achieving spiritual connection is motivated by the total lack of it, which the alcoholism causes. This was a classic learning-through-opposites life plan.The chapters on the death of a loved one and accidents are equally instructive.I found the book as a whole to be thoroughly illuminating, insightful, informative, satisfying, comforting and perfectly expressed. I would absolutely recommend this book to everyone. It is one of the most important books I have read this year, in fact, ever.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WZDP5HLV0FN6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003M5I4FI#wasThisHelpful","R1WZDP5HLV0FN6","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little book is based on a recurring dream dreamt by the author three nights in a row. He dreamt that he was attending a lecture held by Jesus. On the third night Jesus looked directly into his eyes and said Im glad youve been writing the information down. This personal comment to the author by Jesus prompted him to write the book.The Jesus of the dream was very modern-day in his speech and refreshingly direct.He presents us with many truths and valuable precepts in the form of what he calls Creed-Busters.The first is: Place your spiritual practices on hold. He says we should develop our humanity instead of our spirituality. We are not yet human beings, but human becomings. We need to be human before we can be spiritual. I dont quite see the distinction, since to my mind being spiritual means focusing on loving others and thus developing our humanity. Jesus rightly points out that we will evolve into fully-evolved human beings when we stop harming and killing each other.Creed-Buster 2 is: You need a new God. By this he apparently means that we need to ditch the God of the Old Testament and understand that God is not a man or man-like being.Creed-Buster 3 is: God is pure spiritual energy. He is an infinite, eternal spiritual energy and the very source from which the structure of the universe evolved.Creed-Buster 4 is: God is we and we are he. We and God are one and the same. We are all connected and extensions of pure spiritual energy.Creed-Buster 5: You must stop believing in God. This sounds a bit shocking, but Jesus explains that he means we should not believe that God exists but know that he exists (just as we know that gravity and electricity exist). This is a point Ive often made myself when asked if I believe in God, so I feel it is an absolutely good one.Creed-Buster 6: God does not answer prayers  ever!I must object to this one. It is not correct. It is true that most of us do not use affirmative prayer, which is the kind that is most likely to be answered. This is the kind where we dont plead or beg for our prayers to be answered, but instead thank God for the answered prayer. Most of us, including myself, will have experienced that many of our prayers have not been answered. But studies have been made and books written on the efficacy of prayer for helping others, and it has been proven that prayer does help! Also, I personally have experienced a miracle in that immediately after praying for healing I once experienced strong rays of energy flowing through the centre of my body. These continued for minutes, after which I was able to ascertain that my (severe) problem had been healed. So you cant tell me that God does not answer prayer! Though the key aspect of the prayer succeeding was, I feel, that I surrendered the whole matter over to God. (Funny, Jesus doesnt mention surrender.)Creed-Buster 7: You have more power than you think. He stresses that when using our power we need to take care of ourselves first.Creed-Buster 8: Stop viewing me as your saviour. When we become fully-developed human beings, we will be  Christ. The Second Coming will be us!Creed-Buster 9: You need to update your 10 commandments. Ill let you discover the authors suggestions for the new ten commandments for yourself when and if you read the book. But Ill reveal that No. 9 is Safely enjoy lots of sex!We get the Jesus lecture twice, the second time with short comments by the author. I dont know why these couldnt have been added the first time. I think perhaps we get the lecture twice so as to lengthen the book.Jesus had some good points, though I do not feel that the dream Jesus is the real Jesus. Not only because of his stand on prayer (that its never answered) but the Jesus character didnt really have the feel of Jesus. However, judge for yourself, if you read the book.I must point out that the content of the book was much greater than I have indicated. It was interesting and pleasantly provocative, but I didnt find it particularly readable. It is marred throughout by incorrect grammar, incorrect use of words and, constantly, wrong use of apostrophes. The author seems to think that a word in the singular reads, for example, human, while the same word in the plural is humans. Why didnt he get some literate person to spruce up the language in the book as befitting the high quality of the lecturer? Of course, the message is the important factor, but poor language detracts from the quality of the book.I wont recommend that you read the book though it does have some interest value and contains many truths.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UHNYH4SUVV2W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AWF9AE0#wasThisHelpful","R2UHNYH4SUVV2W","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kyle Gray has seen and communicated with angels from an early age, and is now a top angel psychic and has his own column in a Scottish newspaper.He helps large numbers of people who consult him, wanting to know about their angels and their loved ones who have passed over.I found this to be a simple book, simply and clearly expressed, and extremely readable. Kyle tells us about his clients problems and how he helped them. The angels give him details of the clients lives and of their deceased loved ones, and when Kyle communicates these things to his clients, they are comforted by this confirmation of the existence of angels and learning of the well-being of their loved ones in Heaven.Kyle teaches us how to tune in to the angels. He informs us of the importance of self-love and how to increase it.We are taught how to cut the cords to let go of negative persons and situations.To ask for help from the angels, use affirmative prayers. That is, instead of saying Please help me, thank the angels and the universe for already having delivered their assistance.Use creative visualization to imagine that what we are asking or praying for is already happening.Always show gratitude. Constantly thank the universe and angels for what you have received.If you visualize yourself covered from head to toe in golden light, this will raise your vibration and make communicating with angels and asking for help much easier.If you wish to transform a situation (in the past, present or future), imagine it and all those involved being surrounded by pink light. You can say, Thank you, angels, for surrounding this situation in light and resolving it now. Step back from it, allowing the angels light to surround it. Trust with all your might in the angels help.Not only does Kyle provide us with stories about the angels, he also gives us the benefit of his spiritual understanding, informing us about the Law of Free Will, the Law of Attraction and the Law of Manifestation. We are told about the value of I am affirmations (very important) and the path to happiness. We must let go, forgive, approve of ourselves, create new things and change our life.I recommend that you read this inspiring book if you wish to be confirmed of the existence of angels and of how they take part in our lives and assist us with whatever we need help with  but this will only happen if we ask for their help!I would also recommend that you read True Angel Stories by Diana Cooper.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28VHJ1KTK6VIM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0082169HC#wasThisHelpful","R28VHJ1KTK6VIM","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book on astral projection is quite fascinating, but I have not found it at all useful in practice.I would say it is just as much a book about witchcraft, not to use the word in any pejorative sense, but merely as a descriptive term.The author counsels us on how to achieve astral projection through meditation. I have never associated meditation with astral projection, not at all, and have not been able to succeed in achieving the latter consciously, though I have tried. And since the author's multifarious teachings and advice are based on obtaining astral travel by this method, I have been unable to benefit from any of it.So for me the book has been a sort of airy-fairy, unobtainable fantasy.I would conjecture that the author is one who has always been able to freely roam around the astral realms. I am in no doubt that she can do and has done all the things she describes, though the book might have been more readable had she recounted some of her own personal experiences. But we're not all born with the same gifts and abilities. Perhaps with hard work and perseverance we could achieve many of the things she describes.But it is somewhat frustrating to read a book about all kinds of exciting things one can carry out in the astral realms, when we can't even get there.The author does provide us with some advice on herbs, stones and oils to help in recalling astral travel and/or heightening the psychic senses. For example, she advises us to make a dream pillow stuffed with dried mugwort and informs us, among other things, that amethyst  is a valuable astral travel gem, and quartz crystal can help open the psychic centres.She mentions finding guides and spiritual teachers in the astral realms and looking through the Akashic records. But these guides and teachers just seem to turn up by themselves and it is they who can lead you to the Akashic records. She states that we can study spiritual knowledge in astral classes, visit deceased loved ones, look at past lives, work healing or ""magick"" on the astral, meet with other particular astral travelers, etc, etc.But, again, how you actually get to do these things is not really specified.There are interesting chapters on time travel and ""treading ancient paths"". This latter chapter includes more about meeting spiritual teachers and guides, who just turn up when you visualize yourself in a beautiful garden, about visiting with a wizard, worshipping with a witch, visiting a healing shaman and so on.There's a chapter about the possibility of finding an astral lover, one on healing in the astral, and one on ""magick"" in the astral, which includes the description of various rituals for good health, prosperity, success and so on. In a ritual for justice one of the items needed is ""a curl of unicorn hair"". The author fails to mention where you get that. Perhaps in one of the shops frequented by Harry Potter.One chapter entitled ""Defence against the Dark Side"" informs us how to deal with astral enemies and uninvited astral entities. The author uses many techniques and weapons to defend herself with. Personally, I would prefer not to use fighting but the power of Divine Love, which I am sure would be just as effective.I don't know why ""magic"" is spelt ""magick"", and this is not explained. I have noticed that certain other authors also use this, presumably old, spelling.The book is well-written and absolutely comprehensive, and it sounds as though the author knows what she's talking about. One gets the distinct impression that everything she describes is as easy as pie to do.She states that astral travel is absolutely safe, but at the same time recommends that we use numerous methods and techniques by which to protect ourselves. She describes seven different types of astral defense, so there must be considerable need for this. Before I read the book I felt that venturing into these realms was relatively safe but I feel much more wary about doing so after reading it.I would recommend the book to those who know from experience that this sort of thing is something  they will easily be able to master and who are interested in witch-like activities and all sorts of ""magickal"" pursuits.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LJBJYCWLF7SA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1567181643#wasThisHelpful","R2LJBJYCWLF7SA","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I much enjoyed Patricia Garfields Creative Dreaming, but was somewhat disappointed with this book.Garfield had an accident in which she severely damaged her wrist. The doctor said it was just sprained, but a dream told her that it was broken, which turned out to be correct. On recovering, she decided to write this book about 1) forewarning dreams 2) diagnostic dreams 3) crisis dreams 4) post-crisis dreams 5) healing dreams and 6) convalescence and wellness dreams.In this comprehensive book dealing with all stages of health crises and recovery, Garfield refers at length to many other writers on dreams throughout the ages, including Hippocrates, Asklepios, Galen, Artemidorus, Jung, Freud, LaBerge, Oliver Sacks and Kasatkin. She also refers extensively to many cases of injuries and illnesses and the respective patients accompanying dreams and their interpretations.I myself was and am in a similar situation since I a couple of years ago also had an accident and subsequently had to endure several operations. But I remembered no dreams or nightmares reflecting the accident, the various surgeries and so forth. This might have had to do with my being given morphine and other strong pain-killers. As far as I can see, Garfield does not mention that pain-killers might impede recollection of dreams.It was not until months after the last operation that I have begun to dream again.Garfield being a dream expert obviously had no problems in remembering her dreams. However, not everyone recollects their dreams with ease. It would have been helpful had she indicated those remedies available to us that might aid our recollection, such as Vitamin B6, mugwort tea, guayana tea and so on.She goes into much detail regarding how to relate our dreams to physical problems, Strangely enough, I have remembered no dreams whatsoever relating to the body parts that I have had problems with, not that I have been able to interpret.She gives us many examples of how we can interpret body symptoms. For example, injured body parts are symbolized by broken building parts, defective objects and defective cars. Dreams of fire or heat = Body Part too hot. Dreams of fiery hair = headache. Dreams of fiery foods = having pain in stomach. Dreams of houses on fire = fever or burning sensation. Dreams of cold objects = inadequate blood circulation. Dreams of excessive water = body edema or mucous production. Etc, etc.The author suggest how we can work with our health problems, for instance by drawing or painting our dreams, and includes various such drawings in the book.The last chapter comprises a meditative journey to our inner dream temple. However, I found this journey much too long and detailed to be practicable, though it may be useful to some. The object of this long and laborious journey (which would take several days of meditation to complete) is to meet our inner guide, but I think a shorter process could have been much more helpful.Thoroughgoing appendices list dream images relating to various disorders.The book is well-written and thorough, perhaps too thorough, as I did not find it to be particularly readable  it was too full of dream statistics and the like.Though I personally would not recommend that you read the book, it will probably be useful to many with health problems, especially those that are good at remembering their dreams. Use your intuition to feel whether this is the right book for you.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 29, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BI4CM7Z84OV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671686224#wasThisHelpful","R17BI4CM7Z84OV","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I lack words to express the excellence and brilliance of this comprehensive, divinely expressed book.The author diagnosed his own cancer of the thyroid gland through a series of nightmares he experienced that drove him to the doctor. These dreams saved his life.He states that healing dreams tend to have spiritual themes rather than purely psychological ones. They address not only our personal situation but also the human condition. They may have the qualities of omniscience, omnipresence, truth and compassion. But our most vital dreams, the ones that spiritually mature us ""play out at the level of blood and muck, lack and deformity"".Healing dreams might be conceived as ""visits to an otherworld with its own geography and inhabitants"". Or the Healing Dream might be regarded as a wise teacher. It often comes to redress imbalance. We should note that ""whatever we deem most ridiculous upon waking is the fulcrum point of what the dream wants to tell us"". Note also key dream words, since dream language ""reveals a dense richness"" - a dream word may have half a dozen definitions, ""each with a different or even opposing nuance"", and each of these definitions will have significance.There is a chapter asking ""What does the Dream want?"" and one on inner journeys of health and illness. One chapter relates to dreams of ""personal calling"", and includes healing dreams in childhood and ""heeding the call"".The book comprises exciting chapters on the Otherworld and Healing the Shadow.The author is exceedingly learned, and refers continually to Freud, Jung (mostly Jung), Milarepa, Cicero, Greek writers such as Macrobius and Artemidorus of Daldis, J.W. Dunne, etc etc etc, and to reports by many of his friends from other cultures, including Indian tribes, such as the Cree.I don't think I've ever encountered such a learned and gifted writer, who at the same time is so exceptionally articulate and writes in such an enjoyable, discursive manner.The book is a work of genius.The author cites innumerable illuminating and insightful dream reports, both on his own dreams and those of many others.This is an important work, one of the absolute best on the subject of dreams, if not the best, together with ""Conscious dreaming"" by Robert Moss and ""Lucid Dreaming"" by Robert Waggoner. I highly recommend that you read this excellent, mind-expanding book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPGGSHGK7PQ5U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1573228974#wasThisHelpful","RPGGSHGK7PQ5U","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is absolutely one of the best books I've read ever.The author suffered extremely poor health as a child and worked with his dreams from an early age, having many dream visitors/guides, including Philemon, whom he later discovered had been one of C.G. Jung's guides.I lack words to express the richness of the book. The author shares freely with us his many exceptional dream experiences, including with guides and shamans.We learn about conscious dreaming, which phrase the author prefers to the more common phrase ""lucid dreaming"". He feels that lucid dream enthusiasts have the aim of manipulating dreams to ""serve the agendas of the waking ego"". He is dissatisfied with people programming themselves to wake up inside the dream state. He thinks we should spontneously become lucid by noticing ourselves doing things we are not generally capable of doing in our physical body. (But here I must stress that not everyone is as gifted as Robert Moss  at spontaneously achieving lucidity, not to mention attracting all the other amazing experiences he easily manifests.)He points out that dreams are ""wiser than our everyday minds and come from an infinitely deeper source"". He feels that ""to try to control this source is the ultimate delusion"".He quotes a Seneca Indian healer: ""The dream world is the real world.""It is vitally important to record our dreams as soon as possible, before they disappear from our memory. We should date our reports. give our dreams titles and note our feelings and immediate associations.If we have a question we need answered, or a problem we need solved, we can take it to our dream source. We should formulate our question or request clearly, lay off alcohol, drugs and caffeine and refrain from overeating before going to bed, and agree to accept and work with the dreams given to us.There is a chapter providing us with nine keys to our dreams. These are: 1) Pay attention to how you feel when waking from a dream. Your feelings and bodily sensations may be your best guide to the importance of a dream and its positive or negative implications. 2) Jot down your first associations with the dreams you record. 3) Dreams often contain accurate information about external reality, for instance, helpful information from the future. Ask ""Could this dream mean exactly what it says?"" 4) The meaning of a dream is inside the dream itself. We can learn to re-enter our dreams in a relaxed state and thus clarify messages about future events, resume contact with inner teachers, and resolve unfinished business. We generally forget 90% of our dreams, thus it is a valuable skill to re-enter them, e.g. by means of shamanic drumming, to search for information we may have missed. 5) learn to dialogue with dream characters. Ask them what they want to tell us. Everything in dreams is alive. (Moss remarks - ""Shamans know the same is true of waking life"".) 6) Follow your dream self, and you are likely to find that you have many selves. You my catch yourself changing your sex, age or race. You could even find yourself ""body-hopping"". 7) Explore dream symbols. 8) Ask what part of me different characters and elements in a dream represent.  9) We should always do something with important dreams. Record them, explore them and share them. We can write a dream motto, confirm our dream messages, find out how to help to bring a positive dream to pass or how to avoid  negative future event.Sharing dreams with a partner or with a group can be rewarding and provide a variety of insights that may illuminate many levels of the dream.With regard to the etiquette of dream-sharing, remember: 1) You are the final authority on the meaning of your dream. 2) You should preface any comments you make about someone else's dream with the phrase ""If it were my dream ..."". 3)Do not ask other dreamers for personal details they have not volunteered and 4)Dreams shared within the circle should not be told to outsiders without the dreamer's permission.A chapter about conscious dreaming also contains accounts of OBEs (out-of-body experiences). Moss has some amazing dreams/OBEs and communications with various beings. He has an ""extended conversation"" (telepathically) with what he terms ""a life force"", and enters a different galaxy. He develops personal maps of paths and landscapes inside the dreamworlds, places to which he can return.Moss informs us that we can return again and again to dream locations that do not have a counterpart in ordinary reality. We can explore the possible conditions of life after physical death, and return to special places for specific guidance or healing.Conscious dreaming facilitates shared dreaming - our ability to join a partner in our dreams. We can set up a ""dream date"" with a rendezvous familiar to both of us either in ordinary or non-ordinary reality.There is an exciting chapter (though all the chapters are exciting) about shamanic dreaming. We learn about techniques for shifting consciousness, including shamanic drumming. We are taught how to enter the Lower World to make contact with an animal guardian and how to rise to the Upper World in search of a spiritual teacher.The book includes chapters about 1) using ""dream radar"", including meeting your future self 2) dreams of the departed, including dialogues with the dead 3) dream guides and guardian angels (Gabriel is the Archangel of dreams) 4) dreams of healing including working with our dream doctor (we receive both warnings, diagnoses and presciptions in our dreams. 5) The creative power of dreams, including ""creative incubation"".This excellent book is packed with accounts of exciting, amazing, illuminating dreams and dream experiences of both the author and those attending his dream courses. It contains numerous exercises, and much. much invaluable advice.I found this to be the most valuable, gripping, informative book on dreams I've read. I can't see how any other dream book could excel this one. I highly recommend that you purchaze this wonderful book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23VL3SR4XF7OU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=051788710X#wasThisHelpful","R23VL3SR4XF7OU","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little book is a guide to perceiving energy or, in the words of the author, to ""expanding your inter-dimensional perception"".Dawn Clark has been able to se clouds of ""auric colour"" around people since the age of three, but she insists that we others, who haven't been so fortunate, still can learn to see and feel ""dynamic energy fields"".We are provided with many simple exercises to see and sense energy, for example, scanning the energy of a quartz crystal and feeling and intuiting colour in a stone or crystal. However, I don't understand this latter exercise, since it suggests that there are colours within the stone that we can't see with the naked eye. And if the author is referring to colours seen on the outside of the stone, wouldn't we be distracted by seeing these colours, and not know whether or not we were imagining that we were sensing a colour and not just seeing it in the normal way? There are exercises on sensing the aura of trees, and again perceiving colour. Here I have the same objection as before.We are given information about the chakras, the usual seven plus the cosmic chakra and the higher self chakra.There are exercises and advice about perceiving hyuman auras and sensing their colours. as well as visually perceiving human auras.I admit I haven't spent much time with these exercises, so it's not surprising that I haven't achieved much success.One feature that I found unsatisfactory was that many of he exercises in the latter part of the book require the particiption of  number of persons. They cannot be done by oneself alone or even by just two participants. You would need a whole group of persons.Also, when drawing/colouring the human aura, you use the physical eyes, as far as I understand, and this means that in order not to fatigue your eyes and confuse your perceptions, the entire exercise should last no more than 3-5 minutes. Your initil scan of the person's form and immediate surrounding area should take no longer than 45-60 seconds.I personally have learnt a method of drawing the aura by closing one's eyes and with the inner eyes focusing on one colour/coloured shape/line at a time. In this way one has time to perceive the whole aura and get the ""full picture"", as far as possible.There is a chapter about psychometry, with which I have previously had success. Here we are advised that plastics and other man-made fabrics should not be used since they do not retain vibrations.Finally, there is useful advice about how best to perceive guides and angels. These vibrate at such a high frequency that they are practically invisible or imperceptible to most.I can't say that I got much out of the book, but then I didn't apply myself to practicing the exercises. I don't know if other books are available on this subject.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 15, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TDI95S5B7NDL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1928532020#wasThisHelpful","R2TDI95S5B7NDL","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Though I have loved all Castanedas books so far, I have a predilection for this one. This is because I have a particular interest in dreaming, and dreaming (the kind of dreaming Don Juan teaches about).Don Juan said Through dreaming we can perceive other worlds  we can feel how dreaming opens up those other realms. He calls dreaming the gateway to infinity. Dreaming is the sorcerers practical way of putting ordinary dreams to use.We learn that the whole universe is energy. Don Juan taught his apprentices to perceive energy directly.Human beings are luminous balls and the crucial feature of the luminous ball is a spot of intense brilliance on a place at the height of the shoulder blades, at an arms length from the persons body, which is termed the assemblage point. This enables us to perceive, and when the assemblage point dislodges itself from its usual spot, our usual behaviour, awareness and perception are changed.Much of the book deals with changing the assemblage point and the consequences of this. Don Juan can make Carlos assemblage point shift to another position to enable him to reach a heightened state of awareness, otherwise termed the second attention.There are seven entrances, perceived as obstacles, called the seven gates of dreaming. We reach the first gate when we become aware that were falling asleep. This is achieved by intending it  to wish without wishing, to do without doing.Carlos reached the first gate of dreaming but by another way, by having a gigantically real dream  he wanders though a city until he becomes completely exhausted.When dreaming you must focus your gaze on anything of your choice as the starting point, for example, your hands. Then shift your gaze to other items and look at them in brief glances. Then go back to the item you started with.Carlos practices focusing and holding his dreaming attention on the items of his dreams. He learns that he must redeploy his energy by losing self-importance. Self-importance is not only the sorcerers supreme enemy but the nemesis of mankindThe city he visited in his dream, where he got exhausted, was out of this world. Don Juan was with him, but he saw the city not as a city but as energy.You reach the second gate of dreaming when you wake from a dream into another dream. Carlos reaches this second gate, but again he does it in another manner, by changing dreams in an orderly and precise manner. He used the items of a dream to trigger another dream.Were introduced to the inorganic beings, and their world, the most fascinating aspect of this book. Two inorganic beings begin to appear in Carlos dreams. They just stand there and stare at him. One day when in the hills with Don Juan, Carlos wrestles with one of them. By the ensuing energy exchange Carlos creates a lasting attachment to the being, which he later encounters again in the inorganic beings world.To cut a long story short, Carlos continues to journey into this world in his dreams, and becomes practically addicted to doing so, though warned by Don Juan that it is dangerous. He encounters a scout disguised as a little girl who is trapped there, merges with her in an attempt to save her but loses all his energy. He is rescued by the combined efforts of Don Juan and anther sorcerer called Carol Tiggs, who travel into this world physically.An interesting feature of Carlos sojourns in the inorganic beings world is the disembodied voice of the dream emissary, which provides him with useful information. The voice always speaks the truth, so he can trust the information given. But the inorganic beings as such are not really to be trusted, because they want Carlos energy and are eager for him to stay in their world forever.In one of the final chapters Carlos has an exciting but dangerous adventure with Carol Tiggs in another world. Finally, he is introduced to the death defier, one of the old sorcerers, and is gone for nine days. He is also fortunate to survive this sojourn.I found this book to be fascinating, engrossing and exciting, in fact unputdownable.  I found the material presented therein to be extremely edifying but challenging.I highly recommend that you read the book. I will miss reading it, but now will tackle some of Castanedas previous books, which I have not yet read,","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I1G1F07W92R7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=006092554X#wasThisHelpful","R2I1G1F07W92R7","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have many points of contention with regard to this book, as indicated by the one-star rating.Firstly, as regards the book's misnomer of a title, ""Ekstasy"", there is nothing about ""ekstasy"" or even ecstasy in it apart from a short reference to an OBE or rather NDE experienced by the famous psychologist Carl Gustav Jung in 1944. This was interesting but the concept of ecstasy is hardly an essential or a characteristic feature of the book. Where Black gets the word/spelling ""Ekstasy"" I don't know.Secondly, the book as a whole is characterized by the author's extreme skepticism about the whole matter of the feasibility of out-of-body experiences. He has an ambiguous attitude towards the subject since he doesn't believe such experiences are possible but was attracted enough to the subject to embark on writing the book.The book is packed with skeptical terms, phrases, expressions and insinuations of disbelief, such as the following:""there is no reliable evidence for life-after-death"" (Black is in for a shock/huge surprise when it's his time to go)""often claimed to have the power of out-of-the-body flight""""confused out-of-the-body experiences with the mythology of astral travel""""the out-of-the body phenomenon, as suspect as phrenology and UFOs""""the fact that he (Krippner) even entertained the notion that in an out-of-the-body experience some part of consciousness might really leave the physical self - seemed preposterous""""if one entertains the possibility of an energy body"" (so he neither believes in life after death nor auras)Black refers throughout the book to numerous examples of persons who were well-known for having frequent OBEs, such as Herotimos of Clazomenae, Carl Gustav Jung and Robert Monroe, founder of the Monroe Institute, who wrote the classic book on the subject, ""Journeys out of the body"". He even informed us: ""There is evidence that the out-of-the-body experience was one of the initiation rites of the Orphic mysteries.He asks Monroe what proof he had that his OBEs were real. ""I haven't been looking for proof"", he answered. Of course not! That wasn't the point.The irritating thing about this book is that the author discounts all the innumerable accounts of OBEs through the ages, instead focusing on his own subjective doubts about their reality.He regales us with the concept of ""autoscopy"" - the projection of a consciousness unable to accept responsibility for a particular act, a narcissistic hallucination that denies the power of death"" - as though OBEs are simply expressions of mental instability.Black refers, among others, to John White from the Institute of Noetic Sciences, ""a think-tank devoted to examining human consciousness"". White states that ""the planet is getting ready for a great leap forward ... a new species is emerging on the planet"".All this is so true, and we are in the midst of this great leap forward and in the ""Love Revolution"", as Matt Kahn terms it. (But Black is apparently not yet cognizant of these developments or revolutions.)At the end of the book Black admits that he himself had an out-of-body experience (!), though he ends by discounting it. He is split - he ""struggles alternately to believe and to disbelieve, unable to do either"".I respect his honesty.I found most of the book boring, but I like to finish books I've started, unless I find them unreadable. This book was exquisitely written and for this it absolutely deserves the one star, and it was therefore not unreadable. Also the author's constant provocations kept me awake and reading.Many may appreciate this intellectual treatise on whether or not OBEs exist, though I did not. I have no idea why I was initially under the illusion that this was a book I would enjoy. But it was a disappointment to me, since I'm in no doubt of the existence of OBEs, and have had a few myself. I therefore cannot recommend that you read it, though, as stated, it may be of interest to many.","1.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3I9F6MRH5HKGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0672519720#wasThisHelpful","R3I9F6MRH5HKGX","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I find all of Castanedas books unique, fascinating and engrossing, and this one is no exception,We are told about how Carlos met Juan Matus in a bus station in Arizona, and that this was the start of a ten-year apprenticeship.Carlos first learns about the importance of erasing ones personal history since this makes us free from the encumbering thoughts of other people. One can erase personal history by not revealing what one really does, and by leaving everyone who knows one well. A fog will thus be built up around oneself.It is also important to lose self-importance. In another book it is explained that in order to dream we need energy, and self-importance uses much energy, so therefore it is best to rid ourselves of it in order to preserve as much energy as possible.Carlos also learns that death is our eternal companion and our most important adviser, and is always to our left, at an arms length away. Awareness of our impending death helps us to drop the cursed pettiness that belongs to men that live their lives as if death will never tap them.We must take responsibility for all that we do, we must know why we are doing things, no matter what, and then must proceed with our actions without having doubts or remorse about them.Don Juan seems to be able to read Carloss mind and knows about things that happened in his childhood and youth without having been told of them.Carlos tells Don Juan that they are equals, while in actual fact he feels that as a sophisticated university student he is superior to him, who is an Indian. He is dumbfounded when the latter informs him that they are not equals - I am a hunter and a warrior, and you are a pimp.The world is a mysterious place, especially in the twilight. The wind can follow one, make one tired or even kill one. It is looking for Carlos. Carlos learns about being inaccessible. He has previously made himself too available, especially in his relationship with a particular blond girl. One must make sure not to squeeze ones world out of shape, but instead tap lightly, stay for as long as one needs to, and then swiftly move away leaving hardly a mark.A hunter should know the routines of his prey and, most importantly, have no routines oneself. Carlos himself eats lunch every single day at twelve oclock, as Don Juan keeps pointing out.These are but a few of the topics that Don Juan teaches Carlos about. He also learns about becoming accessible to power, experiences a battle of power and learns about a warriors last stand. He learns the gait of power and the tricky art of not-doing.Finally, he learns about the ring of power and meets a dangerous, worthy opponent, a sorceress going by the name of La Catalina.Towards the end Carlos meets Don Genaro, another powerful sorcerer, and he and Don Juan make Carloss car disappear into thin air.Carlos is sent out into the mountains by himself and stops the world. He has a conversation with a coyote who speaks both English and Spanish (!). Carlos sees the lines of the world.We understand that Carlos time with Don Juan has come to an end, since it is time for the latter to leave this world. Carlos sadness is overwhelming, and so is that of the reader.This is an amazing book. The information/knowledge presented is fascinating and absorbing. Castaneda presents the information in great, satisfying detail. The book is well-expressed, though the content is difficult to grasp. (Carlos himself makes no secret of the fact that he finds it nigh impossible to understand Don Juans concepts and methods since the units of his description were alien and incompatible with those of my own.)I am really going to miss reading this authors works when Ive got through them all, but luckily I still have many left to read. The separate reality portrayed in these books is quite different from our daily reality, so it is an amazing journey for the reader to delve into these books and access this other reality, or world.I strongly recommend that you read this mind-expanding book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDPG1RR4UMTBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671732463#wasThisHelpful","RDPG1RR4UMTBZ","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first book Ive read by Castaneda in the last many, many years. Im afraid Im not good at reading books in the correct order, and this applies with Castanedas books too. It would perhaps have been easier to begin with his first books.In this book we are instructed, among other things, about the art of stalking and the mastery of intent.We learn about a point of brilliance called the assemblage point on the surface of the luminous ball surrounding our body. When this is moved from its usual position, it brightens up new energy fields, making them perceivable. This perception is known as seeing. Movement of the assemblage point enables perception of an entirely different world. Sorcerers go into that other world to get energy power, solutions to  problems, or to face the unimaginable.Intent is what causes us to perceive. The aim of sorcerers is to reach a state of total awareness.We are given the dramatic story of how the nagual Elias meets Julian, saves his life and takes him as his apprentice. Julian becomes the benefactor of Don Juan.Don Juan accompanies Castaneda on long treks and in particular to a special cave which was created as an instrument to push the apprentice deep into heightened awareness.Don Juan tells about a time years ago when he was kept prisoner by his benefactor, tricked into believing that the house belonged to a monstrous man and that he needed to wear womens clothes in order to escape. Eventually he did manage to do so but kept being pursued by the monstrous man until he realized it was a figment of his imagination (actually, an inorganic being, a formless energy field).Don Juan keeps banging Castaneda on the back, thus enabling him to move his assemblage point and enter a heightened state of awareness, in which state he clearly understands everything. However, later, he may have forgotten not only his understandings, but everything that happened.(Don Juan states at one point that striking Cs back was actually more a trick to trap his attention than a bone fide maneuver to manipulate his perception.)We need to intend the movement of our assemblage point. We want it to reach the place of no pity, which is the site of ruthlessness. When this happens the eyes of the sorcerer begin to shine.Don Juan frequently bursts out laughing when Carlos opens his mouth, just as Don Juans benefactor Julian continually weeps profusely when together with Don Juan (which he does to hide his laughter).We learn about the art of stalking and its four moods  ruthlessness, cunning, patience and sweetness. Stalking is special behaviour  it is secretive, furtive, deceptive behaviour designed to deliver a jolt. And, when you stalk yourself you jolt yourself using your own behaviour in a ruthless, cunning way.You can use the idea of your death to stalk yourself. Death is our challenger  the only worthy opponent we have.I found comprehension of all the presented information to be extremely challenging. Carlos himself found the material challenging/incomprehensible. This is because it is a totally different sort of information than that we are used to understanding with the logical left part of the brain.But the book is well-written, fascinating, engrossing and highly entertaining, and I recommend it highly, although it may be preferable to begin by reading The teachings of Don Juan and the other early books before tackling this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RM9O6G2BU4W4G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=067173248X#wasThisHelpful","RM9O6G2BU4W4G","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A friend lent me this book in Danish, so I read it in that language. It is a collection of selected texts from the work of Byron Katie.I've previously read this author's book ""Loving what is"" and much appreciated it.It is Katie's view that the world would be transformed for the better, were we all to use the Work - her method of posing ourselves the following four questions whenever we have a problematic thought:1) Is it true?2) Can you really know that it is true?3) How do you react when you believe that thought?4) Who would you be without that thought?When you've asked yourself these questions, try finding opposites to the sentence you wrote/your problematic thought. For example, if your problem is ""My husband doesn't listen to me"", try saying ""My husband listens to me"", ""I don't listen to myself"" and ""I don't listen to my husband"".Katie's basic premise is that the universe does not make mistakes. This means that whatever happens is what was supposed to happen, what needs to happen. Thus everything that happens to you or anybody else is good, even though your baby dies, your legs get chopped off or everyone in your village is massacred (note , she doesn't use these latter two examples in the book). However, for some Katie's statements are provocative.When a suitcase falls on top of Katie's head when she's sitting in a plane, she says it ""felt like a kiss"". She continues ""How could I know that I needed a bang on the head? Because that was what I got!""Katie tells us that everyone in one's life, everyone one encounters (everybody in the world, actually) is God in disguise, and will show you all you need to see. When you see your partner as God, your work with The Work will be simple.The worst loss you have ever experienced is the greatest gift you can get.All our thoughts are projections. We are the only one here. There are no others here. This world doesn't even exist.The book consists of small extracts from other books, and thus can seem a bit disjointed,  but the extracts all have the same theme of questioning one's thoughts. There were quite a few parts of the book that didn't seem to me to make sense. This may have had to do with the Danish translation, but then again Katie herself writes somewhere in the book that many have told her that some of what she says is nonsense, and she seems to admit that sometimes she talks ""nonsense"" or what could be construed as such.In the books Katie discusses some of her own problems with her offspring. Now however both her children are doing the Work.I felt good while reading the book because I kept being reminded of how to let go of difficult situations by accepting the reality of things. Katie's work has the same precept as that of David R. Hawkins, among others - to let go of resistance and love everything, accept everything. When you do this, it is possible for healing to occur.I recommend that you read the book - it will help you to manage your life with acceptance and joy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYSIE8Q4S3RWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1401917305#wasThisHelpful","RYSIE8Q4S3RWN","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received this book free in return for a review.Unfortunately, I hadnt realized that this was a work of fiction, and thus not really my favourite type of read, and I was unable to get through the book.However, I found it to be beautifully written and to be a wonderful romance about a beautiful Indian princess named Damayanti who wishes to learn the secret of enduring love.Great Swan (a female swan) becomes her guru and Princess Damayanti is told that she must study men, and travels with the swans on this quest.She learns that she must let go of the compulsive need to have your existence validated by the man of your dreams She must learn to recognize herself as worthy of a place in the universe independent of any man. Practically all the women I know need to learn this so the book has a valuable lesson for us.We also learn that males seek love within their feminine counterparts instead of the love inside themselves.We are introduced to the various deities, including Brahma, Creator of the Universe, Shakti, the Goddess of Cosmic Love, and Shiva, the Destroyer of the Universe.Damayanti must pass through seven inner gateways in order to learn the secret of enduring love.Though this book was not for me, Im sure it will interest, perhaps even fascinate, those interested in romance, Indian/Vedic deities/culture and spiritual truth, and they will be able to extract much wisdom from it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYV0O8278A6VY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0989649601#wasThisHelpful","RYV0O8278A6VY","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was lent this book by a friend in Danish translation. So please note that if I present any quotes from it, they are my translations from the Danish back to the English and may not quite correspond to the original English version.The book portrays the near-death-experience of a skeptical neurosurgeon who had brushed aside these same experiences as tricks of the brain when recounted to him by his patients. Then he himself is stricken with bacterial meningitis and falls into a coma.First he, Eben, experiences being in pulsating darkness with no words in his head and no awareness of time. He feels like an earthworm buried deep in the earth, surrounded by root-like objects. He doesnt feel human but not like an animal either. He is a lonely point of consciousness in a timeless reddish-brown sea. He feels imprisoned in this underworld. Grotesque animal-like faces appear, yelling and screaming and disappear again. He has no recollection of his former life. The faces appearing from the dark are ugly and threatening. The rhythmic throbbing is like the pulse of an army of troll-like underground workers carrying out some endless monotonous task.There is an unpleasant biological odour. He is close to panic and needs to escape from that place.Then a beautiful creature appears to hm. It radiates a white-golden light which shatters and dissolves the darkness. He hears the most wonderful music imaginable. As the music increases in strength, it extinguishes the monotonous, mechanical throbbing.The light comes closer and closer and within is an opening (perhaps akin to the tunnel in other reported near-death experiences). He begins to move quickly upwards, and moves through the opening to find himself in a completely strange, beautiful world.It is an ineffable experience. It feels like being born.Below him is a green, fertile landscape which reminds him of Earth. It both is the Earth and at the same time isnt. He flies over trees and fields and people. It is an unbelievable dream world.He knows that this place is completely real.Then a beautiful girl appears. They are surrounded by butterflies. The pastel colours of the girls clothing are intensely alive, as are the rest of the surroundings. Her gaze is intensely living, containing all the forms of love we know on Earth but much more exalted than these, and more real and pure.The girl talks to him wordlessly. Her message is:You are loved and highly appreciated and will be for all eternity.You have nothing to fear.You can do no wrong.We are gifted with Ebens ineffable experiences in various chapters interspersed with chapters about how his family reacts to his situation, details of his condition and so on.He sees clouds high above containing glittering, highly developed beings like birds or angels.He experiences God, whom he terms Om.Were also told of Ebens background, how he was an adopted child who eventually regains contact with his birth family.There is much more in this book than I have touched upon. He recovers and comes back to life with the help of his younger son, who calls him back from his coma.The book is divinely and eloquently expressed.The author, as befitting his doctor status and original skeptical attitude on the subject of near-death experiences, makes a point of explaining how his experiences could not possibly have neurological causes.This is a wonderful book and it is praiseworthy that this neurosurgeon was brave enough to pen it  but then again I suppose that he couldnt refrain from doing so. I advise you to read the book.P.S. I see some reviewers state that this book is badly written. I didn't read it in English so this may be so. But in that case, the Danish translation was divinely expressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R145G0RG2F230R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451695195#wasThisHelpful","R145G0RG2F230R","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is by far the best book I've read on the subject. The highly intelligent  author delves much more deeply into all aspects of lucid dreams and dreaming than any of the other authors whose books I've read. I would give the book ten stars if I could.I have learnt that a valuable technique when lucid dreaming is to ask the dream itself for information/help/guidance. You can ask a dream figure to explain dream symbolism or tell what it represents.The author refers constantly to the works of Carlos Castaneda so I will be  re-reading some of these. (I read them many years ago.) Don Juan's advice of looking at our hands in the dream state will stabilize the dream and ""renew the power of dreaming"".Also, to maintain the lucid dream state you must modulate your emotions.You do not control your lucid dreams but merely direct their focus.There is a strong correlation between lucid dreams and out-of-body experiences. In fact I have difficulty in distinguishing between them, since it turns out that experiences in lucid dreams as in OBEs can be ""real"", i.e. you can meet with other ""real"" people in mutual dreams, both people you know and those you don't. OBEs are characterized by the experience of buzzing vibrations. But in both OBEs and lucid dreams you can fly around. I would recommend Robert Monroe's ""Journeys out of the body"" for a fascinating, comprehensive account of OBEs. Though not a recent book it is the best I have encountered on the subject so far.Apparently, the most common difference between a lucid dream and an OBE involves the lucid dreamer's ability to change the ""internally generated"" environment experienced, while those having an OBE do not report consciously changing their environment. Also the memory of a long OBE experience seems crystal clear and is easily recalled as opposed to the recalling of a long lucid dream. And those experiencing OBEs report returning to their body.In a lucid dream where the author asked a boy the right way back to a hotel, he receives valuable advice. The boy said ""here, any way is the right way"".The simplest method to move in lucid dreams is ""concentrated focus with intent"". Concentrate on the goal as your sole focus then intend yourself there.In lucid dreams you can fly into outer space, past planets. Waggoner sees a planet with rings and four moons. He speculates whether these journeys represent ""a movement of inner depth with the wings of the mind"".Waggoner's niece dreams of her great grandmother and receives a message for her mother which proves to be significant to the latter. So was this just a dream figure or her actual great grandmother?He finds that he is not always directing the actions of dream figures. One dream figure told him that he was a character in her dream. Some dream figures insist that they are real, and get really offended when the opposite is suggested.You do not create the particulars of your dream, just suggest a general intent.Waggoner relates a plethora of striking, significant and elucidating dreams in the book.He discovers that the unconscious is not chaotic, primitive and archaic. He knows beyond a doubt that the unconscious is ""conscious, responsive and alive"".The dream space contains various types of dream figures, behaving with varying degrees of awareness. Some appear to ""possess the ability to reason,. rRemember, comprehend and perform purposeful actions"". When the author says in a dream ""All thought-forms disappear"" many of the figures do so. In one case those left behind looked at him in disdain as if to say ""Can't you tell the difference?""Moving consciously deeper into the unconscious we meet knowledgeable dream figures that may represent fragments of conscious awareness, and the inner Self. When we focus on dream objects and dream figures, we remain involved with the reflections of the self. We need to intentionally focus away from the presented dream environment and toward the presumed awareness behind the dream.""Once the lucid dreamer directs questions or intentions to the awareness behind dreaming, he or she creates an opening from which to engage the subliminal or inner Self."" The lucid dreamer can then encounter a consciously aware, much larger aspect of Self.The author learnt to ignore the objects and dream figures and simply shout out his requests to the dream, or ""inner ego"". Responses came.There are guides and guardians in our dreams that offer assistance or support.Staring at an object for a long time will normally ""collapse"" the dream, and you will wake up.In a lucid dream you can heal yourself in various ways: 1) symbolically and literally entering and manipulating the dream body 2) directing healing intent 3) directing affirmations etc. 4) creating symbolic healing imagery 5) seeking information about the cause or meaning of the illness 6) seeking a dream doctor, medicine, or healing environment. Some techniques are more effective than others.Sometimes light projects from one's hands which can be used to heal the body. In one case warts that were healed in a lucid dream turned black overnight and fell off within ten days.Dream figures may not provide answers about health problems, whereas the awareness behind the dreaming will.Others can also be healed in lucid dreams if they want to be healed. ""The lucid dreamer's intent appears to engage a deep source of transpersonal healing energy with surprising effects.""Important factors in lucid dream healing include 1) a positive expectation or positive belief about possible success 2) greater ""surrendering"" to the lucid dream and acceptance of its own intuited information 3) the use of healing techniques one can perform by one's own actions 4) a willingness to call on inner energy.There is a chapter on ""forward-looking precognitive"" lucid dreams and one on mutual dreaming. The author distinguishes between dual-person-lucid and one-person-lucid mutual dreams. The material presented shows that what happens in lucid dreams is or can be ""real"" and not just something happening within the mind as often stated. In lucid dreams the author encountered ""real"" people previously unknown to him who gave him information that turned out to be correct.Additionally, there is a chapter on interacting with the deceased.In Appendix B we are given tips and techniques for achieving lucidity, including Castaneda's finding-your-hands approach, Stephen Laberge's MILD technique, the NAP-TO-LUCIDITY technique and Paul Tholey's critical-mind technique.I usually don't re-read a book unless at least 20 years have passed since the first reading, but this book warrants an immediate re-read since it contains so much valuable information that one might have missed. So now I will be re-reading this one. I highly recommend that you buy this excellent, illuminating, extremely well-written book. Enjoy this wonderful read!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1021DOPHKAIXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=193049114X#wasThisHelpful","R1021DOPHKAIXR","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This long-awaited sequel to Zero Limits is an enjoyable, illuminating read, as was the latter book.Joe writes in the same clear, simple style as before, though he is perhaps even more open and honest.He tells us about all sorts of negative things that came up after writing the first book. Among other things, he was being sued for 3 million dollars. Not until he cleaned and cleaned with the four phrases Please forgive me, Im sorry, Thank you, I love you and understood the lesson he was to learn, did the problem go away. Joe had to take full responsibility for the issue. Issues are programmes that need to be deleted.We are given Mornahs Cleansing Prayer. It was she who adapted the traditional Hooponopono practice of healing in a group to healing with yourself.The prayer is as follows:Spirit, Superconscious, please locate the origin of my feelings, thoughts of (fill in the blank with your belief, feeling, or thoughts).Take each and every level, area and aspect of my being to this origin.Analyze it and resolve it perfectly with Gods truth.Come through all generations of time and eternity.Healing every incident and its appendages based on the origin.Please do it according to Gods will until I am at the present,Filled with light and truth.Gods peace and love, forgiveness of myself for my incorrect perceptions.Forgiveness of every person, place, circumstances and events which contributed to this, these feelings and thoughts.This is to be used for clearing bonds. We are to say the prayer four times whenever we want to release something. we have ties to others, and emotion makes them stronger. If we want to release them, we have to release ourselves. To release ourselves, we do Hooponopono, saying the script above.The problem is always in us, not the other person. We need to delete the data in ourselves.Joe discusses differences in the viewpoints of Mornah and Dr. Hew Len.Everything is alive, including tables, chairs, rugs and rooms. Joe himself experienced a guitar he had bought seeming to tell him a song, after which he now talks to his guitars.We are given the Hooponopono Prayer in the Foreword, but in my view there is some confusion as to whether the Hooponopono Prayer or the Cleansing Prayer is best for severing chords and releasing data. practicing Hooponopono is clearing all mental needs and inherited memories so that you hear inspiration when it calls you.Joe helped his mother survive in a critical situation and get out of hospital by means of the method, though he wasnt able to cure her.Theres a chapter on new clearing methods, e.g. the use of blue solar water and visualizing your problem and using the edge of your business card to slice it up. I dont know if it has to be a business card. Cigars can be a clearing tool. But personally I wouldnt begin to smoke them, since I believe that is bad for the lungs. Neither would I follow Hew Lens advice about licking M&Ms!? as a clearing tool. (Is he kidding us?) He also says eating sugar and chocolate can clear data. Well, perhaps, if you really believe it can. I wont use that method either.Theres also a chapter called The big fat lie questioning/discussing whether or not Hew Len really cured all those mental patients as he claimed.Theres a valuable interview with Joe in Appendix C. I found the repetitious Appendix F impossible to get through. For me the most valuable part of the book was Appendix G, Success stories. Reading about other peoples successes with Hooponopono really encourages you to believe in its efficacy and keep on doing it yourself. Personally, I now just use the phrases Thank you and I love you, Hew Len having informed us that this is sufficient. Ive also read somewhere else in quite another context than Hooponopono how beneficial it is to use these phrases. Also Dr. Emoto of water crystal fame has demonstrated the amazing effects on water of positive phrases like I love you and since our body contains such a large percentage of water (at least if we drink enough) this may actually explain how saying the phrase is of such benefit to us.Finally, I thought I had read somewhere that the book contained a chapter that would help us achieve enlightenment, Perhaps I am mistaken and it was some other book. At any rate, I have not found any such chapter, and I have not become enlightened.Nevertheless, I would recommend that you read the book. It makes enjoyable reading and is inspiring and informative.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3K5TK2G5USAKS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118810023#wasThisHelpful","R3K5TK2G5USAKS","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Emmanuel Dagher  he is very loving and a strong healer, and he has written an enchanting little book.Emmanuels definition of a miracle is an experience a person attracts into their life as a direct result of being in alignment with the natural flow of life. He has written this book to help us attain this alignment.Alignment is not about control, nor letting go, but letting be. Emmanuel tells us that alignment entails a lot of trust and requires you to develop and maintain a demeanor of positive energy.Miracles are manifestations of our degree of alignment with the universe.The book is in part divided into five Miracle Foundations  Self-love and acceptance, Releasing attachments, Being present, Circulation and Imagination. Each foundation contains several miracle-attracting processes.I didnt feel ready to do all of the many processes, but have begun to do several. I most appreciated the Miracle Shower, the Smiling Heart, Miracle Love Drops and Cup of Faith and Miracles.The Miracle Shower Miracle Process is about imagining a beautiful golden cloud take shape in the sky above you. You then notice golden-white energy (the energy of miracles) pour out over you, drenching every cell, fibre and molecule of your being. See the golden-white drops massage your mind and completely saturate it with the energy of miracles. Notice that the golden-white energy completely melts away any energy blocks within you that might have prevented you from attracting miracles in your life.The Cup of Faith and Miracles entails finding a colourful cup or mug that makes you feel good. Write the words Faith and Miracles on your cup. For at least 30 days before you take your first drink from your cup set the intention that with each sip you take from the cup your faith in attracting miracles is magnified 1,000 fold. Miracles will surely follow.This is a wonderfully inspiring little book. You will probably need to refer to it regularly in order to remind yourself to keep on doing the processes, or at least those to which you are most attracted. Reading the book and carrying out the processes will greatly improve your mood/raise your vibration. I highly recommend that you read the book and connect with Emmanuels miracle-attracting energy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HR5Q4IN93A2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492960977#wasThisHelpful","R2HR5Q4IN93A2V","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the most unusual, and perhaps the oldest, book I've read about the astral plane.I found the book somewhat, in fact exceedingly, abstruse, and the author's information about the astral plane differs from that of other authors whose books I have read or dipped into. He concludes that the astral plane is not a place but seems to be one. He states that he was told by someone who should know that the ""Astral Plane"" is an old term for the ""realm of the visual imagination"". He declares that ""dreams are a function of the Astral Plane"".He repeats that the astral plane is a ""level of the mind"". Inner worlds are thought of as unreal, but this does not mean that no dangers lurk there. We are informed of several doorways we can use to enter the astral plane, something I have not encountered in other books.We are warned about the dangers of using some of these doorways.There are five elemental doorways to the astral plane. To work with these you will need to prepare cards with the various symbols of Ether/Spirit, Air, Fire, Water and Earth. You can choose one of these symbols and visualize it as a doorway in front of you. It all sounds very tricky and hazardous, not to mention unbelievable, but eventually you will be able to pass though this doorway.The author describes some attempts to pass through an Elemental doorway by some of his friends, where they became ill. This is not a procedure that I myself would consider trying out. There is also mention of Guides encountered through entering such a doorway.Also the Trumps of Tarot cards can be used as astral doorways. These doorways produce ""lively visions"" according to the author.There are chapters about ""Qabalistic"" and ""Oriental"" doorways, which I  found difficult.The book includes chapters on hypnosis and the astral, the ""hypno-astral experience"", the ""objective astral"", astral entities and an ""astral credo"".One of the author's subjects had a realistic astral experience under hypnosis where he apparently travelled to the Middle East and later found his experience to fit in with physical reality. I didn't understand how conditions on the astral plane could correspond to physical reality.He distinguishes between the etheric and the astral body, the etheric body being ""something you are equipped with in the natural course of things"", and which ""belongs to the physical plane"". In certain circumstances it can be projected out of the physical, and when this happens, ""it can carry your consciousness virtually anywhere on the physical plane"".For the average person, the astral body is used only on the astral plane, whereas the trained occultist can use it on the physical as well.According to the author you need to build your astral body and this is ""explained"" in an Appendix. This is the first time that I have heard this postulate, and am not convinced of the veracity of this information.To sum up, I found the book to be filled with sometimes conflicting and confusing information, not clearly explained, and feel inclined to say that I didn't understand a word of the book, though this would be an exaggeration. At any rate, I found it hard reading. On the front cover it is stated that the author's methods are ""clear, easy-to-understand"" and ""safe, simple and effective"". But personally I have found no other book on the subject to be as confusing, and the author himself insists that the methods are not ""safe"" but in fact can be dangerous.So I would not recommend that you read the book, but have given it three stars since some of the information contained is quite interesting, e.g. about the possibility of using Tarot cards etc as astral doorways.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RJRO2D2ESZ8ZU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0877281750#wasThisHelpful","RJRO2D2ESZ8ZU","AJ1FNOQE7BCLF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AJ1FNOQE7BCLF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I weigh in at 300 lbs so this kind of density is pretty much a requirement. However, because I do weigh a lot, this thing pushes back a lot so its not real comfortable. I expected that. The rollers at my physical therapist are much softer but provide very little support (they squash out flat). This one barely compresses at all. Its a little more comfortable than wood; about the same a wooden round coated with memory foam.

"A very nicely made leash that is comfortable to use with strong dogs who pull at the leash. You slip your hand through the handle and it wraps comfortably around the back of your hand as you lightly hold the leash. No more straining to grip the leash with your fingers, and the padding makes it comfortable on the back of your wrist. Next step is to train the dog to stop pulling against the leash.The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that I dont like the hook that attaches to the collar. It is quite heavy (heavier than it needs to be)  and the latch is a bit difficult to pull back. I like to let my dog run with the leash on, but this heavy latch whacks him as he runs.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLSKAR9GMQ8T2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013GGU0JU#wasThisHelpful","RLSKAR9GMQ8T2","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Petsafe Current Pet FountainThis is a simple yet effective way to prevent stagnant pet water from getting nasty. I suppose its simple enough and even cheaper to buy a water dish, and then clean and refill it daily. But this is simpler as it only needs cleaning once per week. Plus circulating filtered water is fresher and more enticing.Unlike the waterfall type, this unit only circulates the water through a dual filter, but moving water is always better than stagnant so its nearly as good. Some pets like to drink from the waterfall of the other models but mine just drink from the bowl anyway, so this is a simpler, cheaper model that they are perfectly happy with. This one has a smaller pump, too, so its cheaper to run.Easy to clean, assemble and use. You can easily dump the unused portion of a water bottle into the large bowl as you walk by. All but the pump are dishwasher safe and it only needs cleaning once a week. Instructions are clear and detailed, but not always accurate. For instance, they state that the water depth should not go below 2, but there is a clear min marking in the bowl at about 1. My testing showed that it works well down to about  but you wont want to let it get that low.If you are the type of person who forgets to refill the water bowl, the pump in this bowl will remind you; it gets louder as the water gets low turbulence increases, and then it starts sucking air. If you wait too long, though, you'll need to replace the pump.The large easily holds enough water for a couple of large dogs for a day. The medium is good for a few small dogs. I did not try the small.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4RCL0Q0DJLWN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0151JV6MK#wasThisHelpful","R4RCL0Q0DJLWN","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The seal did not burst open, but nonetheless, the bag tore slightly near the ends of the seal where the seal was attached to the bag.So much for the drop test. Now for a leak test. I grabbed another bag, filled it halfway with water and turned it upside down. It leaked, this time from the end of the seal. I pulled out another bag and did the same thing and it leaked at both ends of the seal. The next bag, same thing, so I slid the slider off the bag (which is easy to do, by the way) to see if it was interfering with the seal at the end, but the seal leaked the same as the other bags.Other than that dropped bag (which I did not test for leaks first), all bags leaked at the end(s) of the seals, as far as I could tell. The seals leaked slowly (one drip every 2-5 seconds), and only at one or both ends, but enough that it would make a mess if the bag was allowed to lie flat.Their interlocking seal is indeed strong, as they say, but it doesnt matter how strong the seal is if it doesnt hold water, so I dont like these. Ill find some use for them in the garage I suppose, but I wont be using them to hold liquids or other things that need a good seal.Note that this review was of a free product provided for testing on Oct 31, 2015.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7U0TD6M1YWJB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014OUTFPW#wasThisHelpful","R7U0TD6M1YWJB","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ive never bought chocolates that were this expensive. I figured that there is no way that tiny bonbons could be worth $1.50 ea. Man, was I pleasantly surprised. Only bad part is that I will no longer be truly satisfied with Godiva. These chocolates are amazing! Im not normally a big fan of dark chocolate, but these are totally different. The flavors are balanced for a true chocolate rush and perfect texture without any negative flavors or aftertaste.I highly recommend these as a very special, occasional treat for someone you love (including yourself). They are certainly pricey, but worth every penny.Keep in mind that even though these are very well packaged, it doesnt take much heat to melt fine chocolates, so dont order during warm weather.

"My first one I had trouble with. Im a bit of a fumble-fingered guy with poor manual dexterity, plus I live in Las Vegas, an extremely dusty environment. I followed all the instructions but ended up messing it up. I emailed the company and a new one was in the mail from England the next day, for free! Now THATS a good warranty. So I tried again and this time I laid out a wet paper towel to work on to reduce static. After a few careful attempts I was able to get it on straight and had removed all of the dust particles. These are no more difficult to install than others. In fact they are easier. Im just not good at it. Most others Ive used, including well known name brands, cannot be refitted without damage and dust particles become permanent. Not so with these.The fit is perfect, as are all of their products that Ive bought. I also put two on my D7200 camera (two screens) and one on my D5300 camera. Perfect.I have yet to see a scratch in any of the shields after months of use, plus the minor scratch in the GorillaGlass on the iPhone can no longer be seen with the shield on.The only downside I found is that, like other plastic shields, they are a little more difficult to clean than glass and prints show a little quicker, too. But! These shields are of the best quality of any that Ive used to date, and even though they are more pricey, the quality and excellent warranty make it worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYNRH5HZQ8PNC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LDOXK0O#wasThisHelpful","RYNRH5HZQ8PNC","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you bought a Nikon D7200 then youre probably no dummy and this book will probably not be of much value. Im sorry to say that I wasnt really impressed and am looking into other authors now. It might beat reading the manual that came with the camera, but just barely. The book might work well for others, but Dummies books should probably be relegated to the lower-end models. I was stuck needing more information and this was all I could find at the time (the camera was just released).

"This printer does a great job at what it was intended to do: print color-accurate, bright, borderless photos up to 11x17. But as Epson, HP, Canon, and others all know, the real money comes from ink sales, so they add other features (like scanning, copying, card stock printing, etc) so youll use more ink.Hence, this photo printer is hindered with unnecessary features (like a CD printer. Really?) and marketed as an everyday, all-in-one printer; but photo printers are slower, and photo inks are prohibitively expensive for anything other than what they intended: photos. If youre looking for a general-purpose printer, there are many other models which do more, are cheaper to buy, cheaper to fill, and faster at printing than this one.If you know you want/need a photo printer, this one does a very good job at anything 11x17 or less. Even goes borderless, which is great! The output is every bit as good as any Ive seen from the big machines in stores like Costco, but those precious Claria inks are expensive. Six cartridges will set you back up to $90 (up to $15 ea). Fortunately each color has its own cartridge so you dont need to replace all colors at once when you run out of one; but on average, six cartridges will last just a few months (even when not in use, inkjet ink goes away, usually through automated cleaning cycles that prevent clogging). Plus, photo prints require a lot of ink. Youll probably be happy with the print, but photo paper and ink is so expensive that you wont be saving much, if any, over equal quality store photo machines. Plus, if the store messes up your photo, you dont pay for it. Not so with a home printer; mistakes at home are expensive!Small photo printers like this one are meant for people who want convenience (and/or privacy) in a small footprint, and this one can fulfill than desire. If youre new to digital photography but are pretty sure you will continue to pursue the hobby, this is a good model to use for test prints before sending out for truly great final prints from a professional printer. Or you can use the prints as-is if they meet your quality requirements, and they certainly may in some circumstances.Some reviewers like to regurgitate all the cool features that are already listed on the Amazon site, but I wont bore you with those; but, I would like to mention that it truely printed well and connected easily to my MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPad Air 2 without going through my network. Networking a printer can be a real pain sometimes, but this one did it all automatically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNBQSF4C1T4BS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010UU5Y1O#wasThisHelpful","RNBQSF4C1T4BS","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Invicta Men's Specialty Analog Display Swiss Quartz Black WatchSuch a disappointment. The only things I like about it are that my left arm can get a daily workout without getting out the dumbbells; and, I like the cool, black finish. My wife hates it but my 27 year old daughter thinks it looks terrific.Pros:--as jewelry, it would pass as a classy watch until someone looks at it closely.--weighty enough to count towards daily exercise--really cool, black color--stainless steel shouldnt rustCons:--the face seems clear and readable in the picture but in average light its tough to see and distinguish the hands or the labels on the little dials; hard to use it as a time piece--the concept of a dial pointing at a day instead of a day showing through a window is rather goofy and difficult to see since it is so small.--same with the date.--the 24 hr clock (center bottom) is supposed to be used as an alternate time zone. It can only be set when the minute hand is between 55 and 5, maybe to prevent accidentally adjusting it with an bump of the button that sets it. That means It can only be bumped 1/6th of the time. I guess thatll keep it right on, eh?--the tachymeter is worthless, but attractive to some people.--the ""swiss movement is not. It's really a ""swiss parts movement"". Not sure what that really means but there are no swiss markings on the watch. No indication of location of manufacturing--the crystal is cheap mineral crystal which is less fragile than sapphire, but much more easily scratched.--warranty is bogus. Requires pre-paid shipping, both ways, plus a fee thats about what it costs to exchange a Seiko movement at a watch shop. It lasts only one year unless you pay for the premium 5-year, which still charges for repair. Doesnt cover the crystal which will likely delegate your watch to the trash within the first year.--heavy, thick, and cumbersome.--the included instruction manual does not cover this model; its totally worthless, Fortunately, they were nice enough to also include a folded up instruction sheet that shows how to set this watch. Peculiar to say the least.--the watch is currently unavailable (17 Oct 15), but when it was, the list price was shown as $600 with a sell price in the low $100s. I got the watch for free for review, but I cannot recommend paying over $100 for it. If youre willing to pay $600, I have some great stock in Florida swamp land you may be interested in.I highly recommend this watch to anyone who likes the looks of it but doesnt mind the weight and bulkiness, and doesnt need an easy to use wristwatch. If you actually need a good watch, look elsewhere. You could take the battery out and the usefulness of this watch would not be diminished.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWZIQQUQ7502Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146HVX12#wasThisHelpful","RWZIQQUQ7502Z","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love to have access to everything I need to get back to riding after a flat or mechanical problem, but this size might be considered a little overkill. Its amazing how much I can get inside, and its expandable, too. For some, this will just be too big, and if you are trying to save ounces, buy a smaller one. For me its great. The only challenge I have is that my seat post is remotely adjustable and I havent figured out the best way to connect to the seat post without the strap jamming.Construction is top notch with good zippers. My past experience with Topeka bags is that the emblem will likely come off (big deal) and the front strap will come off leaving all support from the seat straps.

"The quality of the filter is not the same as the original Drinkwell filters Drinkwell Fountain Premium Replacement Filter 3 pack that I had been using. The attachment of the front white filter to the back black filter is not uniform and actually misses in places on these filters so that the two sides can separate. The Drinkwell filters have uniform, firm attachment points. Maybe even more important, these filters just slightly smaller than the Drinkwells so they do not fit snugly to the sides of the slot in the Drinkwell fountain. Consequently the filter floats up and water goes around the filter instead of through it. The Drinkwell filters fit perfectly (as they should!)Yes, this brand is cheaper and I like to save money too, but the more expensive Drinkwell filters are just $2.33 ea. and they work. Spoil your animal(s) with a $50 fountain then put in a cheap, ineffective filter to save 83 every 6 weeks just doesnt make sense.

"Overview:This is a review of the router without the optional modem. This router is outstanding. Even if you don't have a super high-speed connection this router could possibly improve your wifi network simply by how well it connects to each device based on its location. The only caveat is that if your network equipment is all old and slow you may not notice enough improvement to justify this kind of power. Regardless of your experience level, if you want/need a new router, I highly recommend this one.Experience levels:1. I thought a router was a woodworking tool...The router in your network takes the data from your ROKU, computer, smart phone, tablet, etc and efficiently connects them together and to the modem. The modem changes the data from your devices to a signal that will travel effectively down a coaxial cable (like Cox cable) or telephone wires (like your old telephone uses). This router could improve your network by talking faster to your devices (assuming your devices are newish and fast) as well as talking louder and listening better than an old router could. You'd be better off asking, or paying, some network guru to install it for you. Although this is a great router, ask the guru first if she/he recommends it.2. I know what a router is but I can't get it to work without my cable company router...Some companies make modem-router combinations so you only need one piece of equipment to to both jobs. That's what most ISP's provide for rental. This isn't one of those. If you want to replace your cable company modem-router, you will need another combo modem-router or a modem for your kind of system (i.e.: cable modem or ADSL modem) plus a router like this one. Even if you've never set up a router you'll probably be able to set this one up. It's fast and relatively uncomplicated. I cannot guarantee you won't have issues hooking it up, but I (and several other reviewers) found it easy and straightforward. Remember to read the instructions and understand that security is actuated by default so your devices won't communicate until you connect them securely (see instructions).3. I'm quite familiar with routers and have set up a number of them on several networks...If your router is old or you have any weak/dead spots in the house then get this router. Even if you don't have a T1 or T3 coming it, you will see improvements. But if you do have a huge data pipe, this router is even more of a boon since it can handle some pretty fast speeds. You'll probably love how quick and easy the initial set up is, then you can delve into the many deep dark secret parts that others should stay away from. The beam forming is quite effective at reducing or eliminating dead spots so you likely won't need a range extender in an average house. Just remember, if the unit comes damaged or non-functional, Amazon is pretty good at replacing it, so don't fret; just return it for a new one.4. I'm an IT expert; it's my job...Sorry. I'm not. I can't help at that level.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17IP66B8LIQYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YY3XSSA#wasThisHelpful","R17IP66B8LIQYZ","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Unfortunately the urge to purge may come after already seated, so it takes some getting used to.If you thought this was just a gimmick, you're wrong. It's probably a little overpriced, and it's not absolutely effective at masking odors, but it does a pretty darn good job (90-99%), and it's definitely more effective than sprays used after the room is already full of noxious fumes.I highly recommend giving it a try to see if it works out well for you, too, and this particular scent is great for the ladies.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N6WDRB1L0NY0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RW5YVTM#wasThisHelpful","R1N6WDRB1L0NY0","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary:If youre shooting 4K video (or less), or your camera is shooting JPG, not RAW, then this is a great card and I highly recommend it. Its waterproof, X-ray proof, and withstands extreme heat and cold. If, however, you have that ""need for speed,"" I recommend that you put out the extra $14 and step up to the PRO card, or for even more, get one of the larger, 60MB/s Extreme cards.Details:I am an amateur photographer who likes taking night shots of the milky way, daytime sporting events, and shooting stills of birds in flight, using mediocre, not pro, equipment. Im not an expert, but here is my honest opinion:Depending on the the device youre using it in, this could be a 5-star product, but there are two things that must be noted. First, the number on the front is a read speed. That determines how fast the card will dump its data into your computer or other storage device. I has nothing to do with how fast you can load data on it; thats the write speed. And thats where I must caution buyers. The 64, 32, and 16 GB cards have slower write speeds (40MB/s) than the 128 and 256GB cards (60MB/s) (hence the one-star ding). If 40MB/s is fast enough for your equipment and the way you use it, then this is a magnificent card that is well worth your money. Its a great card.Heres a comparison: I have a Nikon D7200 which shoots ~30MB RAW files at up to 6 frames per seconds into the buffer. Once the buffer is full (about 2.5 seconds later), it slows to the speed at which it can write to the storage card. The Extreme PRO (the card I use all the time) will write at up to 90 MB/s but I doubt my D7200 can write to any card that fast. With a full buffer, the D7200 will write to the Extreme PRO at 3 f/s, which is still pretty good, but not 90 MB/s. However, the Extreme 64GB Im reviewing (a 40MB/s card) slows to 2 f/s, just 33% slower. Based on that non-scientific, real-world testing, Id say that the Extreme 128GB or 256GB cards, with their 60MB/s write speeds, might just match the capability of my D7200, but the smaller, slower versions clearly do not. If SanDisk sends me a 128 GB for comparison review, Ill update this to reflect what I discovered.So whats enough capacity? Thats pretty much a personal preference, but just as a comparison: when I format my 64GB card, the camera says I can shoot 1.1K 24-megapixel, 14-bit color, lossless-compressed RAW pictures. If I drop to 6 megapixel, JPEG-basic, I can fire off 32.4K shots. Anyone still remember those 36-frame film rolls?","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U9E6I6ONZDY8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013CP3MMM#wasThisHelpful","R2U9E6I6ONZDY8","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If youre looking for a rather large, heavy, and attractive watch for a really decent price (currently $60) then jump on this quick before the price goes up. It even has a synthetic sapphire crystal which could last longer than that watch if you dont break it.Now for the caveats. The chronograph function is not really; it merely measures seconds and minutes on two small dials that are difficult to read... not a really useful chronograph. The third dial is a 24 hour dial that you can use to tell if ten oclock on the face is AM or PM. About as useful as looking outside. The dial under the bezel can be set to check elapsed time, but the knob that turns it can be easily bumped to make it inaccurate.So if youre thinking that this is a great watch for diving or other sports activities, think again. But if you want a styling watch that gives other the impression that you are a diver or other sportsy kind of guy, then this is a very nice looking, Chinese-made watch. I dont expect the gold ionized stainless steel to last long, so I plan to use this watch only for special occasions.I had to be fair and add the caveats, but bottom line is, I think this is a very nice looking watch, and since watches are now more jewelry than time-keepers, I love this watch. Its not Rolex, but if I had a Rolex my friends would know it was a fake. ;-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10DH9YY3GWNFH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AZKXXTU#wasThisHelpful","R10DH9YY3GWNFH","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was pretty disappointed in this little tape dispenser because failures abound.The good:the color part (mine was blue) was shiny and smooththere is an effective no-slip bottom padThe bad:the weighting is wrong, with more weight in front than back, so pulling off a piece of tape causes the back to raise and the dispenser to slide forward (it kind of hops)the cutter doesn't stay in its slot in the body of the dispenser so I had to bend mine to create a tight fitthe bottom (black) half was not finished nicely like the top; it was scratched and dullthe upper section finish was marred with a black spot that was molded in with the blueA good desk tape dispenser should hold it's ground while you pull tape out, the cutter should stay in place, and it should look nice.

"I think the modem is good, but I was disappointed that it was so difficult to set up with my carrier, probably due to it being such a new product. It seems to be pretty much identical to another brand that has been selling well on Amazon but it's cheaper. That said, I cannot recommend it to a novice at this time (late Aug 2015). If you need a replacement right now, then the other name brand (Motorol_) might be better since the cable companies have that brand all tested and linked into their systems. But if you're upgrading from something else and can wait a bit, then this one offers nice savings over the other brand.Functionally I can only compare it to modem I rent from the cable company. Both work well with no problems with dropped signals, etc, but the rental is a bit more finicky when it comes to adding new users. Plus, with the TP-Link I no longer need to pay $10/month to rent the other one.

"I definitely recommend these to any sports shooter who wants to protect their hearing, but if you have someone with you, talk them into getting a set too. Otherwise you'll be the one yelling to talk through their earplugs/muffs that don't have amplification. Before these, I used a set of cheap Winchester amplified Earmuffs and the 3M Pelters are much better.The sound amplifiers in this set work well enough but are cheap and noisy. Not loud-noisy, just background noisy. There is a rushing sound at mid-range and above, kind of like when you turn your amp up all the way without any music on. At normal levels it's not bad, especially for less than $50, and it is functional they're just not premium Bose amplifiers, if you get my drift.They are comfortable and seal well so outside noise is significantly attenuated (rated 21db). The sound of a shotgun or rifle is too significant to be eliminated... it still comes through as loud, just not damaging. How much is 21 db? Sound seems twice as loud for every 10 db, so these will quiet everything to  the original loudness, then amplify only normal sounds when the amp is turned on.Like all earmuffs, they do get hot inside and the plastic that touches your face will likely get sweaty. You'll just need to learn how to deal with it.Even though they are low profile, they can interfere with your cheek weld in some situations, especially when using a shooting bench where you're scrunched over your rifle, but they are still much better than anything I've used before that wasn't low profile.Overall I'd recommend them as a mid-range amplified earmuffs. They are certainly good enough for me to keep in my range bag and use when I go shooting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10D43GWBFT7D4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UAM0MFG#wasThisHelpful","R10D43GWBFT7D4","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Im quite impressed with the quality of this snorkel-mask-fin set, especially for less than $30.The snorkel is not open at the top as were all of my previous pro dive snorkels. What is interesting is that the valve they have on the top really works, quickly and tightly sealing of water if the end is submerged! But even if you get water in the snorkel there is a clearing valve that works quite well. The only concern I have with the clearing valve is that its thin silicone membrane is not well protected from accidental damage.The mask seems to be made of a high quality silicone that molds well to seal various sized faces, from my big mug down to the small face of my 10-year-old granddaughter. The field of view is amazingnearly unobstructed. The glass seems quite strong and durable although I was unwilling to give it a scratch and break test (sorry). That said, my granddaughter used it for about six hours without breaking or scratching it and she is constantly moving and not as careful as most adults.Considering that this product is nearly the same quality as my pro dive mask and snorkel set at 1/4 the price, I do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone who wants a quality dive set at a very reasonable price.

"The first one I received was faulty, but Amazon took it back and reimbursed me without question. The new one is perfect. It does exactly what it says it does. Charges two batteries independently at a reasonable charge rate (not a trickle, but not so fast it damages the battery) and displays the status of the charge at the same time. I won't regurgitate their description of the product; suffice it to say I am happy with how well it works.

"Im quite impressed with the quality of this snorkel-mask-fin set, especially for the less than $90, but the fins run small.There was a plastic insert inside the boot that kept the shape of the fin during shipping. It has sharpish edges and is uncomfortable for those who didnt remove it, but once its pulled out the fins were fine, just small. As with a pro dive fin, they are more comfortable with dive booties on, but the rubber is certainly quite usable without. I rated them down a star for not having good sizing info though.

"I don't know why Under Armour fits different than it did before, but the legs are definitely tighter. I'm a pretty big guy at 6-2, 290, so I expect to buy larger sizes, but the ones I was replacing had more room in the legs than the new ones so I had to go up a size. The legs had a bit more room in the larger size but now the waste band is a bit loose. Bottom line, at least for me, is that this new fit causes the underwear to work down my legs, pulling the top with it, so that I'm constantly readjusting. I'm hoping that as I continue to lose weight these will fit better since I love everything else about them. The last a very long time, the material is moisture wicking, and except for what I perceive as recent changes to the design, they fit well and protect me from chafing.

"Review of the Silk'n Soniccleanplus Deep Cleansing DeviceI already own and use a Clairsonic Mia 2, which sells for about twice the price, so I will compare with that.Overall I find that the Silkn is a fine facial cleansing system that is easier and more efficient than a face cloth, which has helped reduce acne breakouts. Compared with the Mia 2, the Silk'n is much more affordable and cleans just as well as the Mia 2, but the Mia 2 has some important convenience factors I find important. You'll find those noted in the Cons section for the Silk'n.If cost is a factor, then the Silkn is a perfectly good alternative to the much more expensive Mia 2. Both units appear to be well made so I do not expect one to last longer that the other; however, this review does not include a test of longevity.Pros:--Battery lasts for over a week of daily use without charge--Helpful timed session (stops automatically)--All cleaning heads work well--Acne has cleared up significantly--Face feels much cleaner and smootherCons:--There is only one timer for entire session on the Silkn. The Mia 2 face brush has four timed intervals to inform user when to switch to the next area on face. It is important to NOT overdo any one area of the skin, so we find this to be more than just convenient.--The Silkn has one button that must be pressed repeatedly to cycle through to the desired speed/pattern, whereas the Mia 2 has separate buttons for speed or pattern of vibration. This makes selection quicker and easier on the Mia.--The Silkn charger stand is more cumbersome than the Mia 2 charging system. The stand is nice for convenient charging and storage of the cleaner, but it takes up quite a bit of room on the sink or in a drawer whereas the Mia 2 has a small, magnetically attached charger that takes up very little room in a drawer, leaving the sink clear.--The Silkn does not come with a travel case so the wet brush is exposed to debris when set in a drawer or cosmetic bag. The Mia 2 comes with a small, convenient case molded to the shape of the cleaner.If I had to chose between the two, it would come down to how important I find the added features of the Mia 2. If you don't mind spending the extra $$$ then the Mia 2 is the better choice. If you just want a fine cleansing system and don't mind the bulky charging stand, then the Silk'n is more economical and cleans just as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30YAJ9DDYLZUJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O84208Y#wasThisHelpful","R30YAJ9DDYLZUJ","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Targus Versa Type Pivoting Hard Shell KeyboardThis case is an excellent choice for anyone with a need for a case with a built-in keyboard, if you don't mind the added weight and bulkiness.The fit for the iPad Air and Air 2 is virtually perfect. With a unique padding in the lid, both kinds of iPads fit firmly in place, even though they are different thicknesses.It seems well made and has a rechargeable battery for the Bluetooth keyboard. The pivot bracket holds an Air 2 firmly enough so that even at a backwards lean of 45 the unit is stable and there is not a hint of slippage. The Air, however, is a bit heavier and needs to be positioned closer to vertical to remain stable. The case is designed with cutouts at the appropriate locations so that all functions are easily accessible yet protected from accidental activation. The case will also activate the iPads automatic shut off when closed but the keyboards Bluetooth must be shut off manually.The case is made of a rigid plastic so popping the iPad in and out is possible but not practical. The surface is rubberized for a good grip, and there are built-in, non-obtrusive rubber feet in the bottom to keep things from slipping as you type. Even though it is bulky, it still has a nice look to it. The pivot hinge keeps the case closed well so a latch is not necessary. Opening is easy.The keyboard is quite a bit smaller than a standard one but I'm getting used to it.Bluetooth setup was quite easy and straightforward.I didnt do a drop test since I was unwilling to sacrifice my new iPad. However I will update this post if I have any problems with the case or keyboard within the next year.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W2U625GY6Q6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIMXV1U#wasThisHelpful","R3W2U625GY6Q6D","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

That said, If you have a slower connection (like many of us still do) then this unit is fast enough for most uses. Unfortunately I was unable to test streaming from two devices, but from one it works fine.Setting up a modem with an ISP is not always straightforward and simple. In fact, this modem is incompatible with some ISPs, so its up to the consumer to find out FIRST if this will work with their ISP, and if their ISP is willing to give out the information necessary to make the connection. If you are experienced with DSL/Modem set up, and you have the information you need, then this unit could work out well for you. But since having trouble connecting-up is common (albeit not universal) I would hesitate recommending buying from a company with foreign technical support with employees who are difficult to understand. Free US tech support definitely has it's advantages, if you speak english.I had some problems setting up the router and tech support was of no value to me. Before I was finished, I deduced that I needed additional information from Century Link. Century Link provided the information and I was able to get everything up and running, no thanks to a tech support with English as a second language.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1D19TMXIYATGE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RGMDGG0#wasThisHelpful","R1D19TMXIYATGE","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are decent glasses, but not refined like Oakleys. Understandable considering the cost difference. If you need eye protection in the sun these are certainly a great option; especially since they are polarized. The lenses are not too dark so detail of your work is not obscured, however, some people with sensitive eyes may want more sun protection (darker lenses). Personally I prefer amber lenses for shooting since blue-blockers provide great detail.

"I have a 2 yr old toy poodle and a 13 yr old shitzu, both males. The Shitzu will eat these, sometimes, when he's hungry and nothing else is available. However, my poodle likes them a lot more and will steal the Shitzu's Greenie if he has a chance. Both of these dogs are picky eaters who want something different to eat every day, so it doesn't surprise me that even the poodle tires of them in a couple of days. But, a couple of days later he likes them again.As far as dental effectiveness, I suppose they are working.

"This is my first impression over a short review time of 30 days so reliability of this product cannot be assessed ATT.The Amped Wireless High Power 800mW AC1750 Wi-Fi Router is an excellent router with great range, but it is not the best for every situation. If you need to upgrade to increase your coverage, then this surely is a reasonable option, but if you want to increase speed, make sure its your router that is the bottleneck. I could be that your modem (cable or DSL) is slow or your ISP connect speed is limited. Also consider that FCC limits on power output can make it necessary to have more than one wireless router (range extender) to effectively cover a large home. In other words, a single wifi router may not be able to provide sufficient range, regardless of make or model.Also, if you have Apple products in your network, consider the Apple Airport Extreme (similar price range) before purchasing this. When compared to an Apple Airport Extreme, the Extreme is easier to set up and use with Apple products, which are designed to work with it directly, and the extreme has slightly better range (probably due to beam forming). Marketing the Amped routers 10,000 sq ft range is a bit misleading since that calculates out to a line-of-sight range, without obstructions, of less than 57 feet. (Not that 57 feet is bad, its just a lot less than 10,000.) Speed for both routers is about the same, even with gigabit Internet service, since the Amped routers advertised 1750 Mbps cannot be crammed down the throat of a 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps) ISP service. If you have 2-gigabit service, then the Amped router could be faster (not tested).If you dont have any Apple products (Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, etc), then consider the Amped router to be your prime consideration for a fast Internet connection. Most of the features are similar, with some favoring the Amped product, such as four gigabit wired connections on the Amped router vs three on the Extreme. The Extreme will still work in a non-Apple-product environment, but some of its advantages will be lost without Apple products in the network.The Amped router isnt magic, though. Just as with any wireless router, to obtain the best results you must place the router in a central location with the fewest obstructions between the router and the wireless devices you plan to use, and if you want to see the maximum speed gains of this router, you need a really fast Internet service (like 2-gigabit). It doesnt matter how fast your router is if the total load from your many devices (wireless and wired) exceeds your modem or ISPs capability.Of prime consideration for newbies, and even some amateurs, is that the tech support is superb, U.S. based, and free.Personally, Im sticking with the Airport Extreme because I have Apple products and I like their integrated ease of use, performance, and reliability over just about anything, and Im willing to pay for that. If you have no Apple products and need better performance than you have now, make sure your ISP package will support your load and consider buying this Amped router. If you dont understand any of this, consider calling your ISP or Amped tech support to help you figure out what you need before you buy.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NSKO4DVW4GMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QQ7SLDO#wasThisHelpful","R1NSKO4DVW4GMI","ATOKT8QYK967L","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ATOKT8QYK967L?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

My milk foaming at work, thus far, has involved a lot of shaking in a bottle and then a microwave but BEHOLD!  THE ANSWER!Nope.  Yeah, it foams, but not super well and not with any staying power.  I strongly suspect the demo people put a little soap or something in their milk.Lesson:  Ask the demo people to eat/drink the demo product.

"TMI Warning:  This review is going to be graphic, perhaps even, at times, unnecessarily so.  So, if youre squeamish or uncomfortable with your lady parts (or your ladys lady parts), or you can't handle knowing about the purging phase of the female reproductive cycle dont read this review and, also, this product is not for you.  If you cant read about it, you are not ready to dig in, as it were.Okay, graphic time.There are lots of options for lady-time.  There are pads and tampons and non-disposable cups.  All, I suppose have their merits.  Lets discuss them first:Maxi-Pad Pros:  You dont have to put anything inside your body.  Some ladies are big about wanting this, so, if thats you, stop here.Maxi-Pas Cons:  You are basically a drain tube pointed down at all times.  When theres something coming down that tube, do you really want to feel it dripping out?  Ew.  Also, this method carries the biggest risk for accidents, so, dont wear white.  Also and this is important.  Youll attract bears.  Dont go camping.  The bears will smell that delicious pile of gore between your legs and attack.  Bears.  And mosquitos.  And vampires.  Pretty much anything that likes meat of blood will want to eat you.  FYI.  This is true science.  Google it.  Im sure you can find something to support it.  Lastly, sex will be messy.Tampon Pros:  Limited bear attacks (its not a perfect seal  its cotton).  Yay!  And there is usually a string for easy removal (unless you use OB.  I think its OB.  Then you have to go fishing for it.  Which kills the string benefit).  And then theres this plunger type applicator usually.Tampon Cons:  Toxic Shock Syndrome.  I dont even really know what this is, but I dont really want it, do you.  Also, tampons usually have this horrible perfume smell.  Its not protecting you from bears but it will probs keep the vampires at bay because theyll think its gross too.  Most importantly, applying and removing and sometimes just wearing a tampon will have the potential to feel like NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD IN YOUR VAGINA.  (Boys:  You know that feeling when the doctor grabs your tongue with a cotton pad?  Try that inside you.  OMG.  No.)  Seriously, writing about wearing tampons gives me the heebie geebies.  And you have to take it out for sex, so sex is still messy.Reusable Cup (like the Diva Cup) Pros:  ZERO PERCENT CHANCE OF MENSTRUAL PRODUCT CHOICE RELATED BEAR ATTACKS.  And you only buy it the one time.  And most of them have like this little stem for easy removal.Reusable Cup (like the Diva Cup) Cons:  You can sometimes feel that stem thingy.  And, you have to take it out for sex, so sex is still messy.Soft Cup Cons (Im doing cons first so we end on a high note):  You must be comfortable in your own skin.  You will have to stick your fingers inside yourself to place this behind your pubic bone and youll have to reach a finger in to pull it out.  When it comes out, it can be messy  especially if youre new at it; the ounces of blood and bits of gore in the cup may spill on your fingers and into the toilet.  The first few times, youll want to be near a water source.  Like every system, its not perfect; you have to know your body and your flow, and change or clean it at intervals the work with you to prevent leaks.  It is disposable after each cycle, so youll have to buy one or two boxes a year.PROS:  Okay.  Like the Diva Cup, you will be totally safe from bears.  You can camp and hike and fish to your hearts content without any fear of bear attacks.  The seal is airtight.  You can rinse and reuse during your entire cycle, which means really you only need one or maybe two each cycle (sometimes you dont have a place to rinse).  The shelf-life on these puppies in use is WAY longer than tampons and pads.  I might dump mine once a day (user experience may vary).  You will feel cleaner with that air-tight seal.  Most importantly, YOU CAN HAVE SEX WITH IT IN.  Sex.  Regular you-dont-have-your-period non-messy sex.  EVEN ORAL SEX.  Like for YOU.  You dont even have to tell him.  HE WILL NEVER KNOW.  So much sex.  Sex for everyone.  Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.  You are welcome.Other Tips:The best way to clean change/clean this puppy out of all the ways is to pop your pants off and sit on the side of a tub with a hand-held shower.  Rinse it into the tub, rinse yourself.  Shake it dry.  Pop it back in.  I HIGHLY recommend this method, especially, before the sex, as it really does prep you best.On sex:  Empty this puppy first.  Yes, you can have sex and yes it will stay in but you know, youre jabbing at it repeatedly so, for the best case scenario, having it empty before you begin is the way to go.In a public restroom, pull it out, dump it, wipe it carefully with toilet paper, pop it back in.  OR, if you can manage a moment of semi-privacy or have a sink in the stall, wrap it in TO so it doesnt drip, go to sink to rinse (if you have to leave stall give yourself a quick TP maxi-pad for the quick-rinse), rinse it out (be nice to strangers, make sure all the gore is down the drain), shake it off, go back to the toilet and pop it back in.ADVANCED MOVE:  With the right wiggle/kegel move, I can actually get this puppy to tip and empty without pulling it out, wipe clean, and go about my business.  This take lots of practice and, ahem, fitness.Overall, I recommend this product with my WHOLE SOUL.  I mean, at least until they give me a way to just vacuum the whole affair out in minutes at home every month without compromising the inner workings of the lady machine.Enjoy your multitudes of clean feeling, sex, and safety from bears.*All facts about bears, vampires etc may or may not be fictional.  Please use your best discretion.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R80D61OU0WFPM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000533CC#wasThisHelpful","R80D61OU0WFPM","APE0DJTM4GLRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APE0DJTM4GLRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I sent this back.  Opened it.  WORKED GREAT!  One time.A week later it would not start.  Now, I know I was doing everything right because I'd used it before and stored in it a covered location and and...I decided to call the company for support before just returning or exchanging.  The first person I spoke to said I need to register the warranty and they'd exchange it.  Okay.Called back and talked to a guy who said he'd send me a fedex label and I'd have to get it to Fedex.  There is no pickup option. When I explained I do not have the will, strength, or time to transport this very heavy box to fedex and I'd like to call for a pickup he got very rude.  His tone was condescending as he told me I could pay for pick up or I'd have to figure it out.  I mentioned that I purchased via Amazon and that they would have a pickup option and he snidley said ""well, then you should contact amazon and I'll just cancel your warranty.""  I wish I could, in this review, convey the tone of this guy.  I don't know that a transcript of his actual word choices would be that damning.I really wanted it just to work or to exchange it.  The reviews were so good.  Even if he'd been more polite in suggesting I use Amazon to exchange instead I probably would have done that.  But, based SOLELY ON THE CUSTOMER SERVICE, I am returning my useless machine instead of exchanging it.  I am now researching other brands to purchase.  Perhaps Toro, since I very much like the other yard and garden machines I have from them.Also, in retrospect, if I was going to buy a Snow Joe I'd but the 620 instead.  It's so much cheaper and exactly the same as this one minus the headlight, which is a bitch to turn on with gloves and doesn't really provide any light greater than what the street offers, so, unless you live in a completely dark rural place, I'd say you don't need the headlight and you're wasting your money if you choose to go the Snow Joe route.  Then again, if you DO live in a completely rural place, chances are your drive is too big too big for this to handle and you need a gas thrower anyway.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HBZZ445HMY62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0040X4VB2#wasThisHelpful","R2HBZZ445HMY62","APE0DJTM4GLRA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/APE0DJTM4GLRA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The remote doesn't seem to work fine enough.  Also, it's nicer lookign than the i-home.My only complaint, so far, is that the nano adaptor does not fit my nano.

"First, this is a really nice and well made bra.  Second, I sent it back for a refund.This athletic bra is beautiful and made of luxurious material.  It is comfortable and has a ""quality"" feel that lets you know that it will last a long time.  Very good value for the money!  The support isn't heavy, but it is comparable to other bras of this style.  Not for aggressive, high impact exercise, but great for low impact cardio or Pilates or other gentle workouts.  I think it would also make a good swim top.So if it so wonderful, then why did I return it?  Because it is simply not proportioned right for a large busted woman.  It is a common failing of companies that offer plus sized garments that they often don't realize that as a woman;s measurements get larger, her proportions often also change and larger cup sizes are needed to accommodate large busts.  The type of proportions that would fit a woman who is a medium do not always translate to a plus size.  I wear a 42DDD bra size and am a 2X in plus size women's clothing.  I ordered the 3X, hoping that the cup section would fit my bust.  When it came, it was a bit loose on the band but far TOO SMALL in the breast area, resulting in ""boob spillage"" out the sides and on top.  I was so disappointed because this was such a pretty, nicely made bra, and I SO wanted it to fit well!  But it was not to be, and I ended up sending it back.Return was easy and the seller sent me a return label within minutes of my refund request.  Postage was required and it cost me almost $3.00 to mail it back, so my net refund was a bit less than I paid.  However, I figure that if I had driven into town to try on bras, I would have spent that much in gas so I don't feel out the postage and am happy with the service I received.  If the bra had been defective, I would have expected the seller to pay return shipping but as it is, I think it was a fair arrangement.So, if you are a woman who's cup size is DD or below, this might be a good choice for you.  I am a 2X and I think a 2X in this bra would have been a perfect fit if my cup size had been a C or D.  But if you cup size is large compared to your overall build, you will not be able to wear this bra.  DDD is TOO LARGE FOR THIS BRA, even if you order a size up.Just for your information, there is a bra on Amazon that fits me perfectly and so if your cup size runs DDD, you might have better luck with the FRUIT OF THE LOOM WOMEN'S 3 PACK BUILT-UP SPORTS BRA.  You can find it on Amazon here:http://amazon.com/gp/product/B005BT2TB8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00The Fruit of the Loom isn't as good of a bra as the NL230, AND it doesn't come in the variety of beautiful colors,  but it is still very nice, it fits well and it is about ' of the price.  I am a 2X and wear a 42 DDD and the Fruit of the Loom fits very well in a size 44.I would have loved for the NL230 to fit my body but unfortunately, a lot of bra designers and manufacturers don't understand that often plus sized women also have large busts.  For women who have an average bust size, AND YOU DON'T NEED LOTS OF SUPPORT, this is a really, REALLY good choice!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R90D7WFX8B2RD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YQJR6RQ#wasThisHelpful","R90D7WFX8B2RD","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a lifelong night-owl and insomniac, I have found that artificial light at night sets me up for sleeplessness.  So when night falls and I'm not ready to turn in, I wear these glasses until bedtime.  I find myself more relaxed when it is time to go to sleep and it has helped in my crusade to overcome insomnia.As others have pointed out, the lenses aren't top quality, nor do they fit over existing reading glasses.  Items view through these glasses are slightly distorted - not bad, but don't expect to use these for anything intricate.  That doesn't matter to me because  I only want these to block blue light in the hour or so before bedtime.  I can watch some light TV without triggering insomnia, clean my kitchen after dinner, or work a large print crossword puzzle, which is all I really need.  I cannot use these if I want to read a book unless the print is large.So for general relaxing before bedtime, these work great to tell your brain it is time for sleep.  For anything that requires high end lenses or intricate viewing, you should keep looking.  For me, they are excellent.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RTC3H7NIFLH2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000USRG90#wasThisHelpful","R2RTC3H7NIFLH2","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I orderred brown because lighter shades are rare when it comes to mascara and eyebrow pencils.  This is OK, but a bit too dark for my coloring.  It is really easy to apply more than you need, so if you are lighter complected then you might be happier with a blonde shade if you can find it.The little eyebrow  brush on the lid is a bit difficult to use because the lid is pretty small and awkward when it is off  the pencil, and it swivels around when it is on.

"Let's face it. Chocolate, all by itself is bitter. And Stevia is super sweet and also bitter. So the combination of these two ingredients creates an intense DARK CHOCOLATE that is very bitter-sweet. Not a product for beginners, but very good for those who are accustomed to and appreciate the bitter notes of true chocolate and the super bittersweet flavor of stevia.Chocolate has the potential to be a healthy superfood when it is consumed correctly - meaning that sugar and milk are not a part of the mix. When chocolate candy is created, sugar and milk are added to tone down the bitterness of the chocolate. But when people struggle with health issues, sugar is sometimes not an option, and often milk is also not an option. Furthermore, milk negates the health benefits of chocolate. According to the University of Michigan Health System, ""Milk binds to antioxidants in chocolate making them unavailable; therefore, milk chocolate is not a good antioxidant source. To get the benefits of antioxidants, avoid drinking milk with dark chocolate."" (I would cite my source but Amazon doesn't allow links in their reviews. Just google the terms, dairy and chocolate antioxidants, and the very first article should be the one I am referring to.) In other words, to get the health benefits of chocolate, you must consume it without sugar and without dairy.I really like the simplicity of the Dante's ingredient list: Chocolate Liqueur, Stevia, Pure Vanilla. 98% Cocoa. And as a diabetic, I am in love with the fact that there is no sugar in the mix. With this kind of list, the bitter taste is impossible to avoid. So - if you hate bitter, then don't try this. But if you like a simple, healthy, exotic and sophisticated dessert, then this might just be right up your alley.You must also understand that this in not a low calorie food. Even without sugar, there are still 260 calories per 45 gram bar AND 12 grams of carbohydrate. Most of the calories in the Dante bar come from chocolate's high quality fat. Compare to a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate bar which is 190 calories per 41 gram bar and 25 grams of carbohydrate (the carbs are mostly from sugar). This isn't about low calorie, low fat or low carb. It is about the health benefits of pure chocolate and NO dairy or sugar - which is great news for diabetics who are open to new taste sensations. I think people often lose weight when using such foods because it is intense and you cannot eat much at all.  A very little bit is satisfying and goes a long way.  This stevia sweetened chocolate is SO intense that you might not be able to eat more than one tiny square at a time. This is where you will save on calories, fat and carbs - this chocolate is so satisfying that you will eat less and your cravings will be satisfied to the extent that binging will become a thing of the past. Or if straight chocolate is too much for you, then you can grate it and sprinkle it on top of a whipped coconut cream mousse for a touch of chocolatey flavor without the dairy and sugar. There are lots of things you can do with this, but be aware that this will NEVER taste anything remotely like a Hershey's candy bar. Do not buy this thinking you will be able to make that switch because the two do not really compare. It is better to realize that the bitterness inherent in both the chocolate and the stevia is to be appreciated and not avoided. If you can come to terms with that, you might end up being one of those people who LOVE Dante's Stevia Chocolate. If not, you will hate it.So - I am giving the 5 stars because it is sugar and dairy free and the chocolate used is organic and non-GMO. For a simple, nutrient rich, sugar free chocolate rush - I think the Dante is wonderful! However I am a long time Stevia user and am used to the taste of stevia. And, my husband and I are both used to eating 100% UNSWEETENED chocolate and we weren't surprised at the bitterness. As long as you understand what it is and what it is not, I think you might like it, too!Nutrition Facts:Serving Size - 1 barServings per container - 1Calories 260Calories from fat - 210 (remember that chocolate fat (cocoa butter) is a super healthy fat)Total Fat - 24 gramsSaturated Fat - 14 gramsTrans Fat - 0 gramsCholesterol - 0 gramssodium - 0 gramsTotal Carbohydrate - 12 gramsDietary Fiber - 7 gramsSugars - 0 gramsProtein - 7 grams","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YRJF6QYA013C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CDJ4SSG#wasThisHelpful","R1YRJF6QYA013C","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In the preface of JOY, Abigail Santamaria tells of an incident that occurred during her preliminary research into Joy Davidman's life.  Most of the first hand witnesses to Joy's life were either long dead or in advanced old age, but a few remained to ""set the record straight"".  One of them was the former Ruth Davidman, the first wife of Howard Davidman, Joy's brother.  At first, Ruth was hesitant to be interviewed for this project and was leery to be a part of a book that was determined to ""perpetuate the myth"".  Santamaria assured her that she only wanted to write a true account of Joy's life and was prepared to be objective and truthful.  This author absolutely lived up to her word and has painted a portrait that is credible but not exactly what fans of CS Lewis and Joy Davidman have come to expect.The book starts with Joy's background - her parents and grandparents story of immigration, hardship and poverty in a new country and how they rose from the lowest rung of society to being involved, educated and contributing citizens of this nation.  Then there is the account of Joy's childhood, brilliance and education that prepared her to take a place among the intellectual elite of the early to mid 20th century.  All of this is played out in front of a backdrop of a painful longing and searching that kept her restless and unsatisfied - and it was this searching spirit that drove her life - causing her to start out as an idealistic extremist, only to be disappointed and ultimately disillusioned until she had an unexpected Spiritual encounter that completely altered the course of her life.  The first half of the book was a bit slow moving, but it was interesting and exactly what I expected.  As a southern, Christian, conservative woman, this was a peek into the experience of people whose lives are completely different from anything that I had known, and I enjoyed seeing the inner workings of a culture that is largely unfamiliar to me.  But, it was the last half of the book that left me breathless and my head spinning with the moral dilemmas presented by a woman who was incredibly complex.  I couldn't put it down, and I assure you that the material contained in this book will have you asking yourself, ""who is God?"", and did Joy really find Him?  I'm not prepared to answer that but I think I'll be pondering this for a long time to come.  I don't know if I ever completely bought into ""the myth"", but I did expect something more orthodox than what I found here.  As a Christian, the true story challenged many of my deepest presuppositions, and I found myself crying as it played out on the pages of this raw, painfully honest and riveting book.This is a very interesting read.  All of my adult life I have been captivated by CS Lewis's writings and wished to know more about him and his wife.  It isn't what I expected, but I appreciated the courage the author displayed when she told the story of the real Joy.  The popular perception of CS Lewis is a veritable legend in some circles and having the real story ""outed"" so thoroughly was a major eye opener to me.  So, I'm giving this book 4 stars, because it is well done, but I'm deducting one star because the first half of the book was a little bit tedious.  Even though the the early chapters are somewhat slow moving, I wouldn't advise you to skip them because they lay the foundation for everything that goes on in the second half.  You might have to apply some effort to get through the section covering her early years, but this is an important part of the whole story.  It really is worth making the effort to read in it's entirety.Joy's son, Douglas Gresham has written a memoir of his childhood called, ""Lenten Lands: My Childhood With Joy Davidman and C.S. Lewis"".  I have ordered it from Amazon to see if his account squares with the story that is told here.  If you're interested, you can get it here:http://amazon.com/gp/product/0025455702?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00Since Douglas collaborated on Abigail Santamaria's book, my guess is that it will probably confirm this take on Joy Davidman.  I am looking forward to reading it and when I finish, I'll update this review to reflect what he has to say.If you are someone who needs to have everything neat and understandable, this is going to make you uncomfortable at best and offended at worst.  Famous people who carry a religious banner for others to follow don't always live up to the persona that people project onto them.  I don't think either Jack or Joy ever set out to make themselves into icons of 20th century Christianity - others did that to them.  However a close look will show two people with plenty of baggage, faults and failings.  If you harbor illusions that you don't want shattered, then I advise you to skip this book.  If you can handle a very bumpy and challenging ride then you just might find this to be worth your while.As for me, I intend to re-read all of my CS Lewis books and ask myself the question, ""did I really understand what he was saying or was I projecting my own opinions in a way that made me hear what I wanted to hear?""  I think I'll start with A GRIEF OBSERVED.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L4DAT0DWS9P3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0151013713#wasThisHelpful","R2L4DAT0DWS9P3","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We have two dogs, one of which eats so fast that he almost chokes during mealtime.  He is a small dog who LOVES to eat, but he doesn't get much food, and is getting fat - even though his portions are half of what our other dog gets!  I hate seeing him longing to be able to eat more, but I know it isn't good for him.  To make matters worse, our other dog is twice his size, is thin and athletic and needs a large amount of food to fuel her fast metabolism.  Her appetite isn't as voracious as his is, and she eats her large meals at a slow, luxurious pace that goes on long after he has scarfed up every morsel in his bowl.  So he has to watch her eat after his food is gone and he longs for more!  I've been thinking of getting some of these slo-bowls for a long time and last week I was browsing in a local pet supply shop and saw these.  I bought them on impulse.  I envisioned my dogs enjoying a longer meal time and was hoping that the little guy would lose weight while stretching the enjoyment of his food for a longer time.I am disappointed in the result and my dogs HATE these bowls.  It does significantly slow down food time, but in my mind I thought that a slower meal would equal extending my dogs' enjoyment of their food.  They both hate these things and when meal time comes, they stare lethargically at their food as if they are dreading the task of trying to eat.  They are completely unable to empty the bowls because the circular design causes the food to endlessly move away from their mouths!  This morning, I watched them eat and after 15 frustrating minutes of not being able to access the food, one of them heaved a big, frustrated sigh and laid down next to the bowl.  He simply gave up and opted to skip breakfast rather than struggle with this thing any more!  I was so sad for him.I think the idea is great, but this particular design is way too difficult for my dogs.  I'll give them some time to adjust and if things get better, I'll come back and change my star rating.  Meanwhile, I'm actively looking for a Slow Feeder that will force them to eat more slowly without being so difficult that they give up and go hungry.The real surprise for me is that my larger dog is a Border Collie who is extremely smart and loves a challenge.  She plays incessantly and enjoys puzzles and mental stimulation.  I really thought she would love this type of bowl, but it only makes her depressed.  I don't mind that they are challenged, but in order for a game to be fun, it at least has to be winnable.  If it isn't the dogs will give up.  Nice try, but this one is a failure in our house!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R190PL6VSCFBA8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011SSQIXA#wasThisHelpful","R190PL6VSCFBA8","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is for the Audible Audio Book version of ALONE WITH MR. DARCY.I am a longtime fan of Elizabeth Klett and find her reading style understandable, entertaining and always first rate. I mostly chose to listen to this story because I knew that this narrator is a wonderful reader who always delivers an enjoyable listening experience. ALONE WITH MR. DARCY is no exception and, once again, she lives up to the caliber of performance that I have come to expect. She is real pleasure to listen to! I am only sorry that this particular book wasn't the best use of her considerable talent.I was offered this audio book for free in exchange for an honest review, and chose to listen to it because I am a fan of the narrator, and also because I love Jane Austin and am on a quest to find JA Fan Fictions that live up to the originals that inspired them. There are a plethora of ""spin-off"" books that take their inspiration from Jane, but seldom do they live up to the beloved classics that we cannot get enough of. This one is no exception.This book is inspired by PRIDE AND PREJUDICE but doesn't try to recreate the classic story at all. I really liked that the author started the book at Charlotte Lucas's wedding and from that point on, she gives us an original story that deviates from PRIDE AND PREJUDICE so much that it plays out in a completely different way. While the roots of ALONE WITH MR. DARCY are anchored in Jane Austen, Abigail Reynolds takes the liberty of writing an original story that gives the reader a completely new and different ending to the book. I found this to be refreshing. However there were some mistakes in this story that ruined it for me.The biggest issue with ALONE WITH MR. DARCY was that it lacked that certain something that defines Jane Austen's work. There was none of the underlying passion that builds up, so that the reader stays completely engaged without the narrative ever spelling out the more explicit sexual elements that are part of the story. I do realize that there are many people who WANT these things to be spelled out, but many JA fans prefer the understated, clever writing style that results in a balance between the romance and other elements of the story. Jane Austen is not essentially a romance novelist, but a writer whose books are romantic within a context of a well rounded story that develops a number of characters and situations. This is an important distinction for me. ALONE WITH MR. DARCY is a pure, crude, bodice ripping romance novel, and the feel it captures is more correctly defined as Barbara Cartland rather than Jane Austen. If you like that kind of thing, then this is a pretty readable romance, but I prefer Jane's humor, clever dialog, understated passion, insight, satire and well rounded commentary on all elements of society and human relations. Romance enthusiasts will love this book as it is a tidal wave of unrestrained kissing, cuddling, groping and more, so that the characters are in a perpetual state of swooning over each other. True Jane Austen fans will miss the subtle elements that make Jane unique. The characters are familiar only in their names, places and general situations, but they behave in ways that leave the reader wondering where our familiar old friends are!PROCEED WITH CAUTION! SPOILERS AHEAD!This story begins on Charlotte Lucas's Wedding day. Elizabeth Bennett takes a winter day's walk during the party and happens upon a barely conscious Mr. Darcy who has been in an accident just as a winter blizzard is beginning. In order to save their lives, the two of them take shelter in a nearby deserted cottage where they are snowed in for 3 days. This particular plot device felt contrived to me - a way to get them alone in a compromised situation and let the sparks fly without Elizabeth deliberately allowing this kind of intimacy. You can imagine what transpires during these 3 days and when it is over, Elizabeth's reputation is ruined in a way that ONLY marriage can repair. I found myself rolling my eyes during this portion of the book, as it is a very unlikely situation and felt pretty manipulative. But that was just the beginning of this book's shortcomings.One particular thing that grated on me was that it is a lightweight read that tries to tackle some pretty heavyweight subject matter and fails miserably. Early in the book, one of the characters from the original PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is publicly gang raped in a tavern by a bunch of officers. This is pure GRATUITOUS sex and violence at it's worst. Darcy and Elizabeth accidentally walk into the tavern and witness this terrible scene and (even though the girl who is being destroyed is supposedly a friend of Elizabeth's), they do nothing to intervene. Instead, they avoid the situation and leave quietly because they fear that taking a stand would be dangerous to them. As they go on their merry way, they barely seem to be bothered by what they just saw and a few days later, when the terrible event is gossiped all over town, Elizabeth reacts with a vague ""oh dear, poor Mariah Lucas, but ins't Darcy HOT!"" In really good fiction, as in REAL LIFE, witnessing a close friend being gang raped would have devastated any normal woman. But Elizabeth doesn't seem to be too bothered, which made her come across as a kind of sociopath who I didn't really like at all.Some works of fiction are very serious, and when sensitively rendered, a story can do a lot of good by including things that are difficult to read or watch. The riveting movie, TWO WOMEN is one such work, and the subject of gang rape is treated with the gravity it deserves. When an author chooses to include such a event in a book, play or movie, they are accepting a serious responsibility on how they do it. Such a writer really needs the chops to handle this kind of subject matter and that was sorely lacking here. This particular book is pure fluff and doesn't have the depth needed for this kind of event. It has no place in the central theme of the story and serves no purpose other than a lame attempt by the author to make this book ""serious"" when this is absolutely lightweight fodder for folks who don't want to think too hard. (There is nothing wrong with lightweight reading, or enjoying a fun read when you want to relax, but scenes such as a gang rape have no place in this kind of sheer storytelling.) I couldn't believe the careless way this was handled and I found myself not respecting this version of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy for leaving this poor innocent virgin to her fate and not helping her. Later on, Darcy paid some ""good sport"" to marry Mariah, but I couldn't help thinking that this gesture was far too little and far too late when he could have tried to rescue her and did not. The original Elizabeth and Darcy were ethical and courageous and I cannot imagine them engaging in an act of cowardice like this. And between all her swooning and trembling over Darcy, Mariah Lucas's fate seemed to make very little impression on Elizabeth. She was slightly distressed but didn't shed a single tear, didn't lose a moment's sleep over this situation and barely managed a ""tsk, tsk"" when she thought of it. This alone was enough to put me off of this particular tale.When an author chooses to write a book it is important for them to accurately assess what they are capable of, and from what I saw in this instance, I don't think Abigail Reynolds has the talent or depth to tackle something like this. Honestly, as much as I love Jane Austen, I don't think even she could have pulled off such an event in one of her books. P& P is expertly written, but is not constructed for heavyweight material, and when updates and alternate tales veer into such territory, they do a disservice to the type of story they are constructing. One of the things that made Jane so VERY GOOD at what she did was her understanding of what her type of stories could and couldn't handle. It is to her credit that she didn't go to into places that her stories couldn't support, and Fan Fiction writers would do themselves a favor if they refrained from charging into territory that the Original Author didn't dare to tread.I also didn't think the story had the underlying feel of Jane Austen. As I said before, this might have worked as a Barbara Cartland fan fiction, but it simply didn't live up to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Nothing is included about Jane Bennett and Mr. Bingley, Elizabeth loses her wit and strength, and there is a very dumb back story of Mr. Bennett that was jarring. Mr. Darcy comes across as moral but wimpy. I think it would have been preferable for the author to remove all references to Jane Austen's story and written this book as an original romance novel. And I think it would have wise to drop the rape altogether because it really, REALLY didn't belong here. So if you are an enthusiast of the Romance genre, you might like this book. If you are a fan of Jane Austen, you will may or may not finish reading it, and you will feel unsatisfied, because all the things that make Jane Austen unique are gone from ALONE WITH MR. DARCY.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FOK3710VCTP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013TF1QT6#wasThisHelpful","R3FOK3710VCTP","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Slow cookers are one of the great inventions of the 20th Century.  You wake up in the morning and spend 10 minutes assembling that night's dinner, and then you can clean the kitchen after breakfast.  5-8 hours later - DINNER is SERVED!!!  :- DThe problem with slow cookers is that the deeper notes of umami flavor that develop when foods are browned gets left out.  It is subtle but it can be the difference between a GREAT dish and a ""nothing special"" dish.  I have compensated for this by searing foods on a griddle or a skillet before placing them into a slow cooker, but that doubles prep time and adds significantly to clean up.  When pressed for time, I just toss ingredients into the slow cooker raw and accept that the finished product won't be quite as good.So when this Multi Cooker showed up on the Vine I hoped it might be the answer to that dilemma and this didn't disappoint me!  This is a slow cooker / roaster that has the ability to sear food in the same vessel that you cook it in - saving an extra step and seriously simplifying clean up!  It will brown food and when you are ready to switch to slow cooking mode, you just walk away and your dinner cooks itself while you clean up the supper prep area with your breakfast dishes.  Then you are free to spend your day on more rewarding pursuits and there isn't that heavy, ever present ""what's for dinner"" question weighing on your mind.The removable liner of the Multi Cooker is made of a non-stick metal so that it can be heated up to 450 degrees for browning.  It takes about 15 minutes to preheat the liner to the proper temp.  I like to get it hot enough for a small amount of water to bead up and dance around on the cooking surface - something you wouldn't DARE to do with a slow cooker crock.  (In fact, it isn't even possible to get a slow cooker crock this hot.)  Then you take your meat and sear the outside, sealing in the juices and creating a yummy, rich crust and a small amount of drippings that will be the base of a wonderful sauce.  I FIND THAT WHEN MEAT IS PREPPED THIS WAY, THE RESULTING UMAMI HAS SUCH A RICH, SAVORY FLAVOR THAT IT NEEDS FAR LESS SALT TO SEASON IT.  This is GREAT when you need to reduce your sodium intake.  Once the meat is seared, you can switch to the slow cook mode, season as desired and start the 5-8 hour cooking cycle (depending on the recipe you are using) adding other ingredients in a few hours so that they don't overcook.  When using the searing function, I used a spatter guard to further reduce the chore of cleaning up.I started with a beef arm roast and it turned out delicious, with just the right amount of juice to make nice sauce.  Most of the juices had been sealed in so that the meat wasn't dry and there was that savory, browned umami flavor that is so often missing in ordinary crock pot meals, but with all the tenderness of meat that has been slow cooking at low temps all day long.  About half way into the cooking cycle, I could add potatoes, carrots and onions which cooked to perfection and produced the ultimate traditional roast beef dinner.  Just add salad and you are ready to serve a meal that seems as if you worked all day.  And since the heavy-duty clean up was finished hours earlier, you just have a few dishes to wash and you're done!  The liner pan is removable and easy to clean while the base unit needs a simple wipe-down.  Clean up is easy and uncomplicated.The instruction manual has a small section at the back with several recipes to get you started.  There are soups, stews, and even instructions for cooking deep-dish lasagna!  You can roast meats, such as brisket, pot roast, and cornish game hens.  Theoretically, you could roast a chicken or a duck, but this cooker is more shallow than an average slow cooker, and in order to cook medium to large birds, you will have to cut them up into pieces.  I find that a roasting chicken is too tall for the cooker and you cannot place the lid on if you try to cook it whole.  It is fine if you cut the chicken up, though.  Large birds such as turkey or goose would be far too large, and to cook the bigger birds, you would have to move up to one of the very big roasters.The metal pan insert is coated in a non-stick material.  While this is convenient, non stick surfaces are notoriously toxic and so I called the convenient toll-free number that is included in the owner's manual to find out exactly what this is made of.  The phone was quickly answered by a REAL LIVE PERSON who was polite and helpful.  It was nice to hear that the coating is of a non-toxic ceramic that doesn't have any of the carcinogens that have given non-stick surfaces have a bad reputation.  While I would rather have stainless steel, I am more comfortable knowing that the issues of cancer causing materials have been addressed in this product. I do prefer a lead-free crock or stainless steel.  When used correctly, stainless steel can also be non-stick and I see no good reason to make cooking appliances that in the long run can add toxins that might be carcinogenic to your diet.  But the newer non stick coatings are vastly improved and when I talked to their customer service, I found out that they are addressing this issue, not only with the Multi Cooker, but with their other products as well.  Good for them.There are some negatives to this multi cooker that I think I should mention:1.  While it is an awesome appliance, it is a bit too expensive for what it is.  Even the huge Turkey Roasters sell for about half this price and slow cookers are about one third of what this costs.  If I had to pay for this, I might still buy it, because the searing function is kind of unique.  But I'd have to talk myself into it..2.  No automatic shut off.  This means that you cannot ""set it and forget it"".  When cooking time is over, you need to be there to prevent burning.  I get around this by using an inexpensive plug timer:http://amazon.com/Woods-50007-Indoor-Digital-Settings/dp/B005WQIDHY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1438190167&sr=8-4&keywords=plug+timer3.  THIS IS A SMALL, SHALLOW COOKER.  IT IS NOT ONE OF THOSE HUGE ROASTERS THAT YOU CAN EXPECT TO MAKE A TURKEY IN.  If you want a very large roaster, you should consider this item instead:http://amazon.com/Oster-Pound-Roaster-Oven-Stainless/dp/B00PKOZKJW/ref=sr_1_3?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1438187893&sr=1-3&keywords=electric+turkey+roaster&refinements=p_72%3A1248915011%2Cp_n_feature_keywords_two_browse-bin%3A7801537011While the size is larger than the average Crock Pot, the removable cooking pan itself is quite shallow.  This is because about 1/3 of the depth in the cooker is taken up by a large heating plate that goes directly under the removable cooking pan.  It is this heating plate that makes the searing function possible so it is a matter of sacrificing some depth to gain a much needed function.  This is fine, because the length and width are generous, but the pot itself is shallow.  You cannot cook anything tall in this, and although the owner's manual has a cover photo of a beautifully roasted chicken, the truth is that a normal chicken would be too tall to sit in this cooking pan with the lid on.  I don't know where they got the photo of a roasted whole chicken, but I can assure you that they didn't cook it in this appliance!  This is better suited to two very small chickens or several quail or cornish hens.  Or you could cook a larger bird if you cut it into pieces first.  But forget putting a whole chicken into this cooker - if you do, the lid will not go on top and close properly.  The shallow cooking area makes this a nice choice for casseroles, it isn't appropriate for anything that sits tall.  I took away one star from an otherwise (almost) perfect item because of how shallow the pan is.  It would be awesome if they would include a simple extender ring in the package like you find in air fryers.  Something like this - if you look closely, you will see a stainless steel extender ring between the cooker and the lid that address the problem of depth when cooking a whole bird:http://amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSL89F8?ref_=cm_cr-mr-titleIn the Amazon Vine, we get lots and lots of free products, and to be honest, a too many of them are not very good.  After evaluating and reviewing products, I find that most of the time they end up discarded because I usually don't want to keep them in the long run.  This Black & Decker is an exception to that rule and I am pleased to know that it is one of the rare Vine product that has passed muster and earned space in my busy, overcrowded kitchen.  I LOVE it, and can easily make great use of it in the long term.I highly recommend it for people who love to eat, hate to cook and hate to clean the kitchen!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3RGOKVW7V0OTH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5XJ9NI#wasThisHelpful","R3RGOKVW7V0OTH","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, and was delighted to find that they were in another project together.  Both of them are very talented and almost always do a great job of acting.  SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was absolutely one of my favorite all-time flicks.This movie was a bit different.  It was watchable and wasn't boring.  The plot was kind of slow moving and a bit forgettable - there was nothing about this story that got me involved with the characters or made me really care what happened.  Defiantly didn't keep me on the edge of my seat or anything.  It isn't my favorite film by a long shot, but I still enjoyed it.  The biggest problem is that the screenplay itself left a lot to be desired.  But everything else was so outstanding that, incredibly, the actual story didn't really matter so much.  It was a pretty good movie simply because of how beautiful it was and how great the acting was.  The soundtrack was nothing special, but appropriate background music for the time and place that this was set in.It wasn't the best mover ever, but as something beautiful and enjoyable to watch while doing other things, it was really nice.  The cinematography was dazzling and I loved all the scenes of gardens and architecture.  The costumes were lush and the acting was first rate.  I loved Stanley Tucci's performance as the King's brother and Alan Rickman is always first rate as an actor.  I found his portrayal of King Louis XIV to be wonderful!  The leads, Kate Winslet and Matthias Schoenaert were understated as the two lovers, and they were somehow outdone by Rickman and Tucci, even though they had the greater share of screen time.The plot is FICTIONAL but very loosely based on historical facts.  Louis X!V was a real person, and the construction of Versailles was a real event.  The Queen of France really did die during these events and the King's actual second wife was referred to in a minor and offhand way.  But the factual events contained in this story are merely a backdrop for a fictional love story.  For the plot to interest me, I would have preferred the story to be more factual and less fictional, but that is just me.  Maybe if the love story had been more compelling, I would have gotten more involved, but as it is, the fiction fell flat while the facts are actually quite intriguing.  I think more could have been made of the story.So, for a mildly enjoyable way to kill some spare time, this is pretty good but it is mostly fluff.  If you are craving some heavy duty stimulating plot to think about, I just don't think you will find it here.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIO9OZG0PYYJQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7R9FWQ#wasThisHelpful","RIO9OZG0PYYJQ","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I don't eat fried foods, but sometimes I miss that crispy, crunchy food that you get when you fry something to a golden-brown.  So when this showed up on my Amazon Vine queue, I was really excited to try it.Unpacking and assembly was super easy.  There is an owner's manual included and a small cookbook, too.  So you can be up and running without a lot of confusion and hassle.  Also included in the package is a small oil sprayer - although I do have my doubts about this item since my experience is that oil sprayers tend to clog up and they don't last long.  I did have a few questions about things I wasn't sure of and was pleased to find a package insert with a Toll Free number where I could call and get some personalized instruction.  The number led me to a voice mail and I left a message, which was returned by a very helpful person within an hour.I wanted to start out with something simple, so I chose the Pork Spare Ribs from the cookbook, which turned out delicious.  There are a number of tantalizing recipes included in the little book and I look forward to trying most of them.  However, the list of recipes puzzled me because most of them aren't unique to this kind of cooking and could just as easily be make in a Crock Pot.  Actually, I think a Crock Pot, electric skillet, or an oven might be even better for some of these recipes.  My Spare Ribs were yummy, but if they had been slow-cooked, I think they would have turned out more tender.The best use of this type of cooker is to make things crispy.  And that is a challenge because to use the crisping function, you must cook things in a single layer so that the hot air is able to freely circulate around the food.  Since the single-layer cooking space is quite small, you will find yourself with small portions, or you will be hovering over batch after batch until you have cooked the amount that you want.That's because the Aero Fryer is compact.  Actually it is smaller than I expected and that makes it just about right for a family of only 2-4 people.  If you are feeding more people than that, I think this could be a challenge and you will find yourself making things in batches instead of being able to cook a large meal in one batch.  For large gatherings, this will be frustrating to use, and cooking things like fries or onion rings (while they taste fine), can only be done in very small batches because the have to be spread out in a single layer, in a basket that is only 8"" in diameter.  You will be lucky to be able to cook more than one potato or onion at a time.  That is a single serving.  So, remember - while you are considering this type of appliance, it doesn't produce a lot of food for the space it takes up.If you are only cooking for one or two people, I think this might work well to reheat things like frozen chicken nuggets, or frozen fries, or frozen onion rings.  The circulating air does a good job of making things hot and crispy.  But if you don't eat this type of diet, you might find this appliance to be redundant, as most of the things you can cook in the AeroFryer can actually be made with other appliances.So, the ""pros"" of the AeroFryer are that it is simple, and easy to use.  It makes crispy treats if you only want a little bit.  The customer service and product support is excellent.  The clean up is uncomplicated and most of the components are dishwasher safe.  You will have to wipe down the top that has the electric heating element (which is a halogen light bulb), and the base is plastic and should be hand washed.  Everything else goes into the dishwasher and it isn't hard to clean at all.But the ""cons"" of this device are that the capacity was surprisingly small, even though it takes up considerable counter space.  It makes only small batches of ""crispy"" type foods, while most of it's other functions can be better served by a crock pot or an oven.My guess is that an item like this would be useful to someone who lives alone, loves fried foods but wants to cut down on fat, and doesn't have an overlapping appliance like a slow cooker.For my purposes, I find other cooking methods to be superior and I don't like the frustration of cooking french fries in such tiny batches.  I don't think I'll get much use from this item but I can see that it would be handy for the right person.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EN241SCL7PN3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QSL89F8#wasThisHelpful","R3EN241SCL7PN3","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are awesome jeans!  They are traditional, cowboy type denims with a slightly updated and flattering silhouette that is just right for work or casual wear.  The rise is made for a long torso, so the waist hits a bit higher on the body than most cuts.Nicely made, good quality medium weight denim jeans that are pre-washed and broken in for a soft, comfortable feel.  They fit well in the waist and hips and the cut is relaxed for easy comfort.  The design is a traditional, 5 pocket styling with contrasting flat fell seams and boot cut for a long-wearing, sturdy garment that should give years of use.The labeled 32"" inseam is too long right out of the package but will most likely shrink when washed and dried, so I think the length will probably be right after they are laundered.  My husband is 6' tall, and a size 36 x 32.  He has a long torso and shorter legs relative to his rise.  These jeans fit him perfectly in the 36"" waist and perfectly in the long-torso rise.  However, even though he normally wears a 32"" inseam, these 32"" inseams are slightly too long for his legs.  I measured them and they are actually 32"" in the inseam.  So I think that the loose cut must make them look and feel longer than what he is used to.There is a single flaw that I might mention just in case fabric content is  important to you.  The Amazon ad states that this garment is 98% cotton and 2% spandex.  However the jeans I received are 100% cotton - which in some people's eyes might be an upgrade.  I do think that all cotton garments wear longer than blends.  I am deducting one star because the ad page information about fabric content is not correct.Otherwise, these are great pants and I highly recommend them!  At the price of $24.99, they are a great deal for the nice quality and give a lot of bang for the buck.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IQJ48XZEO8PK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XKY704W#wasThisHelpful","R1IQJ48XZEO8PK","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are awesome bookmarks/subject dividers for a 3 ring binder.  I love that they come in beautiful colors and designs, but think these are more suited to women than to men because the bright colors and pretty designs have a feminine vibe.They serve much the same purpose as the old-fashioned subject dividers, except this design is not a whole page-sized sheet, but a long, narrow divider that has the tab at the top instead of out the side.  I like that they are plastic instead of paper because that makes them sturdier and they won't tear as easily.Included in the package are little stick on labels for the tabs.  You can write anything you want on them OR you can access label templates online so that the tab labels are neatly printed on your inkjet printer.The three loose-leaf holes are not solid, but each of them have an opening so that you can slip the bookmarks on and off the rings without opening the binder - that is why they are called Snap-In.  It is very convenient to be able to reposition them whenever you need to change places.They won't work well with report folders because they depend on the flexibility of a 3 ring loose leaf binder.  When I ordered them, I was envisioning something I could use with a large, expandable folder but after seeing them in person, I quickly realized that the usefulness is strictly limited to the 3 ring loose leaf.  For that application, they are awesome!","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAZ7VGO0Q9WB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X7HWY6G#wasThisHelpful","RAZ7VGO0Q9WB6","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I  have really, REALLY problem feet and I've tried everything in an attempt to curb the super dry, thick, cracked skin that builds up and creates a serious health hazard.  When my feet start cracking and bleeding, it is difficult to walk and being a diabetic, this is potentially a serious health threat.  These moisturizing gel toe socks are the best remedy that I have found, and the 5 toe design address all the areas where other remedies have failed.When I was young, I used to use the old ""vaseline and cotton socks"" treatment, which is almost useless because the cotton soaks up the vaseline and leaves the feet dry.  By morning, I felt as if nothing had been applied to my feet and the cracks and soreness was as bad as usual.There have been foot files, creams, lotions and even corn razors, but the issues with my feet have worsened every year, until at age 60 I have wondered if this might even be life threatening - and those of you with diabetes know what I mean - the threat of sores on the extremities that won't heal gives us the dread of infections, gangrene, and amputation.  This shadow hangs over people with diabetes and so what is merely dry feet to some people becomes a fearful threat to the diabetic.Expensive pedicures can help a little bit, but when my feet are exposed  to too much exfoliation, the outer layer of protective skin is gone and the delicate underlayer of skin is left exposed.  This is relieving and pretty in the short term, but in the long run, this delicate skin dries out even faster, and the ultimate result is that the dryness goes deeper and deeper into the feet.At first it was only my heels that were effected, but eventually the dryness crept up to the sides of my feet and in the past few years I have been battling cracks and bleeding in my toes.I asked my primary care physician what I could do about this, and I don't think that she understood at all how serious the issue was.  She suggested lotion, which was like putting out a forest fire with a water pistol.I went to a podiatrist who spent 5 minutes looking at my feet, wrote a prescription for an ineffective product, told me to get more pedicures and went on the the next patient.  It was a waste of $150.00.Gel socks have been great but most of them have design flaws that make me wish more thought had been put into what dry, cracked feet really need.  My first pair of gel socks were purchased on Amazon:http://amazon.com/gp/product/B001K1IYRO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpageThe above socks are great quality, but the gel is too thick and the material is too thick.  During the night, the gel would close around my feet like shrink wrap and I would wake up in a strangling vise that gave my feet terrible cramps.  I found myself ripping them  off to relieve the pain.  Too, TOO much!Another try was the gel heel socks:http://amazon.com/Oppo-Gel-Heel-Socks-6790/dp/B0028PY27C/ref=sr_1_7?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1437536448&sr=1-7&keywords=gel+heel+socksThe gel heel socks fine for heels, but there is no protection for the toes, and the socks themselves are unstable enough that they move around in the night and I often wake up with the gel on top of my feet and my poor cracked heels are left unprotected, dry and painful.Then there are the gel toe socks:http://amazon.com/FootSmart-Gel-Lined-Compression-Separating-Socks/dp/B005CW2Y28/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1437536648&sr=8-1&keywords=gel+toe+socksThese are fine for mid-toes, but the heels are left out and the tips of the toes stay exposed.In my mind's eye, I always envisioned a soft bootie, with 5 toes - ENTIRELY COATED ON THE INSIDE WITH GEL.  But I couldn't find it until now.I must admit that the price of these booties made me pause momentarily, but I was desperate for a real solution to a very serious problem.  So I sprung for 3 pairs.  The first night, I was able to sleep all night in these soft, stretchy socks that have a complete coating of gel in every single toe as well as the whole foot.  The gel in these socks still has a tendency to ""shrink wrap"" my feet in the night, but because the gel coating is light, the socks are soft and stretchy and the separated toes keep the feet in an anatomically sound position, I don't wake up in excruciating pain.  My feet feel a little bit hot at night, but the relief from dry, cracked, bleeding feet is worth this minor discomfort.  The separated toes also anchor the booties in the correct position, so there is no shifting or falling off in the night.Each night, I put a heavy moisturizer in my feet - usually a Shea butter based cream.  Then I put on the gel socks and sleep in them all night.  From the very first morning, I have wakened with soft, smooth, moisturized feet, and each subsequent day the cracks, flakes and dryness had improved dramatically.  In less than a week, I have managed to reverse a terrible problem and have even been able to wear some pretty sandals during the day.  In conjunction with some mild exfoliation, I have found these gel booties to be a real lifesaver - and I do mean that literally.  The protective outer layer of skin stays intact, soft and supple and my feet have stopped cracking and bleeding.  What a relief!The  Natra Cure 5-Toe Moisturizing Gel Socks have addressed every single problem and given me a cure for an issue that threatened my health in ways that people without diabetes probably don't understand.  I really love these and they were worth every single cent I spent on them.  And I intend to add several more pairs to my collection so that I always have a clean pair to wear to bed.Very highly recommended for anyone who suffers from dry feet, but especially for those who have a serious health threatening condition of cracked, bleeding feet!  So Great!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VVBIA0TM719Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O81S77A#wasThisHelpful","R2VVBIA0TM719Z","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This paper shredder is fast, quiet and easily moves from place to place on smooth rolling wheels.  I really like that it will take on 12 sheets at a time, and will also dispatch CDs, credit cards and staples.It is quite large - about 50% larger than my current, medium-duty shredder that will shred only 10 sheets at a time.  For an ordinary household, the Sentinel is probably overkill, and if your shredding needs are small to moderate, then it will probably be a good idea to pay attention to the dimensions (stated in the ad) and consider whether the extra work it will do is worth the extra space it will take up.  But if you are in a small business where a lot of paperwork is generated and shredding needs are high, the Sentinal could easily pull it's weight and earn whatever space it takes up.I was disappointed in the paper feed, which I found slightly awkward at first, but I got the hang of it quickly.  However a bigger concern for me was that the paper feed is a little bit narrower than what I am used to and will only accept standard paper that Is 9.5"" wide.  So if you have occasions when you need to shred something that isn't exactly standard size, you will be out of luck.  It just so happened that the very first thing I tried to shred was somewhat wider than standard and I had a very hard time getting it to go through.  But since the vast majority of papers that people need to shred are standard 9.5 x 11 or 14 pages this might not be a problem most of the time.  However, I was surprised at this design flaw because my old shredder, which isn't nearly as fancy is very flexible in the feed chute and takes pages of many sizes.  I didn't think it was necessary to design this kind of restriction into the Sentinel, and I actually like my old one a little bit better for this reason.The final product is a fine shred, something like confetti, and from a privacy and security standpoint this will definitely do the trick.  The finely cut shreds would be impossible to read and the Sentinal outperforms my old shredder in this feature.So, if you need a shredder for ordinary household tasks, I think you might be happier with something smaller, less expensive and not quite so fancy.  But if you have a small business that generates a lot of standard sized paper to dispose of, the Sentinel might be perfect for your situation.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS3M7EC9WE1KR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UT125ZI#wasThisHelpful","RS3M7EC9WE1KR","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little tool set is nothing special, but it is very practical, space efficient and useful for small around-the-house jobs.  They appear to be well made, but the ultimate determination of that is how well they perform in the long run.  I have written many favorable reviews for small tools of this type, only to have them fall apart within a year.  So for now, I am going to say that they are great.  In a year, I'll come back and update.I like that they are compact and that the necessary tools fold out for use and fold in for storage.  The little plier multi-tool reminds me of a Swiss Army Knife, and it actually does have a couple of different kinds of knives included in the multitude of tools folded into the handles.  The larger folding knife is just that - a folding knife and nothing else.In addition the the small, needle nosed pliers shown in the ad photo, you will also find (folded into the handles) a small pocket knife, a very VERY small flathead screwdriver and a very, VERY small phillips head screwdriver, and bottle opener.  The other handle holds a little saw (or small serrated knife - whichever you prefer to call it), a nail file, a very tiny folding knife, and a slightly larger flathead screwdriver.It would be great for a small household toolbox that you might want to keep lean and orderly, but I think most people already have these functions covered at home.  An even better place for something like this would be the glovebox of your car, because at home you probably have other tools of this type that are more suited to your tool-box.  This is best as an on-the-go emergency tool kit.  They will do a multitude of small jobs in a pinch but don't count on these if you have major work to do.The fold in components are easy to open and close and so this is a convenient device to have and use.  The biggest negative is that it comes in one of those clamshells that put you in danger of experiencing ""wrap rage"" when trying to open it for the first time.  Because of this, and because it is slightly overpriced compared to similar tools I have seen at Ace Hardware, I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars.  To be updated at a later date depending on how it performs in the long term.....","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TSIA790K0W71/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WI0MX0U#wasThisHelpful","R1TSIA790K0W71","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think that for a review to be truly helpful, it pays to know something about the person who is evaluating a product.  So (for what it's worth) here is my experience level with tea:  Novice.For years, I was a coffee drinker and didn't like tea, but after developing health issues related to coffee, I made the switch to a morning cup of tea instead of my morning cup of joe.  I am a night owl and so living on a ""normal"" schedule is a challenge for me.  I drink tea for it's medicinal qualities and for the caffeine boost and if it also tastes good, that is a plus.  My regular morning dose is Guayaki Greener Tea, which is a blend of Yerba Mate and Green Tea.  Unlike other people, I like my teas strong and bitter, so I use a lot and steep it long enough to develop a noticeable bitter flavor - usually 20-30 minutes.  This preference is probably because I switched from coffee and am used to something strong and hearty.  If  I drink black tea, it is usually Newman's Own Organics Royal Black Tea.  If I am traveling or in a ""pinch"", Lipton's will do - just for the caffeine, but I don't like Lipton Tea (because it is not organic, bland and flavorless) and so I avoid it if I can.Having said that, before reviewing this tea, I made an effort to educate myself about what a ""quality"" tea is supposed to be like and carefully brewed this tea according to instructions.  Here is what I found:When I first opened the package, I noticed the lovely smell - almost like flowers or fruit.  The color of the dried leaves is a deep greenish-brown; almost black.  For those of you who think it is important that dried tea leaves be a uniform size and shape, you will be disappointed to know that this Breakfast Tea has very uneven sizes - many broken leaves that are so tiny that they are almost powdery, and many full sized curled leaves, and everything in between.While heating my water, I put 2 teaspoons of tea in a small, 12 oz teapot.  As per package directions, I steeped my first cup for 3.5 minutes and then strained the liquid into a mug.  I tried my first few drinks plain with no sweeteners or milk or cream and found the taste to be pleasant - no bitterness at all - but with a strong enough flavor to be satisfying, even to someone like myself who is used to over-brewed bitter tea.  It compared well to Newman's Own and was much better than Lipton's.  The color was a beautiful dark amber with a touch of red, making it seem exotic and luxurious to drink.  After my first few sips, I then added stevia - which is my personal favorite sweetener and the result was really QUITE good!  I thoroughly enjoyed this with my breakfast.The caffeine buzz was more than my usual yerba/green gives me.  It woke me up quickly and thoroughly without making me jittery.  I usually take my morning shower after breakfast and then have a second cup of tea, making me quite alert and ready for my day before 8 AM.  So after my shower, I decided to experiment with this tea and see what it would take to get this tea to go bitter.  For my second cup, I steeped it for a full 7.5 minutes and then took it onto the front porch for a relaxing time in the morning sun.  This cup was stronger, but still not bitter.  I really enjoyed the smooth, robust flavor, but found that the second cup delivered more of a caffeine punch than I am used to.  It made me a little bit jittery and I didn't like the sensation.So (for what it's worth from a novice), I thought this tea was better than Lipton.  Way, WAY better than Lipton.  It was comparable in taste, color and smell to Newman's Own, but I think it is even better than that.  And since I drink tea for the health benefits,  I love that it is organic. The caffeine high was noticeable.  I received this as a 2 oz free sample which means that the price wasn't a factor for me, but for those of you who are paying, be aware that this is $10.41 for only 4 oz of tea while Newman's Own Organic Royal is $9.80 on Amazon Prime for 7.05 oz.  And if you order on VitaCost, Newman's Own is only $3.99.  Capital Teas is better than Newman's Own, but not THAT much better.  I am deducting one star because I think it is too expensive and I kind of doubt that this is TOP quality tea because of the uneven size and shape of the leaves.  But it is still very good.Will it do the trick for a REAL tea connoisseur?  I don't know.  But as someone who has had to make a (regretful) switch from coffee, I found it to be very pleasant and the rich flavor, while not like coffee, held it's own and opened my eyes to the value of the flavor of a good cup of tea.  In fact, this has opened a whole new world to me and now I am interested in exploring what high quality tea has to offer.Also, a friend just gave me a Kombucha scoby and I plan to make a small batch of Kombucha from this tea and see what that is like.  From the taste, I think it will be awesome!  In about 2 weeks, I'll come back and let you know how the KT comes out.4 stars from a novice!  ;-)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQXQMHGBHHVVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PK34DJG#wasThisHelpful","RQXQMHGBHHVVO","A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SVJWQVC7ZDMT?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have had my MiniDrone for sometime now and in the beginning had a few issues.  But with each update it has performed so much better.  The new batteries that are coming with it are much improved and I am enjoying it a lot.  Each of my drones has a purpose and my mini drone is used a good part of time inside.  I love how it will hover and wait on the next command.  I had it outside yesterday and had it still under control about 50ft away.  Much further and it is hard to see the direction it is flying.  But indoors it is great as you can adjust how far up it will travel which is great if you want to avoid hitting the ceiling.  For me it is great, and my grandchildren enjoy this also because it is easy to control without worrying about loosing control.  And did I mention, you can click an icon and make it do all types of flips!  I am an owner of many AR Drones, the MiniDrone and the new Bebop.  People think I am a bit crazy when they see all my multi-rotors,  but then again it does keep me out of trouble.  lol  sometimes :-)Grandpa Jake","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCRX3K0KLDN6G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KZM53NC#wasThisHelpful","RCRX3K0KLDN6G","A40UTSS993WSK","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A40UTSS993WSK?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
