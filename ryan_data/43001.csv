"Be advised that a particular seller (that claims to be the actual distributor for Baofeng) claims that their lower capacity 3600mAH generic battery will work with the UV-5RA radio - it DOES NOT.  It will work with the original UV-5R (of which I happen to own), but when I ordered more radios from this ""distributor/seller"" they switched my order from the original UV-5R to the UV-5RA unit (without any prior contact or approval) and then proceeded to ship generic lower capacity batteries (with that same order) that won't work with the new units that they (not me) chose to ship as (in his words) an ""upgraded unit"".

"Most folks that have a problem with these units simply don't understand how they are designed to work.They ARE NOT designed to work all over the FM dial on your radio, they are designed to work on only two frequencies on your FM radio - period.  Mine worked on either 88.9 MHZ or 106.7 MHZ.They WILL NOT work on AM or HD radio either, only FM.  The simple way to correctly (and easily) get them to work in your area is to sit in your car, truck, or van, turn on your FM radio and manually dial your radio to either of the two frequencies your Car Baby II unit supports (it usually 88.9 MHZ or 106.7 MHZ), but I have seen some that are different.This is the important part for all you non-technical folks, so pay attention.After you manually dial up both of the two frequencies that your particular Car Baby II unit supports, pick the one (of the two frequencies) that your FM radio has the least amount of interference with and program that frequency into one of your memory channel inputs in your car radio (my Jeep has 12 different memories, so it was easy to pick memory 12 as my ""go to Car Baby"" channel in the radio.Install the required AAA battery and turn on the unit.  Your FM radio should now magically have no interference as the signal from the Car Baby II unit will over-ride any local interference on that channel (assuming you've correctly followed directions so far).Now when I'm driving down the road listening to the radio and my phone rings I simply switch to memory 12 on the radio (by pushing one memory button) and like magic the Car Baby broadcasts the audio from my phone through my radio speakers.If you follow the instructions on the package (and read this review), you'll have no problem with this product, assuming of course you do follow the directions and use common sense (don't leave your phone in your purse in the back on the van or in the trunk and expect Car Baby to work for example).Don't laugh, I've had folks do both and then complain when the product didn't work how they ""assumed"" it would.  One previous buyer of the product thought that her car radio should constantly be scanning between AM, FM and her HD channels, find the Car Baby frequency automatically, and then switch her radio to the proper frequency when she had a phone call come in.  Sorry folks, but the current car radios don't have that magic technology (maybe someday), until then these sub-$20 devices work quite well if you learn how they are designed to work and then use them in that fashion.If all else fails, get a teenager in your neighborhood to install it for you and then show you how to correctly use the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UKLG38LWTHFI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0012KTOT0#wasThisHelpful","R1UKLG38LWTHFI","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Optimus has a winner with this extremely quiet unit.  Unlike many other brands that skip the more extensive cETLus approval rating (meaning the unit meets both Canadian and U.S. safety standards), Optimus has this approval rating, plus a three year factory warranty.The picture shown really doesn't do this unit justice.  The actual unit comes in a beautiful Cherry wood cabinet (suitable for any den, bedroom, or living room), plus the remote control allows you to completely control the unit's functions (not just ""on or off"" like some others).  Even the really large blue LCD display performs a dual function, since it not only is easy to see from a distance, it also acts as a night light (no more stepping on items left on the floor or the family pet) while getting into bed.The heater is instant on, which is probably helped by the actual copper coils used by Optimus (unlike some other units that merely coat their aluminum coils in copper).  My wife loves being able to stay under the covers on chilly mornings and turn on the unit from the comfort of our bed, wait just a minute, and get up into a much warmer room (this unit can kick out 1500 watts of heat in a hurry).I love the fact that it's cheap to run (around $1.00 a day) and I can easily roll it (when needed) into another area in our house.  You can even set the thermostat to have the unit kick on (or off) when room temperature reaches a certain pre-set temperature.One warning however.  This is not some cheap light-weight plastic unit that we've all seen before in various hardware stores.  Shipping weight is around 45 lbs. and the unit probably weighs around 40 lbs. sitting in your room, so if you're planning on getting one for your grand-mother you probably had better unbox it for her (or make arrangements for someone else to help her).  Of course once it's removed from the box, anyone can easily move it from room to room using the 4 built-in caster wheels in the base of the cabinet.Anyone that has a vacation home, an RV, or lives in an apartment without much insulation will love this unit.  I like it because my wife and I both get what we (she ??) wants.  She wants more heat, and I don't want to keep feeding money to the local utility company when she gets cold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMJD6GGJILPL8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005TH6HPG#wasThisHelpful","RMJD6GGJILPL8","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many folks are quick to blame the Avery software or Avery templates for their printer problems, but most of the time it's not the software to blame but rather the old age of their laser printer's rubber rollers.  The older rubber roller's (that grab the paper or label sheet to feed the printer) have a much harder time getting proper contact with the clear sheet labels, which is why your laser printer can work perfectly with regular paper or white labels but go crazy when trying to print clear label sheets.The easiest fix to to check your printer's rubber feeder and if it's dirty or worn get it replaced.  9 times of of 10 that will fix your issues when printing on clear labels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R70Q3HZEF1LYM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NEGTCO#wasThisHelpful","R70Q3HZEF1LYM","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Far too often reviewers (that have very little expertise with a particular product or field) rant on about what they perceive is a failure of the product, when in reality it's not a failure of the product, it's a failure of the individual in not reading the manual, not following proper directions, or simply not checking for compatibility when purchasing the product.We see this all the time in the technical field, so often that we generally tell the customer (that's ranting on about how a product doesn't work when we know it does) that their hardware or software issue is called an ID-IO-T (pronounced I-D, I-O, T) error.  It makes them feel good, and they don't even realize that to the tech working on their issue ID IO T really means (idiot).That's not to say that some hardware or software doesn't work, but even then it's usually caused by somebody assuming that a 5 year old Windows XP version of software ""should"" work on his/her Windows 7 Pro 64 bit workstation.  Unless it states Windows 7 Pro compatible on the box, don't assume it works and most of your tech support issues will magically disappear.The same is true with hardware configurations as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 7, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB1Z168E0JRSZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BO9RT0#wasThisHelpful","RB1Z168E0JRSZ","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let's clear up an issue with some folks writing negative reviews about this product (as it relates to the wet/dry claim).  The shaver works fine (in or out of the shower) so long as you are using it on DC power (batteries), which is why it's called a cordless shaver.  Only an idiot would stand in the shower and try to shave with ANY shaver plugged into 110V AC power, that includes this unit (which is why Emerson states their warnings about using it plugged in).  Honestly how some reviewers on Amazon downgrade their reviews on a product because the manufacturer is forced to remind idiots about safety is beyond me.Second, regarding the unit itself, as most folks (with an IQ of 100 or more) will tell you, this unit works as advertised.  For the money, it's hard to beat.  Will it outdo a unit from Braun or Norelco costing a hundred bucks more?  No, but do you really expect it to?  For the price, it's really hard to beat.  It's certainly a great backup unit (for work or travel), as I'd be mad as #$*^ if I left my expensive unit sitting in a hotel room, but if this one got accidentally left behind it wouldn't cause me to panic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4P8H57FE3TFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003QPSK1M#wasThisHelpful","R4P8H57FE3TFE","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A small percentage of Amazon sellers continue to list non-Xerox Solid Ink Sticks under the actual Xerox OEM listings (instead of listing them under a compatible category).Perhaps they really think that it's Amazon's job to move their listings to the correct category (I've actually had one seller from TX tell me it's Amazon's fault that their cheap clone ink is listed under the Xerox part number and picture).More likely is that these questionable seller's think it's an easy way to trick buyer's into purchasing their clone ink and not wanting the hassle of sending it back when we discover the bait and switch upon opening the box.Several sellers also believe that simply listing the word ""compatible"" within their short description field is enough to avoid the problem, it isn't.  When a seller (by accident or on purpose), lists an item under the manufacturer's part number, uses the actual manufacturer's picture of the product, and the Amazon main page also lists within the main description field words like ""actual, OEM, Xerox, genuine"" etc.,etc., we buyers should be able to feel confident about what will arrive in the box within a few days.The latest trick a few sellers attempt is to simply claim they are now out of stock on the actual Xerox item (and they cancel the order through Amazon), but they would be happy to ship you ""replacement"" product that's ""as good as"" actual Xerox.What they don't seem to understand is that while they can cancel they order, if you wait around 10 days after the order is cancelled you can then leave feedback on your order (even when they cancelled the order).I encourage all buyers to take the time to leave feedback on seller cancelled orders (after waiting until Amazon finally allows feedback on those cancelled orders), since negative ratings are apparently the only way to get these questionable sellers to stop with their bait and switch sales tactics.I would also encourage Amazon to allow immediate buyer feedback when a seller cancels an order for any reason, instead of making us wait up to 2 weeks before the feedback option finally appears.  That's far too long (in my opinion) and simply allows most of the questionable sellers to continue to get away with bad business practices for an additional two weeks.","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QR28FCOIYX3V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DPSTIG#wasThisHelpful","R2QR28FCOIYX3V","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We are a small business that tends to do most of our marketing in-house in order to a) save money, and b) have greater control of our marketing.I've tried all different types of color printers (ink-jet's from Canon, HP, and Lexmark, colored power toner based printers from Brother, Canon, HP, Okidata, and Xerox, even a gell-based color printer from Ricoh).  They all have their individual pro's and con's, but most small business owners simply don't have the budget to have various pricey color printers on-hand to pick the one model perfect for each job, in other words, we have to understand that while it would be nice to have four or five different color printers available it simply isn't realistic for most of us.So what to pick?In our case, we wanted a color printer that could at least do legal size pages for some brochures, the Xerox 8560/DN model does that nicely.We also wanted a printer that didn't bend the pages much (if at all), again the Xerox 8560/DN model does that nicely.We also wanted the ability to automatically duplex print and be attached to our network (which helps share the cost among several users).  Again, the Xerox 8560/DN printer has those features built-in.We wanted a printer that has a great reputation for quality, which the Xerox 8560/DN has.  Now I know some folks that fill up their sport's car with cheap gas and oil and wonder why it doesn't perform to factory specs.  I'm guessing those same folks throw cheap clone wax cartridges into their Xerox printer and then whine constantly about color issues, color matching, print jams, etc.All I can tell you is that we've continue to use our Xerox Phaser 8550N, 8560/DN, and 8560MFP units virtually every day printing invoices, packing slips, quotes, marketing materials, etc., etc. Perhaps because we don't fill them with cheap clone ink products allows us to have virtually zero maintenance issues year after year, I don't know.What I do know is that the 8550/8560 color output looks fantastic for normal office work and smokes (speed wise) normal print output from powder toner products we'd tried (so far) and yes, that even includes Xerox powder toner based products.So if you are a graphic artist looking to print 11""x17"" output for sale at a gallery, skip the Xerox Phaser 8560 line of printers.  Or if you are so tight with money that you'll shave crayons down in an attempt to refill your ink needs, skip the Phaser 8560 printer line, or if the noise from a business quality printer (that's built to last) is too much for you in your home library, then skip the Xerox Phaser 8560 printer line.The rest of us, however, appreciate how well these things are built, how fast they print, and how inexpensive they are to run year after year.  For the record, I don't work for Xerox and never have.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHEYI1VSGR15I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000N1ONGI#wasThisHelpful","RHEYI1VSGR15I","A3HEU0C1S0CFI3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HEU0C1S0CFI3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is my smaller (65lb) dog's favorite slow-feeder bowl.  The Dane prefers the round flower design, and neither dog really likes the spiral.In order to make this more dishwasher-friendly, we used a drill press to make drainage holes in the points where water collects when it's upside-down.  The holes are small enough to allow the water to drain, but not large enough to bother the dogs when they eat.  We've done this with all the slow-feeder bowls and it makes washing them much easier--and I know they're clean if I run them through the dishwasher with every use.

"Very nice assortment of patterns.  Doubly cool since they're reversible--even if you don't like one side, you might like the other.  The workmanship is pretty good.  A little thready here and there and a couple seams weren't quite finished, but considering the price, I'm not fazed by minor inconsistencies.Since one-size items can be tricky where fit is concerned, here's how they fit on two body types/heights:  I'm 5ft6, down to 155lbs, and wear average length jeans in anywhere from 8 to 12 depending on the manufacturer and style.  Hourglass figure--best fit is Curvy Skinny jeans by NY&Co.  Definite waist, but ""baby got back,"" as well.  These are a great length if I tie them a bit below my natural waist.  If I tie them at my waist, they seem a little short as they just skim my ankles.  If I had less ""junk in the trunk"" the length might not be an issue if I tied them at my natural waist.  As far as coverage is concerned, I am happy to wear them around the house because they are *super-* comfy, but they're a little revealing if a stiff breeze opens the slit up the side of the leg.  To feel comfortable wearing these outside the house, I'd have to add leggings or bike shorts, and that kind of defeats the purpose of the comfy fit.  So:  I love love love these for lounging around the house or porch, but I won't wear them out anywhere.  Still a great deal on a very comfy product.The other tester is 5ft2 and just shy of 120lbs.  No booty or thighs, but a bit of a tummy.  These pants were just dragging the floor when tied at the natural waist.  Rolling the waist up a bit helped, but created a bulky waistline.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XTD5RU6HISP7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P3ASWQQ#wasThisHelpful","R1XTD5RU6HISP7","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Shipped Priority Mail in black velveteen gift box.  The posts are a *lot* longer than my other screw back earrings.  Probably won't be able to sleep in these as they are--will likely need to have the posts shortened and swap out the backs for the screw-on cap-style.  (They're less pokey.

"Shipped Priority Mail in black velveteen gift box.  The posts are a *lot* longer than my other screw back earrings.

"I bought two of these bowls in the Henna pattern and couldn't be happier with them.  The size is perfect for anything from soup to noodles to tuna salad.  The chopsticks that came with them are twist-style (not the plain, traditional chopsticks that are currently pictured), and they're also very nice, but black lacquer chopsticks look good with the Henna print since it has a black rim.  One nice detail is the raised white dots that accent the designs; it gives depth to the pattern while adding texture to the bowls.  Oh, and they do just fine in the dishwasher.Great purchase--already looking forward to using these at breakfast (scrambled eggs work fine with chopsticks!) while sitting out on the porch now that the weather is warming up.Update:  I've had these for nearly 6 months now and they've held up really well.  I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher and they come out fine.  We've had everything from buldak noodles to scrambled eggs in these bowls, and the finish was not discolored by the sauce on the buldak.  (That stuff is evil.  Delicious evil.)  There is no crazing of the glaze, and no stress cracks.  We remain pleased with these and look forward to using them through the winter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EFM2K0WVC1W7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NC5PV40#wasThisHelpful","R2EFM2K0WVC1W7","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The good:  Unless you're right on top of this stuff, it looks super real.  Everyone who's seen it has been impressed with the image quality and the dramatic transformation (given that the walls were white, before).  The vinyl is textured, which makes the woodgrain effect even more realistic.  (I included a photo so you can see how it looks on a white wall, in both light and shadow.)This stuff is really pretty easy to work with, too--just don't peel off all the backing paper at once.  Only peel off a few inches at the top of the piece you're hanging.  Once you get the top aligned, you can peel away more of the backing and work your way down.  It is very forgiving, and I managed to cover my curved metal switch plate and outlet covers without even having to overlap it anywhere on the front of the plates.  It was easy to match up the pattern around the plates to make them blend in better.The roll arrived safely packed in bubble wrap, and the seller very thoughtfully included some useful little plastic smoothing tools for pushing out bubbles and getting the paper into corners.The less-good:  While this stuff is definitely durable, it is *somewhat* transparent.  I put it up on a painted, white wall, but there was a spot where the drywall paper and paint had peeled off which was much darker than the rest, and I ended up removing this wall-covering, painting over the dark spot and re-hanging the paper because the dark spot showed through so much.  I'd say that if your walls are not one solid color, you'll probably have the same issue.  While the print is ""busy"", dramatically darker or lighter areas (like, say, a big, dark waterstain or a white area of drywall patch) will show through to some degree.Overall:  I really love the look of this paper.  I was able to put it up by myself with nothing but the included smoothing tools, scissors, and an Xacto knife.  (And a screwdriver for the outlet/switch plate covers.)  Despite some uninspiring reviews of the seller's brick pattern paper (primarily involving the print not lining up over extended run), I had a positive enough experience with the pattern I chose that I decided to order some of the brick print and a couple others to brighten up the kitchen backsplash and do a couple accent walls in the diningroom.  I'm very pleased with how the room turned out, and I'm optimistic about trying the other patterns.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IXEDAADPFFM7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TF2TOX8#wasThisHelpful","R2IXEDAADPFFM7","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"While these are very pretty, at least two of the four cups in the set have a hairline crack that allows tea to seep slowly down the side of the cup to pool around the base.  The cups appeared to be in perfect condition when I unpacked them, but the cracks are visible once tea gets in them, as it stains the inner porcelain brown and makes the crack(s) easily visible.  Since I have used these cups I can't very well return them, so I ordered a second set and am hoping for the best.  If the next set is also unusable, I'll take this down to 1 star and there won't be a third try.Update:  Received the second set of teacups yesterday and they are all in perfect condition.  Ran them through the dishwasher (top rack) and tried them again, and they are still water-tight and unblemished.In order to make something good out of the two cups with hairline cracks, I decided to repurpose them by lining them with blue sticky-back felt and using them to hold my glasses on my desk and on the bedside table.  They're very pretty, and the felt keeps my glasses from getting scratched.  Not ideal, but perfectly useful--and I won't be terribly upset if they break since they're already on borrowed time.Overall, a decent purchase if you're okay with the risk.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Y4QBQXJ03A1V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003FG0ZY2#wasThisHelpful","R1Y4QBQXJ03A1V","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are great go-withs for blue-and white dishes.  I have a sushi set with a similar pattern and these look very nice with it.  They also look good with the various Japanese blue-and-white patterned bowl and teacup sets that are around here on Amazon, and/or populating import stores.  Don't let the size put you off--you really can do a lot with these dishes.  They can hold sauce (of course), but they can also function as a salt dish, hold wasabi or pickled ginger, or even a few pats of butter.  They make a nice little teabag caddy, too, if you have similarly decorated teacups.  I'm sure I'll find even more uses for them over time.(Since people have asked about it: they seem to do just fine in the dishwasher--top rack only, in the small-items caddy.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I894D32XAT1M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004VTQTTW#wasThisHelpful","R2I894D32XAT1M","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So glad I tried this!  This flavor is not included in the Flavor Lovers assortment so I was curious about it, but not sure if I wanted to risk buying a whole box.  It kept taunting me (because the Bananas Foster is soooo good!), so I just went for it.  It's really lovely.  Not as intensely apple-y in the way that the Bananas Foster is banana-y, but that's probably the ""a la mode"" coming through.  Definitely a keeper.  (Still wish the Crazy Cups folks would get on the Decaff bandwagon.

"Phone-wise:  This is a pretty decent little wristlet for the price.  It easily holds an iPhone 6 in the Apple-endorsed Tech21 Evo Mesh impact-proof case.  (I can't say whether it holds the 6 Plus or not--I bought it so I would have room for the 6 in its impact-proof case.)Pros/cons:  The snap is tight (requires a bit of aligning sometimes, but it does stay closed), the materials are not shabby (it's not leather, but it's not plastic-y like some other low-end wristlets), and the chain is not plastic, either.  The zipper isn't the greatest, but it's easy to use and doesn't open by itself.  The cards-and-cash pocket area that zips is WAY roomier than I thought it would be.  I had a ton of cards, a slim credit-card sized emergency phone charger, a super-short charging cable for the iPhone, and a small pen in there.  So yeah--it won't fit the contents of a purse, but it holds more than my Vera Bradley All-in-one wristlet.Bottom line:  I would totally buy another of these in a different color or print, but the black/pink is the only one I liked.

"I admit I was really surprised that my iPhone 6 fit in this wristlet--let alone the 6 in its Tech21 impact-proof case.  This wristlet/wallet is very slim-and-trim.  I can fit my ID, insurance card, four credit/debit cards, 3 punch-cards (business card sized coupons that are stamped or punched out every time you go to a shop, and redeem when all the slots are filled) and a bit of cash.  Any more than two credit cards to a slot, or too much cash/receipts and I can't always get the flap to snap shut.It's a shame that it arrived damaged.  The only good part is that the scrape is under the flap, so it's hidden most of the time.  I just keep reminding myself that you get what you pay for.Bottom line:  cute, cheap, holds my iPhone 6 in the impact-mesh case without struggling to get it in and out of the phone pocket, and holds enough of my essentials that I can grab it and go, or change to a different wristlet pretty quickly.

"These are seriously cute shoes--just right for Spring and Summer.  That said, I have to acknowledge that they're pretty pricey for what comes in the carton.  (They come in a milk-carton style shoebox, which is also very cute.)  Without being judgey, it seems like what you're paying for when you buy these is the cute, chic fabric designs.  And really, that's it.  Because these shoes have no leather uppers, super-cushiony linings, or molded, impact-reducing heel cups;  no waterproof this, suede that, or ergonomic the other thing.  They're flat Mary Janes with a roomy, squarish toe box, a silvertone buckle, and silky fabric uppers stitched to a thin rubber sole.  And, of course, they're completely adorable.When I got my first pair, it took me a couple days before I realized that they're freakishly similar to the embroidered silk Mary Jane flats I used to buy at a Chinese import store near my workplace when I was in college.  They were just like these except that the toebox was round.  They came in silk or cotton, and they cost about $10.  The silk was really gorgeous for the price--perfect for a poor college student--and the embroidery made them look like a million bucks.  But sadly, like all cheap things, they never lasted very long.  If it rained, the silk showed every drop, and the color bled if your feet got sweaty.  And now, whenever I look at my feet, I am reminded that my super-cute Hot Chocolate shoes are so very, very like those cheap, Chinese import store shoes in almost every respect but price.Pros/Cons:  The soles are very thin, but flexible.  The footbeds have -0- arch support, but since they are roomy and the strap is adjustable, I wear arch support insoles with them and that makes a huge difference in comfort.  If you use orthotics with a highly cushioned heel cup that raises your heel up too much, you might have issues with the way these shoes rub your Achilles tendon.  The prints and patterns are, of course, super cute, to which there is no down side.  The toe box is very roomy, the stitching seems tight, and they seem to hold up well in a purely mechanical sense.  Aesthetically, however, you need to baby these shoes a bit to keep them looking good--especially the paler designs.  (They really seem to show dirt/scuffs, and the silky fabric doesn't wipe clean as easily as leather or fake leathers do.)So, with all that considered, why did I give them 5 stars?  Because they're just that freakin' cute.  Bottom line, I guess, is that if you go in knowing what you're getting for your money, you'll probably give these shoes 5 stars, too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JGTHFCFYSTBS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I3IYO9E#wasThisHelpful","R1JGTHFCFYSTBS","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Hikari soups are great!  Convenient and tasty.  If you've wondered whether the Miyasaka soups are just as good (or better), here's a brief comparison.Hikari and Miyasaka soups consist of the same ingredient set:  one packet of miso paste and one of dehydrated/freeze-dried veg/seaweed/etc.  (The Kikkoman soups are simply one small packet of powdered miso that includes what seems to be a lesser quantity of additional ingredients.) Both Miyasaka and Hikari have 8 servings per bag, but the rest of the numbers is where they start to differ.  If you care about this stuff, here's how the Hikari wakame soup measures up to Miyasaka's wakame:Hikari: 17.4g miso paste and 2.1g garnishMiyasaka: 20g soup base (miso) and 2g garnishBoth recommend around 2/3 cup of water.  Hikari--5-6oz, Miyasaka 2/3 cup.Calories/fat calories:  Hikari--35/10.  Miyasaka--30/5.Both brands show 1g of fat:  both brands show saturated and trans fats at -0-.Cholesterol:  both -0-.Sodium:  Hikari--770, Miyasaka--840.Total Carbs:  Hikari--6g (>1g fiber, 2g sugar).  Miyasaka--4g (>1g fiber, 4g sugar).Protein: Hikari--2g, Miyasaka--3g.The vague takeaway there seems to be that Hikari goes heavier on the fat and lower on the sodium while Miyasaka does the opposite.  Which probably explains why I have a slight preference for the Hikari over the Miyasaka--particularly the green onion.  (While I use the Kikkoman soups, too, it's generally only for convenience as a take-along.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q29Y0BCWNPIJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RB4K74#wasThisHelpful","R3Q29Y0BCWNPIJ","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The DH has some serious allergies; you name it, he reacts to it.  Animal dander, every pollen you can think of, mold spores and mildew--the lot.  He's not a great sleeper to start with, and (this is totally my fault) to make things worse, I have always let my dog sleep on the bed.  And the cats.  And since they were here first, I needed to make everybody as comfortable as possible.  This involves a LOT of regular laundering of bedding and throws, as well as having an air filter/cleaner/purifier of some kind in every room of the house (including an ozone-producing unit specifically for the Cat Genie litter boxes).I put this unit in the corner farthest from his side of the bed and generally run it on the highest setting when we're not in the room.  At night, I turn it down to about the third-lowest setting to make it quiet enough for us to sleep.  And let me say this:  when you first fire this thing up, is sounds like a jet engine preparing for takeoff.  It is *super* loud on the highest setting, and it moves a LOT of air.  When you stand next to it while it's going full-blast, you know how a pigeon might feel if it gets too close to a Boeing 737.  When you turn it down to the lowest setting, it's proportionately very, very quiet and (of course) doesn't move very much air.Within the first couple days of use, the DH was sleeping better and wasn't going through a half a box of tissues and Benadryl while reading before bed.  (And that's with random cats and the dog on the bed, too.)The proof is in the sneezing, really, and in this case, it's a significant improvement.  An added bonus over the last unit I had:  I guess this one moves a LOT more air, because I find that the temperature in the room is more even as opposed to warmer near the radiator and chilly on the opposite side.  This unit is moving the air so thoroughly that it's actually evening out the warm/cold spots.  Sweeeeeet.Pros:  Effectively relieves allergy symptoms for better sleep (presumably related to animal dander and pollen/mildew), you can clean the pre-filter, it moves a *lot* of air on high, very quiet on lower settings, the light is not bright enough to bother us while we're sleeping, long cord, unobtrusive design.Cons:  The base feels incredibly cheap given what it's supporting.  I find the unit to be a bit unstable, and it wobbles a bit when we walk by (historic house, old floors have a lot of give) which is alarming.  I'm always worrying that one of the cats will knock it over and it will come partially unplugged, so I have left generous slack in the (thankfully long) cord.  When it's on the highest settings, it is *incredibly* loud.  Not that you have to be in the room with it the whole time, but just be prepared--if you have one of these, you know that the jet engine comparison isn't really a joke.At the time I was first considering buying this, the reviews were largely not by verified purchasers.  I don't know about you, but this tends to say ""buyer beware.""  Still, I looked around and figured it was worth a shot.

"Excellent snack for chocolate cravings without the sugar hit of candy.  Yes, they're sweetened, but the sugar/fiber ratio is a decent offset:  9g sugar per serving, and 5g fiber plus 3g protein.  9/5/3's really not that bad a profile.Regarding the taste, I think that liking dark chocolate with a high cocoa content helps.  I love barely-sweet chocolate, and I think these are great, but the DH likes milk chocolate best and it took him a while to fall in love with these.

"This is SO sheer it's not even funny.  If the model was wearing it layered over a tank or something I could see it being an honest representation, but there is no way anyone could wear that without a bra or something under it--it's a *very* loose knit.  However: the band around the lower 1/3  of the arms and the bottom is super tight.  The bottom band has a row of buttons that run the length of it, and they are not for show--you can actually unbutton them, and that is the only way I could wear this sweater because it was so constricting when walking.  (I'm a little under 5'6"", and this sweater is tunic-length on me, coming down about five inches onto my upper thighs.  This isn't going to be an issue for the model or taller folks, but between that and the sheerness of it, it's not a keeper.)Pros:  Kind of soft; really nice, unique grey-green color; can hand wash as opposed to having to dry-clean (although it's an option).Cons:  See-through, not flattering, tight band around the bottom that might not be very comfortable for shorter folks--even if they like the length.

"Bought this because it's the closing track in Princess Jellyfish.

"Wore this coat for the first time this morning, and it's a total keeper.  When it arrived a couple days ago, it was somewhat loosely folded in a plastic bag.  I took it out ASAP and hung it in the closet to let the wrinkles hang out.  This morning, it appeared to be de-wrinkled.  (Maybe the black fabric hides wrinkles better than the grey?  I don't know, but it looked fine to me.  If it arrives packed in with other things and it's super-wrinkly, you might want to hang it in the bathroom through a few showers and see if the steam helps--it always worked with my old peacoat.)It was 25 degrees this morning, so I wore it over a light sweater with a scarf and gloves.  I was definitely warm enough, but if I'd been standing around or if it had been windy, it would have been too light.  (There is no insulating liner--just the usual shiny, synthetic fabric lining to make it look finished.)  This is not a coat for the coldest, windiest New England weather, but the cut is easy and it's great for layering.  Goes nicely with jeans, slacks, or a longer skirt--very versatile.  The material is soft and moves very well--not stiff or scratchy at all.  It was also comfortable when driving--it didn't bunch up behind me and make the drive miserable.It closes with two large concealed snaps, and they seemed very tight when I pulled them open the first time.  The belt (which is super long, IMO) is made of the same fabric and two side loops to keep it in place.  It's a tie-style belt, and I had trouble getting it tight enough to look good without the knot looking ugly, so I gave up and just looped it over itself once and let the snaps do the work.  I'm told it looked fine, and it stayed in place throughout the walk and the drive.Overall, it was very comfortable.  I felt good wearing it, and everyone had to touch it (to see if it was scratchy wool, or not), and then wanted to know where it came from when they felt that it was more like soft, strong fleece than itchy wool.And for size reference, I'm 5'6""/165, and the XL fit very easily with room for layering.  (I could probably get the Large and it would look perfectly fine, but it definitely wouldn't be as comfortable and I wouldn't be able to wear it over anything but eveningwear or single-layer tops.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1GIFEJQBTZ7F9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OOHBTGY#wasThisHelpful","R1GIFEJQBTZ7F9","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Pros:  There's no two ways about it--these sheets are super soft.  Even the ever-stoic DH had to admit they're comfy.  I washed them after they arrived, and true to the description, there was very little lint in the lint trap of the dryer when they were done.  Also, they lost none of their softness after washing.  The King size sheet set fit the pillowtop mattress perfectly, and the top sheet was large enough to turn over a bit at the top, tuck in at the bottom, and hung down the sides far enough to reach the top of the box spring.  Also holds heat nicely--paired well with heated mattress pad, thermal fleece blanket and bedspread.Cons:  I wish there was an option to buy additional pillowcases.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RF53A8ICV3W9F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NM8OPEO#wasThisHelpful","RF53A8ICV3W9F","A3LGC1PVFD7358","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3LGC1PVFD7358?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This dress is everything I have come to expect from Patty products.  The cabling is gorgeous and tight, the fabric is heavy enough to be warm but light enough to move, and the fit is very flattering (and I'm a bit under 5ft6 and 165).  The first thing the DH said when he saw me in it was, ""Oh!  That looks really good!  Is it new?  Because I think I'd remember if I'd seen it before.""  (So cute.)This dress does loosen up a bit with wear.  When I first put it on, it fit like a glove and I thought it was just a bit too tight to be flattering.  After cooking doing some morning chores, making breakfast and startng some laundry, I noticed it had already loosened up a bit (particularly the bottom hem) and lower sleeves, (which I had pushed up to cook).  I think that if you find it a liiiiiiitttlllle tight at first, you just need to break it in a bit and it will be your new best friend.  I'm going to order it in black, too.

"A lot harder than I thought it would be, but surprisingly comfortable.  The cutouts are definitely in the right places, but you might have to shift around a bit to find the best way to sit, depending on your needs.  This cushion has been a real boon after these last couple surgeries (Bartholyn cyst marsupialization and excision).  I wouldn't be able to sit at my desk without it.  I still can't sit up for extended periods, but it makes the experience a LOT more comfortable, and allows me to do a bit of work and keep my desk tidy instead of watching bills pile up and trying to pay them on the lap desk on the sofa.

"I first read Ian Fleming as a teenager well before James Bond had become a cultural icon associated more with film than Fleming's books. I recall that my friends and I read these books and felt a self satisfied sense of being grown up and sophisticated when reading the Bond novels. So here I am 50 years later deciding to pick up Fleming again and I must say I was immediately struck by the quality of this very first James Bond book Casino Royale. It is still a page turner and suspenseful action novel. Here Bond emerges as a more introspective and complex character than I perceive the film versions to have ever captured. Although the cold war setting of the plot risks being dated, for me it felt vaguely familiar like a good historical novel should. Fleming was a master of pace and his story moves quickly from suspense to action and back. Another aspect I found fascinating after so many years is that many of the features that must have seemed so exotic to readers in the 50s and 60s ( The food, the French Riviera setting, cars, wine, even the casino itself) are now elements that are much more commonly experienced and understood by a broader public I devoured this and thoroughly enjoyed it. I expect to start working my way through the series and even revisiting some of the older films.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GUJVQPMOFM88/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1612185436#wasThisHelpful","R2GUJVQPMOFM88","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In a style that combines the right amnount of detail within the grand scope of the age of Portuguese exploration and expansion, Mr Cliff has produced a fine enthralling account of Vasco da Gama's role in the exploration of East Africa and India by Europeans.It is rare to read a work of history and be caught up and absorbed in it as if it were a novel, almost disappoinnted to have finished it. That's how well written and exciting The Last Crusade was for me.Cliff's theme is that the Portuguese explorations were intrinsically tied to the struggle between Christianity and the Islamic world with long reaching historical ramifications that extend to the present day.

"Lanchester's novel is grand in scope and he has a wonderful ability to get inside the heads of an incredibly diverse number of characters. In Capital he is pursuing numerous story threads involving a cast of unrelated people who's only common thread is their connection to a specific residential street in South London. Rich and poor, established or recent immigrant , Lanchester's gift is to tell their individual stories in such compelling and believable terms that each short chapter reads like a vignette or short story on it's own while still contributing to the whole mosaic feel of the novel.There is much to recommend this book as a snapshot of life in modern urban London. In some ways it is like a modern version of a Dickens novel. While exploring the plight of the various waves of humanity that have made London their home ,whether by choice or not it maintains a sense of humor and entertains the reader on several levels.

Centering on a pensioner struggling to get by with his dog , as his mean spirited landlady threatens him with eviction ,the film is a classic of Italian cinema from this period.

"Written toward the end of his long exile from his native Austria during the war years, Zweig's portrait of Erasmus while fascinating on it's own merits clearly has a touch of autobiographical reference from Zweig as well.His story of Erasmus' life and work focuses on his essential humanism and his dream of a united and peaceful Europe on the eve of the reformation much as Zweig dreamed of the same before the rise of fascism 400 years later. The comparisons continue with both men being exiled from their native countries and being confronted with growing violence precipitated by a new ideology.Apart from those self references that can be read into this work, Zweig gives us the conflict between Erasmus and Luther in clear terms and the relative importance of these two men with very different approaches to reform is portrayed as central to the drama of the unfolding reformation and the violent upheavals that grew from it.Stefan Zweig is a masterful biographer and this book is no exception. Not easy to find but an incredibly rewarding read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MPKL4WHPR1BQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001CHNVG0#wasThisHelpful","R3MPKL4WHPR1BQ","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Following Stefan Zweig through the years in which the Nazis were gaining power forcing him to leave his beloved Vienna and seek asylum abroad allows the author to examine not only Zweig's personal circumstances but also his place in a network of Exiles in both Europe and the Americas during this tumultuous time. Zweig's inner struggles with living in Exile are related through reference to his own excellent autobiography The World Of Yesterday as well as correspondence and interviews. I've rarely read anything about these years from the perspective of those who escaped the Holocaust with such a depth of feeling and understanding of the combination of restlessness, grief for what was lost and guilt for having left others behind. The author is the descendent of Austrian Jews as well and his common heritage with his subject Zweig gives this book a particular poignancy when discussing the seemingly lost world of pre-Anchluss Vienna.Zweig was a renowned author, a celebrity who quite suddenly finds the rug pulled out from under him in such a devastating way that his story is the perfect example of what those exiled from their homelands during the Nazi era experienced both externally and internally. As an avid reader of Zweig , I found this book incredibly interesting and valuable and recommend it to anyone with an interest not only in Zweig but in this story of those fortunate to escape the death camps but who struggled to find themselves after being cast adrift. Fabulous book.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249S314ESIFOK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590516125#wasThisHelpful","R249S314ESIFOK","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"All of these films stand as master adaptations of Shakespeare to the Screen. Olivier's Hamlet is the standard for any screen version. Staged traditionally and filmed in black and white it is the Hamlet performance that can be viewed again and again. Olivier's direction and acting are superb as are the rest of the cast and the lines of the most famous scenes are so beautifully delivered as to make them seem fresh again with every viewing. Much the same can be said of the other two plays that are in this collection. Henry V uses the device of showing the play being staged but then the viewer is drawn into the action in a way to make the experience as immediate as if in the theater. For Shakespeare lovers this is a must own collection as Sir Olivier does the bard justice as no other film maker can.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHL37420LQBTS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FILVO6#wasThisHelpful","RHL37420LQBTS","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These stories set in the former British colonies of the far east invoke the atmosphere of Englishmen far from home clinging together in clubs sipping G&Ts in the dark corners of the waning empire. No one captures that setting better than Maugham did in his short stories and novels set in Asia. These atmospheric stories introduce the reader to a fascinating collection of characters who have found their way to these British outposts for reasons both mundane and shady. Written by a man whose life spanned the turn of the 20th century it may be said that the Native characters serve as background fodder for these British centric stories and are never or rarely fully fleshed out characters in themselves but consider the time. If reading about expatriate Brits playing bridge on a veranda in Burma is your cup of tea you will love these stories written by an absolute master of short fiction. Maugham's writing never disappoints me and I return to these stories time and again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKAUDE959NRJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0099282844#wasThisHelpful","R2PKAUDE959NRJ","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book is certainly targeted towards fans of the The Stanley Brothers but it has enough background on the early recording industry and the evolutiion of Bluegrass as a seperate genre to satisfy the curiosity of a gnereal readership as well. Well written and researched, Lonsome Melodies depicts the intersection of both the art and business side of The Stanley Brothers' careers illuminating rivalries and friendships that were both the natural outgrowth of a small but growing market for traditional music.  There is much here for the those that love their music as well. The origins and creation of songs, the detailed view into life on the road and their recording sessions outlining various band members who come and go over the years.  The personal side of their story is detailed as well including the tragic demise of Carter Stanley and his premature death after struggling with alchoholism.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this and have been listening to The Stanley Brothers almost non-stop while reading this. This book is a slice of Americana - a look into an era that is gone when regional isolation allowed for development of traditional music as represented here by the Stanleys. A great read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R9E3EZVQHHIO9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1628460571#wasThisHelpful","R9E3EZVQHHIO9","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's really nothing in here but ramblings and testimonies from his kids about what a great guy he is.

"Thomas Hardy's writing is always evocative of atmosphere and filled with meaningful symbolism. This tragic novel is no exception and once again fictional rural Wessex and the ecclesiastical center of Melchester provide the setting for two individuals who fall in love with all the circumstances of social position and differences in wealth arrayed against them. In the case of Viviette Constantine and the Astronomer St. Cleve age difference is added to the volatile mix of factors that doom their love for each other. Hardy provides several twists of fate that irrevocably challenge this pair who through an overly developed respect  for social convention leave their feelings for each other hidden from everyone else in their lives with tragic consequences. For those who love Hardy's work and enjoyed Jude The Obscure or The Mayor of Casterbridge , Two On A Tower will satisfy the desire for another wonderfully written story with similar themes and settings. I personally can never get enough of Hardy and highly recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed his better known works.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGZ2HFTOS7UZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140435360#wasThisHelpful","RGZ2HFTOS7UZ6","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very tightly scripted film noir crime drama. All the elements are here- great acting, crisp screenplay and a plot that moves along quickly and holds the viewer's attention for the entire length of the film.

"In Shakespeare's hands this tale as old as time itself becomes a perfect representation of the ends that people will go to follow passion and neglect duty. Anthony as one of the triumvirate could rule one third of the known world but his obsession with Cleopatra is the weakness he cannot overcome. Cleopatra as the Queen of an important country herself is also victimized by the mutual passion these two share. Whether this is historically accurate or not is immaterial as the world has witnessed this type of tale play out again and again in both art and in real life. Shakespeare again held the mirror up to the world and used historical figures to demonstrate universal truths about human nature. Brilliant !","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19LZ23D2BEIYG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0140714529#wasThisHelpful","R19LZ23D2BEIYG","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Andrew Garcia's first hand account of his experiences in the Montana area as a trapper and trader living among the tribes native to that area are both harrowing and remarkable for the level of detail that he recorded in his memoir. Referring to himself as the squaw kid he becomes comfortable trading and even becoming romantically involved with a survivor of the Nez Perce debacle who is living among the other tribes as a refuge. This is a fascinating book on many levels. First Garcia is a white man living with the Indians and his perspective is unique in that much of his trouble results from encounters with other whites or Indians who are drunk on the whiskey that is used to trade for anything the Indians had of value. There is a sense of the inevitable change that is fast approaching these people as these two cultures increasingly clash over land. At one point he diverges to allow his Nez Perce woman tell the story of her people's struggle in her own voice as told to Garcia. These chapters are a bit difficult not because the content is inaccurate but because the style of writing changes dramatically before Garcia reverts back to his own tale in his own voice.Overall this is an indispensable read for anyone interested in the history of the West. It was recommended to me by a friend and I immediately ordered and read it. Truly unmissable to anyone with an interest in that topic.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10Z5YYNOX3HBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0893012505#wasThisHelpful","R10Z5YYNOX3HBR","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Shorter than his other major works, Joseph Roth's Weights and Measures is a novelette that is almost fable like in the portrayal of the downfall of a man who has followed a code all of his life and upon abandoning that code falls deeply and irrevocably into a world dominated by those very people upon whom he had imposed some semblance of order. As an inspector of weights and measures in an area of the former Austo-Hungarian empire bordering on Russia the protagonist is a symbol of government authority in an area given over to smuggling , cheating and theft. Roth's nostalgia for the order of the old ways in personified in the character Eibenschutz who becomes increasingly unmoored from what has sutained him as the story progresses.Roth was an extremely talented writer and his longer works, The Radesky March and the Emperors Tomb take place in similar circumstances ( in fact several of the characters overlap in this story) but here he has honed his observations into a masterful work of short fiction that has poetic descriptive passages of incredible beauty.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T6V47H3Q1E2E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0720611369#wasThisHelpful","R1T6V47H3Q1E2E","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tia Leoni is fabulous in this and her performance gives the movie it's heart and soul. Overall even though the story seems implausible the screenplay is intelligent and funny and all the main characters are  well conceived and well acted.

"Robert Larson tried hard in this biography to give a layered and balanced perspective on a man who's leadership and prominence lasted for over two generations. In the end I believe he succeeded. Red Cloud was a figure who played a significant role in the history of his people during the most volatile  and dynamic years of change and struggle that the Lakota experienced. His early days as a warrior are outlined here as are his skills at reading the intent of his adversaries and using negotiation, stall tactics and long deliberations to prolong the Sioux traditional way of life in the face of what Larson suggests was his view that the forces arrayed against his people would in the end be irresistible.Red Cloud is presented here as a man with faults and shortcomings. He did not take part with the Northern Sioux led by Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull in the Great Sioux war that included the Battle of Little Big Horn. His role in the episode that resulted in Crazy Horse's murder at Camp Robinson is clouded in mystery and frankly Larson's book does very little to shed any additional light here. These factors may have diminished his stature among his own people to a large degree. But the record of his continued resistance to white encroachment on Sioux lands is clear.His numerous visits to Washington and meetings with several US Presidents  are described in great detail and attest to the importance of the man and his reputation at the time. It also seems that those trips gave Red Cloud insights into the way white people thought and the overwhelming numbers he was dealing with contributed to his legacy as a treaty Sioux.Overall I learned a great deal from reading this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in Native American history.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R6GTHI2INGRSJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806131896#wasThisHelpful","R6GTHI2INGRSJ","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins has been referred to as the first modern English detective novel. It is unique in form , being narrated by no less than 7 characters. In this way Collins enabled the reader to see events from varying points of view. The effect of this is not disunity of form as you might suspect but instead a gradual buildup of suspense that grips the reader and provides numerous thrilling plot twists. This is a Victorian era novel ( Wilkie Collins was a close friend and associate of Charles Dickens) and must be read in that light as a work of historical importance and a classic even if it may not be as well known as the works of his famous friend.The plot revolves around a theft at a Yorkshire state and the story moves between Yorkshire and London as a variety of characters come under suspicion and an equal variety of people either attempt or think they have identified the guilty party. There is enough intrigue in this novel to satisfy any fan of mystery writing and enough quality of writing and depth to satisfy any lover of great literature.Wilkie Collins may now be best remembered as the author of THE WOMAN In WHITE but The Moonstone is reputed to be his masterpiece so I chose to start with this and truly enjoyed reading it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R143LJRKBHF8K9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0451531221#wasThisHelpful","R143LJRKBHF8K9","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Alan Stilltoe was a fine writer who really exposed the grimness of life in postwar industrial England through characters who either endure lives of quiet desperation or inner rebellion. The title story in this collection is well known since it was made into a film in the 60s and it falls into the later category. The prime character is a youth living in a grim rainy gritty city in England who is caught after a robbery and sent to a Borstal where he discovers his talent for running. He then uses this to set up a rebellious tale that sets the individual against the establishment, a theme that is repeated in much of Stilltoe's work. The other stories are very good and as a collection this short book is excellent for the quality of the writing and consistency of theme.Stilltoe's full length novel  Saturday Night and Sunday morning is equally well done and worth exploring if you enjoy these stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGRBCN36PZHQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307389642#wasThisHelpful","RGRBCN36PZHQD","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the 6th installment of the Flashman Papers that I've read and while not my favorite it is still a tremendous adventure following our man from the cricket grounds of London to Borneo, Singapore and finally Madagascar  to rescue his wife Elspeth from the clutches of a Pirate. Like all Flashman stories the hair raising close calls alternate with ribald humor and the combination of adventure tale with well researched history brings this story to life. All the Flashman books I have read so far have been hugely entertaining and informative. I continue to work my way through the remainder. George Macdonald Fraser was brilliant in the way he was able to continually find new and interesting circumstances in which to place his hero for our amusement. Well done again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1WOMRLLDWMFAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0452264898#wasThisHelpful","R1WOMRLLDWMFAF","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Having just read Van Gogh The Life ,an outstanding 900 page biography, of Vincent Van Gogh I was curious to see this film again after many years to see how it lined up against the book. I was very impressed with the film for a number of reasons. It is obviously condensed compared to the book and begins with Vincent already a grown man trying to enter the ministry. The time he spent in Arles with Gaugin takes up a significant part of the film even though their time living and working together was really only three months out of his 37 years. That aside the performances by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn are both excellent. Douglas particularly does well in conveying the artists manic depressive states and his essential feeling of isolation. The scenery and and the way the film incorporates the actual paintings of Van Gogh and sets them in context is truly remarkable.A film by necessity must have a buildup ,a climax and a conclusion and the choices that were made by Vincente Minelli to achieve that without compromising the essence of Van Gogh's life story result in a wonderful concise view into a very complex artist and troubled man.Overall I thought after reading the book that I might find the film trite but I was happily surprised to find it completely engaging from beginning to end. It is an excellent movie that has held up quite well after almost 60 years.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZZFGGU1QLMJI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BYA4HY#wasThisHelpful","R1ZZFGGU1QLMJI","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I came away from watching this film with very mixed feelings. The film is stunning in period imagery and many of the performances are really outstanding. The plot is intriguing enough and there are several surprises along the way. The historical aspect of seeing Spain in the late inquisition followed by the French invasion and then the British marching up from Portugal to drive out Napoleon's troops is very well captured in a compressed timeline. Excellent costuming and atmospherics contribute to a highly entertaining period piece. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that for me the involvement and chance encounters of the main characters during these tumultuous events strained believability to the breaking point. While that distracted me while watching I still recognized the beauty of the film and admire the attempt to tell a truly fascinating historical tale through the eyes of a handful of people including of course Goya. Bardem is convincingly evil and self- interested. Portman in a dual role is very good. Overall I'd recommend it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLM01S7RMNOTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00118S6A6#wasThisHelpful","RLM01S7RMNOTI","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am a big fan of Steve Coogan and that is what prompted me to watch this film. I knew little of Paul Raymond's story beforehand. There are some fine and highly watchable moments in this and Coogan does admirably in the lead role. The background and scenes in London from the 60's through the 80s are very entertaining in their own right. Given the subject matter there are a host of beautiful women in supporting roles. So far so good, right ? But overall there was something missing. The story of a man building a business empire based on soft porn and strip clubs , the inevitable use of drugs in the 80s, the tragic family relationships with his ex wife and children all may be based in fact but it seemed like a check the box exercise in a typical the higher they fly the further they fall cliche"".It was worth a rental but in the end it's a fairly forgettable film.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 11, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R185U1IN9FULRC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DX88JAE#wasThisHelpful","R185U1IN9FULRC","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Captain Phillips provides a seriously tension filled movie experience. Tom Hanks is terrific in the title role. The actors who play the Somali pirates are equally strong. The movie has a very short buildup that allows the viewers to understand the  major players but the action sequences commence very early on and once they do the action is relentless making the entire rest of the film edge of your seat stuff.  I have read that there is some criticism that the film distorts the actual story  but even if true that doesn't detract from the quality of this as an action movie.

"Stunning in the amount of detail and yet never dry or boring this is as an extensive and insightful biography as any I've read. The authors collaborated and yet the style of the writing is so engaging and consistent throughout that it seems the work of a single author. Van Gogh is traced from childhood through his troubled young adulthood and emerges here as a tortured soul striving for understanding and a place in the world who intimately translated those longings into his art. Beautifully written, massive in scope , detail and informative while entertaining ,this is a model for what good biography should and can be. You leave this book feeling like you know Van Gogh the way you know members of your own family. Using the letters Vincent wrote to his brother as a primary source in a narrative that very effectively merges the circumstances of his life with his inner torment and struggles results in a dissection of the man's evolution as an artist and his emotional neediness that is at once disturbing and powerful. This is a long read but for me the pages flew and I loved being immersed in this  man's life and world for a time. If you have an interest in Van Gogh or this period of art history you simply cannot miss this book. It will enrich your appreciation and stay with you for a very long time. An investment in time that is well worth it.

"I first read this book many years ago and recently picked it up again before visiting Little Big Horn Battlefield. Connell's meandering style takes some getting used to even in a second reading. Nevertheless, this is a fascinating portrayal of one of the seminal episodes in the history of the American west, with the personalities of many of the major as well as the lesser known players explored as tangents to the events leading up to the Custer battle. Connell's practice of going off on countless tangential details may be distracting at first but in the end he weaves a quilt that allows the main thread of the story to emerge while entertaining and informing his readers of an astounding array of characters who influenced or participated in these events from both the white and Indian perspective. This is a book that often left me shaking my head in awe at the almost unbelievable characters involved. As the saying goes truth is often stranger than fiction. In Connell's hands history takes on the dramatic tension and has the ability to amaze as if it were a great work of art which I suppose in the end it is even though well documented and true.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KYCB24NJTB9I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0865475105#wasThisHelpful","R1KYCB24NJTB9I","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"W. Somerset Maugham is one of my favorite authors and I find his writing to be always insightful and interesting. The Hero is far from being one of his masterworks and yet there are passages in it that are just so stunning in the way he is able to capture a person's essence and reflect their inner life that forshadow how some of his later more complex novels are structured. As a playwright first and a novelist second Maugham has a unique feel for the dramatic confrontation and that quality is reflected throughout this book.A decorated veteran of the Boer War returns to his small town in England to his family and his fiance only to find he has changed in his attitude toward them through his experiences overseas. He struggles to reconcile his feelings and actions with tragic results. The plot is excellent, the tension is palpable and the characterizations are typical Maugham. For those who like me can't get enough of his writing this is a fine selection. If you are new to his writing I wouldn't start here but read one of his better known works first.Overall I found this relatively short work by an author I revere to be exactly what I would expect from him.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1J9NI2O0BBOWB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1607620057#wasThisHelpful","R1J9NI2O0BBOWB","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I count myself a true fan of The Flashman Series by George MacDonald Fraser and so could not resist picking up his own memoirs of the Burma campaign in WWII when I saw it in a London bookstore. I was not disappointed. Fraser writes so warmly of his experiences with his Unit of Cumberland soldiers as they fought their way toward Rangoon. There is the hardness of battle worn veterans in mortal combat with a deadly enemy levied by a camaraderie and slowly gained respect for men in the far end of the world isolated except for each other's company. Fraser spares nothing relative to the cruelty and also to the role of luck in who makes it and who doesn't and his battle and combat writing is superb. What sets this war memoir apart is his willingness to record dialogue between military comrades , much of it written in a Cumbrian dialect that brings his former comrades to life and makes this such an engaging read. It's the camp life, tea time discussions that you'll remember more than the battles and movement of troops. This may not be the best WWII memoir but it certainly a fine one written by a remarkably gifted writer and I enjoyed it very much.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17QYFPJNCR7N2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602391904#wasThisHelpful","R17QYFPJNCR7N2","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Conan Doyle's Gerard may well have inspired Fraser's later Flashman series. The similarities are obvious but there are profound differences between these two fictional 19th century military heroes beyond the fact that they would have found themselves on opposite sides. Flashman is an admitted rogue and coward who has gained his reputation by mere chance and misunderstanding. He knows it and the readers he addresses in his fictional memoirs are in on the secret. Gerard by contrast is oblivious that his superiors see him as rather dim and while brave in the extreme he has an acutely exaggerated opinion of himself. The difference is that with Flashman the joke is on them... with Gerard the joke is on him.Gerard's adventures during the Napoleonic campaigns are true page turners. The settings are just about anywhere that the French armies engaged from Poland to Portugal. His overblown confidence extends to his conceit about his irresistibility to women, although unlike Flashman this takes place mostly in Gerard's mind. Before this I had known Conan Doyle ,as most probably do,as the author of the Sherlock Holmes stories. This is another side of him and quite humorous, well written and worthwhile.  Anyone who enjoys the Flashman novels will love this as well.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 1, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GMQ0CW9IR1DO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0940322730#wasThisHelpful","R2GMQ0CW9IR1DO","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The concept of this short and very witty book is that a group of diverse passengers stuck on the Jubilee line and faced with some choices of how best to leave is weaved into a funny pun filled dialogue around the competing social political theories of capitalism and socialism. This is part of a series by John O'Farrell.  I picked this one up while in London. It's funny and at times thought provoking. At other times it's a bit of a stretch  but it's a short and worthwhile read overall.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W6CCWJFQ73DG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1846146348#wasThisHelpful","R1W6CCWJFQ73DG","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There are a number of qualities that make Rear Window one of the best films of all time. Set entirely in a single room facing out onto a courtyard, a photographer recuperating from injury and confined to a wheel chair spends his days observing his neighbors through their windows. His natural voyeurism becomes obsessive as he begins to draw conclusions about each of these people and give them nicknames ( Miss Lonely Heart...etc) based on what he sees through the window. Jimmy Stewart is fantastic in this role. His fashionable socialite girlfriend is played by the incredibly beautiful Grace Kelly , who is slowly drawn into his obsession that one of his neighbors is acting suspiciously and his wife is uncharacteristically missing. Suspicion and Suspense builds from there.Hitchcock had tried something similar in his earlier film Rope, also set in a single setting and involving suspense around a murder. Here he succeeds in taking that concept and directing two incredible actors to create a film that deserves it's reputation and longevity. Rear Window doesn't feel dated and still has the quality to grip the viewer and maintain it's suspenseful quality even 60 years on.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDD465AJE6WY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00871C09S#wasThisHelpful","RDD465AJE6WY","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Joseph Ellis wrote a highly readable and engaging biography that brings Washington into clear focus as a leader and a man. This is not an iconography and it is also not a politically correct rewriting of history. Ellis writes in his introduction that in order to present a valid and realistic view of Washington one must judge him within the context of his times. Washington clearly made many military misjudgments and as the Revolutionary War unfolds and things look very dire from the American point of view, Ellis' description of the entrapment of Cornwallis' army in Yorktown can be seen as Britain losing the war as much as it was an American victory.Washington's handling of the post war situation and his unwillingness to follow other revolutionary military leaders examples and become a dictator is well handled by Ellis.There are surprises and thought provoking passages throughout this book that serve to demystify a man who may be the most distant and difficult to separate from the icon he has become in American culture. KIng George III hearing of Washington's refusal to grab dictatorial power is quoted here as saying "" If he does not he will be the greatest man in the world."" Quite a thing for the defeated King of England to say.Fine book, well written and highly recommended.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JSEGNZAFAQ2P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1400032539#wasThisHelpful","R1JSEGNZAFAQ2P","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Butcher's Crossing expands on the traditional Western Novel through the examination of a world in transition. A young man seeking adventure funds and joins in a buffalo hunt high in the rockies with a mix-matched party of men who are clinging to a way of life that is rapidly disappearing. They meet in the small desolate town of Butcher's Crossing and after a year of hunting and struggling to survive they return to find the town and the world they left behind as dramatically changed as they are by their own collective experience.A novel deep in imagery and symbolism , Butcher's Crossing is totally engaging as a story of the West and yet it is much more. John Williams was a writer of incredible skill and his ability to form images so clearly in the mind of the reader is a huge factor in what makes this story so moving. As I read this I could hear the river, feel the cold of the snow and smell the campfires. I had recently read Stoner which I enjoyed very much as well and look forward to reading Augustus, his other major work. I'm very happy to have discovered the works of John Williams through the New York Review Books Classics series.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DLQEK3GR0A09/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590171985#wasThisHelpful","R2DLQEK3GR0A09","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Naomi is the story of a man who becomes painfully obsessed with an adolescent girl and takes ""possession"" of her in order to form her into his vision of a sublimely sophisticated and western influenced partner. He is attracted to her initially because of her somewhat western features so his secondary obsession with Western culture ( this is set in 1920s Tokyo) underlines and magnifies his flawed vision of the girl.Part Lolita and part Frankenstein, the story begins with his manipulation of her but she grows into a self absorbed and selfish creature who seems to delight in his humiliation.Written in a very straightforward style and with an excellent translation in this version, Naomi is a novel that is set in a Japan going through significant social changes and the portrayal that Tanazaki provides of a Tokyo in transition and the underside of a society with a collective inferiority complex is deeply atmospheric and gritty. In turn the two main characters are fairly despicable and yet the book resonates and made me want to explore more of this man's work.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIQILCDN0Q1NO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375724745#wasThisHelpful","RIQILCDN0Q1NO","AMKZHBOK7VMQR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AMKZHBOK7VMQR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is an incredibly well written book about Shane MacGowan. It summarizes his influences both from his Irish republican roots as well as the Punk and Traditional music that led to the formation and work of the Pogues in concise and yet detailed enough fashion that I felt like I was learning these things for the first time although I am familiar with both threads of his history. The author writes very engaging prose and there are many quotes from both Shane and others that add texture to this book making it indispensable reading for anyone who is a fan of the Pogues.

"I hate cleaning out my fridge but it has to be done. I cannot explain how so many sticky spots appear on the glass shelves but my jars of condiments and bagged salads catch on this little spill or that little drop and it's just disgusting. I've always used a regular scrubber sponge to clean my fridge but they quickly turn sticky and disgusting themselves and I never can seem to get the sticky gunk to rinse out of the scrubber pad side so yet another sponge ends up in the trash. Ugh. I was so DONE with sponges when I had the opportunity to purchase these at a discount to test them out. ""These are different"" they said. ""They are silicone and won't get gross, moldy, stinky or messy."" Fine, I'll try them.I'm so very glad I did! First, they scrub REALLY well but without scratching at all. They literally grip sticky messes and jerk them right off the surface of whatever you're cleaning. You can see that my glass refrigerator shelves in the picture are *SPARKLING* clean. Thanksgiving is in a week and now I won't cringe with embarrassment when family opens my refrigerator door. The whole fridge is now gleaming! Even better, it didn't take me two hours like it usually does. Nope. I scrubbed the crud and sticky off each shelf in less than three minutes each. The silicone just wiped it off and the water rinsed it straight out of the sponge because NOTHING CAN STICK TO IT! I had no idea that I'd spent years smearing messy ketchup and strawberry jam all over the glass shelves with a regular sponge until the dish soap could finally dissolve it all and get it rinsed away. Peachy clean sponges worked sooooo much better at removing gunk the first time and not hanging on to it at all. (Silicone is totally non-stick after all.)I also LOVE that I can throw these sponges in the dishwasher to clean them and I'm certain they'll still smell good. Even after using Dawn dish soap multiple times and rinsing the sponge thoroughly, it STILL smells like clean peach! I'm kind of in love with silicone sponges now! If you are looking for a way to reduce your grocery expenditures, your family's waste and you want good, reuseable items, seriously consider getting a pack of these sponges! They're honestly amazing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RH1WFT78EDG6N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LAGQL3S#wasThisHelpful","RH1WFT78EDG6N","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This creative Picnic Bowl is unlike any other food transport system I have ever used and it's positively BRILLIANT! It comes with 3 different inserts that divide the bowl into levels where you can separate foods for a picnic. Or you can remove the clear plastic inserts altogether then fill the whole bowl full of watermelon slices and snap on the lid for mess-free transport no matter who ends up holding it in the car!The bowl is a generous 9.5 inches wide and 6 inches deep with a top lid that securely clip-locks on all 4 sides. The lid has smooth, comfortable plastic handles attached to it for easy toting. The handles are designed so perfectly that when they are folded down flat, the top of the bowl is perfectly level and steady for stacking other things on top. SAVE MONEY At it's widest the bowl is 11 inches with the lid on, making it easy to tuck into the family pool bag so we can eat lunch during adult swim at the pool instead of spending a small fortune at the overpriced snack bar. Sandwiches, berries, sliced vegetables and individual bags of chips would easily fit for 2, 3 or 4 people.If you need a reliable way to transport veggie dips and sauces, the LunchBots Leak Proof Stainless Steel Food Containers Set of 2, Green I ordered from Amazon are AMAZING at containing the messiest liquids without ever spilling. The 4 ounce (1/2 cup) LunchBot container is small enough to fit in the middle compartment and the bottom divided compartment (it couldn't fit in the top lidded compartment and still allow the lid to lock properly).I'm done buying flimsy paper bags that allow food to be crushed in my pool bag or daypack or that get soggy and ruined from wet drinks or ice in the cooler. I love that I can set the entire bowl inside of our large cooler to stay chilled and fresh while the items inside are protected from the melting ice and water that has drenched so many lunches in the past.This is the fastest, easiest and CUTEST way to quickly pack-and-go food, snacks or meals to enjoy wherever your adventures - or busy schedule - takes you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L9N2ASJSJLXR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013EU2E8I#wasThisHelpful","R2L9N2ASJSJLXR","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is hands-down the best stapler I have ever used or owned. I've worked several jobs and owned numerous school staplers. Before this I would wrestle with my supposedly good quality name brand stapler that ate more staples than it ever punched through paper. I was working on making a large stack of handout packets and about lost my mind.Is it too much to ask that a stapler simply staple the paper properly every single time? We have sent a rover to Mars - how is it possible we have not perfected the common household stapler?In my frustration I jumped on Amazon, scoured the reviews and had this bad boy shipped to my house. (I love Prime 2 day shipping!) When this arrived I tested it out. It tackled the few handout pages easily, like it was stapling air. I folded a sheet of paper into fourths and rapid-fired staples as quickly as I could. It didn't jam. I stapled over existing staples. It didn't catch, snag or fail in any way. It just kept stapling like it should! FINALLY! I have found stapling bliss! (And my old stapler has gotten to know the local GoodWill).If you are a student, in college, just starting out, working in an office, have a home office or simply have hands and you're about ready to throw your malfunctioning stapler out into the street, make a small investment in your sanity and order this wonderful tool that will forever after properly attend to all of your stapling needs!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G7NI4P2PKHT5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NLVDFM#wasThisHelpful","R1G7NI4P2PKHT5","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We adopted a beautiful Brittany Spaniel / Yellow Lab mix but like many spaniels, he grows long tufts of fur from the bottom of his feet. This causes him to frequently slip on our tile and he tracks in enormous amounts of mud when it is raining outside because of these long tufts of paw hair. Previously I had been using my husband's hair trimming scissors to trim the dog's paws and my hubby was not at all happy when he discovered what I was using. He was much more pleased when I was able to purchase these at a discount to use instead. These are wonderfully designed with blunt, flared tips to protect dogs from accidental nicks. I have accidentally cut my pup during these trimmings and now he trembles and dislikes when I have to cut away the hair from his paws. I'm hoping the safety features prevent any more boo-boos and he begins to relax so it's not such a chore!The scissors cut his thick hair quickly and cleanly, which is really saying something when you're dealing with a squirming pup! There are both a long nose and short nose trimming scissors. The long ones worked great on my medium dog and the slightly shorter scissors would be great for trimming facial fur. The thinning scissors are awesome - I've never had a set for my dog - so I'll be able to thin out some of the fringe all over him during the hot summer months when he is shedding like crazy.

"These sweet little hair clips hide a secret weapon for keeping lice away from your child's head. On the underside of each one is a soft, cottony pad that will absorb and hold a drop of lice-repelling Mylee oil right next to your child's scalp.The ingredients in the Mylee oil are Rosemary oil, Phenoxyethanol and Tocopheryl Acetate to send those brat lice fleeing. If you'd like to use a different brand of essential oil or a concoction of your own make (Peppermint, Thyme and Melaleuca/Tea Tree essential oil are all believed to repel lice in addition to Rosemary), the absorbent pad dot on the back of the clip will happily accept and diffuse whatever oil is placed upon it.It seems that Amazon sends you one of a random assortment of clip colors and I was fortunate to receive a VERY charming hot pink, orange and cream set. Each clip is 2 inches long which is small enough for a school-age child but also large enough that mom could wear one if needed, too. They gave a quick, sturdy snap-close and EXCELLENT hold, even in ultra-fine baby blonde hair that nothing seems to be able to grip!Invest in these cuties before lice strikes at school. If the outbreak has already reached your children, seriously consider purchasing the Metal LEVIA Nit-Free Terminator Comb to get the nits out. (Check my review on that comb for a simple lice and nit removal kitchen recipe that really works and makes the nits slide off the hair easily.) I was fortunate to be able to purchase these lice clips at a discount to test AFTER a horrible lice outbreak hit our school but I know that using essential oils on the hair and not sharing brushes or pillows among friends does prevent them from spreading.

"We live in the suburbs and own a Doberman. That alone gets us plenty of stares and sideways glances but when it is time to do off-leash training to ensure she is well-behaved and obeys long distance come-backs, it gets a little tricky. There are leash laws and neighbors we need to be considerate of. The best solution is a long training leash.At the end of our cul-de-sac is an open greenbelt with a large grassy area that is perfect for training her in the evenings. In nice weather other families are out playing catch with their children, others are strolling on the greenbelt, some are walking their dogs, so you can't hog it all to yourself. I found this leash came in very handy for training. First of all, it is literally a 30 foot long leash. It has a loop handle on one end and a metal bolt snap clip on the other end. If your community has strict leash laws this fulfills the requirement as being a leash.For our pictured training, I bought a 70 12 inch nail from my local hardware store and pushed it into the ground then looped the handle of the leash over it. My dog understands the command ""You are tied up"" so she didn't pull it out of the ground. If she had, the leash webbing is PLENTY strong enough to handle a big dog but light enough that the dog may not notice they are clipped up so you can reel them in if they disobey a ""come"" command, reinforcing that they have to comply to your commands even if they believe they are off-leash.You can also see in the pictures there are people walking, children are running around and a father is playing catch with his children nearby. None of these neighbors minded at all that I was training my dog nearby because the black leash was highly visible and it was obvious she was tethered. It made for incredibly easy training to walk her to the end of the lead, give her a sit and stay command or to put her in a long down-stay and then release her from the stay and call her back to me at a distance. Even when I was the full 30 feet away from her, people could see that she was leashed and under control so they were comfortable walking by on the sidewalk without complaint. I like that this specific training lead helps me comply with local leash laws and show the utmost respect for my neighbors while also letting me train my dog as needed.When we were done, I stored the leash by folding it in half several times and then securing it with an 18 inch Nite Ize Gear Tie I bought on Amazon. This was a great way to quickly wrap and securely store it until our next training session.I'm grateful that I was able to purchase this lead at a slight discount (not free) to test it out for our own dog training needs and that it worked so incredibly well! I also appreciate how lightweight and packable it is. This will be much easier to take on our camping trips that our big cable tie out, making it even more useful.

"I purchased these to use as loops that were fastened to tent stakes to create a fast loop-and-secure system for tent guy lines. The pieces were all uniformly stamp-cut, smooth faced and none of them had any manufacturing flaws. Because they are stamped, one inside lip/edge is smoother so I faced the smoother side down so no sharp edges would cut through the paracord if the guy lines whipped during a storm. They were perfect for the use I intended and I'm pleased that they were all very uniform in shape, quality made and priced MUCH less than my local big box hardware store.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2DI6P2NRTL6LI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HYN42NC#wasThisHelpful","R2DI6P2NRTL6LI","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son received a nice Land's End solid leather belt as a hand-me-down. That company has discontinued making such thick, sturdy, cowboy-like belts and I was disappointed that this one was a bit too long for his lean waist. I needed a leather punch to create three new holes but I dreaded using one. The punch my family had growing up was painfully hard to squeeze and when you finally could punch a new hole in a belt, it also pinched and bruised your skin badly. Worse, most of the leather punches I looked at had thin, flimsy looking components and appeared as if they couldn't cut through anything thicker than a piece of felt.Here I was, with this discontinued leather belt that I didn't want to ruin but that could not be worn unless it had new holes punched in it. I was fortunate to be able to purchase this leather hole punch at a slight discount in order to test it out. I removed it from the box and looked it over thoroughly before I let it anywhere near our beloved belt. The punch is large at 10 inches tall and the heft of it hinted that it is a high quality tool. I inspected the punching heads and found them to be sturdy, firm and durable. The rubber handles were cushiony and I checked twice that there was no way they could close all the way down to pinch the soft part of my palm. They simply cannot.After the tool passed inspection, I retrieved the belt and set about sizing the holes so I could select the correct size punch from the 6 different options. I found the exact size needed, rotated it into place and then measured the distance between the existing holes so I could punch equally spaced new ones. I measured the distance and marked the leather with a Sharpie where I wanted to punch it. I positioned the leather tool over the mark and squeezed about as hard as you squeeze a can opener. I thought I was positioning the tool so it would bite and hold the leather while I transferred it to both my hands to apply enough pressure to punch but after positioning it and squeezing it I heard a gentle POP and the belt was punched. That was it. I released the handle to find it had made a nice, clean round hole. I measured and punched the next hole and then the third. The task I had been dreading for over a month was completed in less than four minutes with this tool! It was SO EASY! No sweat, no blood and no tears over a ruined item - it just did what it should and made the task simple!I took pictures as I worked and in the third photo I have the first hole I punched next to the original last belt hole made by the manufacturer. They are identical and you can see how nice and crisp the fresh punch looks. I'm very, very impressed. I love the inventive double-lever action that makes this so easy to squeeze and I love that my son's belt still looks handsome.This is a wonderful tool. If you dread the old leather punches that hurt your hands or you're looking to buy your first, seriously consider this wonderfully well-built model! You won't regret it and it makes the chore of sizing belts incredibly easy!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U91F5MAAPCKQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015ECJ7NO#wasThisHelpful","R2U91F5MAAPCKQ","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These pudgy little animal markers are so adorable for small hands just learning to color! Their shape helps children hold them naturally with the rounded button point facing down - not out towards your fresh painted walls - to keep them working on the paper. They are scribble and ""hammer banging"" friendly and the tips aren't really damaged by the pounding-coloring that little boys seem to engage in.I recommend getting the huge easel drawing pads to make sure they have plenty of room to swing their arms in long, wide coloring strokes and still stay on the paper!Melissa & Doug Easel Paper PadI was fortunate to be able to purchase these at a slight discount (not free) to test them out.

"I live in Houston, the humid, moldy air capital of Texas. As a result from all the mold spores constantly in the air, I suffer from year-round allergy issues. I'm so grateful to have found peppermint essential oil! I diffuse peppermint oil in my home every day to kill spores in the air and to help make breathing easier. I've been diffusing for over a year and in that time I haven't had another sinus infection.As you can imagine, I use a LOT of peppermint oil diffusing it every day. A 4 oz bottle will last me several months, diffusing for 1-2 hours each day. I have tried many different brands and have found that I like a fresh, cool peppermint scent that also makes my home smell very clean when I diffuse it. (My nephew comments that my house always smells like gum! Lol!)This ArtNaturals peppermint has that sweet, clean, candy cane scent I love! It comes with a handy glass dropper, which makes refilling my diffuser without spilling sooooo much easier. I'm thrilled that this peppermint oil is being offered as such a great price! I was fortunate to be able to purchase it at a discount (not free) to compare it to the Now and DoTerra brand essential oils I have been using. I felt that it smelled sweeter than the Now brand oil and similar to the DoTerra peppermint oil that I take internally. (This one I will use just for diffusing.)Peppermint oil is also great for taming painful, throbbing headaches and when diffused regularly, I feel that frequent or repeating headaches are kept at bay. Of course diffusing it during the winter months gives your house a crisp, cheerful scent that enhances the holidays and is refreshing throughout the spring as well!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T8WAP0QMWEFK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JBP5DK#wasThisHelpful","R2T8WAP0QMWEFK","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Let me tell you why you need to add Lavender Essential oil to your first aid kit immediately. It is an incredible essential oil with many skin soothing and skin healing properties. We are a family that loves to camp and be outdoors but sadly we tend to burn easily in the sun as well as suffer a few accidental burns around the campfire. I discovered how incredible lavender essential oil is after a canoe trip where I got a severely bad sunburn on my face and chest from using expired sunscreen. I was so severely burned that puss-filled blisters began rising on my chest (second-degree burn). It was incredibly painful.A family member told me to put a few drops of lavender and peppermint essential oil in a spray bottle with clean, filtered water (not chlorinated tap water) and to spray my skin whenever it was hurting. I followed her directions and it instantly cooled my skin, paused the pain as long as the essential oils were in contact with my skin and helped the burn heal much more quickly. My husband used a few sprays but not near as much as I did. His burn took about 4 days longer to heal than mine did. The lavender had helped speed up the healing process!After this experience I read that Lavender essential oil can also be used on skin burns from touching hot surfaces. Since I do all our camp cooking I'm most often the one who ends up a tad burned. Lavender essential oil applied to a minor cooking burn made it stop hurting INSTANTLY. Now I keep a tiny vial of Lavender essential oil with my first aid kit. You can buy the tiny glass essential oil dram bottles here on Amazon and keep one in every car plus one in each first aid kit:12 New, High Quality, Amber 2 ml (5/8 Dram) Glass Bottles, with Orifice Reducer and Black Cap.After we go camping in the winter I hand wash our wool clothing and I put several drops of Lavender in the rinse water to help give the wool a nice fragrance before it is hung to dry. The lavender in the wool helps repel moths that would ruin it and it helps the wool to not irritate your skin the next time you wear it. The residual lavender also repels mosquitoes!As you can see, I use a TON of lavender so I was grateful to be able to purchase this extra-large 4 ounce bottle at a discounted price to try out. It has a fresh, clean lavender scent and in testing it on a cut on my hand, has the same skin soothing and healing properties as other brands I have tried. This bottle is marked as Therapeutic Grade, sourced from Bulgaria and that it is undiluted. (Diluting with coconut oil actually helps your body absorb the essential oils better!) I feel it is a great quality oil for topical skin and laundry uses and I'm going to enjoy having this big bottle on-hand now!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R308I5SQS1U68W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014S27U8K#wasThisHelpful","R308I5SQS1U68W","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was pleased to see there were several fruit and vegetable character cards, which I believe helps children be open to the idea of eating their veggies! There were several characters I hadn't seen before and I'm sure my niece will LOVE matching up each of her characters with the card that tells a bit about their personality and seeing which Shopkins she still needs to collect!In short this is an adorable card game set that can help early readers in a way that engages their mind and gives them a reason to WANT to read about their favorite Shopkins characters!

"I had no idea how beneficial copper mugs were for your health. Copper itself is anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory so any liquid in the mug - including pure water - is going to benefit from simply contacting the copper. In several countries where  water treatment is less than ideal, they store water in copper pitchers and drink it from copper cups because the copper will naturally kill any harmful bacteria (it is especially good at killing E. Coli) present in the water and prevents the water from going stale.The copper also gently leeches it's best properties into your drink as it is in the cup. Copper is an important trace mineral the thyroid gland needs to function properly and drinking from a copper cup can help make up for any deficiency. Copper also reduces inflammation within the stomach, helping to aid digestion. Copper is also necessary for proper absorption of iron and for vitamin C to be used by the body.I was fortunate to receive one of these beautiful Pomegranate hammered Vogue style cups at no cost to test and review. First, the mug is drop-dead GORGEOUS. It has an old-world appeal that is simply stunning and a heft that implies it is high quality. The generous handle, the thick, rolled lip and substantial weight makes it a piece to be enjoyed. The hammered finish is simply stunning. From top to bottom, the mug is well made, well joined and well thought out. Copper is highly conductive so the ice in your mug doesn't melt nearly as fast and it feels cold and refreshing in your hands for a long time!Enjoy up to 2 drinks per day of any liquid, including water, from a copper mug and reap the health benefits of using natural, sustainable, beautiful drinkware!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35TLGO3JCKJRK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00W30493E#wasThisHelpful","R35TLGO3JCKJRK","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My son was begging me for something that made his bike ""cooler"". It seems the boys in the cul-de-sac are seeking ways to make their bikes unique and enviable to each other. I was expecting to receive 1 set of lights that changed colors but was thrilled to get 3 different sets! He will LOVE the green and now we have little gifts we can share with the cousins!Coolest bike? He wins.  :)Update: These were such a hit with the boys in the cul-de-sac that we ended up sharing the other 2 packs with neighbor children after yelling fights broke out over the lights! Even the pink ones found a home on a little boy's bike! Lol! The lights turn on from centrifugal force so the batteries are not wasted while the bike is parked. However, we found that children's bikes with smaller tires just don't get going fast enough to spin the batteries into contact with the lead so the light can illuminate. They worked great on a bigger boy's bike, 10 speed bikes, etc. Just not the little bike the 4 year-old neighbor was riding. You need to be pedaling at a good speed to have them illuminate on a kid's bike.

"I searched for a while, trying to find sturdy mesh bags at a reasonable price. This set of 5 bags made of thick, durable nylon mesh at less than $2.50 per bag is an awesome deal!What I really wanted was a mesh produce bag that I could fold up and tuck into my purse so I quit looking like a forgetful fool when I showed up at the farmer's market or dropped by a roadside produce stand with nothing to hold fruits and veggies. These mesh bags easily fold up to a little 2.5 by 3.5 inch rectangle and can be secured with their own drawstring. One now resides in my purse, ready for any impromptu local food stops!These are big enough that I could easily use it as a dirty clothes bag for a day trip with my son, a quick toy bag, a reusable in-car trash bag - the options are endless and why not, you have 5 bags!I have a feeling these will come in handy for berry picking next spring. We visit a local U-Pick Organic Blueberry farm in June to get blueberries to freeze and these will be great for transporting them home instead of the plastic grocery bags we have used the past couple years. The mesh is well made but breezy and breathable so my goods won't suffocate on the drive home. I could even wash the blueberries inside the bag then hang the whole thing to drip-dry, all without dumping them out!

"My husband believes in the buy once cry once philosophy when it comes to purchasing outdoor gear and his ultralight backpacking hobbies come with a hefty price tag. The money spent is well worth it for his outdoor enjoyment. He was drooling over the ENO hammocks when we had the opportunity to purchase this one at a discount (not anywhere close to free) to test out. I'll be honest, I figured this would end up being my son's hammock while my hubby threw down for a full priced name-brand one.

How much can they hold? They're selling this for only $40? And you expect it to hold up? Fine, I'll try it.The hammock sat for a couple weeks of rainy weather and he didn't seem to be in a hurry to use it. Finally a clear Saturday came and he gave it a try while he and the guys were out at the land. His texts blew up my phone.That hammock was really easy to set up!I'm impressed, the quality is much better than what I expected at that price.I'm in 20-30 mph gusting winds and the hammock is hanging on solid.He then began sending me pictures.There is plenty of fabric left - you could easily cocoon this over you.It's very comfy. I'm going to let [our son] try it.IT FITS BOTH OF US!Thank you for buying this, it's really nice!There you have it, folks.

"This is the nicest leash in our house. We have a huge Doberman who whimpers to chase the hundreds of squirrels that scamper across the greenbelts where we walk. A namby-pamby little leash is simply not going to cut it for our strolls, especially when a naughty squirrel dares to bolt just beyond the reach of her nose and she breaks my heel command to lunge at it. Sometimes I skip the squirrels altogether and walk her under the stars in the late-night quiet. People appreciate such a massive dog being on a secure leash and visibly well-behaved when they are sharing the sidewalk with us.The leash is thick, durable and strong. It's made by Primal Pet Gear (their big rubber label is stitched to the leash) and features their black powder coated heavy duty metal hardware, including a metal ring at the handle where you can attach a poopy bag dispenser. Down both sides of the leash is a thick reflective strip stitched into the body of the leash. It throws off quite a bit of light, which is important when you're walking a dark colored dog at night like I do.The padded handle is hands-down the best. It's a thick red loop of cushy soft neoprene sewn onto the handle. It's neoprene so it can get wet, sweaty and slobbered on without being ruined. It feels pleasantly comfortable and keeps the thicker nylon webbing edge from scratching and irritating your skin. I've done a bit of pet-sitting and rescue group volunteering so I know there are dogs who have learned to deliberately pull at a leash until it is hurting your hand so bad that you let go, thus freeing them to romp about wildly. The padded handle should help if you're trying to break this habit in a dog you've adopted. If you've got a chronic leash-chewer, this should offer a lot more resistance while you work on training. (Forget Bitter Apple spray. Wrap the leash in aluminum foil. Dogs hate biting the stuff. Add Lavender essential oil to the leash webbing and the foil. They also hate the smell of Lavender and should quickly abandon their chewing attempts.)If you want to make a one-time purchase for a leash that will last the lifetime of your large dog, this is the one you want right here! I was fortunate to be able to purchase it at a discount but even at full price it is cheaper than regular nylon leashes at the big box pet stores.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RR0TPITS1SJZ3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0146912JI#wasThisHelpful","RR0TPITS1SJZ3","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My husband dislocated his kneecap while playing ultimate frisbee a few years ago and although he had surgery to replace his MCL, he still needs Kinesiology tape for some activities. This is a good, lightweight tape that gives support and freedom of motion at the same time. Kinesiology tapes leave a sticky residue on your skin so some baby oil or, in a pinch, a few drops of beard oil will get the uncomfortable tackiness off your skin so your clothing will quit clinging to you. Melaleuca (tea tree) or orange essential oil will also power through the worst leftover residue if other oils don't work.

" Total weight with stuff sack, including the plastic slider on the end to keep the sack closed, is 316 grams or 11.25 ounces according to the electronic scale we use to weigh backpacking gear. 18 inch circumference and 6 inches long when sat on to squish as much air out as possible and re-rolled tightly after being inflated for use.Great lightweight camping pillow! My husband went to Philmont this past July and wished he'd had this with him. He takes ultralight backpacking to the extreme and said that the dirty clothes he used as a pillow for 2 weeks were not comfortable at all and in the end were not a wise decision. A few ounces would have been worth the additional comfort. After trying out this most recent purchase, he said he wished he would have had this pillow. It met his requirements for light weight, although the pillow repacked in it's own brown nylon stuff sack is 18 inches in circumference and about 6 inches long, which is larger than what he prefers to carry. (Like I said, he's a tad overboard on the ultralight backpacking...)The example image colors are way off, by the way. There are NO pink or purple diamond shapes. The colors are solid aqua blue, lime green and dark green stripes together to make an apple green shade, aqua blue and gray stripes together (what looks like purple in the example image), solid red orange, red orange and yellow stripes together, solid yellow, red orange and fruit punch red stripes (appears hot pink in example image) and red orange and yellow stripes, which look tangerine orange in the example image but are darker orange in real life. At first I thought my husband had been fortunate to receive a pillow with no pink or purple diamonds in that part of the pattern but then I realized the example image was just wonky. It is a multi-colored pillow but it's not nearly that bright or little kid-ish looking. It's honestly unisex colored and fine for an adult, teen or child.The pillow has some soft fluffy fill fibers in it that add to the cushioning but they also suck down quite flat for storage.

"My husband returned from Philmont this summer talking about these buffs that he saw several people wearing to help keep the sun from burning their necks and to keep them cool. He talked about what they looked like and how they worked as he slathered burn cooling treatments on his own scorched skin. He burns sooooo easily on his face and back of the neck that I decided to buy him one for Christmas. About this time I was fortunate to be able to purchase one at a discount (not free) to test out. Let me say that I didn't just buy any old buff at the cheapest price and call it good. I looked closely at these over a couple of weeks and opted for this one because it seemed to be soft, lightweight and long. I'm so glad I chose this one!First, the material is incredibly soft. Think super soft thin t-shirt kind of material. It is a seamless tube, which means the ends are not sewn in any way. I included a picture of this so you can see what I mean. The end is a raw edge but when I drug my fingernail across it, trying to get it to fray, the material did nothing - it didn't fray or separate. If this proves to be a problem later, I'll gladly stitch the edge, but I doubt it will be a problem as I anticipate the material will naturally roll up at the edge as opposed to fraying. This means there is no itchy seam constantly rubbing your skin raw.I ordered the color NG02, which is a deep pine tree/hunter green as shown. It's quite a handsome shade and one of my hubby's favorite colors so I'm certain he's going to love it. I was worried about it being a dark color in the hot sun but it is so lightweight that color isn't a concern in the heat but it will hide dirt smudges well when he uses it to wipe sweat from his face.If you or someone you love sunburns easily when outdoors, consider buying one of these feather-light, good-looking neck gaiters for them. They will appreciate it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U2BI6VU8Z6TA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016850B3G#wasThisHelpful","R1U2BI6VU8Z6TA","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I also like that they added several other ingredients such as turmeric, ground cloves and kaolin powder to provide a spectrum of minerals and bacteria-killing power.

"My husband received this book as a gift and I immediately fell in love with the plans for a camp reflector oven. We camp as a family several times per year and many times I had wanted a quick way to bake biscuits by the fire while our big dutch oven was in use making the main course.My husband has done a few wood building projects but he had never worked with sheet metal aluminum or done any metal working at all. This was going to be a total first for us and I won't lie, it seemed a tad daunting. The book had very reliable directions that we followed carefully. In the end, we made THREE camp ovens for ourselves and extended family members! The first one was the hardest. Not only that, but we have used it camping 4 times before I wrote this review so I can tell you that it works! Here is what we did to make the LARGE size aluminum reflector oven from the book:1. We found a local supplier for sheet aluminum. The book tells you the author used .032 (0.8128 mm) sheet aluminum in a 32x36 inch piece. We could only find .014 thickness and it came in a huge sheet - enough to make 4 ovens. Ugh. Glad we have a truck. This thicker aluminum was harder to cut so we had to use an angle grinder to do it as the huge heavy duty metal snips I had bought couldn't cut more than a few inches into the sheet. (The metal snips came in handy for the detailed little snips and cuts I had to do at the corners to follow the template.) Make sure you invest in a tool to properly cut the metal.2. The Template you use to cut the pieces has to be hand made. I'm a graphic artist with Adobe Illustrator and a Silhouette machine so I was able to recreate the template in Illustrator and then use my Silhouette to cut a cardstock template in pieces that I then taped together. Making the template was honestly the hardest part. It's a tad time consuming. If doing it by hand you'll need several sheets of posterboard, a long ruler, a short ruler, a sharp pencil, a big eraser, an abundance of patience, good spatial intelligence, math skills and an hour or two dedicated only to making the template. Once it's done, it's done forever so it is a good idea to invest the time here. If you are sloppy, the angle of the oven will be off and it won't bake as properly as it could. Tracing the sides of the oven is the most important to get right but it is also the weirdest shaped piece.3. We didn't own a riveter (pop-rivet gun) so I bought one on Amazon. All 3 of our various big box hardware stores had really low quality riveters so I scoured the reviews and selected the Stanley one linked below. I'm so glad I did - this riveter was comfortable, easy to use, powerful and worked incredibly well for this project. I strongly recommend saving yourself the time I wasted shopping around and letting Prime deliver the correct, high quality tool to your front door for the same price as the flimsy plastic riveters at the store.Stanley MR100CG Contractor Grade Riveter4. I also needed to buy rivets. Again, the book had wonderful directions telling us exactly what size to buy of a hardware piece I had never seen before. You need 1/8 inch (3mm) rivets with a 6 mm reach AND 1/4 inch rivets also with a 6 mm reach. I couldn't find the 1/8 inch STEEL rivets at the hardware store so I ordered a pack of them on Amazon along with the riveter. This set has 1/8 inch rivets with a 7mm reach that worked just fine for us. 1 pack will make 1 oven using only the steel rivets.Stanley R120 Rivet Pack Assortment5. Next you need a 1/8 inch drill bit that can drill pilot holes through the aluminum. Amazon to the rescue again. I bought these Bosch titanium bits and had them delivered with the riveter tool. You can read my review on them - they worked incredibly well and drilled through the aluminum easily.Bosch TI2135 Titanium SP Jobber Drill Bit, Carded, 1/8-Inch, 2-Pack6. The oven calls for a carrying handle. I purchased a pre-made aluminum handle at a big blue hardware store then scoured their selection of larger rivets until I found the size that would hold the handle onto the aluminum oven body but were short enough to not protrude too far into the oven box. They had them as part of their normal stock and this was easy to obtain.7. Last was the assembly. My husband was impressed that I had done all of the research, shopping, template-making and everything else needed to make the oven so he drove me to buy the aluminum, cut it and did the assembly work. The book has very detailed directions on what to do. We used aluminum angles cut to size for the legs, which was optional but made the assembly a bit faster.The oven was done! Now to test it out. We completed the oven in November of 2014 and have been camping with it a full year as of this writing. You can see the campfire scorch marks on the oven in the images, proving its use. Here is what we have found: The reflector oven is EXCELLENT at baking small, individual servings of dough, like biscuits. We have baked biscuits and canned cinnamon rolls in it with wonderful results. (Cinnamon rolls have now become a camping breakfast request from the boys!) It did not do very well baking a small, long loaf of french bread dough. The dough was just too thick to cook all the way through. Biscuits & small things cook much better. I imagine cookies would be fine, too. If you want to cook cake or brownies, I'd pour it into a longer, shallow sheet-cake pan so the fire can bake the batter all the way through. We chose to build the Large size oven (measurements for small, medium and large size ovens are given in the book) and I'm so glad we opted for this size because a Quarter Sheet baking pan fits almost perfectly on the oven shelf. Any smaller and the baking pan would hang off the edge. As you can tell from the pictures, a quarter sheet overhangs a teensy bit but we have used this set up for baking several times and it does work! However, you must purchase a very thick commercial aluminum baking sheet so the fire doesn't warp it and send all your biscuits sliding towards the middle of the pan. I got the Nordic Ware Naturals Aluminum Quarter sheet and it has worked incredibly well. In fact, I've bought a second one to make sure I have a replacement and that one is always clean and ready to use.Nordic Ware Natural Aluminum Commercial Baker's Quarter Sheet The sheet aluminum the oven is made from is going to get sooty and black. The author of the book tells you this will happen and explains why you do NOT need to clean it. The reflector oven bakes by reflecting heat - not firelight - so even if your oven has darkened from use, it will still bake. Our experience has been that the more you use it, the better it seems to bake but that is because you learn more each time it is used. We have discovered that the oven must be set in front of it's own roaring bed of orange hot coals to properly bake and brown. Placing it directly in the face of lapping flames results in blackened edges and dough that is soggy in the middle.Does this sound like a lot of work? It kind of is but it was incredibly rewarding to hand make our own camping gear. This reflector oven has lured many curious fellow-campers and brought many complements, as well as a few pleas to make some for friends! If you'd like to tackle such a project, this author has put an abundance of time into developing his own handmade camping gear that he uses as a Maine canoe guide, creating detailed directions and specialized measurements and then building his gear all over again following his own book directions just to ensure he hasn't missed any steps and to provide new items for photographing for the book. There are lots of pictures, detailed templates, supply shopping lists and more. It's like having grandpa in the workshop with you, walking you through all the tricky ins and outs. I'm very glad we received this book and tried our hand at making something new!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27ZWFFEBU9609/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1565234847#wasThisHelpful","R27ZWFFEBU9609","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought 3 of these to use as camping plates. You can no longer find the old fashioned pie-plate shaped ones sold for camping that can work as a plate and double as a soup bowl, all in one dish. Since the old camping plates are nothing more than a 9 inch pie pan anyways, I ordered these and am very pleased! The stainless steel is thick and sturdy, not at all prone to warping and these will honestly last a lifetime. These will be banged, dropped, stepped on and left out in the rain but they feel rugged and should hold up well to all of it! Plus they are quick and easy to hand wash, which is a must while camping out.Some camps are requiring that kids bring this type of pie plate so save yourself a ton of hassle and order these!

"Little lantern puts out a lot of light! This was really handy for our Halloween trick-or-treating. It rained this year, adding slick roads to the danger of nighttime traffic. We took the children around as a group and this light lit the way for all the adults (no one had brought a flashlight) and made it easy for our son to spot his parents in the crowd, ensuring he didn't get to far ahead of the group.I set the Luci to charge in a windowsill for about 8 hours of sunlight, deflated it and stored it flat on a shelf until it was needed Halloween night, about two weeks later. It lit up and glowed for several hours that night without even flickering or dimming. Multiple people admired it, switching it on and off through it's various settings of low, high, flash and off. It even got curious inquiries and compliments from strangers out with their children as well.Not only is this a great light to have on hand for emergencies but it's going to prove useful during family camp outs (we camp as a family about 6 times per year and my husband and son rack up another 3-6 camp outs with boy scouts). I also plan on using it during night time activities at New Year's and July 4th. I love that I don't have to suddenly worry about batteries as the sun is sinking in the sky during busy, eventful holidays when it would be difficult to run to the store in all the traffic - if you can even get to the store because the roads have been shut down for the parade/fireworks show/trick or treaters.

Great for cool weather and can be used as a baselayer hat with a warmer wool hat over it for the coldest winter days.

You can also wear it as heat-regulating layer under a straw hat and it will help keep the straw hat on without a chin strap.

The plastic trash bag kind are a joke and some of the ""fabric like"" ones rip so easily they might as well be made of plastic, too. When this one arrived, I took one small raw edge and TRIED to rip it. The material barely budged and simply began separating to reveal strands of fabric as I tugged. The entire poncho is made of fabric that has been treated with a silky, plastic-like PVC coating so it sheds water.

"Each summer I spend a week volunteering as a youth camp counselor. It's an electronics-free camp where teens get a chance to unplug and swim, do archery, zip lines and handmade crafts. Parents expect that while they are out of touch with their cell phone-less children that the counselors will be well prepared for any accident, injury or unforeseen teen incident. (And believe me, the craziest things happen!)  You simply MUST have a good, sturdy bag with you at all times full of the things you're going to need to remedy any situation, which almost always requires band-aids!This bag is surprisingly well thought-out. Inside the main body is a single pouch pocket along the back that is 7.5 inches wide. Great for stashing your guidebook (or a tablet) and keeping it separate from other items. The remainder of the main body (10 x 13 inches) is open and could easily fit a water bottle and sack lunch. Or, in my case, a large first aid kit.The front pocket features an abundance of pockets that are incredibly handy! First there is a 4x4 inch mesh zippered pocket. Behind it is a 5x4 inch open top slip-pocket for a cell phone, bottle of bug spray or sunscreen. Behind that is a large 6 x 5.5 pocket for your largest items. To the right of the mesh pocket are two pencil pockets, large enough to hold a standard Sharpie marker. (For some reason pens and markers are so hard to find when you're at camp yet you always seem to need one!)  A red key clip dangles securely in front of the pockets.There is a small mesh cell phone pocket on the side. At first I thought it was a water bottle holder but at only 2 and a half inches wide, it was too narrow for a plastic bottle. That is fine because a bottle hanging off that side of the pack would bump against your side and rub you.Stitched into the side body of the bag, near the mesh cell phone pocket, are two back and reflective silver gear loops. They are large enough to slip a carabiner through to attach additional lightweight objects.On the cross body strap is a 7x3 inch zippered pouch. it's long and deep, ideal for holding anything you need frequent access to. I plan to keep a bug bite stick, a pen, chapstick and travel size essential oils in that pocket.The back of the bag is a black padded mesh which will help keep your own back and shoulders from becoming chaffed and overheated. The pack strap can be disconnected and clipped to a second attachment point on the other side so it becomes a left-handed cross body bag if desired. The body strap can be adjusted, extending to accommodate an estimated 250 pound frame.The material: I opted for the blue bag, which is a gorgeous vibrant aqua. The material is a rip-stop kind of weave and seems to be water resistant. This is perfect because I need a bag that I can spot across the mess hall that will easily shed glitter from crafts and splatters from food fights, all in the same day's work.I'm incredibly pleased with this bag! I was fortunate to be able to buy it at a slight discount (not free) to test out. It is well sewn and feels rugged; surprisingly so for the price. I've had many bags (I typically carry an REI Flash 18) so i know good quality and I know what will hold up under real-life outdoor abuse. I hope my measurements and pictures help you make the best bag purchase for your adventures!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYMYL6CH75RJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015PTB94Q#wasThisHelpful","RWYMYL6CH75RJ","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is our second weather blitz football and we love them! The first one was so ""loved"" that it disappeared right out of our front yard and was never seen again. This replacement is just as easy to throw and catch, making young boys believe they are as cool as their dad and helping them feel confident about their throwing and catching skills. This also makes a great football for the beach because you can quickly dunk it to wash the sand off.Let me be the first to warn you that if it is left sitting out, unattended in the grass, it may be picked up for a quick game of catch by someone else and never make it back home!

"This is exactly what i needed for keeping dirt out of our tent! Boots pick up so much mud, almost without you realizing it, and then it gets tracked into the tent or the cabin and someone (read: mom) gets to waste her vacation time sweeping the floor. Again. This boot scraper takes mere seconds to use and prevents a lot of muddy, yucky floors. I was shopping for one of these for our upcoming camping season when I was fortunate to be able to purchase one at a discount (not free) to test out.The thick, strong black plastic bristles are long, for poking in all the nooks and crannies of your boot soles and the surrounding sides to pick and pry mud from every angle. Of course it works for adult shoes but how about children's boots? I tested it out with my son's size 5 boots and found the bristles were plenty long enough to do a great job of getting the debris off them, too! The space between the bristles is 3.4 inches so as long as your child's shoe is wider than that, it will scrape the mud and snow off the sides. The bristles on the bottom will scrape any and every boot it touches.I'm really pleased with this simple product that makes it easier to keep a clean cabin!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K5AN3HH5RTEK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015GCD36O#wasThisHelpful","R2K5AN3HH5RTEK","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"12 rolls of packing tape, exactly as described! This is made by a brand called CWC and is a perfect tape for assembling boxes quick and easy! (This is not thick, name brand tape but it is plenty strong and has good stickiness!) I have found that to keep the end from sticking to itself and then shredding into strips when you try to use it again is to flip the end down so sticky side is touching sticky side to create a pull-tab on the end of the roll. This makes it easier to start taping another box right away and then gives each box a pull-tab for opening later so you don't need a pocket knife. Also a great trick for sealing up Christmas gift boxes (after you have checked to see what was in the Amazon box!) so they're easier to open by the recipient: simply pull the tape tab at the end and the entire strip of tape holding the box closed comes off. No scissors or box cutters needed on Christmas morning!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLX1BGAA9QZH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015NKM7Q6#wasThisHelpful","RLX1BGAA9QZH","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Wow, these are nice quality colored pencils! I lost a set of Prismacolors and was really missing them. I purchased a set of Prang colored pencils and these, wanting a good quality set at a reasonable price. These are hands-down my favorite. They have a rich color and draw with a creamy smooth feel that I adore. They're not at all dry, brittle or gritty like some colored pencils.In the first picture I drew with Prang brand on the LEFT and Siensync on the RIGHT on a strip of thick white cardstock. You can see the Prang pencils did just fine but they have a bit of ""patterning"" to them, as if I was doing a rubbing of a wood grain. The picture shows the gritty texture of the line they left better than I can explain it - Prang just didn't color super smooth. The Siensync on the other hand color like butter and lay down a beautiful, rich hue. I was able to do fine detail work and handlettering with them or I could press harder, which I did with the red color sample, to achieve thick, vibrantly bold lines.I'm a graphic artist but I indulge in doodle work here and there.

"Thank goodness someone invented these! I cannot stand the smell of open cans of cat food yet when my cat is sick and can only take medication with wet food, I have to have one of those itty bitty cans open for a day or two until we finish the dosing. (Ah, the strange problems of a cat lady. Luckily I only have one.) I think they made those cans especially slick so that neither plastic wrap or aluminum foil will properly grip them to give an airtight seal. And even if they did, that brat cat could still rip through them in an instant.So here I was, dry heaving at the smell of canned cat food that was temporarily permeating my kitchen, when I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase these silicone lids at a slight discount (not free) to try them out. I was thrilled - THRILLED - when I opened my package of 6 (which is way too many. You could easily split the set with a friend) and discovered an itty bitty baby silicone lid that looked like it might actually fit those microscopic stink bombs I feed my sick cat. I dashed to the pantry to retrieve one of the little pipsqueaks and squealed with delight when I realized the silicone lid fit the can! I won't have to deal with any more putrid fish gut cat food smells in my fridge! I was so excited, I even took a picture, folks!Just for fun I slapped the silicone lid on a regular can of husband food (the effects of which also stink up my master bathroom) and discovered that SAME little tiny lid fit the regular sized grocery store cans as well. As you can imagine, this little guy got a prominent spot on the cabinet shelf, where I can quickly find him next time I am retching over that danged puke-gut cat food.The other lids are great, too! I was delighted to find the largest one fit over my KitchenAid mixing bowl, so I can also keep the cat out of the cookie batter. And the husband, too, for that matter. It's taut surface gives me a great place to Sharpie warnings and death threats to anyone who dares to eat a single chocolate morsel before the cookies are baked. I'm sure I'll find several other uses for them, too. However, the large one doesn't fit over the toilet bowl so you're still going to have to use Saran Wrap for that prank.In short, I am thrilled with my purchase and look forward to covering up all kinds of things!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29CTV4MS7KXM5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013HHJUY4#wasThisHelpful","R29CTV4MS7KXM5","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I was fortunate to be able to buy these at a slight discount (not free) to try them out before all the holiday baking began. The bags are large and sturdy. They are THICK and really well stitched. The edges are serged and there is a second stitching around the edge to make sure they last forever.

"This is a nice, lightweight little lunch kit at an affordable price if you're looking for entry level stainless steel lunch containers. Notice I said Lightweight, because it is. This is not the thick, heavy duty stainless steel the $20 boxes are made out of. It's lighter weight, more like an altoids tin, for easy lunch toting and camping. For holding a sandwich that you're going to tuck into your bag, it is ideal and at a great price point.  Just be aware that the somewhat thin stainless can scratch and dent more easily than the heavier stuff.The silver triangle lid holder isn't terribly useful. (When the item ships, the piece is inside for you to assemble yourself so you can leave it off if you prefer.) A rubber band would hold the lid on well enough and you could band a napkin to it with your meal. This container is in NO WAY leak proof. This tin is for completely dry foods and snacks only. Any long-standing liquid may cause water spots that turn into little rust spots. (Stainless means it ""stains less"" than other metals, not that it is stain-proof.)Allergy Friendly: There is no plastic on or in this lunch box whatsoever. I know some people have allergies to plastic, plastic fillers, etc. This has none of that and is excellent for those with allergies or who want to avoid plastics touching their food.Our family does a LOT of camping and picnic lunches at the park on beautiful days so I'm happy that I was able to purchase this lunch box at a slight discount (not free) to test and review.

"My husband has a very thick, scratchy beard that constantly needs oil. He had been using a few other products when I was able to get this oil at a discount for him to try. It's a good quality blend of ORGANIC Argan and Jojoba oil that is silky in your hands but has no additional scent. I really liked that aspect because I can add therapeutic grade essential oils to it for a customized fragrance or select oils that help boost mood, energy and alertness. (The fact that he's applying this to his beard, just under his nose, is a perfect delivery system for oils that should be taken aromatically for alertness and morning energy.)Does it help your beard grow faster?Nurtured, well-moisturized skin and hair follicles will have the nutrients and environment they need to grow as fast as your genetics dictate. However the difference may only be in microns. It seems to me (and I'm no expert) that beard oil helps moisturize and weigh down the wiry hairs, helping to straighten them and that gives the appearance that your beard or mustache is longer or growing more quickly.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQLKZOFHFJUMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0128V0260#wasThisHelpful","RQLKZOFHFJUMB","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was quite impressed with the quality of this set of smoothie straws! First, the stainless straws arrive individually wrapped inside of their packaging. The straws themselves are smooth, shiny and don't have any welding lines or other unsightly blemishes on them. They have been polished to a mirror finish and each one has a small etched Savvy Straw logo. The ends of the straws have also been slightly rounded and smoothed so there is no way to cut your lip.

It's not too big nor too small and it's sturdy - it doesn't bend or distort itself as you try to shove it down the straw.Each straw has some heft to it, implying it is no flimsy stainless steel. They are a hair over 1/4 inch wide inside the opening and while I've seen some massive plastic straws that are wider, these are no slouch and are plenty wide for easy smoothie sipping.

The foot pads are wide enough that you don't slip off and the padded handlebars are great in case you topple to one side and accidentally bonk yourself in the face.

But don't try it, dad - this pogo smashes pretty flat if an adult tries to use it because it's only rated to 80 pounds! (Might handle 90 lbs okay.)

"I'll be honest, I didn't think this product would really work that well. You know how diet pills are. I received a discount on this (not free) to try it out and since I was feeling a tad desperate to get sugar cravings under control, I bought it. I won't lie, the first pill did nothing. Second pill kind of gave me mild heartburn feelings, which I never suffer from. I figured it must be doing something. I took the third pill the next morning, maybe ten minutes before eating breakfast. My stomach growled around 2 pm, reminding me I hadn't yet stopped my projects to eat lunch. Wow. I'm not one to miss meals but I wasn't troubled enough by hunger to pause my work. This caught my attention.Now, this product is not strong enough to stop all hunger signals completely. It's more of a support to healthy eating that may help you cut out snacks or keep you less-than-ravenous so you have time to thoughtfully prepare something nutritious instead of gobbling whatever is readily available.

"I've heard good things about Vitamin C serum but I hadn't tried it yet. I use an essential oil-based facial care system that I felt was doing a good job on my face. I had no idea how this serum would improve my current regimen! It did make the skin on my face softer after only a single use. However, I feel this product deserves rave reviews for what it did for my hands.I wash my hands a LOT and I often get dry skin on my knuckles because of this. In the fall and winter it can get so bad sometimes that my skin forms thin cracks and blood seeps into the crack, giving my hands an ugly and unkempt appearance. It's embarrassing. Lotion doesn't seem to help. I tried slathering the backs of my hands with coconut oil but it didn't do much good either. Antibiotic ointment provided some relief but it was greasy and got on my clothing easily. When I bought this serum, my knuckles were beginning to show signs of cracking so I decided I would try several drops of the serum on the back of both hands to see if it helped. I awoke the next morning to normal looking skin. No whitish dry skin patches on my knuckles. It worked! I washed my hands all day and my skin didn't get worse. I did an experiment and skipped the serum that night and then washed my hands normally the second day, too. Still no dry skin. I resumed using the serum on my hands and noticed the skin had a much better, younger-looking texture than usual. My knuckles are now butter-soft. If this can spare me the pain of cracked and bleeding knuckles this winter, I will be thrilled to have found my cure!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J5615ZBVT45B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012Q4M3DO#wasThisHelpful","R2J5615ZBVT45B","A2114M46F4MO2W","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2114M46F4MO2W?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I wanted some colored duck tape so I could mark a few specific storage boxes and make them easier to find amidst the other cardboard boxes. I didn't really care about the color so I ordered this value pack. I was pleased that I received 6 rolls of the exact color assortment shown! The first roll is a comic strip kind of design with action words which was almost immediately claimed by my 8 year-old. The next is cherries on black gingham. It's cute! The last design is a mystery. My son thinks it looks kind of like stacks of pastel ice cream scoops while I think it looks like a grandmother's floral sweater. ""Daydreamy clouds"" might also be a good description.It's obvious that duck brand is clearing out some old designs at bargain prices.

"I was very pleased with the nice quality and substantial feel of this fire poke! My husband is THAT GUY. The one who pokes, prods and arranges fires to ensure you're getting the best burn. Always fiddling with the fire, poking a stick in it like some kind of pyro-crazy eleven year old on his first boy scout campout. (For real, babe? Just sit back and relax! The fire is fine!)I decided to legitimize his fire-prodding needs by buying him one of these. It is long and quite heavy, which surprised me. I would expect to pay a lot more for such quality. The rod portion has a beautiful twist in the middle of it and the handle has a hand-wrought spiral at the end, giving it an unexpected look of elegance. I've already ordered one for my dad and father-in-law because I know my mom and mother-in-law won't mind having such a handsome yet functional piece of fire pit equipment. (It's also long enough that you could use it to nudge a snake out of the way if one dared come near your fire circle or your patio for that matter.)

"I received a big blow to one eye which resulted in a massive floater that affected my vision severely. I had cloudiness, halos, and dizziness. I purchased these drops, and the clinitas drops with hylauronic acid and started using them a week after injury. Two doctors said I would have to live with the floater.I also started using bilberry as a supplement, and drinking chicken and miso broth which have levels of hylauronic acid in them. This is what the jelly in your eye is made of.Four weeks later my eye is almost perfect. I have a very slight hint of haze that is almost imperceptible.I use the drops four times a day.Also treating my elderly dog with severe cloudiness - it seems to be clearing, but will report back later if it clears her eyes substantially.I think possibly one must attack externally with drops and internally wi supplements etc. This method seemed to work for me. I am just grateful that the giant blob floater is gone, and I don't have to live with the disorienting nausea caused from it.Both of my eye doctors had never heard of these drops, but the medical establishment will not be condoning these.If they were made by a big pharm company and marketed and had to be prescribed, I am sure they would be used more to treat people. My feeling is this - if your eyes are important to you then give these a shot.

This is so fantastic and fun - follow the instructions - do not overfill - go under the fill line by a bit,as when the liquid freezes it will expand upward!The trick to making popsicles that taste ""store bought"" is to add a tiny amount of guar gum whisked in preferably with immersion blender in the liquid. Google guar gum and zoku and you will get the amount to use with liquid. Guar adds mouth feel and makes the popsicle less of an ice cube( as in rock solid) and more of a frozfruit consistency. Also do not underestimate guar gum, a tiny amount goes a long way -it's used for gelling and emulsification in foods!If you like quick treats and noi hassle, get one!Last night I made creamsicles with orange juice, heavy cream, a little sugar and guar gum! Delicious!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7QLEBOKI32Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003U9ZCRO#wasThisHelpful","R2K7QLEBOKI32Q","A1VO2YYQ7IVRR9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1VO2YYQ7IVRR9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The bowl, top and plunger system developed stress fractures and cracks in less than a year of use. the polycoarbonate material they used in manufacturing is brittle.  At the top of the bowl the fractures are such that it has made the use of the processer dangerous as I am afraid that pieces will break off and go into whatever Iam processing.  I called the company and they said that parts would replaced if under a year old. I called just over a year as I had too many other things to do...I don't know if they will replace. I even offered to send the bowl so that they could see what the problem was.  The replacement powls are about $40.00 plus shipping, so I am not happy that this might have to be a yearly thing.

On almost every page there is a text box with commentary that explains or enhances the readings. The use of color and the text boxes breaks up the pages nicely and keeps it interesting.I take a liberal approach to the bible and found nothing I object to in the authors additions. for example one of the boxes in Deuterotomy started with ""Why does God say to kill those who worship other gods? What does this mean today?"" The author answers by explaining some history and then saying that today we look at people of other faiths respectfully and believe God wants us to live together in peace.

"Perhaps I am spoiled by the ""barely touch it and it staples"" stapler at work but it seems this one needs a bit of force to make the staple prongs close and lay flat.  My 10 year old consistently cannot get the prongs to close on her staples unless the stapler is braced on the table. Even several times watching her and giving feedback does not help. It does staple 52 sheets nicely if you press down fast and hard. I tried 60 and the prongs just aren't long enough. This takes special staples and the seem to be thinner than the standard kind of staples.I ordered the black and red model and received  the black and white model twice. Not sure if this is the fault of the company or a glitch in Amazon's Vine order fulfillment department. The black and white one is beautiful and seems very well made.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R17BY4BFBQH03/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RPP0EHW#wasThisHelpful","R17BY4BFBQH03","AXARTAQU05PFL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AXARTAQU05PFL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The doll stays on pretty well except for when it is on an unstable surface. The doll does not always make it up onto the horse without getting stuck.

"I don't know where to start...this is the neatest little vacuum!  I have NEVER had a vac this lightweight. I have had as many vac's as diets I have been on...lol...plenty! First let me say that the company REALLY put a lot of thought into the packaging of this vac...yes, the packaging. I'm a woman of a certain age and its not easy for me to open some boxes and or get things OUT of their box...THIS was a breeze! I sliced the big box that Amazon put it in, there was the Hoover box and some wadded paper. Pulled out the Hoover box, slit the taped top and could see there was folded corrugated cardboard at either side, I thought oh great, it will be anchored to that...it wasn't. I reached in, got a hold of the vac and pulled straight up...it came up with the cardboard pieces falling aside. The cardboard pieces are just cut and placed together like a little jigsaw puzzle, VERY easy to take apart, no glue or tape, and went right into my recycle bin...I appreciated THAT...the rest was easy too...box dealt with!The VAC...oh man, it's SO EASY to use...came with only one (and installed) filter....the handle snapped into place, one screw being needed and provided in a little orange bag. The CORD....LOVE that SOMEONE FINALLY SEES we needed longer cords on vacs!  I have a no name vacthat rhymes with 'Spears' that has a 18 ft. cord, drives me nuts...had another no name vac that rhymes with 'Bison' and it was about a 20 ft cordor so...its gone, but the 'Spears' brand is still here, now in the second position...for when I need to reach up with a tool on a hose for cleaning things up high. That is my ONLY complaint about this Hoover, I KNOW its a commercial, they don't use all the on-board tools in stores, motels, etc. but most women will still want to keep their old vac or get a little vac to use strictly when you need to clean those up over your head spots, like in the kitchen to clean the soffet areas or what I use the attachments for is to vac my many baskets that are all around the house...so tools DO have a use at home for most of us still, but for just plain old vacuuming this little light weight BEAST has my heart...it was so easy to maneuver and the suction was GREAT and the noise level was less than my big older vac.

"My husband has used ViewSonic before, and felt I would be very happy with their larger monitor. I had an old Samsung, that was great when it was new, but its now retired, pixels went bad and that is not good. I hooked this up alone, I unpacked it alone too...found it to be easy right out of the box. AND light weight, I REALLY thought that this being a 24"" screen, that I would need help carrying it, thankfully I was wrong. I plugged it into the comp and into the electricity and was staring at a blank screen. I started to feel all around the frame, front, back and outside diameter...but did not find a power button. I called the company and spoke with a nice gentleman (Blain) who looked up this model and found where the buttons were. They are RIGHT in front...I had to get a flashlight to see them, guess I had not brushed exactly over them, but as soon as I DID it responded and turned on the monitor. I think its nice they are low profile, BUT, they should maybe put a little '3-d dot' or two on the power button...anyway that is where they are located, RIGHT SIDE near the little slash of white right where the bottom and side edges come together. When the monitor is ON that white slash will be blue. Once you find and touch the button you will see it hardly takes ANYTHING to turn it on...or off.  ALSO, Blain had said that if I was running windows 7 or higher, I probably would not need to use the CD that came with it, I was ready to run it, but I did not need to. He said there is lots of good info on the CD so I DO plan on taking time to look at it one day soon. Anyway, it set itself to full screen, the color is good, I really have no complaints about it at all...if that changes I will be back to change the review...but as of now, this looks to be a quality large screen monitor that I believe anyone would enjoy owning.  I DO hope that they come up with that '3-d dot' on the power button or a better ""sketch"" on their quick start guide, as of now that guide shows a finger pointing at a 'start button' and that is it...even if they were to give you a little blurb saying the control buttons are flush, positioned at the far bottom right front corner...something to help us out...especially those of us of a certain age ;-)  I would recommend this monitor to anyone looking for an updated replacement monitor.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XRPZJSDI150B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NSCCU1E#wasThisHelpful","R2XRPZJSDI150B","A1OWRLSD7LTSQ9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1OWRLSD7LTSQ9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It was a nice surprise that I received a 3-pack of these cushions -- I was expecting just one. It came with a red, blue, and yellow tomato cushion, and they're really cute.The cushions are pretty small -- the tomatoes are about 1.5"" in diameter, but I'm petite and have tiny wrists, so it works well for me.  The velcro was adjustable on my wrist with room to spare (I really have skinny wrists). The pin cushion is reinforced by a hard plastic at the bottom of the tomato, so there is no danger of poking myself if I get too excited with pins and needles. It's cheap -- I mean it's a basic pincushion I didn't need it to be ber-fancy, but it doesn't seem like it'll fall apart right away.It would hold a couple dozen pins and needles, which should work fine for what I do (I normally do cross-stitching and basic sewing).

"This is my first vibrator to own ever, so I did a lot of research, and so far this item has gotten a lot of reviews and mostly positive ones, so I decided to get this. I did not regret it.Since it's my first time using one, it took me some time to get used to the general sense of having this machine on my lady parts, but after a couple nights toying around with it while hubby is out, this little thing managed to provide me multiple orgasms, which is not usual for me. I started off with the lower setting, then progressed higher as I familiarized with my body more. Well needless to say, I hardly felt lonely on those nights hubby isn't available LOL.The only thing that makes it 4 out of 5 stars was because it drains the battery very quick. I got in half a dozen uses until the medium setting decreased its power significantly then died after several minutes (that session became really disappointing so I had to finish in a different way).

"Simple to operate, quiet, and easy to refill. The tank is quite huge, and it works well in a small bedroom. The low setting is very low, I hardly see any vapor coming out, so I usually set it to medium. It's very quiet, except for the occasional gurgle. You can turn off the night light - I really have no use for it since I really only need the humidifier part, but it's a nice soft blue. Probably too bright for people who normally sleep with the lights off but it's not too harsh. I am not sure about the ""120-hour claim"" since I don't really need to top off the tank as I only use the humidifier when I sleep, but half a tank does last me throughout a couple 6-hour nights. I can't say much about the ease/frequency of cleaning as I've only used it for a couple weeks. The reservoir is easy to grip -- there is also a handle at the underside so you can carry it upside-down right after refilling it.The only thing I am complaining about is very minor -- the item has a small cleaning brush that is attached to the underside of the reservoir -- well, supposedly. The brush keeps falling off so I just put it along the edge of the lower half of the unit rather than attach it to the reservoir. I don't know if that happens to others and maybe I just got a weird unit, but it's not a big deal to me. Also, when you refill, a few drops are to be expected to splash about so be careful. I'm used to refilling the inverted tank of our cat fountain so I'm used to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RL2MKXVBE2WU4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ENWEJK8#wasThisHelpful","RL2MKXVBE2WU4","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It felt like the black garbage bags if it were made of fabric. Sure, the wrinkles stretch out when you wear it, but the shininess just looked a little bit more costume-y than I expected.

"Out of the 10 seeds I got, only one sprouted. I tried scoring some of them, I tried just soaking some as-is, but the success rate was pretty slim. I soaked the seeds overnight and then planted them as directed, after a few days all but one rotted out (they broke apart and became mushy white stuff on the inside).Hopefully this one survivor actually is worth it. They say it takes quite a long time before you find out if the seeds are of good quality as the flowering period could take several years. Right now the lucky one is a 3-cm little thing and I am crossing my fingers. I've read that this plant can become uncontrollable if not taken care of properly and can destroy property -- so I'm attempting to make it a bonsai plant (potted) and learn.A lot of gardening sites say you'd be better off with a seedling than a seed, and making sure that the seedling came from a reliably flowering tree. I just gave these seeds a shot, they didn't survive me. Plus, they grow faster, obviously, since you don't have to work as much trying to germinate them.The vendor did give me a packet of 7 free giant Russian sunflower seeds together with the wisteria seeds, though. They all sprouted (after soaking), however, my husband mowed over the seedlings *sigh* (maybe I have a gardening curse). One still has leaves while the others are all reduced to tiny stalks.

"I had qualms with this, seeing as there are a few reviews about cats being able to tear their way out of this. But I got it anyway, and did a trial run inside the house. Our cat seemed very curious as to why she was in this tent and head-butted her way around it, but she finally got used to the screen. I played with her a bit inside the tent (I am 5' tall, I fit in sitting down with room to spare), then on the next warm sunny day we took the tent out to our deck.Our cat seemed pretty weirded out initially, since we usually take her out on a harness and leash, so she meowed quite a bit and did the head-butt all around the tent. But I tossed her favorite cardboard box and toys in with her, and gave her some space (definitely still keeping one eye on her). Eventually she sprawled on her belly, watching the birds and bunnies on the backyard. I guess she isn't crazy enough to tear it to pieces (she puts her paws up the tent walls to stretch, but hasn't torn it apart so I guess she's being gentle).Cat likes it, we like it especially when we feel too lazy to ""walk"" her around the yard, so it was actually a great buy. Also, setting up is a cinch, just make sure you tie a knot at the top strings so it doesn't collapse.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNNZ6PLI5DKHF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KWHE1E#wasThisHelpful","RNNZ6PLI5DKHF","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just installed it in our 2007 Sonata SE, to replace the ""universal"" floor mat that we've got that kept on sliding around like crazy because it was much too small for the front floors of the car. According to the specs, this will fit our model of Sonata, and while I'd like to get the tan one to match the carpet, however, since the gray was on sale, I figured it would work.The product seems to be well-made, of rubberized plastic, and installation was a snap. It was flexible yet rigid enough to slip onto the floor, and it seems to be a nice, snug fit -- it was made perfectly for the car! It had enough coverage behind the pedals, there were no worries of snagging at the same time provides more protection. I did not notice any strong odor from the product -- it was mid-winter, but we'll see how it does in the summer.For its price, I think it's worth it.

"These shoes are quite comfortable and look nice. I am normally a size 5M but since they seem narrow at the toes I got two pairs of size 6 -- one nude and one black. I received two pairs of black, so I had to ask the vendor for an exchange, which they have done efficiently and painlessly.I believe these shoes are true to size. With that, the size 6 is an OK size for me, as long as I wear thick winter socks underneath. So I decided to have the vendor ship me a size 5.5 for the nude. The 5.5 actually worked for the regular pair of cotton socks. They do taper a bit at the toes, so this is not good for wide feet, but it worked for my 5M feet with some room to spare.The only parts that need breaking in are the shoelaces and the suede part of the shoe. I say shoelaces because they have this plasticky coating on it that makes it sort of stick out stiffly when you tie them. But I'd say a little exposure to weather elements it'll soften up and look better. The suede part of the shoe does not feel like suede -- more like felt. The shoe is going to be pretty stiff the first time you lace it up, however doing a few squats to get some crease into them softens the fit around your ankles.I only wish they'd design the flap at the top of the shoe (I don't know what you call those, but the flap where the shoelaces criss-cross each other) such that it's UNDER instead of over the side flaps of the shoe. That way you can lace up the shoe tightly or loosely depending on what you're wearing. Also, while I like the sole because it has those little nubs for better traction (why do most sleek boots have little or no traction?), the nubs are coated with some sort of felt, which is just weird, because it's counter-intuitive. It's not too slippery or anything, it's just that you have nice, grippy rubber soles but there's a thin layer of furry stuff coating it. I'm pretty sure it'll rub off with usage, so it's no biggie.Overall, they are still surprisingly comfy for me. It does not have any arch support, but the insole is padded enough for my feet. It's not the best boots I've ever had, however, it's a fair quality for its price.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U1F9H0WAEB3L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008CMK8BO#wasThisHelpful","R1U1F9H0WAEB3L","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got the p12040 model from a home store (they're cheaper there, BTW) to replace the two ionization alarms across the hallway that kept going off when it took longer than usual to pull the pizza out of the oven. Seriously, the ionization alarms are at least 30 feet away from the oven and it still picks up ""invisible combustible particles"". There was no smoke whatsoever.Anyway, it was easy to install this photoelectric alarm. We did not have to change the wiring harness with the existing Kidde alarms that it replaced, just the mounting plates. Easy to test, and while it's not typical of alarms we're used to, the red light blinks every 30-40 seconds to indicate it's on standby. Also, I think you have to press the Test button upon installation or else it will chirp incessantly (I don't know yet if you have to do it every time you replace the batteries. It comes with a dust cover, so you can cover these if you are doing something dusty in the room.I don't want to jinx it, but so far it hasn't caused any false alarms due to burnt out parts. Maybe it's the older models (pe120) that had faulty parts? It hasn't been years yet, but I'm curious as to those people who had the p12040 model for a year or so if they had any similar problems?In case that happens (I really am hoping not), I'll post an update.

"Smoke detectors are recommended to be in hallways outside bedrooms. Sigh.Our hallway outside our bedroom is very ""conveniently"" (hint: NOT) right next to the kitchen, and very close to the gas oven, and we had a ionization/CO alarm that gave us a scare when we first used the oven and called the fire department to confirm if there is any CO leak that we didn't know of when we bought the house. That's when we learned all about ""nuisance alarms"". The alarm from the apartment where we used to live rarely went off while we cook so - yeah, this annoyance was new to us. Given we have about 10 of these hardwired together when one went off and I hate loud noises, I knew the smoke alarm will be my least favorite of all household electronics.We got this to replace the one next to the kitchen -- it was easy to install and test (with earplugs), and so far it did not throw any tantrums during frozen pizza nights like we used to have. I did not have to replace the existing Kidde wiring harness -- just the mounting plate. It integrated well with the variety of Kidde alarms we currently have (we plan to replace the nuisance ones at some point in the future).I also installed this in our basement to replace the ionization type that we have right beside the laundry/furnace room (that also went off when we are using our flat iron). No nuisance so far, although we make sure we don't put steam directly beneath it. Of course, I also got a separate CO alarm for the basement, though, for added protection.4-stars because while I'd rather chuck each one of these out into the dumpster, I have to have these for my own safety. I don't love it. I like it enough because it saves me from having frequent heart attacks.I wish they'd be able to manufacture more alarms that's ear-friendly, not ear-splitting, while being able to alert you with the situation. Or sound out a voice warning a few minutes before it starts beeping like crazy. It's just ironic how you're supposed to ""remain calm"" when these things go off, but I usually feel like joining my kitty under the couch when it starts shrieking.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LX0ZMO40ZGNB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P4YY8K#wasThisHelpful","R2LX0ZMO40ZGNB","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Got this to discipline our kitty after a few attempts of ordering squirt guns/sprayers and failing (our kitty had all the luck). The NERF super-soaker ironically was DOA, and we wanted the trigger-action, not pump action. I tried getting a small spray bottle, but it failed too. So I said -- screw it, I'm going to get a cheap squirt gun, and decided on this, since it's a 12-pack at less than a dollar each. If any one failed we can just toss the defective one and use a new one (hoping the working ones outnumber the duds).The day it was delivered I opened up half a dozen of these and filled them up. Out of those, one ended up leaky at the tip and another had a gaping hole on the barrel. The rest though, held up pretty well. I haven't seen any leaks with the plug so far, but I am extra careful not to lay it plug side down. I kept the others as spare, but so far, it's got a fairly good working percentage. As of this date, a total of 3 died (including the previous 2 I mentioned), the rest filled with water are still sitting around various locations of the house, waiting for kitty mischief.UPDATE: Three more died as of today, most of them due to leaks. The plastic itself is quite brittle, so I'm pretty sure that if you drop it on a hard floor it will just shatter. None of them leaked at the water input plug; most of them leaked around the colored tip of the gun, the trigger area, or the seam where the two plastic pieces are glued together. We are now down to 50% of this pack's original count. The ones that remained so far are still good after quite a bit of squirting (our kitty suddenly lapsed into a bout of craziness the past week or so). Thus the war on naughty kitty continues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QEO60OHQWQJP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0019ICP4Q#wasThisHelpful","R3QEO60OHQWQJP","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit the smoke detector is probably the least favorite of all the home appliances. I have quite a phobia for loud noises, and I grew up from a different country where smoke detectors aren't really a normal fixture in the house. But then, we don't really have gas heating appliances there so there's least risk of CO poisoning. Here, I have to live with it -- for our safety.We replaced the detector that was in the hallway nearest our bedroom (and consequently the kitchen) with a heat detector, because the former ionization detector kept on sounding every time we turn on the gas oven (we learned that gas ovens normally give a burst of CO during startup). So now that detector didn't cause issues. The one by the living room/kitchen area was also causing nuisance alarms, so we replaced the one with a photoelectric alarm. So far so good -- we have been cooking pot roasts and pizza without nasty surprises.Then we got a kitty and placed her on the storage/utility room, so we had to leave the door open for her to come and go to her room as she pleases. Cue frozen pizza dinner. We opened the oven door a few seconds longer than usual to get the pizza out, and the alarms went off. Of course we initially thought the ones nearer the kitchen were causing it, but after trying to hush those to no avail, we figured out the one that triggered was from kitty's room. Which was about 30 feet away from the oven, right at the other side of the house. And it is the i4618 model.The kitchen isn't even by a closed hallway -- it opens up to the living area. My husband was cooking bacon for chili the other night and of course, he opens the oven, and that same alarm starts shrieking. He hushed it and closed the door -- we never heard a peep from it afterwards. Seriously -- how far does this thing have to be from the kitchen before it stops causing us hearing loss for no reason?I understand that photoelectric alarms are better around kitchen areas -- but this room is the farthest away from the kitchen, and it's got a very sensitive trigger. I'm not entirely thrilled with smoke alarms in general, but I realize ionization types are the least of my favorite. They give me and our kitty heart attacks.We have those two rooms at that end of the house, one of them is constantly closed (we plan to use it as a guest room in the future), and they both use the same i4618 detectors (as well as 4 more on other rooms of the house that we keep doors constantly closed). I'm sure if we get to leave these doors open we'll get an unpleasant surprise. We are replacing these on a one-off basis -- I'm paranoid enough to want to replace all of them with nuisance-free models, but hubby would probably prefer to replace them as they start causing us trouble. Technically they ARE working, but I'd really would like to avoid getting so used to these nuisance alarms before I ignore them when they actually alert me of a dangerous situation.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YZ7FOXNL5GH7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001XQ5VHW#wasThisHelpful","R2YZ7FOXNL5GH7","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I got this spray for our very naughty newly-adopted kitten, who we'd like to discipline as early as we can. The ones in the hardware store are just too huge (we don't really need THAT much water to squirt kitty -- and it's too heavy to carry around), and we were using that up until I decided to look for a smaller spray bottle from Amazon.This spray bottle is small, perfect for discreetly spraying the cat whenever she gets too rowdy, without the water being obviously associated with you. The design is cute (I got a dark green nozzle) and it's got a good grip. However, I've tried doing a quick spritzing test, but no matter how much I adjust the nozzle, or tried different rates of squeezing the trigger, it was just too flaky. Sometimes it would give a decent squirt, sometimes it won't. Plus, water constantly dripped from the nozzle. So unfortunately I can't rely on it to squirt when I actually want it to -- it would spoil my hidden glee of seeing kitty's puzzled face after it's been 'chastised'.I was unlucky enough to get a defective product. I'll see if I can return it -- meanwhile, I'll look for water pistols instead.

"Finally found a nice, perfectly-fitted thermal top to layer with! I ordered a Small for my size 0-1 frame, and it wasn't too snug, but it wasn't too loose either. It was better than the HKNB thermal top that I purchased several weeks ago (I have a separate review for that). The fabric of the Cuddl Duds top feels a bit thicker and less stretchy than the HKNB one, and I like the V-neck so its neckline won't be too visible when I decide to layer it with a V-neck sweater.The elbows of this top has little elbow patches, which adds a bit to the style of the top. The sleeves are long enough to accommodate a thumb slot, which is an added plus, because I layer more tops when it gets cold and I always have the problem of sleeves rolling up while slipping on another layer of clothing. There's a small stitched brand logo on the end of the left sleeve, falling right on the top of your hand, but it's not a name (more like a circle with two open parentheses -- ""o))""), and it's lighter colored so it's not too obvious. I initially thought the fabric was going to be too stretchy, warpy and thin (the HKNB thermal was), but it actually is thick enough and not too pajama-looking to wear by itself.I don't know yet if there's going to be shrinkage when I throw it in the washer/dryer, but I think with proper care it should last long.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1BIJCM5UQUAPB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0081FWY50#wasThisHelpful","R1BIJCM5UQUAPB","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I initially ordered the polished steel variety, but it was delayed due to Sandy. The seller, though, suggested the brushed/matte look, and I didn't know they offered this design. Since the brushed design coincidentally goes perfectly with our bathroom's look, I agreed to get it instead of the polished.The towel rack is pretty sturdy, and came in a compact package -- some assembly required. Pretty easy to assemble, though -- I finished it in less than 20 minutes (I think it can be done in less, except my kitty kept on distracting me). The base is very solid, no worries about tipping the towel over, fastened to the vertical metal base with two large screws. The four smaller screws are for the horizontal bars, and they fit sturdily.Overall, it's a very well-made product. The only reason I give it less one star is because the rack is actually somewhat shorter and narrower than I expected. If you fold a plush bath towel (the larger fluffy ones) in half lengthwise, you cannot hang it right on the side prongs of the rack (leaving the vertical bar visible) -- it's too narrow. I ended up having to place the towel over the entire horizontal bar, leaving just enough room for a hand towel. It's really a small towel rack to be used for 2 people. I think this towel rack is made just for one person.I ended up with our bath towels hung one on each of the upper and lower bars, with the hand towels squeezed in beside it, so now the gorgeous rack is now all covered up. If they had made it say four inches wider and taller it would have been perfect for 2 people.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19DK67OATV4SJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003F3QRFQ#wasThisHelpful","R19DK67OATV4SJ","AO9KZ2D5EH0N4","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AO9KZ2D5EH0N4?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Purchased ours at PetSmart -- there seems to be a consistent problem with the way the circuit is connected -- the beam lights up when you screw the cap on in a very particular way. Too tight or too loose, it won't work. Even if you got it to work, after a few presses of the button the laser stops working again.We thought we had a defective product, so we decided to give it a chance, we returned the first and got a second. We thought ""it couldn't possibly have the same issue the second time around"" and opened it up without waiting to get home -- SAME ISSUE. When we returned to the pet store, we avoided this brand and decided to go for the brand hanging next to it. We were contemplating to get a larger, heavy duty-looking one, but we decided what the heck -- let's try out the same ""bullet"" style from a different brand. Needless to say, after getting home and installing the batteries, it worked. It's sort of funny because the KONG pack brags about being ""tested in the USA!"", but the one that didn't say anything was the one that actually worked right out of the box. Not that I think all items labeled ""[insert verb here] in the USA"" is of high quality, because not all items ""made in CHINA"" equates to cheap quality, either. The whole caption just made us chuckle, as obviously we've had horrid luck with KONG.Not that our kitten enjoyed the laser toy, though -- she indignantly ignored it and preferred to be silly with plastic springs.

"I grew up on the Serious Sam games and remember having to ask my dad's permission to play the original. They were always a blast to play, but I never played the HD remasters before now. They are all included on the disc, as well as Serious Sam 3 (and DLC,) as well as DDXL.There isn't much to say about the games that hasn't already been said: For an old-school, hilarious, and challenging first person shooter, look no further. The gameplay is repetitive, sure, and there isn't always a variety of enemies, but bang for buck, it's hard to find a more fun game. The level design is incredibly linear and beginning to show its age, but the secrets and hidden items prove to be rewarding.Co-op is fun if you can find servers. Consider how much of a bargain this collection is: If purchased individually on the Xbox marketplace, this collection would cost you upwards of $40, but for $10, it's hard to find a better deal on such fun games.Altogether, while the game lacks proper narrative and character development, it's okay to set them aside and just have a blast (literally) as wave after wave of enemy come to strike Sam down.

"I am a bit of a late bloomer to this game, having never seen the films, nor playing either Riddick title until now. Lately, i've purchased a few games second-hand to expand my digital palette a bit with some that i've never played. I'd heard about the Riddick games in the past and seen screenshots, but never any actual gameplay. You can pick this up now for under $10, and if you get the opportunity, I strongly recommend it. Coming hot off the heels of a title like Alien Isolation or Dishonored, this game is a fairly smooth transition. I can see where Isolation gets some of its inspiration from.For starters, the game is visually stunning (even the remastered version of Butcher Bay, dating back to the early 2000s) featuring rich environments with plenty of variety, great shadows (a wonderful dynamic, as well) and very nice visual effects. For a title that's around six years old, it certainly packs a punch. You can tell the developers certainly took their time to do this right.The gameplay is very varied, and the transitions from gameplay styles (stealth to action) is fairly seamless. The gunplay seemed to fit just right, and the multi-faceted ways to get out of situations was really cool. Hand to hand combat with improvised weapons seemed silly at times, but when you hook a punch, or perform a disarm successfully, it proves for a rewarding experience. Savepoints and health machines got a bit annoying. Sometimes, the guards seemed like overpowered robots, and other times they seemed like they lacked brains, proving for a dull experience. Thankfully, the Dark Athena campaign features an upgrade on the already great gameplay and graphics. There's a bit of something for everybody in the game to enjoy for hours. The branching sidequests and open-ended gameplay was pretty awesome, certainly unique for a game of its time.Vin Diesel's gravelly voice is a nice addition to the game. His humor and cynicism blends with his wisdom in a way that gels with the player perfectly, providing a bit of relief from the sometimes repetitive sneaking around.This game isn't without its share of glitches, either graphical or physical, but nothing game-breaking. All in all with a bit of patience, this game is easy to enjoy, and proves for a challenge (but Riddick tends to like those.) If you consider yourself a fan of first person action games, this is one you don't want to miss. Truly a hidden gem!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MEO8CBTQVUB6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001L18RIE#wasThisHelpful","R1MEO8CBTQVUB6","A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These strings are great, especially considering the cost.I purchased a pack at the recommendation of my uncle, who services the owner of DR Strings' personal vehicles in New Jersey. I am glad that I did!They're about the same price as D'Addarios strings of the same gauge and they last just as long, but they sound only slightly different once broken in, and that sound would be enough to merit purchasing more strings in the future. These are a bit mellower, but have more mids than your average pack of D'Addarios, in my opinion.I've used a few packs on my guitars at present, trying them all in various tunings and such, and they are consistent in their strength and tone.I'd definitely buy these again, they are cheap, high quality hand-made strings for electric guitar, and they offer great value.I'd really love a multi-pack, though, like D'Addarios does.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT5INW4LRTEVO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AXSFOK#wasThisHelpful","RT5INW4LRTEVO","A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This product works great! Wow, I was truly floored by how well it performed.I applied it to all my guitars. It comes in a convenient spray bottle applicator and while the bottle recommends spraying small dabs onto a microfiber cleaning cloth, I can verify that directly applying The One to your guitar body will produce the same results.For starters, let me just say that Music Nomad has a great business model with their products-- proceeds from their purchases support independent musicians, their bottles are made of PET plastic so it is environmentally conscious, and the formula itself is biodegradable. Nice to know for those of us who try to minimize the footprint they leave behind.Applying the spray is a pleasant experience, which is a plus. For me, I have recently gotten back into the full enjoyment of cleaning and taking care of my guitars, so when cleaning becomes a chore and less of a force of habit or act of respect or love for your instrument, you lose touch. The spritz smells like candy and beads up much like Rain-X would on a car windshield, and you just rub it in the finish and anywhere you want to clean the guitar (though I would avoid the fretboard/strings and instead use their F-ONE Oil and 0000 steel wool for optimal results) and let the cleaner do it's magic.It works great, applies easy, and produces great results. A few guitars I had genuinely not cleaned more than with a rag for a few years now look showroom new apart from hardware, and knowing this polish protects your instrument while cleaning it is great peace of mind.They have a great lineup of products and while this is a bit more than your average bottle of Dunlop 65, you can rest assured knowing full well this product will stand up to the test and live up to the extra dollar amount over your average name brand. I strongly recommend this, as well as Music Nomad's other products, to the guitarist in your life.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK96FJABAL8WR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003TLSN74#wasThisHelpful","RK96FJABAL8WR","A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's odd that at writing I didn't seem to see any reviews for this book-- which is weird, considering it's been out for a few months now. I think that may be in part due to the underground nature of BFI's library. To be fair, I didn't even know these books existed until my film professor at college brought in his copy of the BFI Terminator book to help us get a grip on narrative development.To any readers who are unaware (much like I was until recently,) the British Film Institute publishes neat little paperbacks that analyze popular films of the past few decades under their Modern Classics series, and Alien finally got its turn! In a nutshell, they analyze the film from many different angles-- to its thematic elements, to physical things such as how it was made. These books are well-written and I hope some of the other, older ones I ordered (Blade Runner and The Thing) stack up as well.It has some nice pictures and concept art from a multitude of Ridley Scott films, not just Alien, which was a nice touch-- this book considers all aspects of a film production and how it holds up in a modern age with fresh eyes and ears. Ridley is a sci-fi master, from his eponymous Alien, to the cult classic Blade Runner, and to his much-debated epic, Prometheus, his work will be talked about for the decades to come, even as Alien nears its 40th anniversary.While it certainly doesn't bring forth much new trivia or tidbits of pictures, it does allow the reader to get a better creative grasp on Ridley Scott's sci-fi masterpiece and offers some great inspiration for the budding writer or director. The avid fan of xenomorphs and Space Jockeys will almost certainly have unearthed most of the information and pictures contained in this book, but for the price, the Alien addition to the BFI library of publications is a great resource, whether to fans of sci-fi cinema, film majors, or just fans of Alien in general.The cover painting by Marta Lech is a masterpiece as well-- it's not been since Giger's original ""Big Chap"" that the world has seen such a ghostly, perfect organism. Her rendering of the Alien serves as a great keystone to complement the aesthetic and design of both the original creature itself, as well as that of the film.All in all, this is a well-written, gem of a book totally (in my opinion) worth it's sticker price, and makes for a nice addition to the collection of an Alien fan, or a sci-fi fan in general.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J98LIWWE6FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1844577880#wasThisHelpful","R2J98LIWWE6FM","A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great, high quality knobs with an abalone dome. These look great on my Jackson SDX and complement the white/black color scheme on the guitar nicely.The knobs only took a few minutes to install and came with all included tools. They fit snug and turn smoothly.The only thing I really could complain about is the price-- essentially, $10 per knob seems cheap but adorning a Strat-style guitar with 2-3 knobs can get costly, almost $50 with shipping. While I will say these are professional-grade knobs and certainly worth the money, I just wish it wasn't so expensive to order them. All in all these are worthy of the 5 stars I gave them!Definitely recommend to any guitarists looking to spruce up their look.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REFL0LFPU3RD3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047D31FM#wasThisHelpful","REFL0LFPU3RD3","A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I purchased this because I am directing a short film this semester, and our main character's (a gritty cop a la Dirty Harry) part called for a large revolver.Being in college and not of legal age to purchase an actual handgun in my state, much less afford a handcannon of a magnum, this Crosman Vigilante made for a nice compromise. It's sturdy, well made, and durable. To the untrained eye, this looks exactly like a real gun, which is what we were going for during filming. It looks so real that I would not suggest brandishing this in public, and only using it in private or on private property only for the sake of public safety (but anybody who has fired any firearm should at least know that, BB gun or not.)The revolver has a great weight to it, it looks and feels real. It's pretty beefy, at that, as I accidentally dropped this (unloaded) against a desk during a shoot and it had only left marks on the desk, not the gun itself. The trigger and hammer pull are both very comfortable and the tactical rail was a nice addition, as our crew attached lights to the rail. The safety works as it should and the user need not worry about it.While I have yet to physically shoot this gun loaded, I have noticed several other reviewers mentioned concerns about its accuracy-- That I physically cannot speak for as neither I nor any of the cast and crew have shot this, we just used it as a prop.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB29S7TP4R9FM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HEC9IKA#wasThisHelpful","RB29S7TP4R9FM","A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3HT0JHJ6JS6AW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Update:  Finally was able to use this mower to do my front yard.  The #1 good thing about this mower is it is SO MUCH EASIER to push than it's predecessor, the one that looks exactly like it, but is not self-propelled.  It was FAR, FAR easier to cut the front yard with this new mower.  I'd say it got done almost twice as fast too.  Now for some of the problems I ran into.  First, I wondered why it was bogging down.  It was because Mulch was ""on"" by default.  Once I turned that off, then it ran like a champ, not even slowing down when mowing up hill in 6"" grass, with the self-propulsion turned on.  Next issue, it was set to cut at 2"" and that was too low for me, so I reset that to 3"", which is easy as pie.  The next problem was the rubber stop guard on the back.  I assume it's there to protect a rock from being thrown at your ankles and breaking your leg.  Well, when you pull the mower back, the guard folds under the mower... this makes the mower hard to pull back, and when you are ready to go forward, there is resistance as the stop guard now has to come back to the original position.  Effectively, it's like it's trying to raise the mower off the ground, a little.  As long as you can keep going forward, this is not a problem.  And, of course, when you engage the self-propulsion, it overcomes the rubber pretty easily.  I finally figured out how to see the battery charge.  On this mower, there is a button by the fake lights that when you push it, it will tell you which of the three cells still have power.  After doing the entire front yard, it was on the last cell, so it was nearly empty.  There is absolutely no way this mower could do both my front and back yards on one full charge.  I don't know the exact measurements of my yard, but it's about 75' from the house to the curb, and about 120' wide.  However only about 1/2 of this area is grass.  I have a very large driveway that is up to 3 car widths wide at one point, and then there is a stand of trees on one side, so no grass over there, a side walk, more plant areas, etc..  If I had to estimate my grass area, I'd say it is about 60' x 90' equivalent.  That gives you a rough idea of what the batteries can handle, using the self-propulsion most of the time, no mulching.  (note: when mulch was turned on, the mower darn near stopped in 6""+ grass)Original review:It was easy to ""put together"", as all that was required was a socket wrench to put the two bolts through the bottom of the handle, screw them in, and then set the adjustment height on the upper handle.  All easy as pie.  Now, I already have the predecessor of this model, the one that looks exactly like it, but is NOT self-propelled.  Amazingly, the battery charger is 100% identical with the older model, right down to the same model and part numbers on it.  That works out well because effectively, I now have a spare charger.  :-)  I charged it up... at least it appears I charged it up, because the lights on the battery do NOT show it is charging.  I let it sit on charge for 24 hours, and there was no change.  I'm assuming it was shipped with a fully charged battery.  I put in the orange circuit completer and made sure everything works.  The mower turns on, spins the blade, so good there.  I then tested the forward self propulsion, and yup, that works too.  Tried it at higher speed, and I could tell immediately that I won't likely be using that speed as it's faster than I can go.  (sucks being old)  I have NOT cut the yard yet because it doesn't need it.  After  I do the first cut, I'll likely add to this review.The reason I got this is because the hill in my front yard is just too difficult for me to push the mower up hill very easily.  I can get it done, but run out of energy pretty fast.... that is ""I"" run out of energy, not the mower.  So this should be interesting to see if the self-propulsion does the trick.  The nice thing about having two almost identical mowers is that I only need for this one to do the front yard, and then I can pull the FOB out and put it into the older mower to do the back yard, which is flat.  Effectively, I have double the capacity, and will never have to worry about battery life.My only ""complaint"" is that the mower wasn't scheduled to be delivered until Aug 5th, but the sucker came VERY early on July 23rd.  Super, expect I wasn't looking for it and UPS delivered to my garage door, and did not take the time to walk 15' to the front door and knock/ring the doorbell.  Usually, they are VERY good about doing that.  Only an alert neighbor came over and knocked on my door, as they were concerned that somebody might come by and steal it, as it had been sitting outside for several hours.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFYDR4P04FEM9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JMZH3A#wasThisHelpful","RFYDR4P04FEM9","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've used nothing but electric mowers for the last 7 years.  Because I'm not inclined to sharpen my own blades, I'd rather have spares available should the old blade get damaged or become worn on the edge.  After I've replaced a couple of blades, I can take those old blades to Ace Hardware and have them ""professionally sharpened"" by somebody who knows what they are doing.My first electric mower still works, but I gave it away to a family member as I wanted a bigger mower.  I bought a used Black and Decker mower but it did not have powered wheels.  I liked the newer mower because it was wider than my old electric, but it was also a LOT harder to push because it weighs more.  Being old, I wanted a new Black and Decker that has powered wheels.

"Some people complain that these ""washers"" are plastic, and should be made of metal so they don't fail when your blade hits an immovable object.I feel the opposite.

"Update:  I had purchased TWO hoses (but Amazon only lets you write one review, even the the products are different sizes.  My other hose was 25' and I finally went to use it yesterday, only to find out that the washer in it too, was defective.  I had to replace it, just like the 10' hose, with a Gilmour Rubber Hose Washer.  Now it also works perfectly.  Just wanted people to know that it appears the washers that are installed on these hoses apparently have issues.Original review:I probably should have made it a 4 star rating, because I immediately had to pull out their hose washer as it was defective.  It LOOKED okay, but it leaked horribly.  Fortunately, I also purchased the 10 pack of Gilmour Rubber Hose Washers.  I put in the new Gilmore rubber washer and bingo, it now doesn't leak even a drop.The reason I give the hose a 5 star review is simply because it doesn't stink, doesn't have lead in it, and therefore is FAR superior to MOST of the hoses sadly being sold in this country.  There is absolutely NO EXCUSE for lead to be allowed in hoses.  (it's added to stabilize the cheap plastic)  Lead will poison the soil the water is sprayed on.  This should be against the law nationwide.  Yet another failure of bad government regulations, or the lack of them!Interestingly, I noticed that water pressure appears to be higher using only a 10' hose.  I can reach the far side of my lawn from the top of the yard now.  With my old 25' hose, I was about 5' short of the bottom.  (and yes, the old hose was the same size hose, diameter wise, but I suppose the real reason it could not squirt as far was all the kinks.  :-)","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1TZ4N8B5B69DA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004RNOVTM#wasThisHelpful","R1TZ4N8B5B69DA","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The ONLY reason I bought this product was because of the unique slightly curved handle.  Because of this shape, you can have a hook on the side of your sink cabinet, over the wastebasket, and after you clean your toilet, you face the ""belly"" of the curve towards the cabinet, which forces the brush to hang about 2"" from the wall, in ""open air"" and dripping contaminated water into your plastic bagged refuse waste basket.  In this way, there is no need for a (you know it will get disgusting) brush container sitting on the floor.  When you empty your trash, you automatically throw out the contamination with the plastic bag.  No muss, no fuss.  And no icky container thing sitting on the floor taking space and looking cluttered, as well as distasteful.It used to be that this shape was common, but more expensive to make.

"Update:  A couple of days ago, I was breaking down cardboard boxes for the recycling bin, and lo, I found the attachment screws in the very bottom of the box, buried under plastic sheeting.  So, my review below was incorrect.  They were there and they now are installed and that is SO much better as these make the seat tight as can be.  The generic attachment screws had the seat sliding all over the place.  It was already a 5 star product before, and now it's an even better 5 star product!While I love this seat, as the construction is top-notch, I was surprised that there were no attachment screws for the two hinges to attach to the toilette.  Considering that almost every brand of seat has their own design when it comes to the hinge design and cover over the hinge design, I expected they be automatically included.  I had a couple of sets of screws, but we had to use our dremel tool to grind them down to fit the unique hinge insides.  As a result, installation took about 20-30 minutes to get it right.  Some of these screw sets lock from the bottom, and some from the top (but never both ways, as far as I know).  I had to use a set that came from a 20 year old toilette seat that was scrapped a few years ago.  Being pack rats, we always save the hardware.

"When I heard the news that the folks that determined what is the correct dosage for daily intake of Vitamin D3 was TOTALLY incorrect, due to the Statisticians that made an error in the study and nobody caught it, I immediately had to order a larger dose than I have been taking.  It also explains why my daily intake of 2,000 units was only keeping by blood level of Vitamin D just barely over the lowest needed levels for good health.  This, in combination with my age and size, told me that I probably should be taking 10,000 units per day.  However, to err on the side of caution, I elected to go with 5,000.  The next time I see my doctor, I will have a blood test again for this to see what the effect is, then decide if I should increase it again.It's very interesting how much Vitamin D3 has changed my life.  All of my life, I usually got 3-6 colds per year, as well as the flu every few years (I do not get flu shots).  I've now been taking Vitamin D3 for roughly six years, and have NOT GOTTEN even ONE cold or the flu in all that time.  Wow.If you live north of say, the northern border of Georgia, you are probably Vitamin D deficient.  Rarely do people in the northern half of the USA get enough sunlight even in the summertime, to have the recommended blood levels of Vitamin D.  When you do get it from the Sun, it is only stored in the body for a few short months (perhaps 3 or so?) before you run low.  Isn't it interesting that people in the northern states usually don't get colds in the summertime (always are exceptions of course), but get them very frequently about 3 months after summer is over?  And when does the Flu Season run rampant?  Why, yes... starts in November and runs through the Winter.  Coincidence?  I don't think so.

"Skyrim, in my opinion, is the best game ever made.  It is easy to play, yet hard to conquer and it is HUGE.  You can easily play it for hundreds of hours, which makes it a great deal, especially at this price.  Now originally, I bought the standard edition when it first came out.  I always wanted the three add-on's for this game, but didn't want to pay the additional price.

That was a bargain, and I could not resist.Installation was simple as can be.  This is a Steam Powered supported game.  If you have the original standard edition installed, you do not even have to put in the CD/DVD that comes with this box.

"I was a tad worried, based on reviews of other ""replacement products"" for Sears refrigerator filters that this might not be as good as the Sears ""official"" filter product.  Fortunately, it worked absolutely perfectly, and I have no complaints at all.  I cannot tell one iota any difference between this and the original version.

"Okay, I tried two different ink pens for writing on the tabs.  Neither worked at all, even though they both worked just fine on regular paper.  One ink pen was regular ink like has been used in ball point pens (Paper Mate, etc.) for years.  The other ink was gel, and I expected that would not work, and it was lousier than the regular ink.  But neither wrote legibly.  I had to resort to a magic marker pen to get the job done.  I doubt that will erase very easily, but who knows.The quality of the plastic paper is actually quite good.  It's as thin as regular paper and is attractive too.

"The color is as bright as it looks.  I wanted this color to make it easy to spot when laying in a mess of folders, and I am in a hurry.I like the durability of the folders.  They will still be ""walking the earth"" long past their intended usage.  That said, I got these because when I've used the paper folders, they work but can be damaged way too easily.  This folder will out live the fasteners within, most likely.  It, of course, depends upon how often I unbend them and adjust the contents.The main thing I don't like about plastic folders is that they don't stack well.  They are so slippery, they are best stored standing on edge.  If you put even a couple that have fairly full contents, they likely will slide apart all by themselves, perhaps even urged by the pull of the moon as it circles the earth.  (humor attempt intended, but perhaps closer to reality)Because of this slipperiness, the pockets are less usable.  For example, I put 54 pages into the center posts (which is about maximum, by the way), and when I slid 4 pages into the front pocket, laid it on the table, the pages in the pocket started sliding out all by themselves.  I then moved them to the back pocket, which worked better because the weight of the documents in the center, held them in place.  Somebody should try to figure out a way to make plastic folders that are not so slippery.  One solution is to put a rubber band around the entire folder, one up and down, and another left and right.  This would keep material from sliding out.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSZB5BR44QWHB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C2MBK08#wasThisHelpful","RSZB5BR44QWHB","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is exactly what I wanted.  Having read some of the other reviews, I generally agree with some of the more important points.  Yes, on about 10 sheets is all you want to punch at once.  In fact, I think the sweet spot is about 7 for ease of one hand punching.  I won't address the adjust ability of the hole areas, as I had no intention of adjusting them now, and probably, never.  It's nice to know they can be adjusted however.  I punched about 250 sheets today, and had no problems at all.  Some mentioned that the cover that captures the punch chips could come undone unexpectedly.  It appears to be solid to me.  Some complained that the holes were too close to the edge.  They seemed fine to me.  Considering that the results had to fit into a folder with tabular posts (you know, the kind that the metal slide through the hole of the paper, then eventually into a reinforcement piece of the folder, then bent down to hold everything in place), had the holes been more to the right, it's possible the reading material would have been covered by the center of the folder when opening it.  So for my use, they are perfectly placed.One thing I noticed that probably most people who use things like this probably already knows.  When you slide in the paper for punching, there is about 1/16th or so of ""play"" in the paper.  That is, you can slide the paper slight up to the top or slightly down to the bottom.  I found that sliding to the bottom appears to be the best thing to do, as this matched up perfectly with prepunched dividers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34J7RZWJJU5R2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0006HUPHU#wasThisHelpful","R34J7RZWJJU5R2","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It seems like I'm always having a hard time finding a stapler when I need it, even though I know generally where it should be.  I think that's because of my other two staplers, one is beige and the other battleship gray.  That makes them harder to spot with clutter around them.  This one, being so bright, it shows up like a spotlight in a subdued room.  These days, using LED lighting throughout the house, often there is slightly less light than with the old incandescent bulbs.  Now I'm not complaining about the difference in the lighting, only pointing out that it sometimes makes stuff harder to see, as the LED light tends to be more directional.

"I bought this along with some of the competing Highland brand.  I tried both, and they each have their own special values.  The Highland is thinner regarding thickness.

The Scotch is thicker, so that's why there is 296"" less per roll.But the clincher for making this purchase was the free tape dispenser with the tape.

"First, the good stuff... (1) It works; (2) the light it makes when it goes off is bright enough to light a darkened stairwell; (3) the swivel of the light ""ball"" within the base is nice (but stiff - hard to move it); the design of how the part you would screw to the wall is pretty cool and innovative; (4) when it senses motion and turns on, and the motion totally stops, the light stays on for about 10-14 seconds, which is really nice to save battery power.The stuff that could be better... (1) the sensor is awfully sensitive... it will turn on the light if it detects movement when the area lighting is subdued, but easily navigable; (2) it truly needs an on-off switch - because of light sensor being too sensitive; (3) with the batteries in it, it is pretty heavy; (4) I would be afraid to try to swivel the ball if this light were mounted on the wall because it takes so much pressure, it just might rip the mounting plate from the wall... especially if it's screwed into plaster.What I wanted this for was to light my inside stairwell when the house is dark.  Because the sensor is too sensitive to low light, that is, it ""thinks"" it's dark out, if I mount it where I wanted, the batteries would need to be replaced all too soon, I think.  This is why I wish it had a simple slide switch where I could turn it on after dark.I do have a back up plan in case this doesn't ""do the trick"".  My door into the garage, which is windowless and therefore dark even in the daytime, I can mount this inside the garage, by the door, so that when somebody comes through the door, it will come on automatically.

"that was working generally fine, but on some software, the cursor was jumpy, hard to position accurately, and the software ran very slow.  I installed this new GeForce GT 610, and it worked marvelously.  It was a breeze to install both physically and software wise.  It even automatically went to the nVidia web site to get the latest drivers.  Everything installed just fine, and then I ran the software that was having the problem.  Now, there is no problem.  The cursor doesn't jump all over the place, the images process quickly and it's like the entire system is now faster.  Strangely, it feels like it even boots a little faster.  If I had to guess, this nVidia card is at least 2 to 3 times faster than the nVidia product that was installed on the motherboard.  (which was a GeForce 6100)Now I get an appreciation why laptops are the turtles of the computing world as most of those have their video on the motherboard too.  The memory on the GT 610 is 4 times more than that on the motherboard (plus the motherboard was using system memory on a sharing basis, which is why the system even boots up faster, I think).  The processor on the GT 610 is at least 3x faster than the 6100 per benchmarks I looked at.  Now some of that is lost because my motherboard is PCI Express 1.0 and the GT 610 is PCI Express 2.0... however the video card is totally compatible with 1.0, but some performance is lost due to that.Regardless, this video card was a perfect solution for my problem.

"The music is appropriate, the acting is absolutely excellent, and the intrigue is in depth, and true to Roman Society, as I understood it to be from the History classes I took oh so long ago,The treachery and debauchery are mind boggling.  I can see why the Barbarians eventually sacked Rome and finished off the decadent empire as it came to be under the Emperors.  It's also interesting how they started with the concept of a Republic, copied to some extent from the Ancient Greeks that preceded them, having a Senate, but not understanding the Athenian Greek concept of the public right of the people to determine direction of government.  Rather, they adopted the semblance of that aspect by having a Senate, which in fact, the people's will had nothing to do with electing Senators, as that was all controlled by the Aristocracy.  Those with money were the only ones that could become Senators.  (sound familiar?)But that was as far as they went with Athenian ideals... a.k.a. lip service.  The real government was more like Sparta's form.  Brutal, with fear keeping people in line.  The Roman excelled at that!Anyway, I diverge... the series is good, and I highly recommend watching it.

"First, the smell everybody talks about.  It is very smelly when you open it.  As suggested, I took off the cover, and then let it set in a large open room to ""air out"".  The instructions say ""a couple of days"".  I let it set a week, flipping it a couple of times over that period.  It still smelled some, but was much improved over day 1 and 2.I then put the cover back on, and set it up on my bed.  I found it to be comfortable, and the right height for me.  Some people said in their reviews they had problems with their arms getting uncomfortable because they would slide off the sides as it's somewhat narrow.  I did not have that problem, even though I am a hefty person.  Some also said that they had problems sliding down it in the middle of the night, thus making their back hurt in the morning.  I did not have this problem.  I think, for me, I know the reason why.  My mattress is a Temper-Pedic.  Because it's so firm, I simply do not slide at all.  I used to use a Select Comfort, but I bet that would be an issue as with air mattresses in general, if you apply too much weight in one area, you hit bottom.  So I would bet I would slide on one of those.Now as for quality of sleep.  For me, I find I can sleep about 4 hours on it and then I have to set it aside and finish up my sleep flat, as I am a side sleeper.  While I could sleep on my left side, anyway, on this wedge, I suspect I might pay for it later, as I think that could stress areas in the spine that should not be stressed.  It seemed comfortable to lay that way, on my left side, for perhaps 10 minutes, but I would prefer not to take a chance on that.The good side is that while I am sleeping with the wedge, I no longer snore, and I don't have to wake up to go to the can, which is interesting.  (snoring is usually co-existent with sleep apnea, which I have... the body will trigger a false bathroom call signal if you are not getting enough oxygen... when I'm laying flat, I get woke up with this trigger signal every 2 hours... with the wedge, I have yet to wake up with that signal occurring for as much as 5 hours.  And, when I do wake up, I don't actually have to go at all.  I just have the desire to lay flat, so I can side sleep, ergo, 1/2 the night with the wedge, 1/2the night without it.)About the only downside I have experienced is that because the wedge is made pretty much like my mattress, it does get warm if you stay in the same spot for a long time, as in 4-5 hours.  This is part of the reason I set it aside for the rest of the night, as my back says to me, ""I'm hot.  Give me air.""  At the same time, the upside is I have ZERO back pain from using the wedge.  I always have some back pain from sleeping flat.  (but NO WHERE near as much back pain as I had with inner spring mattresses or water beds!  A side note... the Select Comfort also gave me no back pain, but strangely, I got knee pain... remember, I said I am a side sleeper... that combined with my size, caused my body to sink into the Select Comfort mattress just far enough that my knee that is towards the mattress gets hyper-extended sidewise, and that HURTS!  This was the ONLY reason I switched to the current mattress.)","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12Q4F3TSIXS1D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HHLBKK#wasThisHelpful","R12Q4F3TSIXS1D","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"See my long-winded review on Ghiradelli and you'll see more information on my obsessions with dark chocolate.I have tried other brands that are available, and for example, I like the Black and Green, but it is more expensive, and frankly, why pay more for something that is about the same quality as Lindt.  There are even more expensive brands, but why bother.  None of them taste significantly better, and some actually taste not quite as good.  There is one German brands that are pretty good and very inexpensive, available at Aldy Grocery stores, if you should happen to have one of those available in your area.  It is called Moser Roth.  (there is an umlaut over the letter ""o""... it looks like two small dots, in case you don't know what that is)  I do not know how to make an umlaut on the computer easily, so I describe it instead.  Anyway, the Moser Roth is pretty good, it's 85% dark chocolate and melts faster than the Lindt, but not as fast as the Ghiradelli.  The flavor is similar, but recognizably different.  The downside of the Moser Roth is that it often has bits of congealed harder chocolate in it (at least, I hope it's chocolate).  As a result, I usually get the Lindt and Ghiradelli instead.

But I noticed the price has been pretty high at some of these places, especially the ""real"" grocery stores.  So I thought, ""what the heck... get it from Amazon!"".  And, I'm happy that I did, simply because with these 12 bar packs I won't have to scrounge the stores for ""the slightly cheaper pricing"".So, my general comments.  First of all, I usually prefer the 90% Lindt bars because though they are somewhat bitter, they take longer to melt in your mouth, so it makes the experience more heavenly.  Now some people don't like that much bitterness and I saw a number of folks be unhappy about that.  My experience is if you are really trying hard to avoid ALL SUGARS, or as much as possible, by not drinking soda, juice, cool-aid and/or eating sweet candy bars, etc. that your tongue gets REALLY sensitive to LACK of sugar, and then, then you are ready for the experience of Lindt 90%.  (my dietary efforts are to approach living with the ""Caveman"" or Paleo, diet, as much as possible.  Yes, ANY dark chocolate is NOT on the ""approved list"" for Paleo.  It however is my one and only exception, and makes BEING on Paleo MUCH more tolerable.  (a man has GOT to have at least ONE vice, right?)Anyway, back to Ghiradelli dark chocolate in particular.  (wow... I am long winded)  Anyway, it is creamier than Lindt 85% and, of course, 90%.  It also melts faster, but because it does so, the flavor is outstanding!  I really do love it.  (but I alternate with the Lindt, ""just because"" of loyalty to the fact that their chocolate melts more slowly and they also have the 90% too.)","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AMMTY1A5SVG1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G0MG2I#wasThisHelpful","R1AMMTY1A5SVG1","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"And that goes back probably 20 years or more.  It is our favorite taco seasoning.  Alas it is getting harder and harder to find it in the grocery stores.  I suppose it's all the competition, and limited shelf space.  Out of the 4 grocers that we usually visit on a regular basis, only one has OCCASIONALLY had it.  And, we had not been able to find it for 3 or 4 weeks now!  Desperate, a light flashed in front of my beady eyes, and it they glowed with the letters, A-m-a-z-o-n.  Whoopee!

"Because I already knew the device needed to be updated, I ran a hard wire to it so that would go quickly, and it did.  A few minutes later, and it was working super!  It is pretty simple to find a TV series to watch that is available on Prime, and movies that are available on Prime.  I watched both for a few hours and never had a single glitch.My only actual complaints are two.  One is that the pictures it shows of the various selections of entertainment are in rather poor quality.  That is, they are blurry and I often had to get up and walk closer to the movie cover being illustrated on my 59"" HDTV so that I could read it.  It appears these are recorded in the lowest quality pictures of MOST, but not ALL, covers, so it appears to be more a fault with the provider of the movie cover not using a high quality bitmap.  Two, the first TV series I watched was Season 1 of Vikings.  I finished it, and that is an awesome series by the way, but, the picture was rather washed out.  Considering that the content is available in Hi-def, it's a shame that Amazon could not include the Hi-def version with Prime, instead of the ""made for tube TV version"".I should point out that I also got to play with a Roku-2 last week (a friend brought it over), and I have to say that the Fire is most definitely faster and easier to use than the Roku-2.  I hear that there is content available on the Ruku-2 that is not available on the Fire, but I don't care about that, because I'm only really interested in Prime movies and TV content.The only thing that prevented me from making this a 5 star rating is that a fair amount of the Prime content is not Hi-def.  I know I could pay for the Hi-def version, but my cable bill is already too high and my ""better half"" prefers to watch TV on cable.  So to save the money, I will take what I get, regardless of the definition.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AYVD9UM1TQND/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CX5P8FC#wasThisHelpful","R3AYVD9UM1TQND","AOHNLSWSOLK8N","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AOHNLSWSOLK8N?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Robert Berdella was born in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio in 1949. His father worked as a die setter for the Ford Motor Company and his mother was a stay at home mom. He did well at school, although teachers found him difficult to teach. He was also bullied by the other students. He was severely nearsighted and had to wear thick glasses from the age of 5. When he was 7 years old his brother, Daniel, was born. Bardella's life took a dive for the worse at the age of 16; first, his father died of a heart attack aged 39. Shortly afterwards his mother remarried, much to Robert's resentment and anger. Around the same time he claimed that he was sexually assaulted by a coworker.What I found most chilling was the fact that he saw a 1965 adaptation of the John Fowles book The Collector, which is about a man who abducts a young woman and holds her captive in his basement; he later stated that it had made a lasting impression on him. Of all the serial killers I've read about, Berdella has to be one of the sickest individuals I have ever come across. It's bad enough that some people murder, but to torture their victims for weeks beforehand takes things to a whole different level.

"This collection of paranormal essays and short fiction was a fast paced and very interesting read. The authors insightful, intelligent and sometimes witty commentary does not require intense concentration or endless analysis to get the gist of what he is trying to say.

I have not found a single generic brand capsule that comes close to the Nespresso brand capsules, and the Nespresso help-line person said the off-brands can actually break the machine--the pressure involved in making such a good cup requires a precise calibration so that the capsule yields appropriately (which makes sense to me).and which brings me to my issue: the machine I got was a ""factory-recondition""-- that did not draw water out of the reservoir. The Nespresso help line person said Amazon sellers often sell malfunctioning machines, which are not covered by the Nespresso warranty--and since I was a previous owner of a Nespresso machine, I got a discount that made a brand new, under-warranty model the same price as the defective one I sent back.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVF8KMNFGPJ0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KMSLHDY#wasThisHelpful","RVF8KMNFGPJ0U","A2KUUIJ52MWDAS","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2KUUIJ52MWDAS?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These are causal pants, not dressy twills. The fabric is fairly lightweight, and prone to looking a bit wrinkly. There is obvious topstitching in matching thread and rivets, so these are more like dressy jeans or casual pants. The fabric is evenly dyed--it is solid, not like a lot of black denims--more of a poplin, but with a very fine twill weave. They fit, as all pants nowadays seem to, one size up--the waist measures 38 inches on a 36. They are flatteringly cut for a middle-aged man with more gut than butt.

The waist actually measures 40 inches, not 38, but I have found that vanity sizing has struck men's clothes now, too, so that is to be expected.

"This is better than the Braun cordless it replaced. It holds a charge for at least 30 minutes and did not need to be recharged for a whole two week vacation! It cuts a lot closer than my Braun.It isn't quite as close as a Gillette Mach how ever many, but it also doesn't require shaving cream---a big plus when traveling. It also doesn't require ridiculously over-priced blades! You have to be extra careful not to miss whiskers, because once they get a bit longer, it is even less likely that you will cut them. It works very quickly in dry environments, not so much so in extra humid ones like here in SC this summer.It took just a bit of doing to figure out how get the pop-up trimmer to work, but it is excellent for trimming all those longer hairs on places other than your cheeks--ahem!

"This is book 1.5 in the series but really does stand completely alone as a novella, and is centered around Christmas time so is a good novella for reading right now.Andrew is on the Aces hockey team.  I can't actually recall him at all in book 1, but that one was full of a ton of nicknames, more than one per player, so I likely missed him.  His family had a tragedy, and from age 16 onward he lived with his best friend's family.  That family also had a younger daughter, Jenna (2 years younger than Andrew and his best friend).  Both felt drawn to the other, but the dynamics of him living with the family meant they could not be together.  Andrew had already lost one family, and he was not doing anything that might mess up the new family he had.  That was the theme of the entire novella, fighting against the fear that if he dated Jenna he could lose his new family.The writing was good but the plot got a bit old, even given the short length.  There was nothing really other than Andrew's fear/insecurity.  There were a few humorous moments, and I liked those, the family banter.  It had some steam.  It wasn't very memorable overall though so 3 stars, and I'll still continue the series, hoping for a full-length and more memorable one next!My thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for an advanced copy to read and provide an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R233CMW6WWTRYB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZNE45JA#wasThisHelpful","R233CMW6WWTRYB","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a new adult book, hero in law school (early 20s) and heroine 21ish.  The heroine's brother has been in prison just over 5 years now, convicted of killing his girlfriend in a particularly brutal manner.  His sister, Cora, has spent the entire time attempting to free him, convinced of his innocence.  She is, in fact, correct.  She uses every bit of her time on that as everyone else has abandoned him, and she feels she is the only person he has left.Leo, the hero, is working in his father's PI agency for the summer.  Cora arrives with her case on the hopes the agency will take it as they do one case a year to assist in possibly freeing innocents in prison.  Leo's father has already done his case for the year, but Leo surprisingly jumps to volunteer to help Cora.  At first, honestly, his reasons are far from altruistic.  He is attracted to her.  Thankfully, he finds some depth to his personality as the story goes on and changes for the better, at the same time persuading her to open herself to having a bit of a life outside of freeing her brother.This is a romantic suspense at the new adult level in a realistic (pretty much) way.  They followed leads and had some excitement while getting to know each other.  I really enjoyed both the mystery and the romance of this one, finding it pretty balanced.  The characters were both both mature in an age-appropriate manner if that makes sense.  For a new writer, that is quite an accomplishment.  I was able to buy into the story here easily.  The side commentary of a family falling apart of tragedy and others judging Cora based on her family struck hard and were a great addition.This was a new author to me, but I will definitely be looking for more of her work in the future.My thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for an advanced copy of this book to review and provide an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VQTXU52L121O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TWEMHFG#wasThisHelpful","R1VQTXU52L121O","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Trevor is just under 30 and the last remaining Moonshine clan Coleman single. He is not exactly searching for a partner but finds one nonetheless when Becky moves into ""the rental"" next door to his piece of land. She moves into the rundown house on the land, and he sees her out on the roof attempting to fix a leak herself. He then goes into ""good neighbor"" mode and uses that to attempt to get to know her as she is decidedly wary of him. We find out slowly her story (heartbreaking), how she ended up in Rocky Mountain and why she is indeed so wary of Trevor and people in general.I give this one a solid 5 stars. I have read the entire series (note this stands alone pretty well), and some stories have really stuck in my mind while others were forgotten pretty quickly. This is a strong one for sure for me. What I love about this series is the writer shows a pretty wide range in ability to write heroes. She writes some strong alphas and some more beta types. The range of their issues/problems varies as well. Trevor is more towards the beta but no wimp. He is hilarious at times with some memorable comments include being a ""sparkly unicorn."" Who can resist a hero who calls himself a sparkly unicorn to make his heroine smile? He shows himself over and over to do whatever it takes to help her heal and find happiness, even if it makes him a little uncomfortable to do it (thinking of a funny discussion with his cousin Travis here!).This book gives a HEA for the couple, but I enjoyed that it wasn't everything wrapped up with a bow and tied with nothing left hanging. They still had some issues to work out as a couple, but the romance part was solid and they were committed to fixing them and found a workaround rather than letting that sink them as a couple. That is true romance - working it out. Also, their familial issues saw little forward progress at all, but both of these characters did not just throw up their hands and shut the door on the relationship but rather showed compassion, insight and true caring. They left the door open to reconciliation down the line. Most of this series involves the entire family, and that makes this book and series special.Again, I just loved this one and I know this particular couple will stick in my mind like a few of the others. I do highly recommend this series.

"Rating 3.5 to 4 starsThis is a quick (less than 200 pages) story from the Entangled Brazen line, meaning steamy. Chloe is a restaurant/bar owner who is allergic to commitment (good change as usually it is the hero), and her hero is a Search and Rescue member, Gage, who happens through her town a few times a year for the Search and Rescue there. Each time through for two years running now they hook up for a weekend, then he is gone again. And they both are happy with that arrangement, until Gage isn't. Now, he is out for more from Chloe, but in the process he has to overcome her fears and face his own issues. The story is quite decent, and the steam factor is good.

"Wicked Ride (prior book) was good, I thought, but suffered from the plague if being the first book in a paranormal series.  Nearly every single paranormal series I have read has shown the first book to be the one I like the least.  It just seems the author has to work so hard to set up the world for the series, including the rules since it is paranormal, that it suffers either in the characterization or the reader is just lost.Here we get a book 2.  The world is set up already in book 1, and we have met all the characters in book 1 or the prior vampire series.  (Note here I would highly recommend you do indeed read book 1 of this series before 2, but the vamp series is just connected not required.)  As the setup is complete, this book and the action just exploded right from the very first chapter and never lets up.  Our heroine, Cee Cee, is far from a wimp despite her challenges.  Those who live strong females should like her.  She had brains, beauty and a solid plan.  Our hero, Coven 9 Enforcer, Daire, sometimes is left steps behind and racing to catch his fast-moving heroine.  Good for her as he needed his orderly life shaken up some.That drug-themed plot from book 1 unfolds some here but still is nowhere near resolved.  A couple evil guys are exposed and/or defeated but again the plot thickens and continues.  This is the main reason I say read book 1 first.  And of course I can't wait for the next book.  Love, love this author and series.  She writes complex, richly detailed plots and doesn't skimp on the romance while doing so.  Each secondary character of course is interesting enough to deserve his/her own novel so I'm sure I'll be tuning in for a while to come.My thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for an advanced copy of this book to read and provide an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RAULBR4VZHCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00URQETIG#wasThisHelpful","RAULBR4VZHCN","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 3 to 3.5 starsThis is a spin-off from one of this author's other series, but you absolutely don't need to have read the other series. In book 3 of the other series, Once Pure, we had the story of Sofie and Killian. Killian there had 5 brothers and a sister. Here, we have the story of one of Killian's brothers, a cop named Curran. We incidentally meet most of the rest of his family too, and all look like great stories!Anyway, here Curran has had a bad break professionally that is messing with his mind. In his recovery, he has light duty basically and is assigned to guard Tess, currently a law student assigned to his brother. Tess and his brother (Declan) are preparing for a very high profile case against a crime boss and hence have police protection. The first time Curran and Tess meet they realize they had a one-night stand in college. Whoops! The plot though made for a pretty good story.Where I had a problem was the relationship between Tess and her father. She was abused, and she is still very much under his thumb at the age of 24. Given she is in her last months of law school and apparently otherwise a strong person, I just plain had trouble believing it to the degree that was presented in the book. I would hope anyone strong enough to graduate at the top of her law class and protect the rights of others would be able to avoid being a victim herself, at least to the degree here. Her father came very close to being a cartoon villain, and that lost some of my enjoyment of reading this book. The plot involving the case they were trying and Curran's situation at work though was very well crafted and believable, so it redeemed the plot some. I'll definitely look into the next books in this series as I have enjoyed this author a lot in prior series.My thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for an advanced copy of this book to read and provide an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CE6BLFOFQTC3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TCI48WW#wasThisHelpful","R1CE6BLFOFQTC3","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating 3 to 3.5This is a book 3 of the series but can stand alone. The first two books are a duo, but this one is a friend of the hero of the first. Jake Tanner is the owner of Tanner Security. He is hired to provide protection to Natalie, a writer of books and a popular game. She is suffering from very severe agoraphobia, unable to leave her apartment, but still is being tormented by notes and gifts meant to scare her. Her cousin, Oliver, comes to Jake to find out who is doing this. Jake himself is a veteran, having amputations of his left arm and leg, but does not let that hamper his abilities.An extremely unlikely romance developed between Jake and Natalie, in fact so unlikely I had trouble buying into it, but this is a romance so there we go. They did in fact begin it by texts and such given her phobia, but that was the most believable part in fact. Even more unbelievable was the final result of why she was being tormented and why, and that was the reason for the low star score. That was just ridiculous in my mind honestly, but I can't tell you why and ruin it for you. Suffice to stay I'm disappointed in that and hoped I was wrong throughout and there was a twist I didn't see coming. There wasn't.I like Jen Frederick's writing though despite this disappointing turn in the plot. I'll continue to read her works, though this is far from my favorite.

"This author and series is really a favorite of mine, so I was very happy to receive an ARC of this book via Netgalley to read and provide an honest review.Here we have Lilliana and Alec. Lilliana inherited the family home, and she is working on turning it into a bed and breakfast. We got to see her and her house briefly in a prior book. Recall the hair incident? LOL Anyway, Alec is a contractor, inspector and the quarterback coach for the high school football team with the prior two heroes. Here I have to divert and say that while the three books so far in the series all involve the three football coaches, they can indeed be read as standalone without issues. There is not really a strong plot line that runs through all three books, though there are indeed a few small threads in the secondary (younger) characters.Alec and Liliana had a one-night stand in college, but the kicker is that he doesn't remember it at all, having been drunk and a manwhore at the time. He has changed, and can't really figure out why she hates him so much. Well, he treated her badly but can't recall it. In this installment, they obviously get past the past and see if they can have something in the present, letting go of the past in many aspects.So, what did I like so much about this book (and series)? It is low-key and the writing is just plain good. There is little to no angst, but I don't find the books boring at all. They are in a small town, with small town issues, people, gossip and caring. Real people in a real setting in other words. This could reasonably happen. We have some catty and flawed family, some good friends and some that aren't so good, some flaws in our hero and heroine, maybe one or both behaved badly in the past and now is better. I found this an engaging yet relaxed and low-key read. Loved it and eagerly await the next book by this wonderful","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21QHVLUBBRHUO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122U5A82#wasThisHelpful","R21QHVLUBBRHUO","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My overall rating is a 4 but that is an average of the two included in there.The first part, the story of Ronin and Lorraine, was only really a 3 for me.  That was the biggest part, and I just didn't honestly feel that one.  Despite the climax of the whole SoCal storyline, it felt really flat and bland to me.  Ronin and Lorraine are back together after 25 years, and they too just felt bland.  I don't know why and may very well have a very different opinion than the majority on this one.The last part though, pertaining to Bart and his family, I would give 5 stars for sure.  It was a ""side trip"" type of tale and I loved it though it was very sad in parts.So this book as an entirety, about two different couples, averaged 4.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HR7BLYGHDVPH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DZ4T5C#wasThisHelpful","R1HR7BLYGHDVPH","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Here we have Jack and Isabelle, werewolves. Isabelle is a painter. Her first art she believes created a divide between her and her father. In one last effort to cross it before he passes on, she is buying up all her paintings to show him, hopefully to gain his blessing on her art. Jack holds a piece she wants for her collection. Jack is over 300 years old, past the age a werewolf can live without his Luminary, his fated mate. It turns out, Isabelle is his mate, but she refuses to mate with him, not believing at first, and then not willing without her father's permission, something he will never give because of the family Jack was born into. That sets up the conflict in this story.I just can't give it more than 3 stars despite the fact it was indeed written decently. What are the morals of this story? You let your fated mate, one you have come to love, die to preserve a relationship with your father, who has no direct knowledge of Jack at all, but rather a prejudice against him just because his family is bad. True love in fact doesn't win out, and that is just that. I had little respect for Isabelle, to let someone die because of prejudice. She had zero spine or integrity, and her entire clan or family, the people she was giving up everything for, appeared to treat others horribly. Just not the book for me in other words.My thanks to the publisher for providing an advanced copy of this book via Netgalley for an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRM7L5YVE6589/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0122RZM4W#wasThisHelpful","RRM7L5YVE6589","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lucy and Pietro are both from mafia families. Pietro's parents are killed in a gripping first few pages of the book, and he goes to live with Lucy's father and Lucy, Pietro age 15 and Lucy 13ish. The book then picks up 8 years later. He loves her, and she him, but both feel it is impossible. Lucy is a dancer, and gets a chance to go to New York for a shot at ballet, and Pietro is tasked by her father to protect her. It is a great setup for a book but falls far short.This book is over 200 pages long and nothing really happens. We learn a little bit about a mystery of the death of Pietro's parents, but nothing really significant. Their relationship in the book feels shallow. There is nothing but mystery really, and then we find out it is a cliffhanger. So, from my point of view as a reader, this is basically being dragged out in multiple books instead of tightening up the plot and giving us an entire story in one book. This is a huge pet peeve for me given the explosion of this style of writing, and I'm just burned out on it. This could have been one interesting story and instead is a rather slow-moving and dull introduction part of a story.The writing? Not bad at all. I would read another by this author provided it was not a cliffhanger. I'm just plain done with that setup.For those interested, it is mafia but the gory and the crazy is really at a minimum for the setup, definitely nothing to freak out a reader of this genre at all. The characters are pretty typical new adult characters aside from the mafia component (age 21 and 23 through the majority of the story).My thanks to the publisher for providing me a copy of this book to read and formulate an honest review.","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JW79WIOC7W34/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1J5KK#wasThisHelpful","R2JW79WIOC7W34","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first of a new series, new adult age characters, 20 and about 23 or 24. Sean is a mechanic and racecar driver on the weekends. He is the ex-boyfriend of Hannah's older sister. Hannah comes back to town after her parents are in a fatal accident to take care of final things. He has been away at college, having not come home for the past 5 years after the death of her sister. Sean and Hannah run into each other, but there are a whole lot of secrets and issues standing between them.I loved how this author duo didn't sugarcoat the issues without making them melodramatic. Everything that happened was 100% believable and tragic. There was no over the top craziness that made a reader roll eyes, but the aftermath was long-reaching nonetheless. The author portrayed that, and the resulting healing wasn't wrapped up with a tidy little bow either. Questions were left never to be answered. That is life when someone dies. There are often questions left behind, pains, things never said or understood. I love that the authors accepted that truth in life. So, as a reader, I got the HEA I have to have in my romances with enough realism to get immersed in the story and think some deeper thoughts. This was truly a 5-star read for me, and I will definitely be looking for the rest of the series. This was definitely new adult done right.My thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for the advanced copy to read and review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B0HWSK8Y1L06/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0141KJL1S#wasThisHelpful","R1B0HWSK8Y1L06","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating:  3.5 stars, rounded up to 4This is the first of a new paranormal series, wolf shifters.  Bailey is a white wolf, and the story opens with her being pressured to mate with someone she detests.  She flees, and in doing so finds herself with Ryker, who happens to be her true mate, something she was not even aware of existing.  This opens the entire new world this author has created of wolves, royal bloodlines, witches, protectors and many conspiracies to power and twists in the plot.  Among all this, Bailey and Ryker have to try to have a romance going on aside from the true mates thing.My rating of 3.5 may seem a bit low, but that is honestly because it read a little bit stilted at times, not flowing all that well.  To give this author/series credit though, first books in a paranormal series are often the worst of the series.  The author not only has to set up a romance between the main characters and introduce all the secondary characters like a typical romance would, but in addition has to create an entire world where the laws of physics are a bit different.  That is quite a feat to perform without boring the reader, taking too much away from the main romance or getting so darned complicated that again the reader is lost.  Often after the first book the world exists and the reader is familiar with it, so the flow evens out.  Hence, 3.5 stars, and a great story and interesting new world with many similarities to other shifter stories but enough of a unique spin from this author's imagination that I would definitely read more of the series.My thanks to the publisher for an advanced copy of this book to read and formulate an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHVIXVVJQM4OD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1515398749#wasThisHelpful","RHVIXVVJQM4OD","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This reads like most of Lora Leigh's books in terms of language, the alpha hero (heroes in this case) and the virginal female.  We have Alyssa, who honestly I felt was a rather lackluster female in this case, seemingly pretty naive and useless the majority of the book.  I'm not even sure what she did for a job she eventually started, social director for her parents?  In any case, she is 18 at the opening of the book.  A little unusual in this, there are some time lapses and eight years pass before the end of the book.The heroes, again like typical Leigh heroes, are Sebastian and Shane, cousins, age 24 at the start of the book.  They share women.  They are also CIA, wealthy, etc., etc.  There is a slight paranormal-ish element in this one (the entire series?) wherein they ""soul bond"" to their one true love, who happens to be Alyssa.  They all fall for each other in Spain during a romantic summer, but things go bad due to villains apparently after money.  This part was not as clear at all, with several players involved and twists.  I do grant Lora Leigh does twists and turns quite well, a little over the top, but complex nonetheless.  As also per usual, we see characters from several of the other books, and there are some past hookups and affairs making it seem almost like each character has slept with every other secondary character and the lead males.  That can get a bit confusing, but Leigh sprung a little bit of a twist with the heroine and her past relationships also, which I liked.  Again Leigh typical, characters sometimes appear to hate each other and others love each other with cynical and cryptic banter at various times.  I usually do like this about her books, but I have to be in the mood for one of her selections.  For those wondering, the BDSM-ish elements are very low in this one, and it is a permanent menage.I did enjoy this book, and probably would have enjoyed it even slightly more had I not missed several of this series in the middle.  A bit plus for series of course is seeing past couples in other books, and that wasn't there as much for me on this one.  It also had a very very large secondary cast that left me a bit confused at times, something that would not happen to a reader of each book in the series, so enjoyment would be higher for that person.  For those who love Lora Leigh, this book is consistently written per her other works, but really lost the stars for me on the extremely weak female lead.  I'm going back to some of those in the series I missed though and catching up though I think.  I had forgotten about this series and am glad to go back to those as well as look ahead to what is apparently the next book given the glimpse we see in this one for Summer, who will apparently be a much much stronger heroine.  I like that so look forward to that one.My thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for an advanced copy of this book to read and formulate an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SJVL0WVP5JMB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0312576250#wasThisHelpful","R1SJVL0WVP5JMB","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started reading Carrie Ann Ryan's paranormal romances back with the Redwood Pack, and I read them all. They were good, but honestly the Talon Pack series in my opinion is so far much better than even those. Perhaps just experience of the writer or the elaborate world she already created, but the Talon Pack series is much richer in dynamics, emotion, ties.Here we have Finn, the Heir to the Redwoods (son of Kade and Melanie from the Redwood series), now grown and taking on some Heir to the Pack duties, including interacting with the Talon pack, allies to the Redwoods. In this world, the wolves have been outed to society at large, and it is not smooth at all. Bryan, daughter of the leading family of the Talon pack, is partnered with Finn to be the face of the packs to the humans. They go out into society and show them wolves are not the monsters they are portrayed at times. However, this is not easy for Brynn at all. Her wolf knows Finn is her mate, but he seems to either not realize it or just have it not be reciprocally true for him, a mistake of Fate. Brynn is unable to bear telling him and facing that rejection, so she hides her pain. Finn cannot figure out why she dislikes him so much.This book centers around the ongoing storyline of the outing of the packs and the danger that brings to them. There are some frightening encounters in this book along those lines. The romantic struggle centers around why Fate has seemingly brought only half of the couple to the mating, what that means and if it is possible to rectify that and how. We get to see lots of secondary characters from both packs in this one, always fun. Some future storylines are hinted at. I loved the balance of romance and action/suspense in this one, finding it quite well done. I can't wait for more of the Talons series. This was definitely a 4 star read.My thanks to the author for an advanced copy of this book to read and formulate an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EFG60HPQO3NF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWSJ7WY#wasThisHelpful","R1EFG60HPQO3NF","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Brad, Todd and Scarlett were friends from freshman year of high school. Brad always felt drawn to Scarlett, but Todd claimed ""dibs"" and went on to date her all through school and marry her. A decade later, Todd has died while an active duty SEAL. Before his last mission, he tasked Brad with taking care of Scarlett and their young daughter should anything happen to him. Brad agrees, and thus begins this book. We seem them briefly at the funeral, and then 2 years later, when Brad convinces her to move to their home town. By then, she is tentatively ready for a relationship, though they start as friends. This is a friends to lovers and a second chance romance kind of rolled into one. Brad was also a SEAL in the past and now works for the fire department. He has always cared for Scarlett, and now is his chance if he can get past his survivor's guilt.This romance is very sweet, the hero very ready for marriage and family. He is cautious and makes sure at every point that he is building something he hopes will last. I loved their friendship to relationship story. I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as the last one in the series for whatever reason, but I definitely did like it. This series is loosely grouped together by all the men being part of a public servants calendar, but the separate couples are not close friends so you definitely don't need to have read earlier books to enjoy this one. There is just a cameo from the prior two couples.

"First off, I love this series.  I missed book 2, but books 1 and 3 I loved.  Unfortunately, this one didn't quite reach that level of like for me.  What the author always does though is provide a professionally written tale with lots of depth and issues.Violet and Cain grew up together with their military families, along with Jeremy.  It turns out both boys fell for Violet, but she eventually became engaged to Jeremy, who died on active duty.  Cain and Jeremy were best friends.  Because of the situation, Cain feels he can never be with Violet as she was his best friend's fiance.  This is the huge conflict throughout the entire story, and here is where it lost stars.  I really do get that he felt that way, but the book was this drawn out saga of him drawing her closer and then hurting her by leaving her again and again and again.  It was just crazy and got a bit dull after a while.  That is not to say I didn't like both characters a lot.  Also awesome was getting to see all the secondary characters, couples from prior books, supporting and friends with this couple.  There were also some truly funny moments and some incredibly sweet ones.  This author is very talented.The last portion of the book we got a good grovel from our hero, and he really put in some serious work to resolve his issues in a reasonable way.  I liked to see that, and it gave credibility to a lasting happily ever after.  The epilogue was sweet, and we got a taste of the next book in the series.  I will definitely continue with this series, but this just wasn't my favorite.My thanks to the publisher for an advanced copy of this book via Netgalley to read and provide an honest review.","3.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRQQDZ50FETIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00QE1J5M8#wasThisHelpful","RRQQDZ50FETIS","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the second in a series, but I read it as a standalone, and my first book by this author. It appears to read just fine as a standalone. The background seems to be given adequately. The first book was centered around friends of this couple.Here, we have Ben and Devin. Both are new college graduates on their way to New York, Ben for a job opportunity afforded to him in the prior book, and Devin to live with her best friend and find work. At the opening, they met and have known each other for roughly 6 months, but Devin during this time has resisted Ben's attempts to start a relationship other than simply friendship. She comes from a bad background and is fearful. Both of them have some issues to work out regarding family, on both sides interfering with their ability to relate to each other. They just begin to settle into a tentative relationship when something very big happens to throw another wrench into the plan.While I admire the author for the plot she constructed, something I need to leave out basically to avoid spoilers, I just found this book too crazy in the drama category for my tastes. It was nonstop drama, drama and more drama of the teenage/new adult variety, and some really really crazy stuff. The writing was good, but it just wasn't for me despite Ben being an awesomely mature hero here. I would consider a different book by this author because she comes into this genre with a fresher plot line and writing for sure.

"Estelle comes to New York to apartment sit while her brother goes to a conference. Unfortunately, she hates the city, missing her quiet home in the suburbs with greenery around her.

Crosby feels bad about the disaster but intrigued by Estelle.

The story itself is very simple and typical for a romance. What I loved about it was the humor, the bantering between the couple as well as with their siblings/family.

"Rowan and Seth fell in love as teens. Then one night a tragedy occurred, and Seth is sent to prison for something he didn't do. He pushes her away, and blames her for 7 years for what happened to him.Seth comes home to their town when his grandmother dies. He also indicates he wants Rowan back, realizing that she is not at fault for what happened. This is there I had a problem with the story. Rowen during the 7 years has cared for his grandmother, managed his grandmother's auto shop, stayed in her home and generally made sure everything was running smoothly as he stayed away. He comes in and states it is his house and shop (true), and threatens to fire her, etc. This is a guy who wants her back? Huh? She makes mistakes too, but is so afraid of opening up and getting left behind again. So what does he do? He threatens to leave her and does multiple times, knowing that is her fear. This book was just crazy for me to attempt to read. The writing was really not bad, the characters more than one sided, and the secondary characters great. However, this guy just couldn't seem to make up his mind at all and the wild yanking back and forth just didn't do it for me at all. It is my very personal pet peeve but I don't want the tension/conflict in a book to be a hero who can't make up his mind how he is going to treat his heroine. Therefore, this gets 3 stars from me because of plot and plot only despite good writing and characters.There will be further books. I think the next is Piper and Jase. Based on this book, it should be good, but will watch and see how that plays out.

"This is the third in a series, but can stand alone if you haven't read the prior ones. Each book is a separate couple, and there is limited series-wide story arc going on. The entire series centers around a group of friends who happen to make up a couple different crime families in New York. This story is Maksim, who came from Russia with his Pakhan (the father of the heroine from book 1). He works for his Pakhan and owns a nightclub. The heroine is the owner of a nearby nightclub, Sydney. We met her briefly in book 2, when she was able to assist that couple. In book 2, Maksim was interested in her but she was resistant to his charms. In this book, we get to see why she as so resistant, what happened in her past and what now is risking her future. She is in trouble, and Maksim and his friends are in the perfect position to assist her. Maks has the most tortured past of the heroes so far, truly awful, but in this book he is actually a toned down version of what we saw in prior books funny enough. I kind of miss how outrageous he was in those first two, but he makes a good hero in this one.I liked book 1, book 2 not so much, and I really loved this one. Books 1 and 2 were remarkably similar to each other, but this one breaks out of the mold with different tone. I love that. It feels as though the author's voice is strengthening with experience. Her characters are more unique and rounded. There is still action in this one, some gruesome as fitting of a crime family book. She doesn't take it overboard or out of the scope of what would be expected in this genre.Maks and Sydney are a good fit for each other. We also get to see some progression of a series wide plot involving Gabriel and his brother (missing after book 1), Aleks and his lost love (I think they are the next book?), Lore and another in their group, a cameo of Nika's brother and his motorcycle club, etc. So, while books 1 and 2 aren't critical, it makes this one even more fun. I can't wait for the next in the series!My thanks to the publisher/Netgalley for an advanced copy of this book to read and provide an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VBJPC4FBV707/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SX9CTXQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VBJPC4FBV707","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was 3.5 to 4 stars for me.I loved the first one, and enjoyed this one as well, though I had a hard time getting into the story at first. I picked it up and put it down a few times before it really grabbed me. Logan is Darcy's cousin from book one, and he is a chef with his own restaurant in Falcon, the small town featured in this series. Logan also helps coach the town's high school football team. Jessica is sent by a corporation owned by her father to entice Logan again from Falcon to come to one of their own restaurants. Logan turned them down before, so now Jessica is sent by her domineering father to Falcon to confront him in person and get him to sign on with their company in whatever way she can. Well, when they meet there is confusion, some funny moments and attraction. Eventually, their getting to know each other will change the course of both their futures. Jessica especially undergoes a change, both through her relationship with Logan but also with the other characters of the small town. This is a story of her really thinking about what it is she wants out of life. As with the first book, all the secondary characters, and the town itself are funny, enjoyable and relaxing. This is a laid-back read suitable to the small town setting of the story. Once I finally got past the first bit it kept me reading for sure. I will definitely be continuing with this series and this author. She writes small towns very very well.My thanks to the publisher/Netgalley for an advance copy of this book to read and provide an honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUYRRV9ZRQLW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SEQKHLY#wasThisHelpful","R2IUYRRV9ZRQLW","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating:  4 fluffy, happy starsThis is a novella, available alone and in the Alphas After Dark anthology.  Jim and Lillie meet in Vegas and decide to have a fling.  Both are bear shifters, and they don't talk much about themselves, pasts, etc.  There is a bit of mystery, especially surrounding Lillie.  It all works out happy as can be in the end.

"Rating:  4.5 stars rounded up to 5!This is my first book by this author, but definitely won't be my last.  The book opens 12 years in the past, and we see a little vignette that is very important to Xander, the hero, then again years later with another very pivotal moment in his life.  The book then picks up 3 years after that.  Xander is a gym owner in Australia.  He fought pro for a while and then, after a traumatic event, went back to his hometown to open a gym and train other fighters and students.  Eden was on the cusp of a modeling career when she suffered burn scars that wiped out her career, and her self-confidence.  Years later, she is still struggling with coping with the transformation of her image.This book is about the relationship between Xander and Eden, their ability to bring out the best in each other as well as challenge each other to fight personal demons and insecurities.  The series title actually comes from that, oni apparently being demons ... thus ""demon fighters.""  Their romance is sweet and hot, but there is a lot more to this book that gave it extra stars.  Both fought hard with trauma in their pasts and displayed remarkable maturity and strength.  The secondary characters were interesting.  There were some ""bad guys"" that gave us some drama, but nothing over the top.  I loved the whole story.  It was long, and dragged the tiniest bit in a couple places as the exposition got long and drawn out, but the story was too awesome to let that slow it down too much.  The whole thing was emotional and inspirational, something that sticks in the memory.We are given hints of what is going on with a secondary character, Dane, but apparently the next in the series in his book.  That too sounds like it will be a great story.My thanks to the publisher and Netgalley for the complimentary copy of this book to read and formulate an honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KAYRJO5OKTI9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010K7B5E2#wasThisHelpful","R1KAYRJO5OKTI9","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We got this tie for my 13yo son.  He needs to wear it 3 evenings per month.  We bought it in January, and at this point I have had to hand sew most of the stitching that keeps the folds of the tie closed on the back, and had to reattach the tag on the back that also serves to tuck in the back part of the tie when knotted.  We don't wash this thankfully, so the stitching coming out appears to come from just typical wear, albeit with a teenage boy (let's face it that they are hard on clothing in general).  My husband's more expensive ties have not had these problems at all over years and years of wear.  So my recommendation is that this tie looks fine and is very suitable for occasional use, or more heavy use if you are willing to hand stitch things in place as needed.  It is not the more durable menswear item I have found, but the price was right for our needs.  If you are considering this for very heavy use (uniform for work or such), you might want to pick a different brand/tie.  If you need it once or very occasionally, the black one looks and functions fine.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1G8OPX37T37H4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BHY3VJ0#wasThisHelpful","R1G8OPX37T37H4","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was a hard one to rate.  I debated hard between 3 and 4 stars, but it's uniqueness pushed it to four.Dylan is from book 1 of the series, from the love triangle sort of there.  He is back from the mental facility after treating his bipolar disorder and working.  Along comes Emma, a new hire at the furniture factory.  And he falls for her but is terrified given his past situation with Jess, his illness, and the slew of problems surrounding Emma in addition to her being a coworker.This book suffered from a meandering storyline with some crazy inclusions of mobsters and exes and whatever thrown on in.  It differed a lot from book 1 in that sense.  But I liked the story of Dylan and Emma, and I liked how his mental illness was handled, factually and honestly, with admission that it was going to frankly be a life-long management process with no cure.  I love that in this book, and that Emma was realistic and accepting of his strengths and his weaknesses.  Good for them for creating a strong base for their relationship.I could have done without that weird mobster plot.  I do believe though that Cooper from this book is the next hero, so that sounds like a lot of fun to read.  I like this author with her unique voice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q8D2J3PDOEEP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JD02UUQ#wasThisHelpful","R3Q8D2J3PDOEEP","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Rating: 3 to 3.5 starsThis is the second Serena Bell novel I have read, I think. She has a very straightforward writing style that is interesting and engrossing. Here, we have Kincaid, who is just out of prison for a violent crime, but which occurred while he was attempting to protect another. I personally as a reader have serious doubts what was described would have given him a sentence that harsh, but I'm not a lawyer so who knows. In any case, we have him just out of prison. Lily is a chef, currently working as a waitress and living with her sister after undergoing not only a breakup with her boyfriend but losing him as a mentor and thus losing her job prospects. They meet as he comes into the diner to eat.The story is actually pretty simple, them overcoming past insecurities and issues to find their way forward together. There is light BDSM in the story, attempting to be integrated but it felt a bit forced despite being a big part of the storyline funny enough, with Lily and her ex and now with Kincaid. There was a light element of mystery/suspense that flowed well in the story, though the resolution was pretty obvious.Overall, a good but not outstanding book in my opinion. It was a good light read with some serious elements but not overly heavy or taxing to read. I would definitely read more by this author.My thanks to the publisher for providing a complimentary early copy of this book via Netgalley for review purposes.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KYGOXHDQWU9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OEXM6VU#wasThisHelpful","R2KYGOXHDQWU9Z","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I loved this - 5 stars for me - but it was SAD.Here we have Cam and Trix, children of the heroes/heroines of the prior round of characters in this series.  They have known each other since they were children, but that doesn't make their romance easy.  In fact, it makes it harder as there is an age gap (6 years I think).  That means Cam matures faster, and is a prospect and then a member/brother before Trix is out of her teens ... with her dad (Dragon) being Cam's MC brother, as well her grandfather (Poet).  That is a hard setup, on top of the emotions of the couple.  This book doesn't span the years of Poet's book or anything, but we do see them over some years.  I liked them as a couple despite some immature and cruel moments on the parts of both of them.  Nicole Jacquelyn writes very human and rounded characters, complete with crummy decisions, immaturity and personality characteristics that aren't terribly desirable.The outside influences in this one are very mild and really kind of weak in terms of the threat to the club.  I never quite got the full story there, but maybe the details went flying past my head or something.  It was a little bit bizarre honestly but whatever.  There was some outside danger/threat to the club as a whole.  It was not part of the prior story arcs.The minor spoiler-ish part of this is that there is tragedy, in that there is death aside from the bad guys.  I'll leave it there.  As a reader, I hate when it happens, especially in romance.  But then again I find myself admiring those authors for daring to completely anger their readers by including it.  If the writer feels it is necessary for some reason, I usually sniffle my way through it.  Not my favorite plot though, I'll admit, and this one was especially sad.  I still was very engrossed in the book and loved the storytelling.At the end, there is a preview of the next book - Will's book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/ROUZSIM0L7NVY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1514798808#wasThisHelpful","ROUZSIM0L7NVY","A36LJXA4FLLXR3","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A36LJXA4FLLXR3?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Fisher-Price Bright Beats 3-in-1 Bright Pod comes with two pods in a set.  The age range of 3 months to 36 months seems pretty true, since this toy was a hit in our house, both with the 5 month old and the 2 1/2 year old.Mode 1: Tummy time made fun! My 5 month old grandson loved these for his tummy time sessions.  He held his head up and kicked like crazy to try and reach them the entire time.  The beat pods light up and play music: one plays music and the other plays a drum beat, the colors change and the music is fun for the baby and not annoying for the parent.  He was cooing and interacting the entire time.Mode 2:  This is for babies/toddlers that are sitting up. When you hit/touch one pod, the drum beat goes off and the other goes on; it was fun to play with them with our 2 1/2 year old.  The lights go on and off on both pods during this mode.  The pods also have little rattles on them; one more thing to get the child's attention.Mode 3: This is for crawling/walking toddlers.  I set the pods across the room and my granddaughter would run back and forth touching them.  Once you touch the pod playing music, it stops and the other one starts.  She loved this game.  Again the music was upbeat and fun.  We also tried turning off the lights in her room and had a little light and dance party, tapping the pods and watching the lights go off and dancing to the music.  It was really very fun.  She could easily carry them around; although the bottom of the pod is large and round, the neck is thin enough for little hands to grasp/carry comfortably.These pods are fun, interactive toys for baby and toddler.  I can see getting a lot of use out of them and definitely recommend them.Note: Each pod requires 3 AA batteries which were not included.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SL46BUN7O20M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014KEEF66#wasThisHelpful","R2SL46BUN7O20M","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Serta Perfect Balance Organic Crib Mattress provides good quality protection.  The top is a quilted, soft material and the underside is totally waterproof (even for a two year old who had an accident when she napped, there was no leaking through to the mattress); there is elastic to keep it safely around the mattress.  I tried this on both a standard crib mattress and a foam crib mattress.  On the standard mattress it is a good, snug fit.  I like that the sides of it are very fine material, which does not impede the airflow from the crib mattress vents. Because the foam mattress is a little thinner than a standard crib mattress, this cover wrapped all the way around to the bottom of the mattress.  It washed and dried well, on a normal drying cycle.I am very happy with this mattress cover and would buy it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33XUE434655KJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00P7EV1P2#wasThisHelpful","R33XUE434655KJ","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you want to see some happy kids, get the Power Wheels Harley-Davidson Cruiser! This has Fisher Price quality and attention to detail, and the look of a real miniature Harley-Davidson motorcycle.  It's a definite five star purchase.It took about 45 minutes to put the bike together. The pieces were easy to find and instructions were easy to follow. We built ours with our 6 and 4 year olds and it was actually not frustrating to have them helping out.  Most of the construction involved screwing the plastic pieces together, so it was fairly easy. The hardest part was assembling the front wheel. It was easiest doing this with one adult holding the bike off the ground and the other adult pushing the rod through the bike and wheel. The stickers took about 10 minutes; there are a lot of them, but again the instructions are easy to follow. The stickers provide a lot of detail on the bike that give it a more realistic appearance. Very nice! Our 6 year old did our stickers and I was able to carefully peel them off when he accidentally misaligned them. The only thing I don't like,  is that some of the stickers go on curved parts of the bike but they are flat stickers so it was nearly impossible to get them on the bike with out wrinkles. From far away you would never see that, so its not a big deal at all. It just bothered me that I could not get them on without wrinkles. The battery is held in with a bar over it, so that the little ones can't take it in or out; this is a great new feature. We have another battery powered ride on vehicle that does not have this safety feature and the boys take the battery out and try to charge it by themselves. Having it screwed down eliminates this stress - major plus.  Another unexpected plus was that the battery comes charge, so we could use it right after it was assembled. No waiting to ride! It is not a full charged battery but it was enough for them to ride it for about 90 minutes before we had to charge it again.The power wheel has 4 wheels so its very sturdy and not an actual 2 wheel power wheel. The foot rest is large and makes for getting on and off very easy. Our 6 year old felt very comfortable on it and he is tall.  The bike has two speeds. You have to connect the wire for the little one to be able to put the bike at it fastest speed. This is a great feature for families that have multiple aged children using it.  Our 3 year old was able to drive it on the slow speed and i could easily walk by her and help her steer. We connected the wire for the 4 year old and the 6 year old; they were able to easily drive it at the fastest speed (5 mph). The car is easy to steer and handled the sidewalk very well. It was slower in the grass and spun out a little but for the most part it kept moving. It has a horn and engine rev noise button which the kids loved.It is very sleek looking and a great ride on toy. All the kids love it. Huge hit!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37JCL6WAJ97PQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T2T2UUS#wasThisHelpful","R37JCL6WAJ97PQ","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a fan of the Belkin Sport-Fit Universal Armband for iPhone/ Galaxy etc.  The material seems ok; it was easy to adjust.  I used it when walking so I wouldn't have to carry my phone. It is a very tight fit for the IPhone 6  - I don't think it's as universal as they claim. You can operate the screen on the phone through the plastic but since you're outside, if it's sunny, you can't see it for the glare. It's ok for playing music while I walk.  I don't run or do strenuous workouts, so I can't speak to how it would hold up for that.

"The Bubula Stainless Steel Diaper Pail is truly the perfect diaper pail.  There is so much to like about this product.  I know, you're thinking ""who would get excited about a diaper pail?"" This is the product parents have been waiting for.  The design is sleek, good looking and made of stainless steel.  It's easy to wipe clean.  You can use ordinary tall kitchen bags in it, so no expensive specialty bags/containers to buy. The best part is no diaper odor - at all.  You load the bag into the lower part, then shut it.  When you want to put a diaper in - you just raise the thin top lid, drop in diaper, shut lid and THEN push the button that drops the diaper down into the bag.  Why didn't someone think of this sooner?  Granted, it is a little pricey at approx $77 but trust me, it is worth every penny.

"The Four Paws Wood Portable Decorative Gate is good looking with its' dark wooden finish and modern design.  It opens from 24-68 inches and is 17 inches tall.  It is made of three wooden panels that can be extended almost full for wider areas, zig-zag style for medium areas or you could close two panels for smaller areas. It is pretty sturdy and not easily knocked down.  When it is closed, it is a good 4 inches or so thick, so it takes up some space when you are not using it.  This is more for small dogs who are not jumpers, as it is only 17 inches high.Cons:  There is a very strong paint odor that has yet to go away after four days; perhaps this needs to be outside for a while to air out before bringing it into the house, or maybe ours was a fluke.  I thought this would be useful for blocking off the kitchen for our dog, but the way the hinges are set to let the gate be free-standing, you can't make a ""U"" shape; it needs to be a zig-zag shape to stand up and this did not work out well for our space constraints.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Q2HB9P1NXF5Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010PIDWW4#wasThisHelpful","R2Q2HB9P1NXF5Y","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""My First Toolbox: A Lift-the-Flap Activity Book"" by Anne-Sophie Baumann has a cute premise.  There are several  different tools in the book with moving parts that enable little fingers to see how they work.  I feel that the age 2-4 year old range is very accurate.  My  4 year old grandson was interested at first but after about a minute he put it down and hasn't touched it since.  My 3 year old granddaughter seems to be the perfect age for this book.  The illustrations are cute and not gender specific so it is good for both boys and girls. The pieces that do move are kind of flimsy and do not move very easily. My granddaughter ripped two of the pieces already trying to get them to move. it is also a little hard to grab the action pieces , so they are bent at the end from trying to grasp it with her little fingers. The handle is a cute idea but when you open it, you have to turn the book  upside down to use it, so it is awkward to hold (sideways might have been a better idea). If the pieces were sturdier and easier to move I could see using this book more, but considering the flimsy pieces and how they easily they get stuck,  I imagine this will be ripped and in the garbage in a short while.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTMDHQH4B02JF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1027600743#wasThisHelpful","RTMDHQH4B02JF","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This Woods 6-Outlet Television Surge Protector for Multimedia is a steal at $11.49 on Amazon and a must-have electronics protector.  It is all about ease of use and attention to detail with a low profile that fits well in a tight space, a 4 foot cord, 6 outlets with sliding safety covers, cable protection, a surge indicator, a ground indicator and even a right angle plug.  When I received this, I also noted that in contrast to the surge protector I was using, this one has extra protection up to 1000 joules; with the cost of replacement of the equipment that I have plugged into it, I am definitely glad of the extra protection.  There is a lot of protection provided in this slim package.Note:  An interesting fact from the instruction leaflet - it said all surge protectors have a finite life of approximately 2-3 years, which I did not know (beyond that, they pass electricity but do not surge protect).  More than ever, I'm glad I replaced my old surge protector with this one.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VMCEGYYYSFHD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005CHMR4S#wasThisHelpful","R3VMCEGYYYSFHD","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love Eminence skin care products.  Of the moisurizers I have tried, the VitaSkin Bright Skin Moisturizer with SPF 30 is my favorite.  I cannot honestly say that I noticed my skin is brighter, but it is definitely smoother.  This is a very creamy moisturizer that applies easily and blends in well, leaving my skin smooth but not greasy.  Another thing I like is that there is no overwhelming scent; very mild and fresh smelling.  This product is noncomedogenic in my experience.  The price is great at Amazon too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWVJL5256H01D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ED4GG52#wasThisHelpful","RWVJL5256H01D","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My review of the Fisher-Price Roller Blocks Tumblin' Zebra is based on my 11 1/2 month granddaughter's use of it.  It is sturdy and cheerful; typical Fisher-Price Quality. My granddaughter liked playing with the blocks; they have shapes that turn inside them.  She did drop them through the hole at the top and was underwhelmed.  This did not hold her interest for very long. She played with the blocks themselves more than with the zebra.  I would say for the size and price (approx $15) this would be a good toy for grandparents to keep at their house, not one that would entertain a child for very long.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JGPSM7EIZXVE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SO7H0BS#wasThisHelpful","R3JGPSM7EIZXVE","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For a reasonable $35, this Conair Infiniti Pro Dual Voltage Styling Tool delivers!  I usually use a travel hair dryer because the full size dryers are too heavy for me to hold for any length of time.  While not as light as my travel dryer, this dryer is lighter than my other full size dryers and smaller in size, fitting nicely in my hand.  A plus over my usual dryer is that the warmest setting does not feel hot on my head, due to the ceramic technology providing infrared heat, yet with its 3 heat settings and 2 heat speeds, this dryer delivers professional quality results.  There is a separate cold button to finish up and set curls.  It also comes with a diffuser and an attachment to concentrate the heat.I've liked using this - it gives me good results and right now there is a $5 off coupon on Amazon!","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MTGMYR46DSTI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ZY8XZ1E#wasThisHelpful","R1MTGMYR46DSTI","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What's not to love about the Graco Premium Foam Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress?  The mattress came rolled up in a box that was lightweight and easy to pick up.  As per the instructions, it does take approximately two days  to get to full size. I was concerned because it had a faint odor to it at first but that went away. The mattress fits in both the crib and the toddler bed perfectly. It seems to be just as firm as the coil mattress that we had in the crib previously. Both the toddler and the baby  have gotten good night/nap sleeps on it. I laid on it and thought it was comfy. It is actually more comfy to me then the coil mattress. I also really like that we can roll it up and store it if necessary. I think it would even be a good idea to purchase a second one for sleep-over guests, since it would be so easy to store until needed, or to take with you if you go visiting family.Overall, this is a good quality, firm, comfortable mattress for a great price.  I  would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a  mattress for a crib or toddler bed; it is a lot cheaper than the coil mattress but just as firm and comfy.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2C074F3DNLBBV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010S7VZI0#wasThisHelpful","R2C074F3DNLBBV","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Twins mean twice the fun at a reasonable cost when you are talking about the Berenguer Boutique Twins.  These 15"" soft body baby dolls are adorable and they come with plenty of accessories.  One boy and one girl doll, each with their own bottle, pacifier, shoes, ""lovey"" blanket, a cute outfit, matching hat and a pair of shoes.  The 15"" size is good for the 2+ age group. Their eyes open and shut.  The head, arms and legs are vinyl but not stiff; the body is soft, so all and all these are good dolls for cuddling.  The pacifier fits in the mouth opening but strangely, the nipple on the bottle does not and I even tried squeezing the dolls' cheeks together.  My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves these babies (especially the pacifiers)! Considering all the accessories, I think they will work well for a long time.

"I found that the Thrive BodyShave Oil works as promised; it leaves your skin smooth and soft,  not red/rough after shaving. There is a lot to like in this vegan-acceptable product.  It is cruelty-free and has not been tested on animals.  It's botanical scent is suitable for men or women but I found that the scent lingered more than I would like,  even after rinsing.  It is made of natural, unique oils found in Costa Rica and the purchase helps local farmers, so you feel like you are making a good choice on all counts when you use it.Basically you wet your skin, apply the oil and work it up into a lather.  I started with a dime size amount of oil and had to reapply twice to get it to lather up; it will be a flat, see-through type of white lather (nothing like shaving cream, more like soap).  The razor glides nicely and after rinsing, the skin feels smooth.  The bottle is small enough to take with you for travel or put into an even smaller container since you can just pour it; no pressurized metal cans etc.I'm just not sure about the fragrance but it performs as advertised and lives the skin very smooth and soft after shaving.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U0H848QIRXDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011LOZ8WS#wasThisHelpful","R1U0H848QIRXDJ","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bounty with Dawn Giant Rolls is an incredible product that I recently had the ability to test.  Like the name says, these are oversize rolls of Bounty paper towels that have been infused with Dawn.  These are full size paper towels; I personally prefer the smaller tear off format, so I ripped one of these new towels in half.  I wet it and the bubbles of Dawn were immediately evident.  I cleaned my butcher block island; it did a great job on coffee and fruit stains.  I rinsed it and then used it to clean my counter tops.  I rinsed it again and cleaned both my sinks - after all this rinsing and cleaning, there was still some soap and the paper towel itself was still strong and rinsed clean.  I went on to clean my bathroom sink.I was truly amazed at how strong this paper towel was (after rinsing and using 8 times I threw it out and it still was as strong as when I started).  The Dawn lasted through several rinsings.Cons:  I used a plain paper towel to wipe up after cleaning the first few times when it still had a fair amount of Dawn left.  You wouldn't use this for windows. Some people may not want to buy two kinds of paper towels.Pros:  This product has the strength of Bounty and the cleaning power of Dawn; it does the job and then some!  I expect these rolls to last a very long time - in truth it is almost like using an actual cloth that you can rinse out over and over.  Even with scrubbing the sink, they held up very well.  For me, this is a great product and I will buy it again.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO7PXZRBNV9W2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TYAMVTK#wasThisHelpful","RO7PXZRBNV9W2","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Readers of cosy mysteries, especially those who are quilters, will be interested in "" A Stitch in Crime: Quilts of Love Series"" by Cathy Elliott.  The plot revolves around a big quilt show, the first ever  that is being held by the Quilt-Without-Guilt-Guild.  Thea James, a young woman who is running her family's Antique Emporium in the small town of Larkindale, and a novice quilter, has been talked into co-chairing the event.  It is safe to say that nothing goes as planned; her friend and quilt mentor Mary-Alice Wentworth is injured at the opening soiree and a valuable family broach goes missing.  That's not all that goes missing...the esteemed judge Dr. Cottle is a no show for several early events.  Thea's co-chair Prudy is no help whatsoever and Thea's best friend Renee suddenly seems like her worst enemy.  There is a possible love interest for Thea in the form of a local newspaper reporter/photographer, Cole Mason.  The closer it gets to the opening of the show, the more headaches for Thea, ultimately resulting in the theft of the heirloom Larkin's Treasure Quilt - owned by Mary-Alice's family.This is a Christian-style cosy mystery; no swearing, no sex and a simple story that revolves around events in a small town.  Neither the characters or the mystery is very complex but it is an easy read for those who enjoy this genre.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3SBI5BDMK2W11/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=142677365X#wasThisHelpful","R3SBI5BDMK2W11","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""She Has Your Eyes"" by Elisa Lorello is the continuation of the story of Andi and David that was begun in the author's prior books ""Faking It"" and ""Ordinary World"".  You do not need to have read the earlier books in the series as Ms. Lorello gives enough back story throughout the book.  Andi is a widow and a professor at a small liberal arts college.  She lives with and is in love with David, who is an artist and art dealer.  She met him before her marriage when he called himself Devin and ran an escort service (yes, really).  After her beloved husband Sam's death on their fourth wedding anniversary, she met David again, fell in love and they are enjoying a pretty picture-perfect life together.  He is talking to her about marriage (she is reluctant to commit) when the doorbell rings and they find a 15 year old girl named Wylie on their doorstep.  She has tracked David down because she recently found out that her Dad is not her biological father and she thinks that David might be...David responds with shock and denial, but to Andi, it is obviously a possibility as she tells David ""she has your eyes"".  The story that follows is about the changes that Wylie brings to David's life, their life as a couple, how Wylie fits in with her family and David and Wylie, issues with Andi's relationship with her mother, letting go of her deceased husband and an ex-fiance of Andi's that resurfaces in the midst of her unsettled emotional state.  A lot happens at once but the issues themselves are interesting.I think this could easily have been a more serious work of fiction , along the lines of Anita Shreve's ""The Pilot's Wife"", but  I think it's a good example of  chick-lit (not that there's anything wrong with that). This was an okay, ""beach read"" type of book for me.  It was entertaining, if predictable but I did not like it enough to want to read the two prior books in the series.  If you are looking for a light read, this might fit the bill.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QJCP4WGTI9P1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1477848126#wasThisHelpful","R1QJCP4WGTI9P1","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have long been a fan of Karin Fossum's writing, so I was excited to preview an advanced copy of ""The Drowned Boy"", the latest in the excellent Inspector Sejer mystery series.  This is an author who never disappoints.  As I finished this book, my heart was pounding.  She is a master at the psychology of crime and her deliberate style lets the horror creep up on the reader page by page.The story begins with a tragedy, the accidental drowning of  16 month old Tommy, a toddler with Down Syndrome, in a pond behind his home.  His very young parents, Carmen and Nicolai are naturally distraught, and yet, there is something...something that seems off to Inspector Skarre when he is called to the scene; something that has him calling Inspector Sejer to voice his concerns.  Amidst some troubling health concerns of his own, Inspector Sejer begins the routine investigation into an accidental death and what he finds produces a sense of unease in both the Inspector and the reader.  When the results of the autopsy reveal not pond water but soapy water in the Tommy's lungs, Carmen changes her story, but is it the truth at last?You do not have to have read any of the other books in the very popular Inspector Sejer series to enjoy this book thoroughly.  If you are a fan of suspense, of mystery, of crime and the darkness that lurks within, you will want to read this book - and you will enjoy every minute of it.  I highly recommend this book - would give it more stars if I could.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R209ULSGTFD35Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0544483960#wasThisHelpful","R209ULSGTFD35Z","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""On a Ring and A Prayer"" is the first Jessie Stanton novel in a planned series of three by Christian fiction author Sandra D. Bricker.  The heroine Jessie Stanton was a young girl from a middle class family in Louisiana who had dreams of a more exciting life in California.  She moves West and is working at a perfume counter when successful and wealthy Jack Stanton sees her and is immediately captivated. After a whirlwind romance and marriage on the beach, Jessie finds herself living the dream of wealth and privilege, wearing designer clothes, driving a BMW, and living in a 4000 square foot mansion.  She has everything she ever wanted, or so it seemed...until one day while lunching with her best friend, Piper, she sees her car towed away...and then her credit card is declined.  She goes home to find her house empty of Jack's belongings and it has been sold without her knowledge.  All she has left is her clothing and her 4 carat Neil Lang wedding ring.  Her husband's cell phone is disconnected and he is gone without a word.As her world comes crashing down around her, Piper helps her find a private investigator to help her locate Jack and find out what happened.  The investigator, Danny Callahan, is a kind Christian man,  who lives his faith.  He helps find Jessie a place to live and supports her when she starts a business renting out her designer fashions.This is light, easy to read Christian fiction; no sex, no swearing.  The characters tend to be pretty simple and the story is predictable.  By turns naive and frustrating, the reader does come to care for Jessie Stanton and will probably want to read the second book to find out what happens to her next.The basic premise of this book is very reminiscent of a much better novel by Nora Roberts ""Daring to Dream"" also the first in a trilogy about three women starting over to remake their lives after disastrous circumstances.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27MSKCR1L5EM2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1426711603#wasThisHelpful","R27MSKCR1L5EM2","A67ZXSOC2XH4O","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A67ZXSOC2XH4O?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Wellness has the reputation for quality ingredients without fillers like wheat, corn and soy and without artificial ingredients.

"I have to admit that I had never considered bookmarks for a three ring binder/notebook.  The package of Avery Tabbed Snap-In Bookmarks includes 5 very brightly colored plastic bookmarks for three ring binders; one each of 5 different colors and patterns.  They are cut just below the holes to allow you to slip them in and out of a binder without opening it and they do so easily.  The question is why would you need that? it's no big deal to  open a three ring binder.  I also question why you even need bookmarks in a binder...I have been using them in my recipe binder instead of those sticky tabs.  You can write on the top of them on the enclosed labels; you are also given a link to the Avery website where you can print the labels.While not a necessity, they are fun.

"""The Great Zoo of China"" was the first Matthew Reilly book that I have ever read.  While my first thought was ""uh oh, 'Jurassic Park' take off""...this book is truly so much more than that, and the author himself makes a tongue-in-cheek reference to that by one of his characters.  I started this book at the beginning of my long flight from the Midwest to California...I finished it waiting for my shuttle bus to arrive.  It is literally nonstop action - of the over the stop/incredible type to be sure, but if you want thrills and excitement, in a fast read that you won't want to put down - this is your book.Set in present day China, the story opens with Bill Lynch, a leading herpetologist,  being hunted ruthlessly by other men and then by something much, much worse...at this point I was sucked in and never stopped reading until the book was finished  several hours later.  Dr. C. J. Cameron is  Lynch's protege, a herpetologist herself and a leading authority on the largest reptiles in the world, the salt water crocodile.  When she and her photojournalist brother Hamish are asked by National Geographic Magazine to visit and document the Great Zoo of China before it is open to the public, they find themselves in an elite group including the US Ambassador to China and his aide, a head columnist from the New York Times and a leading internet voice.  It is obvious that the Chinese have spared no expense to announce their zoo to the world.  As the tour begins, I hear Jeff Goldblum's character from Jurassic Park in my head discussing all the ways that nature cannot be controlled...and that is exactly the premise of this book.  SPOILER ALERT:  It is not really the Great Zoo of China but The Great Dragon Zoo of China.  The Chinese have actually found dragon eggs, raised several species of dragons and even ""trained"" them...but of course the reader knows this is destined to go very wrong and it does.  The intrepid Dr. Cameron goes from one fantastic adventure to another, but the author keeps the story moving at the speed of a runaway train.  I did think that this has blockbuster movie written all over it...if they could figure out how to film it.  The story is so big, that it is at times more fantasy novel than thriller, but the reader won't care.The section in the book titled ""Sixth Evolution, The Time of the Dragon"" begins with this quote by Tolkein ""It does not do to leave a live dragon out of your calculations, if you live near him"".

"This is a great idea, I don't know how many times I have been out and about and forget to bring a pair of headphones. The hat is warm, comfortable, and large enough to really cover the head and allow the speakers to hit my ears correctly. The sound is great and easily adjustable. I love the color of mine (black and gray) and its attractive enough as to not have everyone look at me when I'm out for a walk. I think it would make a great Christmas gift! I do love that it is washable (if you take the speaker off). There are other colors as well so choose whichever you'd like.I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

"Initially, I didn't expect a whole lot from these gloves but after plugging them into my USB, I was quite pleased. They warm up instantly and really work! They leave enough of my fingers showing so that I can type easily, unlike some other fingerless gloves I have used for the same purpose. The mitten top buttons down with an elastic so that that they don't keep flopping over my fingers while I type.

"I've tried several different LED bulbs and have already switched most of the house over. LED's offer low wattage and energy use and last years longer.This bulb is amazing for two reasons. First of all, it looks identical to a conventional bulb. If I hadn't known that it was an LED bulb ahead of time, I wouldn't have noticed the difference. The bulb has a warm, soft yellow 2700K color temperature and really lights up the room.Something else that is really cool about these bulbs is that they are filament bulbs, resembeling bulbs from the early 20th century.These bulbs aren't overly bright, they are only 40W equivalent but they are perfect for a bedside lamp or a bathroom strip light. I have been using this bulb at my nightstand but I intend to switch them over to my bathroom strip light.These bulbs are dimmable if you have a dimmable fixture. The bulbs instantly turn on when I flip the switch and they stay cool to the touch. The filament style really is cool to look at and they give a warm vintage feel to them. For some reason I get black bars on the pictures when I take them but the pages pictures are very accurate.Overall, these bulbs are great!

"This KeyLine charger is a 5-stage charger and maintainer for car, motorcycle, and marine batteries. It chargers at a low, 0.75A speed and is very easy on older batteries. It features built-in overcharging protection and surge protection to protect the battery during long charges.I have charged my boat battery on a slow, 1A charger for several years and have noticed that it holds a much better charge than a higher ampage even though it takes longer. After reading into the difference between this charger and my trickle charger, I feel much safer using this one not to mention it does seem to charge a little faster.This charger is also a quarter of the size of my trickle charger. It is easy to store and it has alligator and terminal cables included. The charger has a long cable and can be plugged 110-240V wall outlet.Overall, great inexpensive and high performance charger.

"First off, I'm not good at jump rope, and am a total newbie.  the last time I used a jump rope was when I was about 10 - over 40 years ago! I am hoping to use this as another cardio alternative at the end of my weight lifting workout.This is a decent rope, and does the job once you figure out the correct length.  I did some googling, since nothing about sizing came with this rope and discovered that for sizing, all rope lengths are measured from handle tip to handle tip, NOT just the length of the cord. To determine the exact length for an individual, stand on the center of the cord. The handle tips should reach your armpits, or just below the shoulders.  To adjust this jump rope you'll need a small philips head screw driver and wire cutters.The problem I had with the adjustment is that I'm just 5'2"" so had to shorten it quite a bit.  this left a long length of cord hanging off one handle as you can only adjust one side. I now need wire cutters to cut it down to size because the rope is not just vinyl, it is steel wires that have a vinyl coating. It hurts when it slaps against unprotected feet (wear shoes!) and shins. I won't be trimming it completely the first time as I may need to adjust the length again as I use it more and get used to it.I suppose if I was more experienced at jumping I'd probably give this 4 stars, but I'm still trying to get the hang of it and not sure right now if it is me or the rope.  I may come back and change the rating as I get more experience with it.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7DAOCEX48197/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LY9L276#wasThisHelpful","R7DAOCEX48197","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't really lost any significant weight with this, but I have noticed it help with reduced appetite. I am not good at remembering to take pills so having to take this 30-60 minutes before a meal is kind of a pain for me, but when I do remember it has noticeably helped in reducing those feelings of wanting to eat something (when I really don't need to).  I have been taking them on and off (because I don't always remember to take them until its too late) for about a week now. Haven't noticed any significant weight loss, but then I only need to drop about 5 pounds.  I've been watching my food intake and exercising as well so I'm hoping that this will help me with the in-between meal snacking urges. I think it would probably be more effective if I could remember to take them before the meals. Since I don't eat my meals at regular times each day, it's a little difficult for me.Because I am exercising regularly and paying more attention to what I eat, any weight loss may not necessarily be attributed to this, but I figure it can't hurt if it helps reduce the urge to overeat and snack.  honestly, if you're looking for a magic pill for weight loss, this isn't it because there is none.  The only true way to lose weight and keep it off is to change your eating and exercise habits.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O43DDNP8W2ZB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IDQZSBY#wasThisHelpful","R1O43DDNP8W2ZB","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have acne.  I'm 50 years old and still have to fight pimples on my face!  I get a small breakouts every few weeks.  This has been my constant battle since puberty!  Needless to say, I've tried a wide variety of products.  So far nothing has been the perfect answer to perfectly beautiful skin.  However, I do notice that my breakouts are much less when I use products with benzoyl peroxide rather than the salicylic acid, which most seem to have these days.  This product, Neutrogena Rapid Clear, contains benzoyl peroxide.  I've been using it about a week now and I really like how it cleans.  It also doesn't have the little ""gritties"" that other products seem to love putting in there, making it a ""scrub.""  Seriously, when you already have large pores from acne and oily skin, those little gritties aren't really good for you - the can cause small tearing of the pores which makes them larger.  I never did understand why companies put those gritties in there when dermatologists and studies recommend that people with oily skin and large pores do not use them.what I like about this product is that not only does it control my acne better than others I've tried, but it is smooth (no gritties!) and it has a light, fresh scent - kind of like baby powder, but not strong smelling at all.  it is easy to rinse off and, again, no left over little gritties to deal with.  I have not had any issue with dryness, but then my skin is used to acne medication.  If you're not used to it, and you get a lot of drying, I'd suggest using it just once a day for at least a week then up it to twice a day.  Also, get a good oil-free lotion to follow it with.Bottom line - I like this much better than the others I've tried (Biore, Aveeno, Olay).  Everyone's skin is different so you may see different results, but for me benzoyl peroxide works much better on my acne than salicylic acid. Most product these days don't use the benzoyl peroxide, so I'm glad to to see Neutrogena including it here.  If I continue to see improvements in my skin I may come back and give this a 5 star, but until I find the absolutely perfect skin care product for my skin, it's going to be 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GAWSVEM60C0W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S49XI6M#wasThisHelpful","R2GAWSVEM60C0W","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I really like this case.  when I first put on my iPhone I was hesitant due to the added size, but then it's not like it's the size of those new iPhone 6 monsters!First thing I did after I got the phone into the case was to test out all the buttons - they work just fine - better than other cases I've had, in fact.Next was a test to see how the earbuds sound.  I'm not very discerning when it comes to earbuds as I'm rough on them, although I do need a decent sound. I am a runner and usually have earbuds strapped from a waist belt up my shirt to my ears.  they get sweaty and dirty.  When you're out running you need to hear some of what's going on around you in order to be alert for any dangers - so I dont' need complete noise cancelling features.  Anyhow, the sound on these is great.  It's not tinny like some others - it's perfect for me.  The controls on the ear bud are a little to get used to in the new spot, up near my ear rather than down a ways like the iPhone standard earbuds. But I found that they were simple enough to control so I can skip songs, repeat songs, and answer calls if needed.The case itself is soft and easy to hold. It seems to provide good protection for the phone as well, which is good as I'm known to drop mine now and again (so far only one time i""ve had to have the glass face replaced, thank goodness!)The one thing that is missing -- well, when I get in my car, I don't have a bluetooth radio so I plug in the auxiallary into my iPhone to listen to audiobooks or music.  I can't do that easily with this case - I need to remove the phone from the case in order to plug in.  If they just had an option to plug in externally to the audio jack, this would perfect!  So needless to say I've had to take my phone in and out of the case for my work commute trips and so far I've had no issues with the earbud cables tangling or getting messed up.  It's pretty simple task to remove from the case and replace it later.So other than the lack of an external audio jack adapter/extender, this is a great case.  I've already had a friend with an Android see this and be envious of the fact that I dont have a tangled mess of earbud cable with my phone.  She wants one of these - and she has a bluetooth radio in her car.  Maybe I should just upgrade my car radio.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKMU58658T58B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00O15U5IW#wasThisHelpful","RKMU58658T58B","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This little stylus works great with my iPhone, helping to reduce the ""fat finger"" issues of typos that I always get.  (I hate auto-correct, so I turn that off and try to fix my typos myself - much better than relying on auto-correct with its often horrifying replacement words!)  This little stylus is sleek and easy to hold.  When the cap is off, it screws nicely onto the other end so you don't lose it.  The built-in clip is perfect for clpping to a case - which would be great for iPad (or other tablet) users who have a case.  The probably with using a stylus on your smartphone is that you need it to be handy and while I've hooked this guy onto tthe pocket of my purse, that is still one step too many for me when I'm out and about.  So, not having a tablet to use this with, I use it on my iphone when I'm at home and sitting around playing Words with Friends or checking my Facebook updates.  I do think this will be a great gift for my 83-year old father who loves his iPad and uses stylus with that until they wear out (yes, he wears them out!)  The tip on this is different than the little rubber-ball type tip I've used in the past, and it appears to be much more durable than those.  So, I'll have to see if dear old dad can wear this one out as fast as he does the rubber tip ones!","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24MXEPRGLCKQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R33ZWI2#wasThisHelpful","R24MXEPRGLCKQJ","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I'm not sure what I was thinking when I got this flavor, the cinnamon chai taste is really not my favorite, but that aside, this is really not bad tasting. my first time mixing this up and i added bananas and strawberries  - i do not recommend that!  They just do not go well with the cinnamon flavor. Since then I've simply blended it with plain, unsweetened almond milk and it's been good.  I drink a glass of it after exercise - usually weight lifting, but sometimes after a run. this could easily be a meal-replacement with its nutrional composition but I got it for the 20grams of protein in each serving.  I love that this is vegan and is pea-protein rather than soy.  Pea protein is great because it is hypoallergenic - easy to digest with no lactose or gluten.  Of course all the green foods in this protein powder (6 servings!) lead to your protein shake also coming out green looking.  Not to worry, though, it's still very much palatable, despite the color.I have no tried this in a shaker bottle, I only use my blender, so I can't say how it mixes up in a blender bottle, but it blends nicely in the blender.  It also does not have a chalky or textured taste that I find from many powders.  I think Vega is a good brand, well researched, and uses whole, plant-based foods, which is one of the big reasons why for my next tub of protein mix, I'll be getting the French Vanilla flavor so i can throw in those bananas and strawberries -- that will add calories, of course, but this is only 160-170 calories a serving, so if using this for a meal replacement, adding in a banana and a few strawberries will make this more of a meal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JECCZBBD5QGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R0Y13K0#wasThisHelpful","R3JECCZBBD5QGO","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This works pretty well.  It's not the be-all, end-all acne killer for me, nothing really seems to be, but I do like how my face feels afterward and the breakouts so far seem to be minimal.  I've got adult acne, always have, where even at the young age of 50 I still get a break out now and again.  My skin is also always reddish looking so I was intrigued by the ""mattify"" step with its ""hint"" of green in it.It's pretty clear that this is marketed for teenage and young adult women, with its cutesy names -- curly brackets and exclamation points all included: {Acne Hater Scrub!}, {Spot Zinger!}, and {Swirled Mattifier!}so the cutesy names are fun and, well, cute, but they are just that if the product isn't up to snuff... so, here are my thoughts on the set (I do suggest getting the set as they are formulated to work together).Step 1: Cleanse - it has a fresh scent and little ""gritties"" in it to make you feel like you're scrubbing off the crap.  I do always wonder why acne treatment products put gritties in their cleansers when these are not supposed to be good for those of us with larger pores (generally typical for those who have oily skin and break out often). The gritties supposedly can cause the pores to get larger by ""tearing"" them open a bit.  personally I like the feeling that I'm getting a good scrubbing, so it's not that big of a deal, unless these little guys are causing my pores to get larger - although I see no evidence of it.  I'll let you decide on your own.  Oh, the other thing about the gritties - I find it's best to scrub in the shower so I can get a good rinse off under the showerhead.  If I'm washing my face at night over the sink with a wet washcloth, it's often a pain to get all the gritties off my face.Step 2: Treat - this little bottle of treatment seems to work well.  I dab little spots of it on the trouble spots of my face then blend it in.  No stinging for me.Step 3: Mattify - this is the one with the subtle green in it to help cover up the redness.  first off, remember that a little of this goes a long way!  one full pump will probably be more than enough, so I suggest taking it easy the first time you use this.  It goes on pretty smooth.  Blend it in so it's on with a fairly thin layer then give it a few seconds to absorb into your skin.  I do notice a subtle improvement in the redness, although it's not a cover up so the redness won't go away completely.  This has a scent to it that I'm not too keen on - but it seems to dissipate after awhile.  This also does well under makeup.  I use a bare minerals powder foundation and it goes on nicely over this mattifier.I've been using the Olay Fresh Effects treatment for about 2 weeks now and I did still have a minor breakout, although the blemish did not seem to get out of control so it appears that this system has helped to kept it in check.  I've not had any drying of my skin, but then it's pretty used to salicylic acid, so if you're skin isn't, I'd suggest you break into this easy but maybe only using it once a day in the beginning.  It does seem to work best, though, with regular use morning and night.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RPJEXI15QM91/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OKD61GA#wasThisHelpful","R2RPJEXI15QM91","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When I first got this I thought it was interesting that the a/c power adapter weighed more than the hub itself.  But that's really no big deal since this hub sits on my desk all day doing its thing.  The cool thing about this is that there are 7 ports PLUS the 2 'always on' fast charging ports for iphones, ipads, etc.I use this port with my MacBook Pro which, using bootcamp, has both OSX (yosemite) and Windows 7 on it.  The port works fine with both and it worked right away after plugging it in.  I have external hard drives plugged into it, a keyboard (for when the MacBook Pro is ""docked"" on the desk), a printer, and a wacom tablet.  All work great with this.The one thing you have to remember is the 2 charging ports are solely charging ports.  You can't plug in a USB flash drive, external harddrive, or other peripheral device and access it through one of these 2 bonus ports.  Which means you also cannot sync your iPhone, iPad, Android, etc when plugged into one of the 2 charging ports.  This is perfectly fine by me because it gets annoying plugging in my iPhone to charge and the computer always wanting to access it, sync it, or whatever.  Plus the fact that these charging ports are always on means I can shut down my computer but leave the devices I need charged plugged in and they continue to charge.  No need to move them to a wall outlet charger.I also have a 7-port Anker USB3 hub, which works great but it does not have the additional charging ports.  Between that one and this TP-Link I have plenty of ports to plug in external harddrives (I use many of those for backups and portable data storage).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MIT2RZPMSXFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCX6I8A#wasThisHelpful","R3MIT2RZPMSXFX","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been an OSX user for years so I know a lot of what's in this manual already, still with all the changes and new features that have been thrown in over years, I found that I didn't know as much as I thought I did!  I've been happy to just log in and work in Photoshop and Illustrator without a whole lot of thought to the OS.  However, this book is a great little gem that offers insight on all the handy little features of OSX that make my life easier.

"These are great.  I was worried that every time I opened the cabinet under the kitchen sink, where I keep the garbage bin, that it would smell perfumey and just too much scent.  I've been pleasantly surprised, as that has not happened.  I can barely smell the fabreze/gain, but I can also barely smell the old coffee grounds from this morning and the onion peels from last night's dinner.  It's subtle and it works.My husband claims that these are the best garbage bags and, in fact, he's thinking of creating his own clothing line with them so he can wear one every day and not bother with deodorant anymore.  I figure, why not, we live in the Pacific NW, it would be rainproof attire.Ah, but in all seriousness, the other thing I like about these is that Glad did not skimp on the other things that make their bags so great - the drawstring and the 'force-flex.'

"We love these glasses!  These are perfect wine glasses!  I received some beautiful Tiffany crystal wine glasses as a wedding gift, they held as much as these but unfortunately were very delicate and I ended up breaking two of the four!  So we decided it was time to get something durable for our (almost) every day use when we have a glass of wine with dinner.  Stemless was my first choice, as both broken Tiffany glasses happened because they were tall - one I accidentally hit on the sink faucet when I was washing it, the other I had filled with water to soak it a bit before washing and when I picked it up to empty the water, I grabbed a little too low on the stem and it toppled over in my hand, against the sink.  Thus, the two remaining Tiffany glasses will be brought out for special occasions only.These stemless Luigi Bromioli glasses are durable, fit great in the dishwasher, and they hold a lot of wine!  Not only are these durable, but they don't feel cheap and are very well made.  We have a ""recipe"" we enjoy now and then with our wine -- throw a handful of frozen fruit in the glass, then cover it with white wine (Pinot Gris or Prosecco - love the bubbly, are our favs).  After dinner, when we finish up the wine in the glass, we have fruit left over - making for a nice after dinner treat that's much better for us than ice cream or cake.  The size of these glasses make that a perfect treat.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EXVU8AA2FHXW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0085E8RU8#wasThisHelpful","R1EXVU8AA2FHXW","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I started the Zyflamend with a half dose (one pill a day) after reading about the potential for for stomach issues.  I have had acid reflux pretty much my whole life, although I control it by avoiding foods that cause me problems, so I was a little worried about this.  I decided I'd try the recommended 1 a day for the first few weeks and see how it goes. I did feel a very subtle ""warming"" sensation in my stomach the first few days when I took the pill the in the morning. After about 2 weeks I had maybe two minor acid-reflux issues related to the Zyflamend, but decided to go ahead and up to the dosage to the full dose of 2 a day.  that was about a week ago and so far I've had no issues whatsoever with heartburn or acid reflux from the Zyflamend.  So that's a good thing!  (we're all different, so your mileage may vary - suggest trying it in the low dose as recommended, but if you have issues the few days, perhaps try a lower dose version).Now, about what it's taken for --- I have been having some issues with a pain in my knee/leg that has hindered my running a bit so I googled Zyflamend to read more about it and see if the ""imflamation response"" could possibly help out. It sounded like this could help with that and the other minor aches I get now and again when I push the workout a little more than I should. Okay. I'll be honest here, I'm going to be 50 in less than a week - I still love to run, bicycle, and lift weights - I get aches and pains often, but I find it takes a little longer to recover from them as I get older.  Maybe it's coincidence, but I have started to notice less of the aches since I've started the Zyflamend.  And the knee/calf pain that's been plaguing me on and off for over a year now is less noticeable.  I suppose it could be time healing it, but I'd like to think the Zyflamend is helping.  As long as this keeps up, I'll keep taking it.I also want to mention that in my google research I discovered that Zyflamend is also good for the prostate, so I started my husband taking this as well.  Although, I notice that New Chapter has a separate version specifically formulated to help with prostate health.As a female (almost 50.. as I mentioned above) i definitely need to worry about bone strength.  Being a vegetarian, I still eat some dairy and take a daily multivitamin (from New Chapter as well), but I need more calcium so taking the Bone Strength supplement from New Chapter is a no-brainer for me.  Besides, my doctor told me to start adding calcium supplements to my routine back when I was 40.  I really like New Chapter's products and the Bone Strength product has calcium, magnesium and D3 - not only good for bones but joints as well. I'm sure that's also a good thing for that pesky knee/calf issue I mentioned earlier, too.I'm pleased with these products, I've always felt that New Chapter makes quality products, using organic whole foods, not synthetics.

"If anyone ever tells you that using an epilator doesn't hurt, they are lying.  These things basically tweeze your hair en masse causing all the pain one might expect if you took a pair of tweezers and started ripping out the hairs in your armpits, your bikini line, and on your legs.This was actually my first real experience with an epilator.  I'm writing this review having only been brave enough to try this once so far.  And, of course, when I decided to try it, it was all-in.  I used the standard head, dry, and decided to try it first on my bikini area.  I figured I'd do one side, then shave the other side and compare.  It was not a pleasant experience, painful as it ripped the hairs out.  Although i was not screaming in pain, and I tried to make it through by doing the entire area.  I switched the modes from hard to soft and even tried the various heads, but it all felt about the same.  The hair didn't come off as completely as I had expected, either.  There was still some left after I had covered the entire area with the thing. There were small red blotches from the ripping out of the hairs and my skin was tender to the touch.  Figured I should have tried this wet first, but I was too lazy.That was at least a week ago and I still have not gotten up the nerve to go near the device again.  however, pain aside, I have noticed that the hair removed by the epilator along my right-side bikini line has not grown back as quickly as the hair on the other side that I shaved on the same day as the epilating.  So for that, it is great.  Basically for me it comes down to whether or not I want suffer through the pain and discomfort of using the epilator in order to not have to worry about shaving/epilating as often, or just keep shaving.  Right now I'm going with the shaving.  I'm too much of a wimp.perhaps I'll get brave and try it again in the shower, where it is supposed to be a little less painful.

"Perhaps I'm being too harsh on this product giving it only 3 stars, as it's the only one I have tried in the Benzac line.  As a hydrator it works well. As an acne control or acne clearing product it is ""meh.""  (you know, average - 3 stars).  I have had acne my whole life - never bad enough to go to a dermatologist but there's always a breakout coming at some point.  And now at age 50, you'd think this would be gone, but nope.  I still get a zit or two on my face every now and then.  I was hoping this product with salicylic acid and the addition of sandalwood would help.  I've been using this hydrator for over 2 weeks now.  As a test, I have been applying it to only the left side of my face.  The scent of this does seem ""citrus"" to me, it's an odd scent that I can't describe - not really bad, but not pleasant, either.  Still, it's faint and goes away rather quickly after applied.As for the effectiveness of the product itself, while the acne is no less or no more on the left side of my face where I am using the Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator, I can see a visible difference in the smoothness of lines on my face.  Interesting, since I'm using this in combination with Dermalogica products - so my full face is getting hydrated from that as well.After hydrating with this the left side of my face does feel smoother and cleaner.  not sure why, the Dermalogica products aren't bad, but I'm glad I only have a trial size of those - and I won't be purchasing the full size of those.  I realize that companies create their products to work together, so using and reviewing just this one (step 3) product out of their 3-step system may be unfair.  With how the hydrator alone has been nice to my skin, though not given me any sort of ""wow"" for the acne control, I may see about getting a trial pack of the Benzac in order to get a full review.I just wish I could finally find a skin care line that works with my skin. It's been a continual search my whole life and nothing yet has blown me away as the perfect solution for my acne-prone skin.  I'll update this review if I find that using the full Benzac line is beneficial.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2FWHB7VSC9IRS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ON1VGZK#wasThisHelpful","R2FWHB7VSC9IRS","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first one that Amazon sent me was black, not titanium as I had ordered.  I wanted a slightly different color than the black one I already have so I could differentiate the two.  The box it came in said it was a WD My Passport Ultra but printed on the drive was only ""WD My Passport""  and it was also printed in the other direction, readable from ""portrait"" (or vertical) orientation rather than ""landscape"" (or horizontal) orientation.  I thought that was  little odd, but decided that it would help me to differentiate the two after all.  So, I hooked it up to my windows 7 install and windows attmpted to load drivers for it but after a minute or so it failed.No problem, I thought, I'll just plug it in to my Mac and format/partitition it there as I had done with my other My Passport Ultra drive.  Nope.  That didn't work either.  Mac OS X Yosemite  couldn't do it either and I couldn't even erase it to start fresh.  It simply didn't work.  I googled the error, thinking I could fix it with some command line process and found instructions on running FSCK to resolve it.  I decided not to bother with that additional pain, because what if it still didn't work?  Having ordered it from Amazon, I figured the best thing to do was to return it and ask for a new one.So I returned the first one, explained that it was ""dead out of the box.""  And Amazon promptly sent me a replacement. (Another reason I LOVE shopping from Amazon - aside from Prime - is that it is always fairly painless to return things).The replacement arrived 2 days after I submitted my return claim and one day after I actually put the dead drive in the mail to send it back.  The replacement was exactly what I had ordered - it came in the correct color - Titanium - and it has the printing on the drive just as shown in the picture (horizontal orientation).  I plugged it in to my Mac and had absolutely no problem partitioning and formatting the drive to my specifications.  it works perfectly so far and will be used as the backup for my other My Passport Ultra.I am only taking off one star because of the first dead drive that I got, but really if the rating is for the drive that I have now, it's definitely a 5star.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 31, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RQ71O7AS2ICJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EAS89AG#wasThisHelpful","RQ71O7AS2ICJ8","A1A027UELK4JZC","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1A027UELK4JZC?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Ok people love her now because she wrote Gone Girl and it shocked everyone and made a movie and everything. WOW! As I said before, I've read better. SHE'S written better. So here we are with a short story. I hope she really did write it as a favour for a friend because for the the third time, I've read better. Do worry Ms. Flynn, your 15 minute story will make you money and keep you in the public eye until you finish your next book. But you didn't need this story, it wasn't even your style. And you know you phoned it in. I liked you when you wrote what you knew. But I think Gone Girl has gone to your head. Your next book better be fabulous, because if it's not you will lose your hard core readers. I let it go when Gone Girl made me lose a little respect. I'm letting this story go as well. But you're only getting one more dance from me, I have better dark places with sharp objects to cut me when I read.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13TO1Y1NIJS7N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0138OACAW#wasThisHelpful","R13TO1Y1NIJS7N","A1TFY9C4U1EZXR","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1TFY9C4U1EZXR?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.  That being said, the review club that sent me this book asks for four things - a disclaimer (done), that the reader read the entire book (done), that any spoilers be clearly marked (no spoilers here), and that the reader provides constructive criticism in a helpful manner. Herein lies the problem. Is it constructive to tell the author ( and other potential readers) that I wouldn't read this book again if my life depended on it? Is it helpful to review this book and recommend that no one should ever be subjected to such an amazing array of stupidity? Is the author going to hunt me down and shoot me if I say this book of short stories is so awful, I don't want to admit I read it?  Look book reviews are boring at best. Most people only read a few, and several people wrote good things about this book. If your the author, be happy with that. If your a potential reader, my silly, little, uninspired recommendation is run away, run away.

The story was not so bad, except it felt like one chapter of an unfinished book. How am I supposed to care about characters who weren't fleshed out. And the plotline has no point of reference. Usually if a book is bad, I just skip reviewing it. I hate to denigrate anyone skilled enough to write something, but I had to review this one.

"I received an advanced copy from the author in exchange for an honest review. Keeping that in mind, I am a tough critic. I have to be because of the sheer number of books I read. So take this review for what it is, a solid review based on a very critical reader. I don't write books, and I wouldn't aim to try. It's hard work, and it takes an imagination I have to obtain by reading. And that doesn't even begin to touch the necessary literary skills necessary to write a book, which I don't have. That being said, it frustrates me when I come across a book that could be good but misses the mark by just a squeak, I get aggravated. This book is to short for a novel and to long for a short story. It's full of superfluous information and has a few very large plot holes. The thing is it could of been a great book. I could see what the author was reaching for, and I cringed every time he missed it.  Especially since he missed the mark by a whisper, not by leaps and bounds.  I liked the ideas, but I had to reach way to far to make the story line fit. And there were to many leaks in the plotline that I don't understand how the author missed. I saw them and I am a literary idiot. The book deserves 2.5 stars. I rounded up to 3 stars. Be thankful author and keep it in mind dear reader.

"Janet Evanovich has been writing best-selling books for so many years I forget when I started reading them. The antics of Stephanie and her crew have made me laugh so hard I had tears running down my legs. The sexual tension between the characters has always had me coming back for more, and, more. Ms. Evanovich was a master of the craft and we all profited from it.  She's done now. The legend of Stephanie Plum is over. I don't know how it happened. I don't know when it all started to go wrong. But alas, the ride is over. Maybe it started when the author started to write other series with other authors. Maybe she just had no more left for Stephanie to do. But since about book 11, I think we all started getting tired of it. How many more times is someone going to say ""babe""? Are we expected to read a book where someone usually dies, the dog eats something and pukes, grandma does something kooky, and the heroine waffles back and forth between two men. We all give thanks for the years of enjoyment but we are officially done. For the last ten books (translate ten years and about $300.00, not to mention the shelf space we have lost) you can take off the dust jackets, mix them around and put them in any order you want. It makes no difference, THE'RE ALL THE SAME BOOK!!!! I gave it ten good years and except for the fact that the books are getting thinner, they haven't changed a bit. I actually SKIMMED through this book. Can you believe it? SKIMMED!!! I'm sorry Janet, I have loved your books since I was a teenager, but I can't read one more repetitious word. I WILL miss you.

"There were a few to many subplots going on. And instead of using the secret lover triangle that's always a red herring,the author played it straight. Just a kidnapping but way to many possible suspects and way,WAY, to much child sexual abuse that had little to add to the main plotline.  If it were cheap, I might buy another one of this author's books. But it would have to be very cheap or free.

I tested out how accurate it was going to be before actually using it and the steps were right on. The charge time for this is also really fast.

Basically if you've been watching too much of that nonsense known as Star Trek: TNG then you'll probably be just totally shocked by everything (and you'll probably miss the fact that the utopian Culture society can't reasonably be expected to work at all without the Minds running it) but if you've been studying real-world history and global security issues then you won't be.In essence, the book is about the naive product of a hyper-utopian society who encounters a traditional Imperialist society that employs what is essentially a limited meritocracy based on the use of a complex military board game as a sort of Imperial Exam system somewhat similar to that of the Song Dynasty in China. Like most readers likely will, the main character goes through pretty much the whole story without understanding much of what's really going on.The book is pretty well written and the story is much more orderly compared to the previous train wreck Culture novel Consider Phlebas which is only slightly helpful for understanding this book (and then, mostly just due to the world building background information). Though the book is quite a bit different from Ender's Game, in some ways it's like a much more grown up version of that book.I didn't really like Ender's Game that much, but I did like Player of Games even though I wasn't all that surprised by anything in the plot. The fact that I still found The Player of Games interesting even though it was almost exactly what I expected it to be indicates to me that the author did a good job.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O5YPVNOCHEGR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002WM3HC2#wasThisHelpful","R3O5YPVNOCHEGR","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The best way I can describe this book with a single phrase is ""a sci-fi war adventure story with strong undertones of futility and inconsistent luck."" The main thing that I got out of this particular book is world building for later Culture novels. Otherwise it is, in terms of the story (not the world/universe setting) sort of like watching a much more chaotic version of the TV series Firefly where everything goes very wrong almost the entire time and characters are saved or killed by good or bad luck as much or more than their own intentional decisions.To avoid biasing myself I'm trying to write this review before reading any reviews by anyone else, so I don't really have any other ideas here besides my own, but after reading this I'm kind of left wondering ""and the point of this story is supposed to be...?"" My only real guesses are: ""war is messy"" and ""supertechnology doesn't grant easy success or address differences in values"" along with some random ideas about how the overall values of a society don't necessarily separate people or keep them together, especially in extreme situations.Maybe I'm just too old or something, but I don't feel like I really got anything new out of reading this. It's not a bad book though, and I'm quite sure other people would get more out of it than I did.

"While I basically like this book, I found that the ""world building"" (amount of detail provided) is a bit weak even considering that it's written in first-person voice from the point of view of someone who's largely kept in the dark by a totalitarian government. To me the setting basically seems too surrealistic for the level of believability that the author seems to be aiming for simply due to the lack of detail about the world itself. Obviously the whole premise of the book is far-fetched but in order to have characters who behave according to believable realistic human psychology you need enough detail about the environment to get the feeling that their behavior makes sense. I feel like there are too many unanswered questions and unspecified details to give me confidence that the author is making realistic statements about human behavior and society.For example, I'm constantly thinking to myself: ""There's absolutely no way they'd need to have a lottery to force someone to participate. They would always have volunteers, and if there was a lottery it would be to decide which volunteer actually got the option to become the 'tribute'. There are simply too many adolescents who are suicidal, or want some sort of fame and don't really grasp that they're over 95% likely to die, or maybe just want to die or would be willing to just to be famous for a while.""Maybe I'm just hyperanalytical, or I just spend a lot more time than most people do studying how people behave in real world extreme situations, but while I think the author does understand certain aspects of human psychology very well as it applies to warfare, I still can't help but be bothered by too many behavioral assumptions that just don't seem to match up with real-world study and experiences.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15G4LPE8QDL4S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MQYOFW#wasThisHelpful","R15G4LPE8QDL4S","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This book gives me a headache simply because it seems like the information is spread all over the place rather than grouped in some sort of sensible manner. I was assigned this book for a ""crash course"" covering four different types of welding plus oxy-gas cutting, and even for the superficial treatment of any given welding technology it seems like the book is lacking in information at least on certain types like oxy-gas. It's not just me, the instructor actually had to provide a packet of supplementary handouts so students could answer half of the questions on the quizzes that aren't covered by the book.I was hoping that this book would serve as a good reference for different welding technologies for those like me who may need to do some welding but aren't planning to become professional level welders. Unfortunately it looks to be very bad for that purpose.I suspect that this book was designed for a very specific degree program curriculum or something, and if the instructor for your class isn't following the author's plan then you encounter the frustrations with finding information that I have.

"I use a KNK Zing electronic cutting machine (often called an ""electronic die cutter"" or ""cutting plotter""), and like most such machines, whatever you're cutting has to be stuck down to a cutting mat. These mats normally come coated with a tacky removable adhesive on them that's equivalent to spray mount, if not exactly the same thing.While you can use the mat for a while with the same adhesive, eventually paper fibers and stuff end up stuck to the mat which eventually reduce it's tackiness to the point where it no longer works.As a result, you have to add some sort of repositionable spray mount type adhesive to restore the mat to a sufficient degree of tackiness. This product works well for this purpose assuming you use it properly and don't apply too much or apply it unevenly, etc.This is the first one I've used with the mat, so I really don't know for sure if cheaper alternatives like Krylon 10-1/2-Ounce Easy Tack Repositionable Adhesive Spray (almost half the cost) are just as good. I think that KNK (manufacturer of my machine) sells the Krylon, so it's probably fine for cutting mat needs and significantly less expensive.After reapplying adhesive to the mat 3 or more times you end up with too thick of a layer of adhesive and paper pulp on the mat and need to clean it off. This is true of any adhesive used with such a mat, but fortunately the 3M stuff cleans off rather easily using stuff like Goo Gone Pro-Power Spray Gel followed by dishwashing detergent to get rid of the adhesive/goo-gone mix. I have no idea if it's any easier to dissolve and remove compared to cheaper stuff like the Krylon, but I can say that it does dissolve rather easily with safer solvents like Goo Gone.I've never gotten any residue on paper/etc that I've stuck down to the mat for cutting purposes, and you usually need to press the paper down very securely with any sort of cutting machine mat with any sort of adhesive. Even with lots of pressure to adhere stuff, no residue problems. Sometimes if I make the mat too sticky the stuff will rip thin bits of paper off of the bottom of things, but even when it's really thick and sticky it barely does this and it really just means I've put too much adhesive on the mat for the material I'm using.The stickiness is very controllable within a rather wide range. Two or so light quick coats from 8"" or so away gives you something lighter than a post-it, and heavy coats are very tacky without causing problems or residue. (Just let it dry longer with heavy coats, at least a minute or two. Stick stuff on it immediately while its wet and you'll get some of it coming off.)I sometimes have to tape thick materials down to the sticky parts of the mat with regular masking tape, and this works out just fine. The tape sticks well enough and comes off very easily. Even with adhesive on both the tape and the mat, there are no problems like bits of tape ripping off.Another thing I have to do sometimes is scrape lots of little paper ""chads"" (caused by cutting small holes for intricate designs, for example) off of the mat, and this works perfectly. The little chads come off rather easily, and very little of the adhesive comes off on the rather sharp plastic paint scraper than I use. What little does get on the paint scraper is so slight that I don't need to reapply adhesive at all and I don't even need to clean the paint scraper.So far I've had no problems and no complaints about this stuff. When I have had a problem it's always been caused by me applying more than needed, or getting a super-thick spot in one place because I held it 3"" away for a second.While the instructions on the can say that, once you're ready to put the can away, you need to hold it upside down and spray it so that the propellant can blow all of the adhesive out of the spray tube/nozzle, I didn't do this last time and the can sat for 2 weeks without any clogging. The directions also tell you to clean the nozzle with turpentine, but that's been totally unnecessary so far. (Maybe eventually some gunk will build up and need to be removed.) So the can seems very resistant to clogging.I'd give this stuff 5 stars except that all of these spray adhesives are really nasty stuff. Arguably I shouldn't fault this particular product since I have no reason to believe it's any more toxic etc than any other product of its type, but spray adhesives are so nasty that I wouldn't give any of them a perfect 5 stars.ALWAYS SPRAY THIS STUFF OUTSIDE OR IN A vacuum HOOD or BOOTH! Like I say, this stuff is NASTY. Not only is there absolutely no way to avoid overspray creating a toxic cloud of aerosol, but the toxic cloud can also blow around and get on anything nearby. Because of this it's absolutely critical that you only use it outdoors or with some sort of fume hood that sucks the toxic cloud through a filter. When used outdoors I'd advise standing at least maybe 6' from anything and also pay attention to which way any wind might blow the cloud. Slight wind can easily blow the toxic mess back onto you, other people, or other objects.Summary: Perfect stuff for what I'm doing. It just can't seem to do anything wrong. The only real con is that it's almost twice as expensive as stuff like the previously mentioned Krylon, and I don't know if it's that much better than cheaper products.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2233XZP87Y485/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000BKQD82#wasThisHelpful","R2233XZP87Y485","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These things are much better than the putties in most cases.The main problem is that they end up being significantly more expensive per thing mounted on the wall particularly if you're using one for each corner of rectangular posters, etc.Note: You can wash them off under running water! This is very useful if something does happen to fall off the wall or the squares somehow get on the floor and pick up dust. Also, if you happen to stick them to a dusty wall and they fall off due to the dust, being able to just wash them allows you to clean the wall and put them back up securely.While Scotch seems to recommend against using these squares on flat wall paint, I haven't noticed any spots left behind. If anything they just don't stick as securely to flat paint but for me the stickiness seems to be good enough. So far I haven't had but one thing fall off of flat wall paint, and the only thing that did fall off seems to have been caused by dust on the wall coating the adhesive. But as previously stated, I just washed them off, cleaned the wall, and put them back up with no trouble. With glossy paint they might not even fall off of dusty walls. With flat paint use a lot of pressure to get them stuck down securely.Summary: good stuff, I'm just subtracting one star for the increased cost over putty.

"Compared to Saunders UHU Tac Removable Adhesive Putty Tabs and another brand that I've tried, this stuff is much worse about leaving residue on walls, at least with flat wall paint, than other brands.The main problems are that it's too soft (causing it to leave bits of putty behind more easily when pulled off the wall), and it's blue (why?) so the residue that it does leave will be much more obvious on most colors of paint. While you can get most of the residue off by the usual technique of rolling a ball of putty over the residue until it comes off, this takes longer and is generally more trouble with the Blu-Tack compared to other brands like the UHU. That, combined with the blue color, makes this significantly worse than others.I have no idea why they made this stuff blue. There seems to be no valid reason for this.Like the two other reusable tacky putty products that I've used, this stuff WILL leave something that looks like an oil spot on flat wall paint. This doesn't seem to be a problem with glossy paint though. (Glossy is usually easier to clean in general.)I would certainly not recommend this blue stuff. The best comparable products I've found are the UHU Tac and 3M Scotch  1-Inch Indoor Mounting Squares. The removable silicone mounting squares are actually much better than the putties, but they end up being significantly more expensive per thing mounted on the wall particularly if you're using one for each corner of rectangular posters, etc. While Scotch seems to recommend against using these squares on flat wall paint, I haven't noticed any spots left behind.

"I've bought this along with Blu-Tack Re-usable Adhesive and some other brand that I can't remember the name of (I stripped the label but I think it's Scotch.) So I've had three brands to compare.Things to know:1) At least with the cheap flat wall paint in my apartment, both this stuff and Blu-Tack will leave an oil spot. I suspect this is true of all flat wall paint, but this is not a problem with glossy paint. I suspect all brands of this tacky poster putty type stuff will leave a oil-like spot on the wall.2) The UHU brand is much better about not leaving bits of residue on the wall when it's removed compared to the Blu-Tack and other stuff I have. Residue isn't really that much of a problem even with flat paint because you can roll a ball of the putty around over the residue to pull it off, but this UHU stuff leaves less residue initially on removal, and removal of any residue is much easier and more complete than the Blu-Tack especially.3) This UHU stuff is also cheaper than other per amount of putty you get.I did these residue tests for both 24 hours and 2 weeks. The results were about the same in both cases. (You'll get the oil spot on flat paint even after 24 hours.)If I need more of this stuff I'll be buying this brand, but with 3 oz of it I doubt I'm going to run out for a long time!If you want something superior to putty tack like this, you can get 3M Scotch Mounting Squares, Clear, .68-Inch by .68-Inch, 35-Pack which are very sticky and don't leave any visible residue at all. The problem with them is that you don't get many of them per pack, so they're significantly more expensive. If you don't have more than 6 posters to hang then these will work, but I have so much stuff to put up that I'd be spending at least 10x as much money for all the silicone mounting squares that I'd need compared to some sort of putty.Summary: if you get removable tacky putty stuff like this, the UHU is the best one to get at least based on my comparisons with two others.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSXFAVKVQTT31/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001B0B1IS#wasThisHelpful","RSXFAVKVQTT31","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using a KNK Zing cutting machine. Like most of these consumer-level cutting machines, it's really only designed to cut chipboard up to 0.03"" thick and some makes of them won't even do that. In any case, if you have a electronic ""die cutter"" that costs less than $400 that ""cuts chipboard"", I can almost guarantee that what they mean is that it will cut 0.03"" thick chipboard and not anything thicker. Usually the rollers and mat won't support that thickness regardless of the blade or cutting force.When I got around to using this stuff I noticed that it was thicker than it should be, and I actually measured its thickness with a micrometer. (I'm an engineer so I actually have one.) Exactly 0.05"" thick, +/- 0.001"" or so depending on humidity, etc. Somewhere I see that it's supposed to be 0.057"" thick but for whatever reason mine isn't. (I know my micrometer isn't off by THAT much.)I measured some matte board that I have and this chipboard is as thick as the matte board. Luckily it's a good bit softer and less dense than matte board though.I don't know why I ordered this stuff thinking it was 0.03"" thick. I thought surely I must have been sent the wrong item. Maybe I saw ""medium weight"" in another listing where it was defined as 0.03"" in thickness, but now that I look at this listing again it doesn't give the thickness anywhere! Perhaps I'm wrong, but I don't think ""medium weight"" is any sort of industry standard term that specifically implies 0.05""-0.057"", so the term is almost meaningless unless the manufacturer clearly defines it which they did NOT do in this listing. BAD!I'm still giving this four stars because I think it's good quality chipboard that would be perfectly good where 0.05"" chipboard is needed. Arguably I should give it 3 due to the bad product listing, but I think that would mislead people about the fundamental product quality. So I'm being a bit ""generous"" here.Anyway, if you're using a consumer-level ""electronic die cutter"" (cutting plotter) you certainly want 0.03"" chipboard like Light Chipboard Sheets 12"" x 12"", 25/pkg. (I know nothing about that specific brand or product, I'm just linking to an example.) Also, check your cutter's specs to make sure it will even cut 0.03"" thick chipboard because some very popular models like the Silhouette don't have the cutting force to deal with the thickness and density of even ""light"" 0.03"" chipboard.With the KNK Zing I actually can manage to get it to cut this 0.05"" thick stuff, but I have to calibrate the cutter perfectly and use exactly the right cutting force with a slow cutting speed and a multicut of *at least 5* if not more. The only reason this is even possible is that the Zing is a $400 cutter with supposedly the heaviest cutting force at it's price point of any make out there, but it's still difficult and you get some of the chipboard layers on the edges curling upward due to so many multiple cuts.Summary: pretty good quality chipboard, but very bad quality product listing! Do not expect this stuff to cut on regular consumer-level ""electronic die cutters"". You're really going to need a razor blade in a boxcutter handle or a traditional manual die cutter to cut this, or a $5000+ laser cutter. The listing may say that this stuff is suitable for ""die cutting"" but apparently this refers to the heavier manual-force traditional die cutters.I'll submit a request to get Amazon to update the listing.

"All I'm really doing is cutting stuff like photo paper, cardstock, chipboard/paperboard, and cardboard, but I'm literally just using a standard one edge razor blade held in a $1 box cutter and so far this mat doesn't show a mark even with the amount of pressure you need to cut stuff like chipboard and cardboard.It may not seem like a big deal, but the hole in the mat is extremely helpful since I can hang this on the back of my closet door. Otherwise it would be awkward to store, and it would not be easy to cut your own hole in this thing. (Maybe an electric drill with a new rather sharp bit would work but I bet the hole wouldn't be very clean.)Alvin is the brand that my digital media arts school uses and the ones there, even after constant heavy use, never seem to have any cut marks in them that I'd notice while using the mats.I got an 18x12"" Alvin mat here for something like $10 which is somewhere between half and one third as much as Michael's (big chain craft store) wanted for the same size thing in some other brand that I didn't even recognize.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 31, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XR1L2KWZBN5I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0015AOIYI#wasThisHelpful","R2XR1L2KWZBN5I","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this because I need to cut cardboard and paper with a metal straight edge and knife, and my wooden ruler isn't quite up to the task.This thing is more than sufficient though. I haven't had any slippage problems, even when using only paper and cardboard under it. Though there's this annoyingly difficult to remove UPC sticker in the middle of the cork underside, it hasn't caused any slippage problems so I haven't even bothered to remove it and don't see any reason to.It's just a metal ruler, but it's less expensive than other ones of the same length and works just as well. If the metal were thicker then perhaps it would better resist accidental damage from bending, but since I'm the only one who uses it I'm not worried about it. About the only reason to spend more for a heavier ruler would be if it were being used by random people in a semi-public area all the time where it's more likely to be subject to abuse.

"I've had one of these for over three years, attached to my keychain where it gets plenty of abuse as my keys get thrown around, bang against it, and it still works! To give you some idea of the level of the abuse, all of the paint on the metal has worn off at this point,Though it is still working (I just used it a few minutes ago), after over three years of this abuse something on it did finally come loose: A few months ago the plastic cap that forms the side of the connector opposite the contacts came off (seems like it was probably just glued on), so I took some typical dollar store superglue and glued it back on. (Luckily I didn't lose it.)  After that it was back to normal with no awkward bits of glue or anything causing any problems. (I did make sure to clean off the contacts.) You wouldn't even be able to tell that it had ever come apart.

But when I have needed it to temporarily store files to bring home, etc, no problems at all.I seldom give anything 5 stars, but I'd give this thing more than 5 if I could. The thing has been incredibly durable and reliable, and it's so small that I never even notice that it's on my keychain until I need it.

"I've read reviews here that claim the the eCraft just ""doesn't work"" and I would dispute that, but it does seem to have trouble with certain patterns especially with no cardstock carrier/stabilizer. The ""matless"" design is rather ambitious and perhaps a bit too ambitious.Overall I'd say that what design is going to work or not is probably less predictable with this cutter than with others. Some things are going to be very sensitive to the pressure setting, the tab width and density, and whether or not you use some cardstock under the material you're trying to cut.PRINT-AND-CUT WARNING: A big feature that's missing from the eCraft is print-and-cut. For some reason I missed that fact before I bought it. There's just no good way to accurately align the page for this, and the rollers seem like they're more likely than usual to adversely affect ink jet printed images anyway. So don't buy the eCraft if you want print-and-cut!The main limitation of the eCraft (other than no print-and-cut) becomes apparent when you try to cut a full-page lattice type pattern. Because it doesn't use a carrier mat, the paper has to have a minimum amount of stiffness and once you have the whole sheet filled with hole cuts (especially if the average gap between the holes is like 1/4"") the sheet becomes weakened to where it doesn't stay flat when it's being pushed by the rollers. Trying this sort of cut at least twice (reducing the density/complexity the second time), it jammed both times. A third attempt trying to get the blade depth set to just barely cut entirely through the paper while using a backing sheet avoided jamming, but apparently I didn't have it set deep enough to cut all the way through in most places. (Basically it got kiss cut maybe 80-90% through in most places.) I had the tab width set to the smallest and least dense settings, and I'm guessing that raising the tab settings to wide and dense would help some, but would probably make removing the ""chads"" rather difficult.Interestingly enough, if I use some thin cardstock (like the protective sheet that came in an 8.5""x11"" box of Epson photo paper) as a backing sheet, it cuts relatively fine detail (at least in the middle 25% of the page) in 32lb laser paper without any trouble even with the tabs turned off. (I didn't try an elaborate lattice with that yet though.) And that's even with no adhesive.Of course, having to use a backing sheet kind of defeats the purpose of having a ""matless"" cutter.Another annoying thing is that if it jams, there would seem to be no way to release the tension between the rollers so you can remove the crumpled paper. This makes clearing jams pretty difficult a lot of the time.I also read about problems that seem to be caused by paper lifting up (probably while pushing) in the area under the cutting head as it seems to have nothing there to really keep it held down flat.... like an adhesive backing mat.It probably works pretty well with adhesive vinyl since that's always kiss cut with it's own backing.Actually, the lattice that I cut might have worked if the cuts had been made in the best order. It jammed toward the end when it tried to push and pull the whole sheet back and forth trying to make lots of little cuts around the edge after the whole middle of the page had been weakened. (Turning off ""prioritize inner cuts"" probably would have helped but I'm loathe to try it again since trying to clear the jam the last time was very difficult.) If the vendor's software were smart enough to analyze the rigidity of the page in various areas and optimize the cut order to minimize the amount of weakened area that's pushed through the rollers (such as cutting in rows from front to back, scanning down the page, so it never revisits weakened page areas) that would probably help.The only way I think they could improve this given the matless design of the cutter is if the software did some somewhat sophisticated analysis to find weakened areas and then perform special optimization on the cutting order and warn you when a particular design is just going to weaken the paper too much to be likely to work with no backing sheet, or at all. The quality of the vendor software is currently rather mediocre overall (which makes the usefulness of third-party software like Make the Cut greater for the eCraft compared to other cutters) so I kind of doubt that we'd see advanced optimization features like this any time soon.The documentation for both the included eCraft software and the cutter itself is really horrible and lacking in information. I'm an engineer and not only was it not obvious to me what orientation letter size paper should be loaded in the paper tray, I couldn't find a clear answer in the documentation. I had to figure this out by trial-and-error.While I don't have any experience with any other cutters yet, and I know that all of these cutters have some not totally predictable limitations in some cases and require proper configuration/calibration in all cases, I suspect that the ecraft is less predictable than most. Maybe if people stick to using only simple designs like not too small or intricate flowers that aren't too densely packed on an entire page, or they just use stuff like vinyl, they won't really have many problems, but with lots of other situations, who knows.Overall SummaryPros:- It's less expensive than many cutters.- Blades are cheap.- Works fine for the typical case using simple shapes like the ones on the included SD card and standard cardstock.- Can in theory cut some pretty thick materials (though I haven't tested this personally)- The cutting head holds both a blade and pen at the same time, so it can draw and cut without having to switch out the blade for a pen.Cons:- Does NOT do print-and-cut!- Matless cutting design is too ambitious for many use cases. You end up having to use a backing/carrier cardstock sheet under your material in many cases.- What will and won't work without jamming, especially without a backing/carrier, is difficult to predict. While experience with the machine will help with this, I suspect that this one takes longer to learn than most.- Software is very mediocre. Luckily it imports SVG files, so I'd advise using something like Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape to design things and then import them. Either do that, or buy third-party software like Make the Cut.- The documentation is very lacking, making the learning curve even worse.- Has some design flaws and overall it's not quite ready for ""prime time"" until some design improvements are made.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 22, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R394KABKRXSJUB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0037CGCCI#wasThisHelpful","R394KABKRXSJUB","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UltraChrome K3 is great stuff, I just wish it weren't so expensive. Since it's the same no matter where you get it, you might as well go for the lowest price.Regarding yellow ink specifically: keep in mind that your yellow cartridge is going to get consumed faster than the others if your printing is fairly average over the primary colors. This is because you have two shades of magenta ink, two shades of cyan, and three shades of black, but only one shade of yellow. So every other color has 2 or 3 cartridges to draw from while Yellow only has one. This ink will get used whenever red, yellow, or green are printed and green especially occurs very commonly due to the fact that plants are green and plants very often occur in photos.So even if you just bought a new printer and don't buy any other color ink right away, you might want to just order an extra yellow with your printer because you're most likely to run out of it first.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R249YDOW5NKDXC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004L62KRK#wasThisHelpful","R249YDOW5NKDXC","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For what this thing costs I was actually expecting something lighter and not as solidly constructed as it is. (The last one I had at about this price was rather flimsy looking, but luckily my ex wife took that one :)I'm not running a business and so ship things rather infrequently so I really don't need the most top of the line durable mailing scale out there, so this level of quality at this price is great for me as spending more money would be a waste of money.Normally I use a scale like this to occasionally ship returns or ship things out to buyers on auction sites maybe 3 times a month on average. Though I usually end up driving to the post office or some sort of shipping facility anyway, if I print a label and pay for postage online then (at least with USPS) I can get a discount on shipping charges, but this requires knowing the weight of the item to do.A scale like this will very quickly pay for itself in online label printing discounts and time saved waiting in line for a clerk to weigh packages for you. If you don't schedule a pickup then at least dropping the packages off will take much less time.I put a 40 lb dumbell set on this thing for testing and it handled it with no problem and read accurately. I seriously doubt I'm ever going to need to ship anything too heavy for this scale to handle.One really great feature of this thing is the ""hold"" button that freezes the display so you can take the box off to read it. With my last scale I'd have trouble reading the display with a large box placed on top of it. (Notice that more expensive commercial shipping scales usually have the display on the end of a curly cord to avoid this problem.) With the hold button you can put a box that's big enough to cover the disply on the scale, wait a bit, then reach under and hit the hold button. Then you just take the large box off the thing and read the weight. There's also a tare button though that's not so useful for shipping.With shipping things USPS using online label purchasing I usually seem to save a bit over a dollar per box, so even if this thing did die after I shipped 20-25 boxes it would still have lasted long enough to pay for itself. Given that it has both an AC adapter brick and can use a battery, I couldn't be happier with it. It can also be calibrated though it requires that you place a known standard 40 Kg of weight on the thing making that kind of difficult.Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1W7K1GI902HW6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BTWMPQ#wasThisHelpful","R1W7K1GI902HW6","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I own the Dremel 8000-03 Cordless which is only 14oz. I partly bought it because I wanted a relatively light tool for small work.Most of the usefulness of the flex shaft attachment is in reducing the weight of what you have to hold in your hand for detail work, so this attachment isn't quite as useful to me as it would be if I had one of the corded models that weights twice as much. I bought it anyway, along with the Dremel 575 Right Angle Attachment just so I'd have it around in case I needed to get in to tighter spaces or needed further ""weight reduction"" over holding the tool itself in one hand. If I were using a corded model it would be absolutely essential for me for what I do.Because it isn't something that I normally need, I haven't used it that much and probably won't use it routinely, so I can't properly speak to its durability. (I usually go back and update these reviews after a while though to update people on that.) But in my testing it feels very sturdy and solid and so I feel confident in its ability to hold up when maintained properly. (Not stored so that it bends at sharp angles, greased at intervals as specified in the manual, etc.)It seems to have no problem working with the Dremel 4486 Keyless Chuck. Attaching and removing the flex drive from the tool itself it is similar to attaching and removing the right angle attachment (you need to replace the collet nut or chuck on the rotary tool with a ""drive"" adapter that the cable slots into) both of which are pretty easy. I am not entirely sure if it's OK to attach the right angle adapter to the handheld part of the flex shaft as it seems like together they may create too much friction on the drive and thus possibly too much additional load on the motor. (Remember these rotary tools power accessories based on speed, not on torque. High speed low torque often does not deal with too much continuous load very well.) Anyone who knows if this is considered OK or who has long term experience using both together please post a comment.A couple of things that you must keep in mind when using this:1) You really do want to hang the tool up above where you're working when you're using this flex thing. I can't say exactly why, but most likely it has to do with keeping the amount of friction low (increased when more of the shaft is curved vs straight) and keeping the shaft from bending at too sharp of an angle. If you have the Dremel 220-01 Work Station drill press type thing then that comes with an extendable hanger but I can't see any good reason to buy that thing just to get a hanger. In fact almost anyone could come up with something much less expensive and more secure than using the hanger on that. Screw an eye screw into the ceiling and hang it from a rope or run a ""clothesline"" across your work area and hang it on a couple of ""S"" hooks, or something. If you don't hang the tool I doubt the shaft is going to shred itself immediately but I'm sure it won't last as long, will be more likely to get damaged by an accidental sharp bend, and won't be able to run at as high of a speed due to the increased friction.2) NOTE! In case you miss the little note in the box, you really do want to run this thing at high speed for a couple of minutes with it hung straight down and no accessory attached. It'll make some disconcerting little ticking sounds at first but those will stop after several seconds. I suspect the point of this is that you want to evenly distribute the grease inside the shaft before running it while bent or otherwise doing any real work. Again, I doubt you'll shred the thing if you don't do this, but at the very least you might have a little trouble with your grinding, etc, for a minute if you try to use it immediately since it's going to distribute grease or otherwise break itself in when first used no matter what. It really will run at 35,000RPM and it really is OK to run it like this for two minutes straight without doing anything. It won't whip around or anything so this is pretty safe. (My cats weren't even that afraid of it while it was doing this.)3) You will need to grease the thing at periodic intervals as the manual says or you will eventually shred the flexible cable inside the jacket. The grease you use for this is as common as dirt at auto parts stores though.So in short, this attachment is pretty important if you want to use a heavier model of a dremel in one hand. The other option in this case is to buy an additional smaller rotary tool for one-handed use but you'll probably end up with less power for more money if you take that option. If you already have a light tool that you can hold in one hand for a sufficient time without much trouble then you might want to hold off on buying this until the need arises. But in any case, this is a solid quality attachment that you'll likely be very happy with if and when you do have a use for it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1M0XPU9BDCRC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000302Y8#wasThisHelpful","R1M0XPU9BDCRC5","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First let me say that I did receive what appeared to be an open box returned item sold to me as new, so it's difficult to tell if the problems I noticed with it were due to a manufacturing defect, shipping damage, poor manufacturing tolerances, or design faults. Obvious damage/defects were that the LCD was scratched up a bit as was the graduated measuring scale near the depth gauge end. (The LCD was missing the usual plastic protection packaging of the sort that you peel off during unpacking.) I'm dropping the item off at UPS tomorrow to be returned for a refund which I might do even if it were in obviously new condition.In testing the accuracy of the unit it would appear that the error becomes worse as the measurement width approaches the maximum of 6 inches. At 6 inches, the digital display does not exactly match the graduation scale mark for 6"" as inspected with a 10x loupe as compared with the same spot it does on the 0"" mark. I don't know if you can really expect any better for $35 but a plastic stick-on measuring scale doesn't seem like such a great mark of quality here. Maybe nobody really expects that much accuracy in the graduation marks anyway.Has anyone who checked the accuracy of this thing measured distances longer than 1""? At 1"" it seems to be pretty good but after 1"" it starts picking up from -0.001"" to -0.003"" error from what I could tell comparing with a metal ruler with engraved graduation marks and with a 1.5"" calibration block. Again, maybe the specific one that they sent me was just bad but I'd be interested in knowing if this is really the best one for the price and whether -0.003"" at 6"" is considered reasonable error for this price point of caliper.Anyway, anyone checking for accuracy please check accuracy at distances wider than 1"" and also please let me know.

"If you're using a tool like the Dremel 8000-03 10.8-Volt Lithium Ion Cordless Rotary Tool then an extra battery is a must. If the battery you're using runs dead while you're in the middle of working on something, and you don't have another one charged up, then you're stuck waiting up to 3 hours for a recharge before you can continue. Having another battery charged up will probably be sufficient to finish the job for most people, and if two batteries is routinely insufficient then using one of the corded models might be worth considering if you have the option. They, or some third party, really need to make an AC adapter for this thing. (Something that looks like a battery with a cord that can be plugged into the tool like a battery and plugged into the wall should easily be possible, but I guess they want to force you to buy a corded model in addition to your corded one if you need both options.)The ""fit"" of the battery in my 8000 is not as secure as it should be; it doesn't clip in very tightly. This is true of both the extra battery and the included one though, so I assume it must be a design problem. It seems to work OK, but it still wiggles around too much which doesn't exactly inspire confidence.The main reasons for my 3 star rating on the battery are the high price of the battery and the fact that Dremel is very bad about clarifying what tools it's compatible with. As a result I had to waste too much time making sure this was the right battery for the 8000. I don't know why but they seem to be horrible about clearly identifying their products. For example, in some places the Dremel 8000 is called the Dremel 8000, but on their web site it's called the ""Dremel 10.8V Lithium Ion"" and I never found any reference to ""8000"" like it says on the box. Based on the latter name you'd have no idea that it was compatible with something that claimed that it was made for the ""8000"".

"I got this fairly recently so haven't had time to test out every single accessory on something though I eventually intend to do so.At less than half the cost of a similar set of official Dremel accessories, this one isn't too bad depending on which accessories you're most interested in. The first thing that I noticed is that one of the grinding ""stone"" accessories in the box was improperly glued to it's shaft sideways in such a way that it would wobble like crazy if actually used. But there are a few other aluminum oxide grinding stones of different shapes and this one wasn't a particularly important shape to me, so this didn't bother me that much.The second thing I noticed is that the edges of the box aren't exactly well rounded off and seem likely to give someone splinters. Fortunately though this product comes with the stuff needed to fix this, and I wanted to test out the sanding drum and mandrel anyway. So I went about rounding off the edges and noticed no problems with the included drum mandrel.For the price, these are the sorts of quality issues you can expect, but if 99% of the accessories in the box are good then it's still a good deal.I also used the polishing wheel mandrel with felt wheels, and I think I tested out the machine screw mandrel with a grinding wheel as well. I can't tell the difference between any of these mandrels and the Dremel ones.About the only thing I notice is that the grinding wheels included in the set are every so slightly more coarse-grained than the ones that came with my tool. So though I haven't tested all of them, I'm a little more concerned about the quality of the grinding wheels and other grinding accessories for some applications where a certain fineness is needed like say removing rust from stainless steel so that you can polish it up afterwards. The Dremel wheels I have seem like they'd be a little better for this.The wire and nylon brush attachments also seem of decent quality. I used them for a while with no signs of them flying apart or anything.So despite some quality issues of the sort you might expect (especially with minor stuff like the wood box edges not being rounded off well enough to prevent splinters) this still looks to be a worthwhile set for the price. If it were any more expensive I'd give it 3 stars, and if it were double the price I'd give it 2, but for $15.50 or so enough of the accessories in the set are good enough that the mediocre quality of some of the parts is made up for in overall value.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2J2UMSL9UKWAF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001EJGOVK#wasThisHelpful","R2J2UMSL9UKWAF","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I haven't had these very long so I can't say how well they hold up over time, but I figured I'd add some things I noticed.I'm making pinhole plates for pinhole cameras, so I'm mostly interested in the smallest bits. I also need them to be accurate because a difference of something like 0.001"" or 0.01mm is enough to make a difference in image sharpness with precision-drilled pinholes in many cases.I put the smallest bit in a good solid micrometer outer caliper I have and it read exactly 0.013"" as advertised. Note that these tiny ones are TINY. To give you some idea, the thinnest manual sewing needle I could find was wider than 0.02""/0.5mm. The smallest bit (0.013""/0.33mm) in this set is about the diameter of an acupuncture needle except that it has burrs to drill with. To handle these I use some sharp pointed tweezers with a locking collar of the sort that jewelers use to hold gemstones for inspection. I'm pretty good with my hands but it's difficult to dump out the little tube of the thinnest size bits and pick one bit out of it without dumping some of them.SO NOTE: the metric conversions given for the drill bit sizes appear to be inaccurate or maybe I should just say wrong. 0.013"" is actually more like 0.33mm, and my micrometer read 0.013"". So it would seem that the accurate numbers listed are the English units, not the metric ones. Therefore refer to the English numbers given and convert them to metric manually if you want to know the real diameters in mm.It's difficult if not impossible to get the really small bits perfectly centered in the pin vise, though using tweezers helps. I haven't really used a little pin vise like this before so I can't really say if this is typical, at least in this price range, or not. But to get the bits centered you might want to spend a little time adjusting them to be as centered as possible so they don't break.Notice that if you remove the nut from the pin vise you can remove the chuck, flip it around, and stick it back in the handle. This gives you a wider chuck capable of holding the larger sized bits. The nut was lubricated reasonably well as it was, but I added a bit of silicone grease to the threads and around the chuck which improved things a bit.I also carefully placed the smallest bit (0.013"") in my Dremel 8000 which was installed in a Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station (which is basically a Dremel drill press attachment) using the regular Dremel 4486 Chuck. I think I actually had an easier time centering the bit in the Dremel chuck than I did with the pin vise even though the dremel was locked into it's drill press attachment. I put the Dremel on its highest speed of about 35,000RPM and used it to drill several holes into a little patch of aluminum that I cut out of the side of a soda can. It went right through with no trouble.So I can't say for sure how well they'll hold up long term, but they look good. I just wish the pin vise did a bit better of a job helping you get small bits centered in the chuck, and it might be nice if it had a compartment in the handle for the bits. But the set comes with a nice tubular plastic box for the bits which is nice though a little less space efficient than it could be.Random related tip: For drilling small holes you can also use really thin sewing needles. Obviously they don't have the burrs for drilling, but they work for really thin soft sheets of metal like soda can foil. They work even better if you place the needle into a HSRT like a Dremel and turn it up to 30,000RPM, but I wouldn't exactly try to drill through stainless steel or anything 1"" thick with such a thing. Unlike drill bits though I can put a needle in the Dremel and grind it against a sharpening stone or fine sandpaper to get it the exact diameter I want, and they're so cheap that if I ruin one it's not a huge financial loss.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 15, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JO4ZI55TRQ2N/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001RJE3X8#wasThisHelpful","R3JO4ZI55TRQ2N","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

This probably doesn't make any difference but there it is anyway. The camera was set up to save only 14 bit losless RAW images to one card. (No JPEG or saving to two cards at once.)I put the camera in CH drive mode and held the button down so the buffer would fill. The LCD reported that when empty the buffer would hold 8 frames with these image settings. As soon as it filled I hit Start on a stopwatch, waited until the buffer free space indicator indicated ""r8"" again, and hit stop. I estimate my timing is probably off by +/- 1 sec.Both cards were freshly formatted in the camera itself by the camera, NOT a computer.After testing each card a few times, the camera took about 5-6s to clear the buffer regardless of which card I was using. So if there's any improvement at all then it's very very little.So there's no point in getting a UHS-1 card for your D7000. Just get a less expensive Class 10 like the SanDisk Extreme HD Video 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (SDSDRX3-016G-A21) etc.I'm going to send mine back and get some less expensive ones since these seem to offer no advantage.Anyway, I wish I could rate the card for it's own capabilities in the proper hardware, but I feel that I need to clarify that this card does NOT help speed up continuous shooting mode on a D7000.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LMOTIM5ZP67T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005LFT3QG#wasThisHelpful","R2LMOTIM5ZP67T","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Many people have mentioned that you can just use the 4486 Keyless Chuck all the time and just forget about the collets, so I wanted to mention some reasons (untested theoretical ones anyway) why people might want to use a collet in some situations vs the chuck. (Note that I have only used the collet and collet nut that came with my dremel so I can't truly comment on the quality of the ones in this specific optional set, but I wanted to make sure to mention some stuff about collets to people and thus am writing this based on the ones included with my tool which *should* be exactly the same as the ones in this set.)Reasons why the collets might be useful, at least in some situations: - While most people who use regular power tools like standard electric drills seem very unlikely to do stuff like wedge a small bit off-center between two of the chuck grips and tighten it down, or use way too little force to torque the nut down, there are a significant number of Dremel users that may not have any experience with heavier power tools or may just have poor strength in their hands. So the collets likely provide a good bit more security for those with less power tool experience or those who have trouble tightening the nut down. (If you think you do, use the included nut wrench every time, chuck or not!!!!) - If I had to bet, I'd say that the chuck probably has less gripping friction on the bits than the collets do simply due to the amount of surface area that tightens the bit down. Lower gripping friction would a factor for anyone, resulting in a higher chance of slipping when bits bind given equal torque on the nut for using s collet vs chuck. So it does seem like a good idea for anyone to use collets with heavy materials and accessories like cutting wheels that are more likely to bind and slip out.So in short, the collets are probably worthwhile for those with limited hand/arm strength (use the wrench anyway!!) or anyone who's working on heavy/thick materials with bits/situations that are more likely to bind. Since I don't usually fall into either of those situations though I'll probably just let mine sit in the toolbox 99% of the time and just use the chuck. But I would NOT say that the collets are totally useless to everyone in all situations.I'd still recommend buying the chuck though since not everything is going to fit in one of the collets.

"I bought these at a local hardware store so I'd have some bits suitable for my Dremel. They work just fine. I don't see anything wrong with these bits per se, but they don't seem to be anything particularly special. They seem like a safe bet since Dremel is branding them, and the price isn't that bad, but personally I'm going to end up buying a larger set of high speed bits anyway so I can have a more precise range of sizes and some smaller bits.As others have said, these and any other drill bits practically require that you have the Dremel 4486 MultiPro Keyless Chuck, which is something that lots of people recommend using with other accessories anyway. If you want to deal with a bunch of different sized collets then go for it, but I haven't been able to find any advantage to using collets with these instead of the chuck. I just use the chuck for everything and never use the collets.A bit of a bonus (yea bad pun) with these bits though: the little case that these bits come in will fit very securely in a slot on the ""crows nest"" (accessory holder) of the Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station drill press attachment. That makes it much harder to lose them should you happen to have the 220-01.No matter what you're doing I'd bet you're going to want some sort of drill bits for your Dremel. These are fine for the average Dremel user, but if you need smaller sizes and more intermediate sizes then you might want to consider other options for high speed rotary drill bits before buying this basic set.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2L2UOLYG98B1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000302Z3#wasThisHelpful","R2L2UOLYG98B1S","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This really is a big improvement over the standard camera strap. I was worried that I'd end up ramming my camera into things if it were hanging around my posterior, but my camera is much much more likely to hit stuff if it's just hanging around my neck on the standard camera strap that comes with pretty much all cameras out there.I've managed to carry my camera with this strap along with a backpack and a bunch of lighting equipment without any problems with stuff running into the camera.The fact that it attaches to the tripod hole is great since it can very easily be removed, which is highly desirable if you are placing your camera on a tripod. The standard strap is a serious pain to remove and would constantly get in my way when my camera was on a tripod. I was initially worried that the tripod screw might not be secure enough, but it appears that it's quite secure if screwed in tightly with your fingers. The strap has a very low friction swivel connected to the tripod connector, so if the camera ends up spinning around it doesn't end up applying any torque at all to the tripod screw. I feel quite secure with this arrangement.The only inconvenience I find with the tripod screw connector is that I usually leave this arca-swiss quick release plate on my camera so I can immediately put it on a tripod when I want, but I have to take that off and store it away in order to use the strap. If my QR plate had a tripod hole on it though then I could just screw the strap to the QR plate, so this is really more of a limitation of my QR plate anyway.I don't see any way anyone could go wrong with this strap. It's highly adjustable with a rather large size range so it seems unlikely that there's anyone it wouldn't fit.I have had the shoulder pad creep down my back before, but this doesn't usually seem to be a problem for me (so far anyway). So I'm subtracting a star because I think they could have done more to secure the shoulder pad.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RCTBS9T41TNG4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KD9BMS#wasThisHelpful","RCTBS9T41TNG4","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I agree with everyone who says that this chuck should be included with all of the Dremel tools. When I bought my Dremel I foolishly assumed that it would have a variable diameter drill chuck just like regular size electric drills, but apparently not. Luckily the guy at the hardware store warned me about this.Not only does this chuck replace multiple sizes of ""collets"" (the bit holder that comes with the tools), you can use it to hold other size things like different sized small drill bits from a regular drill set. I even used it to hold a really thin sewing needle so I could drill 0.49mm holes in thin soda-can type aluminum, and it worked just fine even holding something totally weird and unanticipated like a half-mm diameter manual sewing needle.So no matter which Dremel you buy, you really want to buy this chuck along with it. If you don't then you're very likely to find yourself buying it later anyway unless you only ever use the same three or four accessories (bits) that fit the size collet that comes with your tool, and never use any variety of drill bits.The chuck works well, you can tighten it down by hand (usually good enough) or use the little wrench to tighten/remove it, and it removes just as easily as the nut-and-collet that comes with your rotary tool. I just leave the chuck on my Dremel all the time and never use the collets at all.The only reason I can image the collets being useful is if you need absolutely zero ""wobble"" in the rotation of your accessory, which perhaps the collets would be better about, but there doesn't seem to be any noticable wobble using the chuck anyway. The sewing needle wobbled a little (not surprising since it was never intended to be used this way) but not enough to matter and I didn't notice any wobble with anything that might have a problem with wobble like the cutting wheels or grinder stones.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YSN8EQEME0RZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0000302ZV#wasThisHelpful","R1YSN8EQEME0RZ","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"First, let me just say that Dremel tools are pretty awesome and for the most part this one is no exception. Not sure how I survived this long without one!The only real problem with this model is that, for what I do, the battery doesn't last long enough. I basically can't finish whatever I'm working on before it runs out. Yea, I should probably get a corded model, but I've got too many cords around that I don't want to deal with and really want to find a cordless solution even if I'm not out working in the wilderness with no AC power. Instead I've taken the 7700 back to Lowes and I bought the Dremel 8000-03 10.8-Volt Lithium Ion Cordless Rotary Tool from Amazon which, though almost twice the price, should be sufficient for what I need. I also bought an extra battery for the 8000 in case I need it, which I probably will.Another problem with the 7700 battery is that it's a NiCd (pronounced nai-cad) which is essentially 1980s technology. It's been so long since anyone really used NiCd AA batteries in most things that I wouldn't be surprised if most people don't know what they are anymore. Anyway, NiCd batteries generally aren't used anymore because they're inferior in almost every way to NiMH (Nickel Metal-Hydride) batteries which are what you get if you go to the drugstore these days and buy rechargable AAs. (The only real exception is that one company is selling NiZn, or Nickel Zinc, batteries which are new tech and in some ways better than the usual NiMH.)They reason Dremel is using NiCd batteries in this model is that, unlike most NiMH batteries, they can output large amounts of current (like 10 amps) with reasonable efficiency compared to NiMH batteries. (Most NiMH's start to waste a large percentage of their charge if a device tries to pull more than just 1 amp, and thus they drain too fast in high power devices, aside from some specialized ones that are very rare outside of RC model battery packs and some high power flashlights. These days NiMH are good enough for most people because most people use them in relatively low-power electronic devices that only draw around 1 amp.)NiCd batteries are still used in higher power applications (like this Dremmel and stuff like remote controlled model vehicles) because they have higher capacity than most other types of batteries, are cheaper than the higher tech specialized NiMH and Li-Ion (lithium ion) batteries, and are still good enough most of the time. A big problem with them is that they lose their charge much faster than say Li-ion batteries if you let them sit on the shelf idle. So if you are going to put the 7700 in the closet and only use it every 3 months, the battery will probably be dead (or nearly so) every time you pull it out to use it meaning that you'll always have to wait 3 hours to charge the battery when you need to use it. Leaving the battery on the charger all the time is a bad idea because it will wear out the battery or otherwise do something bad to it.So overall, the 7700 is a good tool aside from the battery capacity and run time. It might be perfectly good if you get some extra batteries, just don't run it for long periods at a stretch, and don't tend to leave it idle in the closet for months at a time. (For example, if you only used it for sharpening some tool blade every month then the battery might last long enough for that.)Some other things about the 7700: - Two speeds seem to be enough, so I wouldn't worry much about the limited number of speeds. Most of the time you can just use 20,000 RPM on just about anything except for plastic. A few accessories (bits) should be used at 10,000 RPM on softer metals like aluminum. I think the only thing slower than 10,000 RPM speeds would come in handy for is slowing down grinding or sanding in some cases to help make more accurate thickness things, etc., but I'm not sure. Some bits might require slower speeds than 10,000 but I'm pretty sure none of them actually require anything faster than 20,000RPM.) - The thing only comes with one ""collet"" which is like a drill chuck that can only hold one size (diameter) bit. That's kind of dumb. Whatever Dremel you buy you REALLY need to get the Dremel 4486 MultiPro Keyless Chuck because otherwise you'll have to buy other size collets, at the least, and some small drill bits aren't going to work in any of the collets. The keyless chuck appears to be able to hold any tool you want up to it's maximum diameter. (I actually put a small thin sewing pin in it and used it to drill a hole in thin aluminum.) So unless you start running into some sort of problem with the chuck and certain bits that I don't know about, you can probably just put it on and leave it there all the time like I do. I don't know why they don't just include the chuck with all of the Dremels. - There's no safety lock on the power switch. Instead of this you're supposed to take the battery out to avoid accidentally turning it on while changing bits, which is actually not unlikely to happen. This is kind of bad in my opinion. Though the thing isn't usually as dangerous as a circular saw, some sort of safety interlock is pretty standard on power tools and it seems like they ought to have them on theirs. - Unlike other ones like the 8000, this one will just slow down as the battery starts to run out. It won't just refuse to run once the battery is too low. This is actually good because... (see next) - NiCd batteries have a ""memory effect"" where if you often charge the battery when it's already half charged, it will essentially cease to work when it's half drained just as though it had been totally drained. For this reason you're going to want to FULLY drain the battery before charging, preferably every time, but at least maybe every 2-3 recharges. When the battery gets low and the tool starts to slow down to the point where it's useless, you can just set the tool somewhere safe and leave it on until it completely stops running and then charge the battery back up. - It would seem that you can use it with the Dremel 220-01 Rotary Tool Work Station even though the 7700 isn't mentioned on the list of tools it supports. You just have to unscrew that collar below the shank where the chuck/collets screw on, and it can be a little difficult to even tell that there's a collar there. The 7700 at least can be bolted into the drill press ""Work Station"", but I never used it enough to tell if there's some issue with actually using it that way. - The 7700 is pretty light which is ideal for a lot of small work. The next lightest cordless with similar capability seems to be the 8000.Lastly, Dremel's documentation is really poor. Their manual seems to exist for the purpose of giving you safety warnings to keep them from getting sued, and actually telling you about the tool seems to be an afterthought.So, in summary, the 7700 isn't THAT bad unless the battery capacity and self-discharge issues are going to cause you problems. If so then you might as well just spend more money on something like the 8000 or get a similar corded model. Otherwise you're going to have to buy probably at least 2 extra batteries or just periodically wait 3 hours to continue whatever you're working on.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIDFQ7UWONNL7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002BACCDA#wasThisHelpful","RIDFQ7UWONNL7","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Fuji FP-100C is good stuff, and I can't really add too much to what others have written already, but note that some vendors aren't very upfront about what the expiration date is on the film they're selling. Before ordering I'd look to see if they tell you upfront what the deal is.So Tip #1:There's nothing wrong with buying expired FP-100C as long as it's only been expired a few months (in my experience anyway, though as always it depends on how well the stuff was stored) but vendors should state UP FRONT if they're selling an expired product and what the expiration date was. When reputable vendors sell expired film AS expired film, especially at a discount, that's a good thing.What's not good is when the vendor doesn't say the film is expired and you get a bunch of foil pouches that have been removed from their boxes with no expiration date evident. If this happens (as it has to me) I would personally ask the vendor for an explanation even if the film is good and complain if the date wasn't listed anywhere.Tip #2:A tip for users of old Polaroid 250 Automatic and similar older cameras: The original polaroid pack film packs were made of metal, and there are a couple of strip springs on the inside of the camera back door that push in on the film pack. This can cause serious problems with the modern plastic packs like in the FP-100C such as jamming of the film and tearing off the paper tabs, etc.I wasted almost an entire pack of film because of this problem before I realized what was going on, did some research, and finally ripped out the springs. Don't take my word for it, but search around on modifications for your camera and see if you might want to remove the springs in yours too. If you're having trouble pulling sheets out of the thing without tearing off the pull tabs then you probably want to consider this simple modification.After removing these springs in my Polaroid 250 I can easily pull film sheets out of it now and I'm having no problems with light leaks or any sort of drawback, even after carrying the camera around in very bright direct sunlight for 2 hours. I'm no longer afraid of destroying the film pack every time I pull a sheet out of the thing now.Tip #3:For those reclaiming the negatives (cleaning the black anti-halation coating off the back with bleach), a couple of things I've learned: 1) getting that ""splashless"" or ""high efficiency gel"" laundry bleach seems to make this process much easier. 2) If you underexpose the shot (for example, turn the exposure adjustment to ""darker"" on the automatic cameras) then you'll get a print that's too dark, but the negative seems to give you better color quality. I think it's probably because the dye isn't intended for a transmissive light negative and so underexposure makes a thinner negative which gives you more transparent dye that transmits more light and scans better. Like I say though, an optimal negative seems to require that you make a print that's too dark so you have to make a choice of whether it;s the negative or print you want better.Tip #4:You can apparently just leave your film unpeeled for at least a couple of hours, if not more, after shooting without having to worry about overdeveloping the film. The chemistry in the FP-100C seems to neutralize itself after the right amount of time. NOT peeling the print and neg apart can make it much easier to transport/preserve the exposed film without getting stuff stuck to it. I've compared shots peeled after the correct time to shots peeled 3 hours or more later and they look the same. Trying to keep the sticky negative or print surface emulsions from trying to react with things touching them seems to be terribly difficult, so consider just not peeling the film immediately if you don't need to. Also if you do this try to wipe off the extra goop at the end of the print since that can still get on things even if you don't peel the film apart.Anyway.... FP-100C.... great stuff! The most fun I've had with film in ages!!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RYJ5TGN4VGKX8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002G3O5IM#wasThisHelpful","RYJ5TGN4VGKX8","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not going to write the usual review here, because lets face it.... people don't buy this format of instant film anymore just to get photos with the best image quality or the cheapest photos. Though perhaps some customers would be owners of legacy systems that still need this film to keep doing what they've been doing, if you're reading this then you're most likely interested in film photography for some sort of artistic reason.I originally bought this stuff for test exposures using Polaroid backs for Hasselblad and Mamiya medium format cameras, but later I decided to buy an old 1967 Polaroid 250 Land Camera off of eBay for $60 to see what I could do with whatever of this film is still being made. Best purchase ever!In the process of messing around I found that people were able to actually reclaim the negatives from these peel-apart films by using household bleach to dissolve the opaque black anti-halation coating on the non-emulsion side of the negative. (The negative is the part that you peel off and normally throw away because once it's been exposed to light and transferred its dye to the print its intended job is done. The thing is that it still has a negative image and you can still use it in an enlarger or film scanner if you can just get the thick black coating off the other side of it.)So now I basically take some shots on these, keep the negatives rather than toss them out, let them dry, then use bleach to remove the anti-halation coating on them. To see the process, do a search for ""Fuji FP-100C Negative Reclamation"". There are a bunch of videos on youtube and there's no generally agreed-upon ""right way"" to do it.The best tips aren't well documented anywhere I know of, so here's what I've learned so far:- Using Clorox High Efficiency Bleach Gel or some sort of similar ""gel"" type bleach works much better than regular bleach, but you can use standard laundry bleach or even bleach-based cleaners like Tilex Mold & Mildew Remover as long as the cleaner contains a high concentration of bleach. Stuff like Goo Gone, Goof Off, etc does not work.- If you want to get all artistic, you can use a paintbrush to brush the bleach gel on certain areas of the black coating, wait, then rinse the dissolved area away to get interesting borders around the negative. As you might imagine, other techniques are possible as well.- People use various methods for keeping the bleach off of the emulsion, but I find that if you slap the thing emulsion side down on a wet piece of glass and squeeze the water out from under it (sticking it to the glass) then it's rather hard for the bleach to get under the negative to damage the emulsion. Just make sure to start rinsing the bleach off from the middle of the negative so you don't flush water, and bleach, under the negative while you're trying to rinse the top off.- you MUST let the negative dry before doing anything, otherwise the emulsion comes off too easily.- After you initially let it dry, it seems that it's probably better to remove the black coating before washing the excess developer reagent ""goop"" off of the emulsion side. So use bleach, wash black stuff off, then wash the emulsion side off to remove any excess goop. Assuming you let the negative dry after peeling it off the print, you should be able to rub the emulsion with your finger under running water to get the reagent goop off.- Bleach will definitely cause the emulsion to come off. You can intentionally apply bleach around the edge of the emulsion to cause this to happen in a somewhat controlled manner to get a border effect or whatever.- After rinsing the negative off really well, it's best to dip it in photoflo to prevent streaking/bubbling during the drying. I actually don't have any photoflo so I've been messing with Finish Jet-Dry Drying Agent, Turbo Dry which is a very similar non-ionic surfactant.After all of this is done, you have a negative that you can use in a scanner, enlarger, contact print, etc. The quality isn't exactly perfect but it's better than you'd probably think.Have fun!

"I'm a photo student. I'm studying everything about photography. I'm not an urban hipster. I don't look like an urban hipster. I have absolutely no inherent ""lo-fi"" photography bias due to some sort of artsy hipster social background. It's just something that I'm messing with because I'm sleeping, eating, and breathing all sorts of photography 24-7.I bought this because it's the prototypical ""crappy toy camera"" and I wanted to see what I could do with it's limited capabilities. It's part of an optional assignment and I'm playing with film right now, so why not.The first thing that everyone should know is that this is not really a toy or an inexpensive alternative camera, but rather a modern ""remake"" of a primitive camera intended to allow those who understand, or are learning to understand, the photographic process in detail to reproduce certain ""vintage"" photographic styles and push the limits of what can be done with primitive technology.The Holga 120N has the following features for ""advanced"" photographers:- They use medium format 120 roll film. This is film that is a little more than 6cm wide... it is NOT 35mm. Normally this film is used in expensive Hasselblad or Mamiya cameras and is thus not usually sold at drug stores and gas stations. Not every photo lab will process it.- There IS a ""bulb"" exposure mode, which means that you can keep the shutter open as long as you keep holding down the shutter button. You have to know what you're doing with this or all you'll do is waste a shot of film.- Whether ""bulb"" mode is turned on or off, there's nothing stopping you from exposing the film multiple times without advancing the roll. There's also nothing stopping you from advancing the film too far, too little, or never advancing it at all. Other than the little window on the back, and perhaps counting the clicks of the film winder, there's nothing to tell you how far to turn the thing to get to the next unexposed frame. There's absolutely nothing to tell you if the current frame has already been exposed.These are all things that can be exploited by advanced photographers to create interesting effects, but for anyone else they're just annoying hazards.Limitations of the camera that can only be overcome by a somewhat knowledgeable photographer in most situations:- There are only two aperture settings. To make things worse, the f-numbers that these supposedly correspond to (supposedly f/8 for ""sunny"" and f/11  for ""cloudy"" or whatever that icon is supposed to be) are reportedly bogus. They may not be accurate from camera to camera, depending on when it was made. Reportedly all you ever get is f/13, though supposedly on some newer ones the switch actually does do something or the other.- There's only one shutter speed not counting ""bulb"" mode: 1/100s- There's no way to focus visually with the viewfinder and with apertures like f/8 or f/11 the focus ring has to be set somewhat intelligently to have any chance of getting a subject within the in-focus depth of field.- Aside from using bulb mode or multiple exposures in some situations, you have practically no control of the exposure aside from film ISO and push/pull processing.If you don't know what I'm talking about, but do want to learn then great! If you don't know and don't care then you probably don't want to buy this camera.The charming lo-fi features of the camera:- It has a simplistic high-dispersion plastic lens that softens focus the way transparent plastic does and does little or nothing to correct for the various optical distortions caused by simple spherical single-element lenses. If you're not trying to intentionally take photos with these properties then for the same money you can get a camera with a more modern design that at least has a lens made of glass.- There's little or nothing in the design to prevent light from reflecting off of slick surfaces inside the camera, contaminating the film with random reflections.- The gaps between parts (like the back and the rest of the camera) aren't sealed particularly well, so light leaks through and reflects off of surfaces, contaminating the film with stray light.Some tips for those using these for the first time:- Tape down the sliding things that lock the back on after loading the camera. The back will come open way too easily if you don't. Light leaks may be hipster cool but having the back come off just results in totally ruined film.- Light will leak through the little frame number view window (red plastic) in the back and contaminate regular panchromatic film (which responds to red light). How bad this is depends on how bright the ambient light is, and whether or not you're using one of the included (6x6 or 6x4.5) film masks. You can either ignore than and get the hipster light leaks, or you can cover the red window with tape. If you cover it then you can either open it up briefly under subdued light to see when you've advanced the film one frame, or you can figure out how many ""clicks"" of the winder need to go by before one frame has advanced and count those when winding.- You may want to write ""1/100s"" and ""f/8 - f/11"" on the camera to remind you of what the aperture settings and shutter speed are if you actually believe what the manual says they are.- You may want to write the approximate focus distances corresponding to each of the icons on the focus ring. I wrote my own focusing scale on the thing using a silver paint marker.- Use the light meter in a manual mode camera to give you an idea of what sort of lighting conditions are going to work with f/8 and 1/100s with the ISO of film you have in the thing. There's probably no point in walking around metering for every shot, but you should at least get some idea if your film is going to require direct sunlight, shade on a sunny day, work ok with overcast sky, or work inside in rooms with lots of of windows on sunny days. Even at ISO 3200, bright artificial office lighting probably won't be enough for indoor conditions.- If possible, try to shoot a whole roll of film in approximately the same lighting conditions so you can push/pull process the film to compensate for over/underexposure. For example, if you know that bright office lighting won't quite be enough but you want to try it anyway, shoot the whole roll under that lighting so you can push process the film (to get a higher effective ISO out of it).Overall I'd say, not bad for $30 if you want to be able to do some of the things that the lack of ""idiot proofing"" features allow and you want to recreate some lo-fi effects, but don't waste your money on the camera, film, and processing if you don't know what you're getting into. These things are also great for making your own modifications since the worst you can do is destroy the thing, losing $30.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23NCFWAJDVC6V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000AL8JKW#wasThisHelpful","R23NCFWAJDVC6V","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this case to protect my Lytro light field camera, not a Sony camcorder, so my use case is a bit atypical.As of this time there's no official case of any sort, and maybe only one expensive third-party case, for the brand new Lytro cameras and i was tired of trying to gingerly carry my Lytro around without damaging it. I saw some people recommend this case on one of the Lytro forums and decided to try it out.For the Lytro it isn't that bad. The case is maybe 30% larger than needed in all three dimensions, so the fit is a bit loose, but not so loose as to compromise safety. The padding is thick enough that dropping this on the floor with my Lytro in it wouldn't bother me at all, and the stitching and such is solid, so it does work as a Lytro case with the main drawback being that it's bulkier than it needs to be for a Lytro. It also has a little pouch for the USB cable.If the case were better designed in general though, I'd probably give it at least 4 stars, but unfortunately the overall design of the case is rather medicore regardless of what device you store in it. Problems:- It has this long shoulder strap that can't be removed without cutting it off (which I'm tempted to do). A shoulder strap for such a tiny case seems awkward to me, I'll never use it, and I hate that I can't non-destructively remove it.- There is a belt loop, but the loop is oriented to hold the case horizontally which, being a single loop in the middle, isn't sufficient to properly support a case this long. So you can put it on yout belt, but it flops around and is otherwise less wieldy than it would be if the loop allowed it to hang down vertically.This thing should really be designed more like a ""fanny pack"", or it should at the absolute minimum be possible to somehow remove the strap without damaging it.So while this case will do the job of protecting my Lytro for now, I'm not satisfied with it and will continute to look for something better. if you have a Lytro or anything else, you might want to keep looking before you buy this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QQNBA5DZG6R8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LQ1BWK#wasThisHelpful","R2QQNBA5DZG6R8","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the Epson Ultra Premium luster and glossy paper for quite some time on my Stylus R3000, and it's become my standard  ""just works"" paper for when I want near maximum-quality photo paper with a standard finish that ""just works"" with my printer without messing with ICC profiles or advanced printer settings. I've only recently gotten around to printing anything this large on photo paper though.This larger sized paper seems to be no different in quality than the smaller cuts with the same product name. Because of this I'd recommend going though at least 50 sheets of 8.5x11 or even 4x6 of the same type  to become familiar with what it looks like before dropping the cash for large sizes like this, but if you're already familiar with smaller Ultra Premium Luster then you know what you're going to get with this stuff.Other papers out there by companies like Red River are nicer in various ways, and less expensive per square inch, but at the very least they're going to require their own ICC profiles and possibly printer setting tweaking. If you need to just show up at some place where there's an Epson printer or othetrwise can't get full control of the printing process due to lack of time or whatever, the Epson Ultra Premium papers are always the thing to use when you need the best quality output possible without any special configuration or calibration.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2562JON4G5G97/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00006B7P6#wasThisHelpful","R2562JON4G5G97","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm a photographer and discharge AA batteries like crazy, especially with flash units. Until now I've just been using a La Crosse BC-9009 (older model of the La Crosse BC1000), which is great, but it only charges 4 batteries at a time. Given that my camera grip uses 6 batteries, I really needed something that could charge at least 6 at a time if not more.So far so good with this thing. I've used it to recondition batteries (I suspect that the La Crosse probably does a better job at that) and charge them in both soft and fast modes (mostly soft). Batteries come out fully charged with no issues. So far I've tried Powerex, Imedion, Eneloop, and some old Energizers that were never very good to begin with. I've also charged AAAs and both AAs and AAAs at the same time with no issues. The recondition process that it uses also seems to be quite fast compared to the BC-9009, though that kind of makes me wonder if that's an indication that it isn't as thorough.One nice thing is that the controls are simple, just one button to put it in soft charge mode (it defaults to fast charge) and another button to put it in recondition mode. That speeds configuration a bit compared to smart chargers with lots of features like the BC-9009, and makes it easy enough to control that my mother could do it.I'm a little skeptical of the ""soft charge"" mode only being 2h long instead of longer, but perhaps this doesn't matter with the pulse charging technique that this uses. Normally in my BC-9009 I charge at 250mA if I'm not in a hurry, and it takes many hours. (Slow charging is supposed to be better for NiMH batteries long term.) So at 2h for the ""soft"" charge I'm not sure exactly how soft it is.I'm very happy with this thing at this point, though I've only been using it a few weeks, though I of course plan to keep the 4 battery BC-9009.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVPIUL555J0DN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000E5S648#wasThisHelpful","RVPIUL555J0DN","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BACKGROUND: I've been using this for exposure testing with Hasselblad and Mamiya (medium format) cameras. Yes, some people still use these things without digital backs, especially for educational purposes. For those who aren't familiar with pre-digital medium format photography, these cameras have backs that contain the film which can be removed from the camera without exposing the film. Unlike a 35mm, you can put some instant film into a ""polaroid back"", load a roll of 120 negative film into a 120 film back, put the polaroid back on the camera to get some instant feedback as to whether your setup is working, take two shots, then switch the back to the 120 for taking the real photos. This was particularly important when you had multiple thousands of dollars invested in a studio setup for a several hour shoot and you needed some assurance that your camera and settings were working properly. You could then switch the backs again when something changed without wasting all of your unused film. This also allowed people to change the ISO on cameras without wasting film before digital sensors. At this point you hopefully have new appreciation for how the average consumer with a $100 camera can now switch ISO settings at will and view their photos immediately.ACTUAL REVIEW: The FP-3000B works well for what I'm using it for. Using a Sekonic exposure chart, I took a +/- 1 stop 3 shot bracket of the chart with this film to help me calibrate my light meter for the film/camera and test the exposure latitude of the film. The chart basically has gray patches with 50% reflectance in the middle with patches going down and up +/- 2 stops in reflectance in 1/6th stop increments. When properly exposed, the FP-3000B shows detail in the whole 4 stop range of the chart. Given that the lightest patch shows up as barely darker than the white of the paper, and the darkest patch is very slightly lighter than total black, it's clear that the film has a 4 stop (4EV) exposure latitude which is pretty good.So, if you're using a light meter, just make sure that the darkest significant areas are no more than -2EV from correct exposure and the lightest areas are no more than 2EV from correct and you should get detail everywhere. (If you don't have a dedicated light meter, take a (D)SLR and use the spot meter in that to meter a scene to give you a general idea of what parts of the scene are light or dark enough to render detail.So, good stuff for fancy expensive medium-formay pro cameras, and no doubt just as good for ""vintage"" consumer cameras as well. Just don't get the nasty chemicals from the peel-off on your skin or clothing. That stuff is caustic and bleaches fabric.Glad that Fuji is still making this stuff, even if they've killed off pretty much all other versions of the instant B&W film.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27Y7YFBF641QL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001G70M6S#wasThisHelpful","R27Y7YFBF641QL","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought these because I need more low discharge batteries for certain situations. Normally I use the regular high-capacity Powerex batteries in things like my camera and flashes, and they work great because I use up their charge quickly and recharge them immediately. But some flash units I have sit around a while between use and I need those to be ready to go when required.If it weren't for these I'd probably just buy the lower capacity Eneloop batteries because I'm not willing to shell out cash for the super-expensive Eneloop XX ones, but the Imedion seem to be just the same except with slightly lower capacity. 200 more mAh in the XX aren't worth double the cost to me.First thng I did with these is put four of them in my LaCrosse battery charger and put it in test mode with the slowest charge current. On their first discharge/charge it says they hold about 2200mAh. That's pretty good for the first cycle. (They shoud demonstrate full capacity after 2-3 more cycles.) I didn't have a way to measure the charge they came with, but I'd probably discharge and recharge them first anyway because these ""already charged"" batteries never come with a full charge. (After all, they may be low discharge, but they still discharge and so will be a bit lower than full capacity after sitting around in a warehouse for a few months.)So I can't say how well they compare in terms of discharge rate yet, but so far they're proving to be quite good.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R23WFFEIOOXAHL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00478VMT4#wasThisHelpful","R23WFFEIOOXAHL","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought two bundles of two of these (four total) so I could use them as a remote shutter release and trigger 2 flashes. They come with cables that allow you to connect tranceivers to PC connector ports which is what I need to do ""corded flash metering"" with my light meter. When I got them I did some pretty thorough testing on them.Unfortunately the PC cables in all four boxes are not designed to spec. The 2.5mm connectors that plug into the transceivers seem to actually be 2mm wide, and 12mm long (instead of 2.5mm wide 10mm long). This causes them to be too loose in the ports causing a really bad connection. If I try to use these cables then the transceivers trigger less than half the time. Pulling the connectors out slightly increases the success rate (apparently the extra 2mm of length, if nothing else, is causing a problem.)These cables were bad in four different boxes, so this isn't a random manufacturing defect. It seems like they got a whole batch of cables from some bad supplier that weren't manufactured to the proper spec of 2.5mm wide and 10mm long. Apparently they didn't test them with their own connection ports before shipping them out.I tested all of the cables with my camera, light meter, and all four tansceivers, so I know it isn't a device problem or a problem with the transceivers.Luckily the 2.5mm to 3.5mm cables work just fine. The 2.5mm connectors on those are actually 2.5mm wide and 10mm long, and they fit very securely into the transceivers.I contacted their support department about the PC cable problem via email, so we'll see how they handle it. I'll relate my experience and raise my rating to four stars if they fix it without too much trouble.Aside from that problem, they work pretty well. I have no problem triggering the shutter or flashes as long as I'm using the 3.5mm cables and/or hot shoe connectors. The only things that I wish were different are that you have to hold down the remote's large button halfway and press the channel change button to manually trigger the flash. If you press the large button (shutter release button) it'll just try to trigger the shutter and do nothing if no transceiver is plugged into the shutter release port. This awkward way to trigger the flashes manually wouldn't be so bad except in situations where you need to do multi-flash exposures or otherwise fire the flashes manually for some reason, such as during long exposures. For the awkward manual triggering I'm subtracting one star. Most people may not care about this but I do a lot of multiflash and other manually fired flash exposures.It's great that they have the 1/4-20 threaded hole in the bottom for mounting the transceivers on light stands with the right threaded post (same size used on tripods) but I really wish they had cold shoe mounts on the bottom also for stands that only have the cold shoe holder.So aside from the included PC cables that are incompatible with the product they were included with, I think these are pretty good. Considering that they're almost double the price of the [[ASIN:B004YW79F4 Yongnuo RF-603s] though, it's rather disappointing that they come with bad PC cables and lack an easy manual/test firing button.Last note: I bought the Nikon version. It seems that each transceiver comes in a different box with either the 10 pin shutter cable for the D300's etc, or the ""GPS port"" shutter cable for the D7000s and below. BUT they've been bundled in sets of two such that you get one of the boxes with the 10 pin, and another box with the GPS port cable. Therefore you get both cables and can use them with both types of connectors if you buy this set. If you buy an individual transceiver though you'll just get one cable or the other. So if you buy the transceivers individually, make sure at least one of them comes with the cable you need.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWJ0F9PL1EUJR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005ODJ522#wasThisHelpful","RWJ0F9PL1EUJR","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this to essentially replace both the 18-105mm DX ""kit"" lens that came with my D7000, and my 70-300mm consumer-level FX/full-frame lens.I'm not disappointed. I used to carry both of those around and they not only take up lots of space, but fishing a lens out of a bag to switch lenses is an annoying and potentially opportunity-losing  proposition. The 18-105mm is decent for most random ""walking around range"" photography, but switch to the 70-300mm when you need more focal length and you find that the minimum of 70mm can be annoyingly limited when you're not sure what you'll encounter. You're more likely to miss some brief wider angle opportunity well before you can switch lenses.The solution is this 18-200mm. No, it doesn't manage 300mm like my longer zoom lens, but I'm not too worried about that since I find that I seldom need 300mm on my DX/APS-C camera at a moment's notice. If I were willing to spend almost twice as much on the 28-300mm full-frame lens I could get 300mm, but then I'd lose the 18mm wide angle that's rather useful to me with a DX/APS-C format camera like the D7000. In short, 200mm is good enough and keeping 18mm is really important.Do not expect the optical quality or speed of a prime lens or narrower focal range zoom! The main point of this lens is it's ""superzoom"" wide-angle to telephoto range, not speed or the absolute best optical quality that physics allow. I'm pretty sure you're not going to find an 18-200mm continuous f/2.8 lens, especially for this price, and you're unlikely to find anything with close to that range that doesn't suffer from some falloff or distortion at most focal lengths. It's still a zoom lens, and a zoom lens that's pushing limits as well. Optical design is difficult, and some things like variable focal length pose serious challenges with the elements that correct stuff like the spherical distortion enemy of sharp focus. Imaging having to vary all of the spherical and chromatic distortion, astigmatism, and other correcting elements as the focal length changes. Changing distance between all lens elements might not be enough to correct everything perfectly at all focal lengths; likely the actual *shape* of elements would need to change as focal lengths vary. Assuming the technology even exists, you could expect to pay astronomical $$$ for it.Regarding sharp focus: I'm not convinced that this lens has any problems beyond the usual, but I do plan to use the autofocus fine-tune on my D7000 to calibrate the autofocus as well as possible for the focal range I usually use. I've had some lenses, especially wide-aperture lenses like f/1.8, that seriously benefited from some autofocus fine-tuning. Unfortunately you'll need at least a D7000 to get the fine-tune feature, and if a lens is seriously off then it probably needs to go back to Nikon for adjustment as part of the warranty.VR II performance: I think it's actually better than my other VR lenses but haven't compared carefully. I'm impressed.Focus range: The specs say 20"", but I seem to be able to get a sharp image at 8"" away, at any focal length. I think they must mean 20cm NOT 20"". At 200mm the frame on my D7000 is about 3 3/4"". Supposedly that's a 1:4.5 reproduction ratio which is good enough that some manufacturers would make the exaggerated claim that such is a ""macro"" lens.In summary: this lens won't replace all lenses in this focal range, but it does a respectable job of getting 18-200mm on your camera at one time. You're still going to need prime lenses and/or (expensive) continuous-aperture zoom lenses with wider apertures and less focal length variability.I'm happy enough with this lens that I'll probably sell my 18-105mm and 70-300mm lenses. (Arguably I should keep the latter in case I get a full-frame camera, but if I get one of those then hopefully I'll be able to just get the 28-300mm full-frame lens.) This 18-200mm lens almost delivers on Ken Rockwell's slightly exaggerated ""replaces a whole bag of lenses"" claim, but if I carry a camera bag it's certainly going to have at least one other lens in it depending on what I'm doing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3998EPKDMQKBF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002JCSV8A#wasThisHelpful","R3998EPKDMQKBF","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

(In other words, I connect my camera to my computer while I'm actually taking photos so I can see the processed images as I take them.) Since it's practically impossible to have your camera connected to a computer with a 5' cable and still use it to take photos, I ordered the AmazonBasics USB 2.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters) (which is a very good quality product for the price). Combined with the 5' cable my now 15' total length cable was really quite sufficient for most photography in the small studio bay I was using... well, most of the time.So I decided that I needed even more freedom to move around, and ordered this extension cable. I haven't used it much yet, but I ran some tests with my camera + 5' cable +10' extension + this 32' cable and had no connection problems over 3 hours or so of constantly staying connected and visible to the software. Note that I didn't use the cable with ""live view"" (same as having the computer use the camera as a remote video camera, basically) so there weren't data constantly being transmitted, but I did take lots of photos at various times (filling up the camera's RAM buffer so it's transmitting as fast as possible) and no issues there.The repeater on this cable is all the way on the far-side (away from the computer, etc) rather than in the middle of the cable. This is good because the repeater is a hub, and this lets you get another 5m of cable length with a regular cable. My guess is that you should also be able to connect at least one more active cable to this one as well.Note that the USB limit on cable length (5m or about 15') still applies to the repeater. So my 15' normal cable with no repeater is the longest normal cable that you can plug into an active extension cable. Longer than that and it may not work so well depending on whether or not the repeater exceeds USB specs or something.Another thing to be aware of is that the repeater uses up USB bus power. A normal ""high power"" USB port supplies 500mA, and the repeater claims that it needs 100mA to power itself. Since the repeater has no other power source, it can't ""pass through"" more than 400mA. (These values are approximate since, in reality, the amount of power is going to differ from what the hardware and specs say it should be.) Therefore if you use the cable to connect up a bus powered USB device (one that doesn't normally need to be plugged into the wall because it gets all of its power via USB), it can't be one that uses more than around 400mA. If it does, then the device will exhibit erratic behavior or fail to work at all because the repeater will incorrectly tell the device that it has 500mA on its 400mA port. (See TECHNICAL DETAIL below for the excruciating detail.)The female connector on the cable has a tight fit which is good since it would otherwise be too easy for the next cable to fall out.Lastly, I like this product overall and figure that it's similar to other such cables, but for what I do I wish the cabling were more flexible like the previously mentioned Amazon Basics 10' cable (which lays on the floor like a piece of nylon rope). This is no doubt a trade-off with the fact that the thing has thick shielding and thick outer insulation which has the benefit of making it more durable. The amount of flexibility is only going to matter to you if you're using the cable with a handheld device though, since it's perfectly fine for fixed placement behind desks and such. So for most people this extra durability tradeoff is all gain.I'd give this 5 stars, but I'm subtracting a star for the fact that the repeater falsely claims an output of 500mA when ""asked"" by a device via the USB protocol. Normally this will NOT be an issue for people as long as they realize that they can't use the cable with a ""full power"" USB device like the USB-Powered Portable LED Monitor I have. Since the cable flexibility won't be an issue for most people, and arguably it's worth the extra durability, I wouldn't lower the rating for that.TECHNICAL DETAILNon-engineers can ignore this section.The repeater is actually a full USB hub and is detected as such by the USB drivers.I decided that I wanted to figure out exactly what was going on with the repeater power-wise (after all, the thing must be consuming some power and can't pass all 500mA through it), so I did a bit of USB logging/probing to see what it was telling the USB driver on my mac. I used the standard OS X utility ""USB Prober"" along with the USB kernel extension for logging USB events and querying devices for their descriptors. The cable was plugged directly into a port on the MacBook.First off, the repeater is using a generic 4 port USB hub chip(set) which says it's made by Terminus Technology Inc. Even though it  says it has 4 ports, obviously only one of them has a connector, resulting in a ""1 port hub"" as odd as that sounds. The repeater is telling the USB controller (root hub) in the computer that it needs 100mA (out of the 500mA) fom the port. Essentially that's how much power it ""asks"" for and how much it claims the hub/repeater hardware needs. Assuming that it's not lying and actually using significantly less or more than 100mA, that leaves 400mA that it can use to power it's own port.So the repeater is basically telling the computer that it's a self-powered hub (such as the type you plug into a wall), but ""self powering"" itself off of the bus power from the port on the computer instead of a wall wart. This isn't toally unreasonable, but the repeater is *claiming* to downstream devices that it's single powered port will supply 500mA. Obviously that's not going to happen unless the thing contains a free energy machine or something.So if you plug a device that uses 400mA (or however much is available on the port in reality) or less then you should be OK; the bus power ""passes through"" the repeater with (what it claims is) 100mA drained off of it. So your device gets power.Unfortunately, if you plug in a device that ""asks"" for and needs 500mA of power (or more than 400 anyway), the repeater will falsely claim that it can supply 500mA on the port. As a result, the attached device won't get the power it needs and will exibit some sort of dysfunctional behavior depending on what it is. Sometimes this may be immediately obvious, but some devices may fail at random during usage when they suddenly try to use full power. Normally the hub wouldn't ""lie"" about the power and so this wouldn't happen. (I beileve the chipset that they're using isn't capable of ""believing"" it has less than 500mA on one of it's powered ports. This in fact may be true of all USB hub chipsets for all I know. But this chipset, unlike more sophisticated ones, does say that it isn't capable of tracking different amounts of power usage on different ports, so it may simply assume 500mA on all ports and have no ability to track total power available.)This probably isn't terribly bad as you can't expect an active repeater to consume no power, thus there's no way you can get 500mA through such a cable no matter what. And as long as your aware of the issue (essentially some bus-powered devices will work and some won't) then you'll have some idea what you can use it for.I don't know how many of these cables you are supposed to be able to connect in series, but in theory you should be able to connect more, using up another 100mA for each one. The repeater on each cable is going to claim it can output 500mA, making the current mismatch issue worse as you go. The signal delay caused by so many hubs in series might make this impractical before you ran out of current though. I'm pretty sure you should be able to connect 2 of these in series, but I'm not sure I'd try more than that. It's also going to depend on whether the cable is plugged into a hub that's plugged into a hub, etc, because USB has a maximum ""depth"" (number of hubs that can be connected in series) and will just refuse to work beyond that.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 4, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18SDAAPRXZ92E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004AGX4YO#wasThisHelpful","R18SDAAPRXZ92E","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Normally I use Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 for everything, but it's extremely weak in some areas such as tethering where you can't change camera settings and the connection tends to go down if you take photos too quickly. Some of its RAW processing is just ""ok"" and not spectacular, but it's generally a good deal for the money. It's true that you can use Sofortbuild for Nikon tethering, but it doesn't allow changing camera settings either.Anyway, I bought Capture One primarily because I've been doing mostly tethered capture in the studio with a Nikon D7000 and some medium format backs and I managed to get it for about $100 due to an educational discount. Unlike Canon which gives Canon owners the EOS Utility capture software for free, Nikon wants you to buy their silly Capture NX2 in order to get a tethered capture utility. Since I could get Capture One Pro 6 at a rather substantial discount that actually made it cheaper than NX2, and I can use Capture One with a bunch of medium format backs and Canons, I said to heck with NX2 and bought this. A rather sad statement about Nilkon, but tethered capture alone makes Capture One worthwhile for Nikon users if you can get it at a massive educational discount.And oh yea, you also get some very impressive raw and other image processing capabilities. In fact this is the real reason why most people who use it would be willing to spend $400 on it.A tip for those who haven't used this before who are planning to: The UI in Capture One doesn't work in an immediately obvious fashion, but it's actually pretty good once you understand the design strategy for the thing. Workspace customization is extremely important especially if (for some simple stuff) you want the help of assistants who don't really know the software. Customize your workspace for what you do!  Use extremely simplified workspaces for particular purposes especially when less familiar people need to do something with it. Basically figure out the whole organization of the UI before doing anything else or you'll end up wasting lots of time wondering where things disappeared to.My ONLY complaint about Capture One Pro so far is that, unbelievably, it doesn't support live view for Nikon or Canon cameras! I just don't understand this since I thought these vendors pretty much provided all the code for this in their SDKs, so it seems like supporting live view would be easy. I'd give it five stars if only it supported live view for Nikon at least.UPDATE: I kept having problems with my camera randomly disconnecting during tethering at times (C1 stopped ""seeing"" it as being connected). It didn't happen too often, just enough to be annoying. When the last C1 update came out I actually read the release notes and noticed that they mention that certain older versions of Logitech Control Center can cause this problem. When I looked, I found that an old version of Logitech Control Center was installed on my laptop. (Not sure why... might have been automatically copied from my desktop.) Though a Logitech update should fix the problem too, I didn't need it so I just deleted it. After that I did a little stress test where I connected up the camera, shot in continuous mode for a while (constantly keeping the camera's RAM buffer full), and everything worked flawlessly. No images lost and no disconnections. I also just left the camera sitting there turned on for a few hours and still connected (until the batteries were almost dead), and it was still shown as connected in C1 and working when I came back. So the moral of the story is, read the release notes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RZ3XZ1I381AO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004NROQBK#wasThisHelpful","RZ3XZ1I381AO3","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm using this with an iPad3. I read through the reviews of almost 10 different versions of these aftermarket camera connection kit type devices on Amazon and this one seemed like the one with the most encouraging reviews, so I bought this one.Here are the tests that I've counducted with this product:- My iPad3 is in a Zagg ZAGGfolio for Apple iPad 2 Carbon with Silver Keyboard (LEACSIPAD2) right now and the card reader thing fit into the dock port quite tightly without the case getting in the way at all. This could have been a problem if the reader didn't have as much space between the connector and the rest of the box, so I was quite happy to see this.- Inserted a SanDisk Extreme HD Video 16 GB SDHC Class 10 Memory Card (SDSDRX3-016G-A21) with a little over 1,200 JPEG files, and a few short videos, about 3.3GB total. Thumbnails all appeared almost immediately with no problem. I imported a few (didn't want to trash my photo stream with all of them) photos with no problem. Never got an ""accessory incompatible"" warning during this test.- Inserted an Eye-Fi Pro X2 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-8PC with several iPad screens worth of JPEG files. The Photos app immediately displayed a bunch of empty box thumbnails, but it took forever (more than a minute, at least) to display actual thumbnail images and I got the ""This accessory is incompatible.."" notice at some point. I just dismissed the notice and it continued doing it's thing. Thumbnails appeared in spurts but eventually all of the thumbnails appeared and I imported a few photos. I tried it another time and the thumbnails never completely appeared, so it seems rather unreliable with this particular card. Not sure I'll use this card with the thing anyway, but it seemed like a good card to use to test with an atypical SDHC card.- Switched the switch to ""USB"" and plugged in my Nikon D7000 with both the (now mostly empty) SanDisk card and the eye-fi card inserted in the camera. Thumbnails appeared almost immediately and I was able to download some images with no problem. I think the ""accessory incompatible"" notice might have appeared but I just dismissed it and continued on with no problem. Very quick response and no functional failures even though the images were on the eye-fi card that the card reader previously had trouble with. So using a camera that works to read SDHC cards seems to be a good way to workaround any SD card compatibility problems.I did not try plugging in a keyboard (I have no use for that as I'm using a bluetooth keyboard to type this) or any sort of card other than these two SDHC cards.So this thing seems to mostly work. The only problems are that it doesn't seem to like certain SD cards (this can be a problem with cameras as well) and the ""accessory incompatible"" warning appears in some situations sometimes but doesn't seem to really mean anything as everything continues to work (except with my eye-fi which was having problems, warning box or not).My guess is that most major brands of SDHC cards like SanDisk will probably work fine (Nikon really only certifies some of these mostly major brands of cards for use in their cameras, so I think device compatibility problems may just be typical with certain cards in many devices anyway.)The official Apple accessory is probably more solid, but for the $5 I paid for this thing it seems to work well enough that I can't complain. I don't intend to use this very often anyway. (I just figured that it would be worth having one around if I could get a working one for only $5.) If it cost any more than $5 I'd give it fewer stars, but for $5 I'd say it works well enough to warrant 4 stars. If it didn't have card compatibility quirks and never caused the compatibility warning to display then I'd give it 5 stars, but it loses a star due to these issues.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD28AE8JLMYNG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006TAQOA0#wasThisHelpful","RD28AE8JLMYNG","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Neewer products are great when you just need a cheap version of whatever item that, while not so high quality, is at least good enough for whatever you need it for. Basically you get what you pay for, but at least you are getting what you pay for and not less than you pay for or something worthless. So while you get low quality at a proportionally low price, you still get sufficient value for the money and you have a low cost option for things that only need to be sufficient and not top notch.This reflector/gobo is pretty much the same sort of decent value as other Neewer products. It's not the absolute most solid construction but it shows no signs of coming apart right out of the box and seems to be more than sufficient for occasional use. I'm sure that if you're a pro who uses these things all day every single day then this thing will probably wear out too quickly, but I'm an amateur who only needs this sort of thing occasionally. Essentially this is like a consumer version of a blender or other appliance rather than a commercial version of an appliance. If you're a restaurant then you'll be using a blender all day every day and need one that won't die under such heavy use, but at home where you only use the thing a few times a week at most, if even that, buying a commercial version of something would be totally pointless.I haven't used this too much yet, but so far it seems to be sufficient for the frequency that I'll end up using it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MKTZ5HSA6PJO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZIMEMW#wasThisHelpful","R1MKTZ5HSA6PJO","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The design of this thing is such that it has a bulging area that keeps it from even coming close to fitting in any grip other than the specific knockoff grip that ATC sells. Some people have reported successfully filing off this bulge, but in order to do so you have to file all the way through the outer shell, exposing the insides.

"Not only is the shell of this thing too soft, more like vinyl than hard plastic, but there is practically NO padding in the thing to provide reasonable protection. It's so bad that I'd rather just use no case since this thing is likely to do little more than provide a false sense of security. The little carabeaner type hook on the thing is the worst construction I've ever seen for this type of hook, and that's no exaggeration. I didn't know these things could even be constructed so poorly. The spring on the thing broke instantly and, even if it hadn't broken the first time I tried to open the hook, it would have broken pretty quickly anyway. In other words, this appears to be a design defect and very poor quality materials/construction, not an individual unfortunate one-off manufacturing defect in one unlucky unit.Unfortunately I failed to send this thing back in time so I'm stuck with it. I'll probably try to use it for storing something but certainly not something as delicate and critical as a hard drive.Don't buy this!!!

"I wasnt going to buy this thing because it used to cost something like $120 and I normally use cheap Cactus triggers instead of the comparitively super expensive Pocket Wizards, but I started using the studio facilities at school and all of their stuff is Pocket Wizard based. I found that trying to carry around both a full PW transmitter along with the light meter is a real pain whether or not they're connected with a sync cable or not.  Either both hands are full or one hand is fumbling with two unwieldy devices.Still, I was not willing to spend over $100 for this. However this cumbersome situation was getting really annoying and I started looking around to see if I could find a better price. When I noticed that I could get the thing for $65 I was like ""heck yea"". I was pretty sure I was going to be using other people's Pocket Wizards enough that this would end up being worth it, even if I don't own any PWs myself.So far I haven't done much more than test it a few times, but on the L-358 I'm using configuration is quick and easy, and it works. I wasn't able to tell from the documentation alone, but once installed it was immediately obvious that the channel configuration was essentially just another ""mode"" just like corded or uncorded flash are modes. So basically when you're flipping through modes with the dial and mode button, the channel configuration mode comes up one click before the actual transmit/meter mode. This means that there's no funky stuff with holding down multiple buttons and turning the dial, etc, so setting the channel is very quick, easy, and it's obvious how to do it. If you hand the meter to an assistant who's never seen it before and tell them how to switch the modes, it will be immediately obvious to them how to set the channel with little or no additional explanation.While the transmitter is ""only"" supposed to have a 30m range as opposed to the 500m or whatever ridiculous range that the actual PW transmitters have, this is several times what I need for the tiny studio bays I'm normally limited to and it's probably enough for the majority of situations (but hey, I'm new to this so I don't really know how big sets might get). If you occasionally need more than a 30m range then you can always go back to using a regular transmitter at times, as annoying as it is. If you always need more range then perhaps this thing isn't so great. Note that the studio I'm using isn't large enough to test the range on this thing, and I'm not yet allowed to check out location kits that I can use outside, so I haven't been able to test the actual range of my unit. For all I know maybe it works from further away but just fails to trigger half the time when too far away or something.If I had to pay $120 for this then I'd probably give it 3 stars just due to expense (though compared to the cost of PWs I guess it isn't that horrible), but for $65 the price no longer annoys me so much and it's an easy 5 stars.Now if only they'd make some module like this for the Cactus or some other cheaper brand of trigger then I'd be thrilled. At least my Cactus transmitter is rather tiny and not as annoying to carry around cabled to the meter.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYMHLV93T13O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001HX44A6#wasThisHelpful","R1SYMHLV93T13O","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have an iPad3. I bought both the Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Removable Keyboard, Case and Stand for iPad 2 and New iPad (K39512US), and the Zagg ZAGGfolio with Keyboard for The New iPad 3G (FOLCARSLV101). The Kensington I bought from Amazon and the Zagg I bought from Best Buy. So this is a comparitive review of both products used with the iPad 3.First the ZAGGfolio since thats the product I'm posting this reviw on. I'm typing this part with it now.Here are its advantages over the KeyFolio:The overall design of the case is not that good, but it seems to be more durable and capable of better protecting the iPad. The keyboard is also a little larger and seems more solidly constructed.- The hard plastic of the case is thicker, harder, and would seem to offer more protection. The KeyFolio isn't that bad but the Zagg is just more durable. Overall the ZAGGfolio construction is bit more solid.- The keys on the keyboard are larger than the ones on the KeyFolio keyboard. The Space bar and modifier keys on the bottom row are also maybe 30% taller than the other keys. Overall the keyboard is larger but neither is a full-size keyboard.- The Zagg keyboard can be used as a stand for the iPad with the iPad removed from the case.- Because you can use the keyboard as a stand, you can stand the iPad up in portrait orientation though you can only do this if you remove the iPad from the case.- Overall the Zagg keyboard is more solidly constructed though both keyboards are made of plastic. The Zagg keyboard is also a little larger but I don't know if this is for a larger battery or just to accomodate the built-in iPad stand.- The Zagg keyboard has a ""Globe"" key in the lower left that can be used to switch the keyboard language. If there's any way to do this with the KeyFolio keyboard then I don't know what it is.- While lacking brightness controls, the Zagg keyboard has dedicated Cut/Copy/Paste keys. Personally I think this is pointless because the standard Command-X/C/V key combos work on both keyboards and I'm much more used to those anyway.- The Zagg has the auto on/off magnet that sleeps or wakes the iPad when you open/close the case.ZAGGfolio problems:- The outside of the thing is covered with this fake carbon fiber ""skin"" sticker that looks cheap-o and some have reported that it's prone to peeling off.- The case doesn't feel like it clips securely closed if you try to close it with the keyboard removed. So I would not try to carry it around without the keyboard inserted.As for the Kensington KeyFolio:This one seems to have a better overall design than the ZAGGfolio and is capable of being set up in a larger number of positions. KeyFolio design advantages:- Significantly less expensive than the ZAGGfolio.- Easier to open.- Seems to stay closed more securely with the keyboard removed.- Easier to insert the iPad in the case.- The iPad3 seems to be held more securely in this case.- There's a stylus holder! This is very important if you ever use a stylus.- The keyboard is held in securely by strong magnets, but is much easier to remove from the case.- The USB port for charging the keyboard is exposed while inserted in the case so you don't have to partially remove the keyboard to charge it.- The iPad panel of the case has velcro on the bottom so, with the keyboard removed, you can stand the iPad up at any angle from vertical to a very low angle that's suitable for typing on the on-screen keyboard if you want. Unlike the Zagg, there are no fixed notches that limit you to 2 or so different stand angles. This continuous range of possible angles is VERY useful.- While neither case is very good for typing when placed on your lap, the KeyFolio is better for this  than the Zagg.- With the keyboard still inserted, the KeyFolio is more comfortable to hold when you fold the cover over to use the iPad like a tablet. It's not that much better but is it easier to avoid pressing the keys with the back resting on your hand. Since its also easier to remove the keyboard, it's easier to switch to using the tablet like this without the keyboard.- The KeyFolio keyboard has display brightness control keys while the Zagg doesn't. It also has a caps lock light,  will allow you to type F1-F12, and has a couple of extra keys like Pause/Break. This may not matter for the iPad but makes the keyboard more useful if you ever pair it with a Windows machine device or something. This keyboard also has a separate Delete and Backspace as well as an Insert key.KeyFolio Problems:- Unlike some photos show, there doesn't seem to be any proper way to rotate the iPad into the portrait orientation while using the keyboard. You can take the iPad out and sort of stand it up being held by the bottom flap of the holder, but this doesnt hold it very securely.- Currently I seem to be having some sort of problem where the left Shift key is interfering with the Z key. If I try to type ZAGG then I get Zagg because for some reason, Shift-Z essentially deactivates the Shift key even if you continue to hold down the shift key. (Releasing the shift and holding it down again, after typing Shift-Z, fixes the problem as does using the right Shift key.) The right Shift key doesn't seem to have this problem with neighboring keys. I'm unsure if this Shift-Z thing is a design problem or just a random manufacturing defect  in my particular keyboard.- This is minor, but the Command key is lacking the little curly corner command key symbol.- As people have mentioned, the ""new car smell"" from the outgassing on the KeyFolio, right after you remove it from the box, is rather strong. I would expect this to go away once all the residue has evaporated and I plan to place it near an open window, with the keyboard removed and all surfaces exposed to air, to speed this up.Both cases have:- Cutouts for all of the standard ports, buttons, speaker, camera, etc- Enough space around the dock connector to support my larger-than-normal 3rd party cable.- Bluetooth keyboards that have a ""connect"" button for easy obvious pairing.- Once paired, both keyboards connect instantly after being powered on. You will not be able to get your hands on the keys before they connect.- Both have special keys for the home key, slide show, mute/volume, audio player control, on-screen keyboard show/hide, search, and lock.- Both have Ctrl/Option/Command and arrow keys.- Some way to stand the ipad up for typing or viewing video/etc, and a way to fold the keyboard side of the cover behind the tablet for tablet-only use.- Use a standard micro USB port for charging.- A certain look. The Kensington looks more ""white collar"" and the Zagg looks more ""blue collar"". I don't consider either of these styles to be better than the other so I've noted it here to point it out.- Both seem about as bulky. Maybe the KeyFolio seems a little thinner just because it's softer.Verdict:Aside from the weird Shift-Z problem that might just be a defect in my particular unit, I like the Kensington KeyFolio better. The smaller keys don't really bother me, I REALLY want that stylus holder, I like the ease of removing the keyboard, the usb charging port is exposed without removing the keyboard, the velcro angle stand with infinite positions is very useful.

"I have an iPad3. I bought both this, the Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Removable Keyboard, Case and Stand for iPad 2 and New iPad (K39512US), and the Zagg ZAGGfolio with Keyboard for The New iPad 3G (FOLCARSLV101). The Kensington I bought from Amazon and the Zagg I bought from Best Buy. So this is a comparitive review of both products used with the iPad 3.First the Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 since thats the product I'm posting this reviw on. I'm typing this part with it now.This one seems to have a better overall design than the ZAGGfolio and is capable of being set up in a larger number of positions. KeyFolio design advantages:- Significantly less expensive than the ZAGGfolio.- Easier to open.- Seems to stay closed more securely with the keyboard removed.- Easier to insert the iPad in the case.- The iPad3 seems to be held more securely in this case.- There's a stylus holder! This is very important if you ever use a stylus.- The keyboard is held in securely by strong magnets, but is much easier to remove from the case.- The USB port for charging the keyboard is exposed while inserted in the case so you don't have to partially remove the keyboard to charge it.- The iPad panel of the case has velcro on the bottom so, with the keyboard removed, you can stand the iPad up at any angle from vertical to a very low angle that's suitable for typing on the on-screen keyboard if you want. Unlike the Zagg, there are no fixed notches that limit you to 2 or so different stand angles. This continuous range of possible angles is VERY useful.- While neither case is very good for typing when placed on your lap, the KeyFolio is better for this  than the Zagg.- With the keyboard still inserted, the KeyFolio is more comfortable to hold when you fold the cover over to use the iPad like a tablet. It's not that much better but is it easier to avoid pressing the keys with the back resting on your hand. Since its also easier to remove the keyboard, it's easier to switch to using the tablet like this without the keyboard.- The KeyFolio keyboard has display brightness control keys while the Zagg doesn't. It also has a caps lock light,  will allow you to type F1-F12, and has a couple of extra keys like Pause/Break. This may not matter for the iPad but makes the keyboard more useful if you ever pair it with a Windows machine device or something. This keyboard also has a separate Delete and Backspace as well as an Insert key.KeyFolio Problems:- Unlike some photos show, there doesn't seem to be any proper way to rotate the iPad into the portrait orientation while using the keyboard. You can take the iPad out and sort of stand it up being held by the bottom flap of the holder, but this doesnt hold it very securely.- Currently I seem to be having some sort of problem where the left Shift key is interfering with the Z key. If I try to type ZAGG then I get Zagg because for some reason, Shift-Z essentially deactivates the Shift key even if you continue to hold down the shift key. (Releasing the shift and holding it down again, after typing Shift-Z, fixes the problem as does using the right Shift key.) The right Shift key doesn't seem to have this problem with neighboring keys. I'm unsure if this Shift-Z thing is a design problem or just a random manufacturing defect  in my particular keyboard.- This is minor, but the Command key is lacking the little curly corner command key symbol.- As people have mentioned, the ""new car smell"" from the outgassing on the KeyFolio, right after you remove it from the box, is rather strong. I would expect this to go away once all the residue has evaporated and I plan to place it near an open window, with the keyboard removed and all surfaces exposed to air, to speed this up.Now the ZAGGfolio. I'm typing this part using it. Here are its advantages over the KeyFolio:The overall design of the case is not that good, but it seems to be more durable and capable of better protecting the iPad. The keyboard is also a little larger and seems more solidly constructed.- The hard plastic of the case is thicker, harder, and would seem to offer more protection. The KeyFolio isn't that bad but the Zagg is just more durable. Overall the ZAGGfolio construction is bit more solid.- The keys on the keyboard are larger than the ones on the KeyFolio keyboard. The Space bar and modifier keys on the bottom row are also maybe 30% taller than the other keys. Overall the keyboard is larger but neither is a full-size keyboard.- The Zagg keyboard can be used as a stand for the iPad with the iPad removed from the case.- Because you can use the keyboard as a stand, you can stand the iPad up in portrait orientation though you can only do this if you remove the iPad from the case.- Overall the Zagg keyboard is more solidly constructed though both keyboards are made of plastic. The Zagg keyboard is also a little larger but I don't know if this is for a larger battery or just to accomodate the built-in iPad stand.- The Zagg keyboard has a ""Globe"" key in the lower left that can be used to switch the keyboard language. If there's any way to do this with the KeyFolio keyboard then I don't know what it is.- While lacking brightness controls, the Zagg keyboard has dedicated Cut/Copy/Paste keys. Personally I think this is pointless because the standard Command-X/C/V key combos work on both keyboards and I'm much more used to those anyway.- The Zagg has the auto on/off magnet that sleeps or wakes the iPad when you open/close the case.ZAGGfolio problems:- The outside of the thing is covered with this fake carbon fiber ""skin"" sticker that looks cheap-o and some have reported that it's prone to peeling off.- The case doesn't feel like it clips securely closed if you try to close it with the keyboard removed. So I would not try to carry it around without the keyboard inserted.- See ""KeyFolio"" advantages above for other shortcomings that I wouldn't necessarily consider outright problems.Both cases have:- Cutouts for all of the standard ports, buttons, speaker, camera, etc- Enough space around the dock connector to support my larger-than-normal 3rd party cable.- Bluetooth keyboards that have a ""connect"" button for easy obvious pairing.- Once paired, both keyboards connect instantly after being powered on. You will not be able to get your hands on the keys before they connect.- Both have special keys for the home key, slide show, mute/volume, audio player control, on-screen keyboard show/hide, search, and lock.- Both have Ctrl/Option/Command and arrow keys.- Some way to stand the ipad up for typing or viewing video/etc, and a way to fold the keyboard side of the cover behind the tablet for tablet-only use.- Use a standard micro USB port for charging.- A certain look. The Kensington looks more ""white collar"" and the Zagg looks more ""blue collar"". I don't consider either of these styles to be better than the other so I've noted it here to point it out.- Both seem about as bulky. Maybe the KeyFolio seems a little thinner just because it's softer.Verdict:Aside from the weird Shift-Z problem that might just be a defect in my particular unit, I like the Kensington KeyFolio better. The smaller keys don't really bother me, I REALLY want that stylus holder, I like the ease of removing the keyboard, the usb charging port is exposed without removing the keyboard, the velcro angle stand with infinite positions is very useful. I don't care if I can stand the iPad up on the keyboard alone with no case. The iPad seems to be held more securely (not as loose). If I need to type on my lap, this one is easier to do that with. The Kensington is also less expensive and overall seems to be a better value. Lastly, the keyboard seems to be more suitable for use with other devices if needed.So if that stuff is what's important to you then I'd get the Kensington KeyFolio.If you need larger keys, more solid (but not quite milspec) protection for tougher environments, better support for portrait orientation, never use a stylus, really want that auto sleep/wake magnet, and/or like the tough-looking style (vs the office management organizer style), then get the ZAGGfolio.UPDATE: See comments section for a report on wear-and-tear after a month of daily use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2AFJU6BE3F5WI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005Y1CYSQ#wasThisHelpful","R2AFJU6BE3F5WI","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Ordinarily this thing would just be a horrible quality monitor. I'm not sure if I'd even give it two stars if it were just a normal monitor, but this thing not only has a built in DisplayLink chipset for USB video connection bit its also USB powered! This means that it will also run off of laptop battery power. For $100 that's not bad. The built in stand also handles portrait and landscape orientations.The thing is very very light and portable. The case might be a little bulkier than it needs to be since it feels hollow, but its not that thick and it fits in my backpack. I wish it had come with a sleeve or something, but I suspect a cheap minimalistic large laptop sleeve would work just fine.So that's the good stuff. Here's the bad: image quality. Compared to laptop displays in general, this one is more comparable to the lower quality displays on cheap laptops.-The viewing angle is horrible. You pretty much have to be looking at the thing dead on or it won't look right, making it very difficult for more than one person to view it at a time. I suppose you could consider this a security feature, but the screen isn't totally unreadable at an off angle, just really bad looking.-The color gamut is horrible. I used a ColorMunki Photo spectrophotometer to calibrate the thing and the resulting gamut plot doesn't come close to covering the standard sRGB color space. Then again, my built in MacBook display doesn't cover sRGB that well either, so it's not that much worse than the typically bad laptop display. My guess is that the image quality is probably comparable to the average screen on an inexpensive laptop.-As others have noted theres no brightness control. There are no controls of any kind on the thing, just a micro USB port and nothing else. The brightness I measured on mine was about 200 cd/m2 which is not bad for a laptop display.-While the built in DisplayLink USB graphics adapter is great in that it only needs a USB port, it lacks a lot of the processing power that a real graphics card with a real GPU would have. So the CPU ends up doing work that would normally be done on a graphics chipset GPU. This means it will use up some CPU power depending on what you're doing, and it's no good for video or games. So this thing is mostly for displaying documents and animated graphics which is good enough for many people.-There's no built in USB hub or anything. Perhaps there's just not enough power for one, but with only 2 USB ports on my MacBook I wish I could get at least one unpowered port out of it.Verdict:-Superior convenience and portability.-""good enough"" image quality for basic productivity stuff like documents and web pages.-It's a second monitor!-Inexpensive and decent value.-Very poor viewing angle that's not very suitable for across the room viewing.-Generally poor image quality that's unsuitable for photo editing or anything color sensitive.-Some performance limitations due to USB (no good for games/video).-No screen controls at all.At some point better competing products will probably be available at which point I might consider this more of a 3 star product depending on how much newer versions cost, but at the current time I give it a solid 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 28, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2I9D6C3DECPP4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005SEZR0G#wasThisHelpful","R2I9D6C3DECPP4","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is more solidly constructed than the cheapo last one that I bought at an auto parts store, and seems like it could tolerate being banged around a bit in your trunk. The auto shutoff feature seems to basically work and is useful, but after a few tire inflations it seems that its pressure gauge is probably too inaccurate to just blindly trust the auto shutoff feature. I'm not really surprised since most non-dedicated gauges seem to be a little deficient, and I wasn't planning to trust this one anyway.Basically what happened to me is that I set it to inflate all four of my tires back to 32psi using the auto-shutoff thing, and according to my TPMS (which is generally within +/- 1psi of my dedicated tire gauge, so not too bad) the tire pressures were initially OK, but after driving 10 min, parking, waiting at least 4 hours, and walking back to the car, the TPMS was reading something like 33,33,34,35. I got out my Accutire MS-4350B Tire Gauge and sure enough the tires were within +/- 1psi of what the TPMS said. So I just let air out of them until they all read 32psi. (It's possible that the temperature went up 10F while I was doing stuff, resulting in an increase of 1psi per tire, but that doesn't explain the the 35.)With the one that was at 35, I was already suspicious because the thing sat there pumping for 10-20 seconds AFTER it was already reading 32 (as if the gauge stuck at 32 then finally hit whatever fraction of a psi above 32 that triggers the shutoff). I actually shut the thing off on the first tire manually, then went back and tried it again after the shutoff worked on other tires. So I went back to the first tire to see what it would do and it continued to run at 32 for a bit and finally shut off, resulting in the 35psi pressure. Odd.Now, it was only 10-20F outside when I inflated the tires and it's possible that the tires had deformed or something due to the cold, then hardened such that they had slightly different internal volumes, possibly explaining why the pressures seemed OK originally but then read too high after a 10 minute drive and a 4+ hour wait. The one that was overinflated was also the one that was very low compared to the others before I inflated them, so it wouldn't be surprising if cooled and hardened into a different shape than the others. (I inflated them all when I got up in the morning and the car was dead cold.)So anyway, I'm still reasonably happy with this as it seems to be durable, it does have the auto shutoff feature which is still kind of useful, the power cord is long enough for my small car (as long as you run it out of the door on the same side as the tires you're inflating), and I didn't really plan to trust the pump's pressure gauge anyway.My advice is that if you use this, use the auto shutoff but then get out a real tire gauge (like the previously mentioned Accutire), check the pressure, and then let some air out until the proper pressure is reached. If the auto shutoff is routinely underinflating, just set the shutoff threshold a little higher so you can then let air out with your real gauge to get to the proper pressure. Watch the number on the pump's display the whole time it's running, and if the pressure gauge on the thing seems to stick at the same value while the pump runs, play it safe, shut the thing off manually, and take a reading with a real gauge. I doubt the thing is so inaccurate as to explode a typical car tire before shutting off, but certainly it's work needs to be verified with a known accurate gauge.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1N1NJXECNIAGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002ZBWKAU#wasThisHelpful","R1N1NJXECNIAGX","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Epson's UltraChrome K3 inks have to be some of the best out there. It's what my visual arts school uses for all of their ink jet printers (3880s and up), and it's what all but one or two of Epson's huge high-end professional ink jet printers use.My only problem with the R3000 cartridges are that they're kind of expensive per ml compared to the 3880's larger cartridges, and of course more expensive than 3rd party ink, but I can't complain about the ink or container quality at all. I'd give them 5 stars instead of 4 if only they were less expensive. Still, the price isn't too bad for the price point of printer involved, just not particularly inexpensive or anything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSVZEUWNYIBNT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005BV100C#wasThisHelpful","RSVZEUWNYIBNT","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"At first I thought thing thing seemed too expensive. Though I don't need portability, I was originally going to get one of the less expensive portable sized models like the ScanSnap S1300, not only because they're less expensive but because they take up less space. However, when I looked up the technical specs I found that the S1500 is still quite small when folded up, and I really don't need to carry it around with me. Considering that the somewhat suspect NeatDesk costs about the same, I decided that the price for the S1500 wasn't that unreasonable and I'd rather have the extra capacity over the S1300. (When in doubt, and something matters, I tend to avoid going the cheaper route on things if I don't have to.)Well, I'm glad that I did because the S1500 is FAST. I'm still rather in awe of how fast it is. I scanned in this whole double sided 100 sheet course pack (some pages in color) in 300dpi faster than I knew what to do with it. This thing will scan stuff much faster than Adobe Acrobat's ClearScan OCR will run on the results. Even if you scan at ""Excellent"" (600/1200dpi which is generally totally unnecessary for regular documents) the thing seems ridiculously fast to me. I rescanned my course pack with ""Excellent"" just so I could run the ClearScan OCR on the thing with better font quality and the scanner outpaced the software easily even with the slowness of the highest quality dpi mode. Most of my time was spent creating PDF bookmarks for chapters in the course pack and otherwise just organizing the PDF file the way I wanted.I haven't tried scanning too many wrinkled up pages with this yet, but I did scan a small stack of papers from a class last semester that had been stuffed in a book for quite a while. The scanner had absolutely no problem even though papers were wrinkled a bit and also different sizes (some note paper, some office paper, some paper ripped out of a sketchbook with a torn edge, etc.) I just fed the whole stack in with no regard for page size, thickness, or condition (smaller pages between larger ones etc).For stuff that's really messed up (like old wadded up receipts) I've just used the clear plastic document carrier. Simple and very little trouble. For all I know the extremely wrinkled receipts might have gone through just fine without the carrier, but I didn't feel like pushing the thing's abilities to the limit at the time.As for the included software: I personally think it's good enough. I'm using a Mac. The UI is a little unusual compared to Apple standard UI guidelines, but that's just typical of software provided by hardware vendors and doesn't really impact usability in this case. I was initially concerned about the lack of TWAIN support, but after using the software I find that I really don't care about TWAIN because you can configure the software to scan to standard file formats and automatically launch them in any application you want which is essentially all you get with TWAIN drivers anyway. And unlike some TWAIN drivers I've seen, I've had no problem with the ScanSnap software crashing or otherwise failing to operate.Tip: For stuff where quality isn't a big deal, the ScanSnap software by itself is fine just scanning directly to image PDFs (bitmap pages) in one of the faster low quality modes and doing its own OCR for text search. For anything large where I care about print quality, I scan to Adobe Acrobat in 600dpi and then run Acrobat's ClearScan OCR on it. ClearScan basically traces character bitmaps, converting them into more space efficient vectors, then generates its own embedded fonts for the resulting document. As a result, quality is maintained but the size of the resulting PDF is much much smaller. For example, my course pack was 450MB as an image PDF and was reduced to 60MB as a PDF after OCR with ClearScan. This is after scanning it in maximum resolution (600/1200dpi) mode and running ClearScan. With a 300dpi scan the resulting ClearScan PDF was about 40MB but the quality was noticeably worse. (Not bad enough that most people would care, but with 600/1200dpi+ClearScan the 60MB file is almost indistinguishable from the original whereas the 300dpi file is obviously degraded a bit.) Without ClearScan, the 300dpi file (image PDF) was something like 80-120MB. So for large documents ClearScan is worth the extra step. For lots of small documents (like less than 10 pages) it's probably not worth the extra step; just scan those in 300dpi or less and leave them as the image PDFs that ScanSnap generates.The ScanSnap software lets you set up custom scanning ""profiles"" in addition to the ones that it comes with (like ""scan to email"" etc), so for example I added ""Scan to Acrobat, Basic Quality"", ""Scan to Acrobat, High Quality"", and ""Scan to Lightroom"" (for photos). The profiles are basically just dpi/format/etc settings plus which application to launch, if any, and you can pick any application that will load a PDF or JPEG. Once you have a profile selected, all you have to do is load papers, hit the button on the scanner, and the document will appear in your application once its done.... no extra shuffling of files around.I haven't tried the ""Scan to Word"", ""Scan to Excel"", or CardIris stuff as I don't have any real use for them right now, so I can't comment on how well those work yet.Anyway, I'm quite happy with this. The thing is crazy fast and the workflow is very simple and refined, basically just press a button to get a document into an application. It will probably take you 10 times as long to organize all the PDF files than it will to get the pages scanned.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2R6BOVUHYSJ0Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001XWCQO2#wasThisHelpful","R2R6BOVUHYSJ0Z","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Great paper, significantly better than the ""non-ultra"" version if you ask me. The only things you might want to do with any large paper like this:1) Don't tighten the sheet feed guides too close to the paper (like I did once). I'd leave 1/8th of an inch between the left side feeder guide and the edge of the paper. If the paper gets bent inward because the width between the guides is too narrow (easier to happen with large paper), it can cause it to misfeed in such a way that the print head can scrape the paper, potentially causing costly print head damage.2) In addition to setting the paper type (in the print settings) to this exact brand/type of paper, you may want to set ""platen gap"" to ""wide"" just to be sure. You shouldn't really need the ""wide"" setting if you set the paper type properly (as the printer/driver should set the proper gap for the paper you set) but it might not be a bad idea anyway just to be safe.And to avoid waste, it's never a bad idea to do a nozzle check on the blank side of some clean and unwrinkled scrap office paper (if not new office paper) before you print on anything large or otherwise expensive.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21EY9DMYYJ00I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z6XJ#wasThisHelpful","R21EY9DMYYJ00I","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is worth having because 1) it's padded and seems to (after a few weeks in my backpack) protect the equipment nicely, and 2) it keeps the cable and pen with the actual tablet instead of mixed up in my backpack with a bunch of regular pens and cables where they can get misplaced.My small INTUOS4 tablet fits perfectly, there's a pocket inside for the cable, and another one that's big enough for more than one standard pen or art pen. I can't say how well the pockets fit stuff like the airbrush or mouse, but it looks like you should be able to at least fit the airbrush by itself if not with a pen, or a pen and the mouse. You could probably stuff the pen holder in there too without the mouse, but it doesn't seem to be designed for carrying the pen (desk) holder around. I personally have no desire to anyway.It's padded almost as much as a laptop sleeve. I put the tablet and it's stuff in the thing and throw it in my backpack which works nicely. It's better than sliding the tablet in between the laptop sleeve and the backpack's laptop pocket like I used to. The case is rather solidly constructed with no sign of stitches or fabric threads coming unraveled, tearing easily, etc.It's not surprising that the tablet/etc fits well since it's the manufacturer's ""official"" case, but considering that it's Wacom I'm just happy that the case doesn't cost $50 or something. (I'm still annoyed with the $100 art pen that by itself is half the combined cost of the small tablet, pen, pen holder, tips/etc, and mouse.)Overall I'd say that this case is just as good if not better than what a 3rd party manufacturer could provide for the same price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R345MH0Z3KJDAP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003ICXCWA#wasThisHelpful","R345MH0Z3KJDAP","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've had this for almost three years and have mostly used it with the mouse as I don't have a constant need for the pen. When I have used the pen though, it's been excellent. I'm personally not bothered by the small size of the drawing area, but if you think you might be then I'd go for a ""medium sized"" tablet of some sort. The small size is good for portability though, and it fits nicely in my backpack in the same pocket with my MacBook. (It's about the same width and height as the macbook though obviously much thinner.) Unlike the small tablet, the medium and larger tablets have little digital display labels next to the function buttons, but I'm not convinced that this is terribly useful.The only problem that I've had with it is that the right mouse button on the mouse accessory started failing after daily use for a couple of years. These things have a 2 year warranty, and I wasn't exactly on top of things enough to realize that and get the mouse replaced when it started having problems. (I'm actually not sure exactly when it started having problems relative to the warranty expiration.) Basically one of the buttons started ""clicking"" almost by itself and this became really annoying. I still use the tablet with the pen, which all still work perfectly fine, and just use a normal mouse for everything else. Really I think a normal mouse is better anyway, and the fact that they even include a mouse with this tablet seems like a minor bonus.The main issue with the Wacom tables is that they're expensive. They're high quality, but you pay for it. They're probably well worth it if you use them to a commercial degree, such as on a daily basis, but if you only use a pen tablet occasionally and don't need the tilt sensor, you can get some rather inexpensive pen tablets with pressure sensing, such as the VT PenPad 7.7-Inch Graphic Pen Tablet, for much less money these days. The cheaper tablets are probably sufficient for people who do photo retouching every week or two since the tilt sensing doesn't help that much with that (though the pressure sensitivity does) and the durability on many of them is probably good enough for a consumer level of usage.I like the eraser tip on the regular pen that comes with the tablet, but I hate the fact that the rotation-sensing Art Pen is NOT included and is nearly $100. If the art pen cost more like $50 I'd have probably bought it by now, but for what I normally do I don't feel like I can justify $100 for it.The tablet does come with different textured tips for the pen which is nice, and it's good that you can replace the tips. Replacement is quite easy, and you can also replace the drawing surface on the tablet.The little touch control wheel is OK, but it seems like it doesn't move very smoothly. Instead it kind of jumps in increments, for most things, that can be kind of annoying unless you lower the sensitivity. This might usually be more the fault of the software application though.Overall I'd say the people who should buy this are the people who will use it heavily and need the tilt sensitivity (or tilt and rotating sensing for the art pen option). For more occasional usage you can get much less expensive tablets with pressure sensing ability.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 21, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GYOQ9PH9VNZ6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001TUYTZM#wasThisHelpful","R3GYOQ9PH9VNZ6","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I just installed one of these in my 2001 Audi TT and everything went pretty smoothly. I bought a specific kit including everything needed for my specific model though, so if I were you I'd communicate with whoever you order this from before ordering to make sure you're ordering the right adapter and all of the parts you're going to need. Make sure you order from someone willing to help you get the right parts and who will help answer installation questions.The main thing to ask before buying one of these adapters is whether you should just buy a new head unit instead. If you buy a GROM-IPD3 with the iPod cable, Bluetooth audio/handsfree interface, and the RCA/phono aux cable, the total price will probably be about the same as the price for a whole new head unit that does all of these things and maybe others as well.So consider whether there is some reason why you might not just want a new head unit before buying this. If you don't want to change the ""OEM look"" or there's some other reason for not replacing the OEM head unit, an adapter like this one is a pretty good option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29Q65NZ2GA1E0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DYF8UO#wasThisHelpful","R29Q65NZ2GA1E0","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This stuff holds very strongly and takes a lot of force to separate. In most situations where you frequently need to separate the hook and loop sides, this might not be the best thing to use, but for things where you need something to stay solidly in place while still being removable if the need arises, this stuff is perfect!I used a whole 2"" x 4"" patch of this to attach a Wagan 4-Way 12V Automotive Socket Extender under the dashboard in my car, and that thing does not come loose even with four heavy cigar socket connectors in the thing. I just recently had to remove the extender so that I could get to the area behind it to install some electronics, and while it took quite a bit of force and effort to separate the velcro, it did come off and go back on just fine. The extender might as well be glued down with industrial adhesive except that it can actually be removed when required, which is exactly what I wanted.I also used a couple of 1/2"" by 2"" strips to attach a wireless bluetooth diagnostic interface under the dash and that was more than enough to very securely attach it. That thing isn't going anywhere unless I want it to.The adhesive back on these patches is also very thick and strong. The plastic that I attached it to under my dash has kind of a matte smooth surface, and all I did was clean it with alcohol before sticking the velcro on. Even with all the force used to remove that socket extender, there's no sign of the adhesive coming loose.So this stuff is perfect for heavy objects and things that you might be tempted to glue down with strong double-stick tape or adhesive. If you need something glued down but you think you might need to remove it at some point, don't just use glue.... Use this stuff.As with any adhesive though, you can't expect one adhesive to stick to all possible material surfces. Some things might require the use of alternate means such as some other adhesive, staples, heavy stitches, screws/bolts/etc. When using adhesive strips like this, always clean the area thoroughly with some sort of solvent that will remove greasy oily stuff!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HMWCXCUNYE4R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001LNS2XM#wasThisHelpful","R1HMWCXCUNYE4R","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a secure well made case that you'll be happy with. It has a belt attachment on the side and a strap on the top allowing you to attach it to other things in a couple of ways. The Velcro holds the top shut very tightly (no danger of the thing coming open accidentally).This thing is BIG. As it says, this holds 82mm filters which is more than I actually need. However this extra capacity does seem to allow me to get more filters of a smaller size into the case. For example, I have four super-cheapo 72mm IR filters. I don't care too much about these so I just screw them all together and place the whole stack in the backmost slot in the case. I can do this easily (it's not a tight fit) and it works out just fine.Unless you just need something more compact, a large size like this will come in handy even if you don't have 82m filters, and you'll be prepared should you end up with any 82mm's.I can't find anything wrong with this product, or any drawbacks to it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RC6FA01BZ88JD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009PAV82#wasThisHelpful","RC6FA01BZ88JD","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I think a number of people are being a little too hard on this product right now (Dec 2011), so I'm going to be a little more generous with the stars.I'm using the Escort RedLine with Escort Live which gives me the the Defender Database GPS feature of the 9500ix and the extra range of the RedLine at the same time. So with the RedLine, Live gives you significantly more value at little extra cost than it does with the 9500ix which it is somewhat redundant with.Yes, the complexity of dealing with it is less than ideal at the current time, but if you're the ""early adopter"" gadget nut type then you'll have no problem with it especially if you dock your iPhone to a power connector in the car all the time anyway for use as an audio player.The Escort Live app UI is more suitable for automotive use than I expected for the first version of the software. The most common 4 or 5 functions have large buttons, large text, and swipe gestures. Some functions have buttons/text that are too small, but that seems very likely to get addressed in later app updates.The things that Live gives you:- A fancy touch screen interface for the radar detector. You can change the detector configuration/mode with touch screen controls, and you can display more alert information on the screen than the detector can display on it's LED display alone. The configuration UI just uses standard controls for the most part and isn't suitable for in-motion use, but it could be very useful if you want to completely hide and silence the detector or something.- You get the Defender Database and *most* (not all) GPS-based functions (warnings for red light, radar cameras, etc) of the 9500ix. Obviously this is most beneficial when combined with something like the RedLine that's lacking location based features. With the 9500ix it's mostly redundant.- Over-the-Internet location based alert reports from other drivers. This is the feature that's most lacking right now (Dec 2011) simply because not enough people are using Live and thus very few alerts get reported. Keep in mind though that of the time of this writing, the Android cable has only been shipping for a few days. So we're still in the first days of the service and whether it will catch on enough over time to be useful still remains to be seen. This is just the type of stuff that's unavoidable when you're an early adopter. Feature wise, you can report radar alerts (some like Ka alerts get reported automatically, others like X band alerts require the user to decide) and a couple of things like ""cop sighted"".So if you're the early adopter type who likes to have the latest thing and isn't bothered as much by the issues with new technology then this product/service is pretty good and seems likely to get better. You're likely to rate it about the same as I have.If you're the later adopter sort that needs this to ""just work"" by itself so you can forget it's there, you will probably want to hold off on buying it for now especially if you're using the partially feature-redundant 9500ix. While the more users Live has the more useful the reporting will be, buying it won't be any help to anyone (except maybe Escort) if you end up leaving it in the closet. So if it sounds like you might neglect it in its current state then it's probably better to hold off for now. This should also give Escort more reason to improve the product when they have to make improvements to get more sales.So in summary, as of Dec 2011, depending on who you are:4 stars for early adopters with the RedLine3-4 stars for early adopters with the 9500ix3 stars for not-so-early adopters with the RedLine2 stars for not-so-early adopters with the 9500ix, those who don't want to deal with anything not solidly established yet, and those who don't normally use and don't want to use their phone in the car for anything.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JKXA5MS17CTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006JJFP56#wasThisHelpful","R2JKXA5MS17CTO","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I set out to buy the best windshield detector I could find, and after much research I settled on this one. After 800 miles cross country I'm not the least bit disappointed. This thing always manages to warn me of radar usage at least a mile before I get close to the source, and that's the worst its done. Given that most radar guns probably can't acquire my small car from more than 1,000ft away, this is way more than enough warning. Usually you pick up actual police radar strength sources from more than a mile away on typical slightly rolling terrain.I'm mostly interested in this for highway use and I use it with the SmartCord Live - iPhone Version, so I don't need the GPS features built in to other detectors like the 9500ix. The main thing I care about is getting the longest range detection possible, and filtering out false alerts is secondary. As a result I've spent most of my time running mine in highway mode and don't have a very good sense of how well it does at filtering out automatic door motion detectors and such in ""automatic"" (city) mode. I'm going to have to drive around my town and find some sources of false alerts so I can compare the two modes.But I don't care too much about false alert suppression because the ""expert meter"" option seems to make these things pretty obvious. If you buy a RedLine I recommend enabling that in the configuration as soon as you plug it in. As far as I can tell there's just no disadvantage to using it.How the ""expert meter"" works: Say you're driving along and you see X.,| on the expert meter. The "".,"" are vertical bar graph bars that show two different radar sources that are very weak, and the ""|"" is a bar showing another source that's very strong. You see a couple of grocery stores around you so you can guess that the two weaker signals are probably just building motion detectors, but that extremely strong X band signal is very suspect. Without the expert meter you'd be more likely to just see the stores around you, an X alert, and think it was a false alarm, but seeing that there are three sources with one way too strong to be a civilian source across a big parking lot, you know there's going to be at least a safety speed sign nearby if not a patrol car with an X band radar. If you didn't take this seriously then the detector might be more harm than good if you get more careless because you assumed it was nothing.Later you drive by a huge strip mall and office complex and see K.,X... indicating that you're probably just picking up automatic door and security system motion detectors. If any of those signals are police radar then they're probably still at least a mile away, if not more, given how sensitive this thing is. (Though the distance could be less depending on terrain and obstructions.)So even if you just run this thing in highway mode all the time, it can give you enough information with the expert meter to do your own brain filtering. If you're sure nothing important in your area uses X band, you can also just put the thing in AutoNoX mode or disable X band detection in the configuration.With Escort Live and the iPhone app you can also lock out alerts by location and frequency. So if you get a bunch of weak alerts when you drive by this mega strip mall every day, you can simply lock those out. The Escort Live app will remember the frequencies of the unimportant sources and not tell you about them in that location again, regardless of what the noise filtering on the detector thinks and regardless if you have the thing in highway mode (which essentially disables automatic false alert filtering).Escort Live gives you the Defender Database (red light and speed camera) location based warning feature of the 9500ix that the RedLine is missing. So the Redline + Escort Live is a great combination that's almost like having the RedLine and ix at the same time. If you have an iPhone or Android phone and you regularly use it in the car anyway, get the RedLine with Escort Live package and skip the ix. Escort Live is very inexpensive in relative terms. The ix by itself will supposedly do a little more to filter false alerts compared to the RedLine + Escort Live combo, but not that much. Personally I wouldn't get the ix unless I just never found myself on the highway at all or if I wasn't going to use Escort Live at all. RedLine + Escort Live also gets you ""social alerts"" from other Live users which the ix alone won't, and you won't have to periodically take your detector out of the car to update a database with your desktop computer or something.So if you have the budget for this and you're ever on the highway, get the RedLine! If you're thinking of getting the Escort Passport 9500ix Radar/Laser Detector (Black), you probably want to get the RedLine + Escort Live instead unless you don't have a compatible smartphone.Avoiding just one ticket will probably make this thing pay for itself when you consider both the cost of fines and increased insurance costs. Unless you always drive like grandma on Sunday, this thing is worth the price.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39BHSBF4OQXZD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002LZUY8A#wasThisHelpful","R39BHSBF4OQXZD","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lenspens seem to work pretty well in most situatons, but until now I've only had the standard sized one. I always wished that I had a smaller one that I could use to clean small lenses like the ones on point and shoot cameras and such, and the normal lenspen never seemed to be flat enough to do a very good job of contacting the surface of a flat filter.Well, the micro lenspen and the filter lenspen solve these problems. Really the one for filters isn't all that special, though it does do a better job of cleaning filters, but the micro sized lenspen is a huge help when it comes to cleaning some things like the tiny iPhone camera Photojojo add-on lenses that I have, and other little things that are difficult to clean with anything.If you're thinking of buying a lenspen, I say buy this set instead of an individual standard one unless you're sure you'll never want the others.

"This thing is perfect. Not only can you charge an iPad at full power with the thing, but the secondary port outputs 1A which will charge your phone faster than usual. In some cases the typical 0.5A charger (which might not even be outputting a full 0.5A) can't even supply enough power to my phone to both satisfy its power consumption and charge the battery if the phone is running the GPS, playing music, doing bluetooth, keeping the screen on, and other stuff that causes it to consume lots of energy.While this thing is more expensive than the cheapo adapters out there, it's well worth the cost. Having your devices too low on power when you get out of the car is really not fun, especially when they're drained before you can even make it back to the car. Two high power USB ports in one cigar outlet is a major advantage because most people don't have more than one or maybe two cigar outlets in their car. Even if you don't normally need two USB power ports, trust me... you will be happy you have the extra one day when you do need to plug something else in. And eventually you will.Buy a cheap adapter for $5 or something and one day the extra $15 you should have spent will feel like nothing when your battery is dead in some critical situation.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFAL1EQZANYCG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PU01M4#wasThisHelpful","RFAL1EQZANYCG","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thing is actually not bad. It fits on very securely. The only real drawback with it is that it doesn't do anything to protect the screen, but otherwise it protects from scratches and nobody can even tell that you have a case on the phone. At least for scratch protection, you can always just place a screen protector film over the screen.For me there's also the problem that the metal adhesive ring that I have around the camera lens that I use to attach magnetic accessory lenses won't fit over the camera lens opening in the case since it's too large. This won't be a problem for most people as most people aren't using the Photojojo iPhone lenses, but if you are then this is not really a good case to use. (Normally with a case that isn't too thick, attaching the lenses to the outside of the case works fine if the case is flat enough to adhere the metal attachment ring.)I'm probably going to give this to my mother as it should be pretty close to perfect for her. Anyway, for most people wanting a relatively light-duty case that protects all but the screen from scratches and doesn't stand out, this is a good choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RBPMVQNET8OE2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003V2NVQ4#wasThisHelpful","RBPMVQNET8OE2","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"For only slightly more than this thing costs you can find something like a GROM Adapter/Interface that's totally hidden with much better audio quality and no awkward junk sticking out of your cigar lighter socket.Here are the problems with this GOgroove thing:- Audio quality over FM is still too poor. A cassette deck audio adapter I have is much better even.- For some reason the control knob controls the broadcast frequency during normal operation, and it's too easy to accidentally hit the thing, changing the frequency by 0.1MHz, breaking the audio connection. This is dumb; they should have given you some way to hide or lock this so hitting the knob while trying to push one of the buttons won't change the frequency. It shouldn't need to be changed at all unless you're on a long trip.- There's a volume control (why?) that you access by pressing the knob down and then turning it. For some dumb reason it resets to 20 out of 30 whenever the thing is powered off and back on. Why 20/30 (or 66% of full) is a good default I have no idea, because the volume is too low compared to regular FM stations even when it's cranked up to 30. Since the same knob controls the broadcast frequency, it's also easy to mess that up while you're trying to fix the volume.- The only connection option is the gooseneck connector. It would have been easy for them to let you detach the gooseneck from the connector and connect up a plain wire between the thing and the power socket so you could mount it with velcro or put it wherever. As things are, if you wanted to do this you'd need to solder your own connector to the power pins or rig up something similar.- The thing is just way too expensive for what it does, almost as expensive as a real dash install kit with bluetooth, an aux port, ipod charger/audio cable, and handsfree mic. Save your money and just buy a real dash install kit to put behind your head unit. They're actually pretty easy to install since usually all you need to do is slide the head unit out and plug them in.The only stuff this thing gets any credit for is:- It does have an audio output jack so you can skip the poor quality FM link and add bluetooth to any aux port. Still, this is too expensive compared to a dash install kit.- The speakerphone thing is reasonably good. Again though it's nothing special and you can do better with a dash install for around the same cost.- The USB power jack is helpful though that isn't saying much.I don't really know why I bought this. I feel like an idiot. I thought perhaps it would make a good temporary solution until I could get my GROM kit installed (which I didn't have time for before my road trip) but I've ended up plugging in my iPhone with the cassette deck adapter that I've been using because the audio is much better and it's generally much less trouble.I tried to give this to both my brother AND a friend of mine, and neither of them have any use for it. I'll probably try to send this back as soon as I get home.This thing is just NOT worth it. Save the money to buy something like a GROM adapter or just a new head unit with Bluetooth, iPod support, etc. Buy the GOgroove and you'll probably wish you hadn't. I wish I had treated the high star rating with much more skepticism. Hopefully this will be the last time I fall for product ratings.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 27, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1STXWU23A61BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003PPGOC0#wasThisHelpful","R1STXWU23A61BO","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for my father for Christmas.After reading about how so many peoples' Keurig machines had failed, I started looking for an alternative. It appeared that the Bunn machine had a pretty solid reliability record and was generally more desirable in a number of ways.It took me forever to figure out what sort of pod this thing was supposed to be compatible with. All of the Keurig-compatible machines say ""K-Cup"" but this one didn't say anything about pod type.This machine uses many (*not all*) of the Senseo type pods which are like tiny versions of the regular drip filter packs that you see in hotel rooms. Not as cute as little cups but just as effective. You can place either one or two in the tray depending on how much of something you want to make and how strong you want it to be.I have NOT found any good reusable filters for this yet! I have mistakenly ordered k-Cup reusables that don't work with this, and after that I tried the Ecopad for the Classic Senseo which also DOES NOT WORK. Not everything that says ""Senseo"" works and anything that says ""K-Cup"" certainly won't. If you know of any good reusable filters for this, please leave a comment!The standard Bunn double chamber boiler thing is great. No need to wait for water to heat up because the thing always keeps some water hot. If you don't use it in an hour or so then it goes into half-power mode. After 2 hours or something it goes into low power mode, keeping water warm but not near boiling. However, when you do anything to it it wakes back up and takes almost zero time to get back up to temperature.Not only is this good for making pod beverages, but if you just want some hot water for your tea bag or something on short notice then you can just dispense some with no wait. Bunn's claim to fame is keeping water hot for use at a moment's notice, and this machine is no different than their others just because it's single serve.*Wash this out with 14oz of pure white vinegar before using! Unless you do you'll get plastic taste for quite some time. Go through the water filling procedure as described until it's working, but instead of brewing coffee right away dump 14oz of white vinegar into the thing and hit the button. It will pump the water out of the hot reservoir and pump the vinegar in. I let the vinegar sit there for a few minutes, then poured 14oz of water in and ran it again. This dumped out most of the vinegar. Run it through it's maximum 14oz at once for another 5 times and that should get 99% of the vinegar out. Now you're finally ready for decent coffee.I think the only drawback to the Senseo type pod machines is that the Senseo mini-filter-pack pods aren't as techno-classy looking as the K-Cups, but unless you're in a sales office or something and you want to impress potential customers with your cool technological stuff, this isn't going to matter one bit. Though the K-Cups give a bit more of a ""high tech"" impression, I don't think the majority of people are going to notice or care one bit.Anyway, I would recommend this. Bunn is known for good equipment and this thing works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RRD3G3NJC6XI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004EBUWHM#wasThisHelpful","R2RRD3G3NJC6XI","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered this for my father to go with his Bunn MyCafe coffee maker, and I would have sworn that I read something here that said it worked with the MyCafe. Of course it didn't because the Senso-type ""pods"" are more like tiny versions of the filter packs they sell for normal drip coffee makers.So if you have a BUNN MC MyCafe Single Serve Pod Brewer, look for pods/filters that are Senso compatible. I don't know why but it seems to be difficult as hell to confirm what sort of pods work with what machines. Keurig and compatible machines will say they use ""K-Cup"" pods, but it seems like nothing else will clearly say what sort of pods they use, just stuff like ""hundreds of different pods available!""Anyway, to replace these I ordered Ecopad, the Refillable Coffee Filter for the Classic Senseo so if you're looking for refillable type filters for the Bunn MyCafe or something that uses Senso pods, check that out and look at the ""other customers who looked at this bought"" list to see the alternatives.I can't really honestly rate the Medelco filters, not having used them, but I've at least looked at them physically in reality and they seems to be made OK.

"The Epson papers are always the safest bet for use with Epson color printers because of the built-in color/calibration support for all of their papers, and the Epson Ultra Premium papers never fail to disappoint me. Until recently the only matte paper I had used (on a 3880 at school) was some Premium Matte (the ""non Ultra"" version) that my teacher was handing out for free, and I was a bit disappointed with the density of both the black and colored print. I was much happier with the Ultra Premium Matte.At home I'm using an Epson R3000 (which uses the same UltraChrome K3 inks as the 3880s at school) with the Ultra Premium Gloss, Luster, and recently the Matte, and when I compare the same photo printed on both Ultra Premium Gloss and Ultra Premium Matte it's very difficult to tell the difference in color saturation and black density. Really I see no difference in very saturated colors, and the darkest black parts of the image are only very slightly lighter on the matte paper. (My guess is that most people wouldn't notice, but I'm a photography student and so I'm used to looking at minor details.) The only color difference I really notice, at least with this photograph, is that in the dark areas (shade) under some trees where there are some very very dark green colors the gloss shows more color differentiation (and thus more detail) than the matte. This would appear to be an example of the expected difference in color gamut between glossy and matte paper in general, and again you'd probably have to be a color zealot like me to really notice in this photo.Also, not everyone realizes this so I figure I'll mention it: When printing photos on ink jet printers, papers are not just completely interchangeable the way most laser printer papers or papers for B&W ink jet printing are. ""Office"" papers may be mostly the same, but with photo papers your printer/driver/software need to ""know"" how to print on them properly. Otherwise you may end up with a mess, figuratively or even literally. At best the colors will look wrong, and at worst the printer will lay down so much ink that it'll smear all over and never dry properly. So unless you're somewhat of an expert with ink jet printing, you should use the paper supplied by your printer's manufacturer. Some papers will never work on some printers, regardless of configuration expertise, simply due to ink type.So, in short, this paper is good stuff. While it is possible to get third-party papers that are better than this, or as good but less expensive, the Epson Ultra Premium papers are very good quality and guaranteed to work properly on compatible Epson printers with no hassle. (If you buy 3rd party papers then you're going to need to mess with ICC profiles and possibly paper thickness or ink density adjustments.)So when you want very high quality paper that works properly on Epson printers with no tinkering around or color profiling needed, the Epson Ultra Premium papers are the ones to use. The Ultra Premium Matte is just as high quality the Ultra Premium glossy and luster.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 21, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VU15SEH2E0GH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00004Z613#wasThisHelpful","R1VU15SEH2E0GH","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A decent tire gauge with a very useful built-in LED ""flashlight"" that allows you to actually see your valve stems at night. The bright illuminated display is particularly helpful at night too. The ""programmable memory"" thing doesn't seem to do anything but let you store recommended tire pressures so you can view them if you forget. (The thing doesn't seem to really DO anything when you hit the programmed in pressure as far as I can tell, though I don't know what it could do if it did.)After you take a reading you can instantly take another reading. No waiting for the display to ""clear"". Has no air release valve but you can just push it in halfway to let air out if you need. The readings usually agree with those from my TPMS, though I trust this thing over the TPMS. (TPMS sensors aren't really supposed to be perfectly accurate.)Also doubles as a general-purpose low power LED flashlight which could be handy at times.I did not find that I needed to add an o-ring to mine, at least with my valve stems (from Orange brand aftermarket TPMS sensors). Mine are rigid metal though; regular rubber stems might not easily allow as firm a seal.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24YTNRJMW7539/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000B6JJUK#wasThisHelpful","R24YTNRJMW7539","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The cigar lighter socket in my car (2001 Audi TT) is in an awkward place (I have to open up the ash tray which looks bad and gets in the way of things), and to make things worse it's a very shallow socket that doesn't do a terribly good job of securely holding most connectors. Basically my car seems to have come with the worst possible cigar lighter socket I could imagine. It's as if the designer didn't know you could plug accessories into a cigar socket. Duh!So I decided to buy a product like this and hardwire it into the electrical system, then just not use the original cigar socket anymore. Except for the cable length, this thing is pretty much perfect. The box is no bigger than it needs to be, and the cable length is probably fine if you're just going to plug it into your existing cigar socket. It would probably also be fine if I took the dashboard apart and wired it directly to the bus bar, but I wanted to run a wire from a fuse tap like this one in the fuse box to make installation much easier.So I cut the cigar connector off of the cable and used some bullet plug crimp connectors like these to extend it with some additional wire. This worked nicely and I can now unplug it from the electrical system (if needed) up closer to the unit without even having to open the fuse box. I ran the wire to the fuse box, tapped the cigar lighter's fuse socket with the tap (which doesn't disconnect the original cigar lighter), and put in a 10A fuse (same rating as the one in the connector I cut off). Wallah! More power sockets than I'll probably ever need, and ones that are actually deep enough to hold connectors securely.The typical Velcro that comes with these things is pretty wimpy, both the hooks/loops and the adhesive on the strips. Though the box is very light, it'll get heavier with stuff plugged into it, and I didn't want the thing going anywhere unless I wanted to remove it. So I used a big patch of industrial Velcro that was big enough to cover the entire mounting side of the thing and stuck it under the dashboard. That thing is NOT going ANYWHERE. Pulling the Velcro apart would probably be very difficult, and that adhesive isn't letting go without a heat gun or something.After getting unlucky with the crappy built-in cigar socket, I got lucky with this thing and managed to find the perfect spot where it's totally out of view, in the center of the underside dash, still reachable, and back under the ashtray where it won't block the ashtray door or anything else. (See my ""customer photos"".) It's VERY good that this thing is no larger than it needs to be, or I probably wouldn't be able to manage that.The ""cons"" of this unit, which aren't that bad and probably won't affect most people:- I sort of wanted to get one with a USB port, but most of those had three sockets and seemed a bit awkward. With this one I have four sockets, and if I want to convert one or more into a USB port all I have to do is plug in an adapter. Furthermore, with a built-in USB port the voltage/current adapter for the USB port is built in to the box where you can't just instantly pull it out and replace it if it goes bad. So personally I would go with more sockets and a USB adapter or two rather than get one of these things with a built-in USB port. USB car adapters are cheap anyway.- The unit is ""only"" rated for 10A, which is actually the best I could find, but the built-in lighter socket is fused for (and I assume rated at) 15A. In most situations I wouldn't need 15A, but I happen to have a 150W AC power inverter similar to this one which could draw up to 12.5A in theory. In order to avoid any fuse-blowing, I'll have to either plug this into the crappy original lighter socket to use it, or probably take the dashboard apart and hardware it to the bus bar/chassis with a 15A fuse. I haven't seen any fuse taps rated at above 10A, so fuse taps probably won't work for 15A stuff, and even if this box was rated for 15A the fuse tap would limit it to 10A anyway. So I guess I'll have another project later. Luckily I hardly ever need the inverter. But anyway, keep in mind that most AC inverters are going to use up to 12.5A (at least) and so it's not advisable to plug one into this 10A rated device as it may blow the fuse in the connector depending on what you try to power with the inverter. Luckily it seems like laptop power supplies are usually around 60W or something so I'd probably be OK powering a laptop with this, but still the full standard 15A would eliminate any doubt.- As previously mentioned, a longer cable would be useful for some applications, but it's probably long enough to reach to the back seat of most vehicles except maybe large vans and SUVs. Most people on here seem happy with the cable length.- There's an LED on the thing that stays lit as long as it's receiving power. This isn't really ideal for hardwiring to unswitched power since the LED will be on all the time, even with the car off. Luckily LEDs don't burn too much power, so this may be a non-issue unless I let my car sit for a month without starting it. I'll just monitor the battery voltage and see if it's draining enough power to make any difference. Stuff like the alarm system in the car is draining power all the time anyway, so some LEDs may not be significant. I also have a hardwired GPS power supply with an LED that will be draining some power too, but if it seems like it's going to be a problem I'll just install a switch.So this product looks like one of the best of its type. It may be limited to 10A, but I haven't seen any socket extenders like this that were rated for more than 10A even though the standard for a cigar socket seems to be 15A. A lot of the extenders I looked at were only rated for 8A, 5A, or even less. So this one is one of the better ones.Whichever socket extender you buy, DON'T get one rated at less than 10A! You may not need 10A most of the time, but with some crappy 5A extender you're likely to blow the fuse at some point, and for little reason. There seems to be no real cost savings in getting one of these rated for less than 10A.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FGNNMPCM7R23/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009JB7GI#wasThisHelpful","R1FGNNMPCM7R23","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have to admit that the whole friction mount thing doesn't _sound_ like it would work well (I guess people are just too used to having things slide around on top of their dashboard should anyone be foolish enough to put something there), but it does work and works well. This is much better than any suction cup mount I've used. (In my experience they fall off every 4-5 months no matter what, perhaps due to temperature changes in my area of the country.) Not only is this thing stable but having the GPS down close to the dashboard keeps it from blocking any of the view out the window in my car, and probably most cars.I have an Audi TT (2001) which has a rather curved dashboard in the area where I and probably most people would want to put this. At first I didn't think that it was going to make enough contact to avoid slipping, but it actually works! You can't tell from the product photo, but the base is more flexible than it looks and holds its shape after you bend it. So, you can shape it around rounded humps on your dashboard as long as they aren't too severe. This is even with the near-freezing temperatures we have around here right now.Also not obvious from the photos, the bottom of the base is perfectly smooth and looks sticky until you actually touch it. Then you find that it's like some sort of polished-smooth malleable silicone rubber type stuff that somehow won't slide against anything, even without any sticky/tacky stuff on it. It's almost like it's sticky without being sticky. (No adhesive junk to come lose on your dashboard.) It's just putty soft and smooth surfaced enough that it has tremendous friction, sort of like a super soft racing tire surface on steroids.I was trying to decide between this mount and the beanbag version, and I seem to have made the right choice for my situation in buying this one. The feeling I got is that this one is better if you're not going to move the mount between vehicles (that is, treat it as though it was just permanently attached even though it isn't). The beanbag is probably better if you want to move it between vehicles all the time. This rubbery one blends in with my dashboard better, but I'm guessing that if I moved it around all the time the almost-sticky bottom would pick up dust and I'd end up having to rinse it off periodically. I haven't seen the bottom surface of the beanbag, but I'm guessing it depends more on weight and typical high friction rubber than slick super-high-friction silicone type stuff.I looked up the weight of both this mount and the beanbag version, and I think the beanbag was like 2 lbs and this one is 1.6 lbs or something. So the beanbag might be better to offset the weight of heavier GPS units. I don't know how heavy they get, but my GPS is only 5oz or something at most, so I thought 1.6lbs would be sufficient weight and it seems that I was right.Since I have a sports car, I can conceivably pull some serious Gs. I can't say I've really maxed out the lateral acceleration of my car with this mount on the dash (it's winter here, ice, wet roads, etc.) but it seriously doesn't show any signs of going anywhere. This is with my typical faster-than-most-people speeds when taking 90 degree turns. Just the weight of the thing plus the ridiculously high-friction bottom seems to be more than enough to hold it in place even if the whole bottom isn't completely in contact with the dash.I kind of wish it would lay flatter against the weird excessively rounded part of my dashboard where I want to put it, and it would be nice if the base would swivel or something (though that might put it off balance), but there's no doubt that it works. Much better than a suction cup, or anything bolted/adhered to the dash that likely couldn't be removed without damage. I wish I had gotten one of these a LONG time ago.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 17, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O9I0CHGKS32Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0035JL4V2#wasThisHelpful","R1O9I0CHGKS32Y","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have a Lowepro camera bag and I'm quite happy with it, so I was pretty sure I was going to like the construction and protective value of this case. But how well would my new Garmin nvi 3490LMT fit?Well, I can say that it fits nicely. It looks like it could even handle something a little larger, though the case isn't too large for mine. It has plenty of padding like my camera bag, and also like my camera bag it has a microfiber flap of cloth inside for protecting the screen. Given how inexpensive it is, I really didn't expect it to be made as well as my $100 camera bag but it is!I'm glad that I bought this instead of any of the cases Garmin sells because this one has much better protection value which is important, especially since my particular GPS model has a glass screen. I'm not planning to test it, but I'm pretty sure I could drop this thing at least 3' onto concrete and any GPS inside would be undamaged. As a bonus, this case is also a lot less expensive than the official Garmin cases.Anyway, get this case! If your GPS has a 4.3"" screen and isn't from 10 years ago then it's very likely going to fit given the extra space it has with my 3490 in it. This Lowepro is the best case I could find after some extensive searching and I'm not the least bit disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWYWWYQK5N56E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002TLSOG0#wasThisHelpful","RWYWWYQK5N56E","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"UPDATE: Per-feature review information added to help you figure out if you really want the ""Garmin Guidance 3.0"" features on the 34xx models.The first thing that anyone considering buying this around December 2011 should know is that, unless you are really determined to buy the latest and greatest non-integrated GPS unit on the market or something, you might want to save some money and get a Garmin nvi 2595LMT 5-Inch Portable Bluetooth GPS Navigator with Lifetime Maps and Traffic which, BTW, also has a larger (5"") screen. While the 3490 has ""Garmin Guidance 3.0"", the 2595 has the larger screen and appears to only be missing the ""3.0"" features which aren't that amazing. The main difference most people will notice is the glass multi-touch screen on the 3490, which is nice, but perhaps not worth an extra $150 by itself.Other than the price, I have no real complaints about this model except maybe that I can't get one with a 5"" screen. Before buying this I would go to Garmin's web site and figure out if you're going to care about any of their super ""Garmin Guidance 3.0"" features. If not, I'd just get a less expensive one (with a 5"" screen even, which you can't even get in this series). I'm a gadget freak so I decided to pay the premium for the latest model, but that's just me. (I kind of feel like I'm wasting money just for the sake of entertainment.)The glass screen is quite nice, the user interface is very well designed, and the routing seems pretty good. You can change your little car icon to a tie fighter or some other sort of car if you want, you can change the voice, create your own voice with some Windows-only software, and some other non-important little features like that, but the thing is that (other than the glass screen) all of this stuff is available on less expensive models.Other stuff that I like (that's also available on less expensive models): the ability to plan trips and create routes on my computer and then upload them to the GPS instead of having to tap on the little screen to do all of this, the ability to download the ""travel log"" (breadcrumb trail) off of the thing (which is useful for geotagging photos with software that associates photo times with position times on the trail), and the custom Point of Interest upload feature. All of this stuff was particularly important to me.Whatever model you get, I recommend getting the ""lifetime"" traffic and map updates. I personally can't stand to pay recurring fees for for content updates on these things.So pretty much all of the stuff that matters to me is also available on less expensive models, so I wouldn't say I really needed the top of the line; I just decided to give up the 5"" screen and blow an extra $150 on extra features I don't really need because I'm a gadget nut.I did look at TomTom, but I didn't buy one of their GPS units because I don't feel like their desktop software support is as good. About they only feature they have that I wish Garmin's units had was their community contributed content stuff.Lastly, before deciding on a GPS to buy, check out the Garmin ecoRoute HD Vehicle Diagnostics Communicator HD to see if you're going to want to use that. If so then check the list of compatible GPS models.I would rate the 3490 5 stars, but I'm subtracting a star simply because I feel like they're gouging on price (as of December 2011) a bit *just* because it's the latest model. Next year (2012) the price on this will drop quite a bit, I'm guessing.Garmin Guidance 3.0 Feature Review Details(The stuff that the 34xx series has that the older ""Garmin Guidance 2.0"" models don't.)I've been on an 800 mile trip with this thing at this point so I can say more about the specific ""3.0"" features:""Digital 3D Traffic provides updates every 30 seconds"" - Whether this is worth anything is hard to say. Certainly it's doing much better at keeping up with traffic data than my 3+ year old Navigon was, but is it better than the ""Garmin 2.0"" stuff? How important is it to update this every 30 seconds vs every minute? Very hard to say. Didn't affect my buying decision.""InstaSearch for faster spelling searches"" - In my opinion this is no big deal. It pretty much just ammounts to more intelligent search interpretation sort of like what you get in Google Maps; type the name of a place, or type a whole address. I don't have trouble with entering search information so I don't really notice much advantage here. Didn't affect my buying decision, but might be important to you.""InstaRoute loads maps faster than ever"" - I really don't know what this means. Certainly it's much faster than my old GPS, but I'm guessing it's really not that much better than the ""2.0"" Garmin models.  Didn't affect my buying decision.""Pinch-to-zoom multi-touch interaction"" - The glass capacitive touch screen is much nicer than a resistive touch screen, and pinch zoom is nice, but I never need to pinch zoom. So really all I care about here is the glass/capacitive screen. Some effect on my buying decision.""Automatic dual-screen orientation (horizontal/vertical)"" - Like the iPhone/etc, there's an accelerometer in the thing that will let you orient it vertically and it'll automatically rotate the user interface. I have not used vertical orientation at all, only the typical horizontal. I probably would have used vertical if I were using pedestrian navigation, but I'm not. Might also matter if I were trying to fit the GPS into a narrow tall space or something. No affect on my decision to buy.""Bird's Eye lane guidance highlights proper lane with overhead perspective"" - This is actually kind of useful, but it's a slight improvement that's not always 100% correct, and didn't have any real impact on my buying decision.""myTrends(tm) anticipates your destination based on your driving habits"" - After 800+ miles of driving around with this, I still have no idea what this is. Sounds cool and I was curious about it, and it had some impact on my buying decision, but so far I still haven't figured out what this is supposed to be. Must be too advanced for me to understand.""SafeText reader -- receive and hear texts without taking your eyes off the road"" - The whole bluetooth phone interface is actually pretty good, especially with the voice recognition stuff. However, I don't really do lots of texting so I haven't even tried this feature. It had no impact on my buying decision.""Voice-activated navigation for hands-free operation (nvi 3490)"" - The voice recognition is pretty good since you don't have to tap the screen to initiate it. Instead you can speak (more like yell if you have lots of road noise) an activation phrase to enter voice command mode. I don't normally expect voice recognition stuff to work well enough to use, but after trying this it actually IS very usable. You can set up a route, find a gas station along a route, dial someone on the phone, etc, all using voice with no screen tapping. A huge improvement over what I'm used to. This WOULD have an effect on my buying decision if I had really been able to try it beforehand.""One-shot POI/address entry"" - Same on the 2xxx series. All this means is that you don't have to enter the street number, city name, etc into their own special fields to get the thing to recognize an address. Again, no improvement over the 2xxx.""3D terrain"" - Cool, but not a huge deal.Battery life - 4h vs 2.5h on older models. I normally expect to have this plugged in to the car's power, so this doesn't matter much to me.The 3490 seems to do a very good job of routing and especially offering up suggestions for avoiding traffic. Hard to say but it may actually be significantly better than the 2xxx models at helping you avoid traffic. It's supposed to also use historical traffic information (""trafficTrends"") of some sort (like ""at 5pm on this road the avg speed is usually 30mph instead of 55mph) then use that to compute the best route at the current time of day, day of week, etc. It would take some serious ""Consumer Reports"" style comparison testing to really tell how much better ""3.0"" is at traffic avoidance though.Well, I hope this helps.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDZ8FYYK00K7H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005DIBFYE#wasThisHelpful","RDZ8FYYK00K7H","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for use with my overpriced Garmin nvi 3490LMT and it seems to be working well. I've noticed no problems with it, and the EcoRoute application seems to be working just fine. Kind of cool how it tells you how many $ worth of gas you burned on your trip whenever you shut the car off. Hopefully this thing will eventually pay for itself in gas savings, assuming I listen to it's ""advice"".The little instrument dashboard screen on the GPS is kind of cool, and you can change the gauges around to display different instrumentation so you're not just looking at a replica of your instrument cluster.People who are complaining that it updates too slowly should know that this is the fault of OBD-II and NOT the garmin hardware. The standard OBD-II protocols have data rates of 1.2kbps to 41.6kbps and most cars except for some Ford or GM cars, and some cars made after 2008, will only do 10.4kbps (that's 0.0104Mbps or 1/100th of a megabit). Ford or GM cars might do 41.6kbps, and cars no older than 2008 (when the CAN bus OBD-II standard became mandated) may do 256kbps to 500kbps. According to Garmin FAQ, the device implements all of these protocols but it's hard to say which ones actually work on which cars. On most cars I'd expect it to end up using 10.4kbps which is slower than the dialup modem I had 20 years ago. In any case, the Garmin seems to be doing pretty well given that it's limited by OBD-II which was never exactly intended for high-speed Internet connections. The other thing to keep in mind is that the more parameters the thing is ""streaming"", the more delay there is since more parameters = more data = more of the amazing 10.4kbps bandwidth used up.The ecoRoute device is also not intended to allow you to reprogram the fuel map for performance tuning your car or something. It's not a general OBD-II tool or a vendor-specific register coding tool. Don't expect it to replace a ""real"" scanner/coder/whatever. I'm just surprised that it will actually look up engine trouble codes and let you reset them.Installation and setup are very easy and I ran into no problems except for the fact that the little adhesive strips that it shipped with aren't sticky enough to stick to *anything*, not even smooth plastic. (I did clean off the area I was trying to adhere the thing to before hand.) I doubt they'd even stick to polished plastic. Pretty sad since they keep going on about how you're going to die if it doesn't stay attached to something away from the pedals (where it can't end up under the brake pedal etc). This is a pain for me because there's absolutely nothing under my dashboard that I can use the zip ties to tie it to. Given all their overly cautious safety warnings though, you'd think they'd ship the thing with some serious adhesive. Anyway, use the zip ties to tie it to something if you possibly can. Those are very unlikely to break. If those won't work, use Velcro Industrial Strength (though you can buy a smaller amount than that roll.)Also make sure that it's actually possible to unplug the thing without completely removing it as a mechanic (or emissions inspector) is going to need to plug his rig into the connector at some point. They and you will be annoyed if they have to cut zip ties or rip off adhesive to completely remove the thing just to service the vehicle, and they might not reattach it fully.My only other complaint is that the app on the GPS doesn't give you access to all of the data that the Android app does, even though it should be able to, and there's no iPhone app. (My guess is that the lack of an iPhone app is mostly Apple's fault since doing anything with Bluetooth on an iOS device is ""iPhone hardware accessory development"" which requires all kinds of extra contracts and stuff to get access to the needed API and documentation. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple also wants some sort of royalty for every ""Made for iPhone"" device sold. Very annoying.) Anyway, fixing anything missing from the GPS app is just a matter of a software update anyway, so maybe they'll eventually fix that.Overall I'm satisfied with this for what it costs. It's not supposed to be a general diagnostic scan tool or something that can reprogram your seat adjustments using some protocol that only your car manufacturer knows and won't document for any other company. If you need to reprogram your fuel map or troubleshoot some sort of engine problem, you should get something else. But for what it's supposed to do, it seems to work just fine and though it's not super cheap, it's not ungodly expensive either.UPDATE: I did have one problem when I unplugged the ecoRoute to reattach it more securely. After plugging it back in it wouldn't connect to the GPS, even after a reset. After I shut off bluetooth on my phone though, it started working. (The phone was paired to the handsfree junk on the GPS.) Not sure what's up with this but if you have problems then shut bluetooth off on your phone and anything else as it might cause some sort of interference during pairing.Also, see my ""customer photos"" for how I attached it.UPDATE2: On my recent 700+ mile road trip I encountered a mechanical problem and the diagnostic capabilities of this thing, meager as they are, allowed me to talk to a mechanic on the phone to determine that I could drive it in for repair instead of having to call a tow truck. I was amazed that the seemingly silly gadget I had bought was proving to be so useful for dealing with a mechanical problem. The thing probably paid for itself in that one incident by keeping me from having to pay for towing. Just being able to know what's up with your engine so easily is very likely to save you much more than this thing costs.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2VSCPWR7GX3W4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CLYMSU#wasThisHelpful","R2VSCPWR7GX3W4","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is the first sensor cleaning method that I've tried, aside from blowing the sensor off with a bulb. I have a Nikon D7000 (APS-C, 1.5x crop sensor).This product seems pretty similar to the other Lenspen pens for lens cleaning except that it has a flat triangle-shaped head. I guess you're supposed to use the corners to pick at bits of dust or something.It basically seems to work once you figure out the right technique, but it's not amazing. I put my camera in mirror up mode, used the blower blub to blow out the aperture area while holding the camera upside down, and then started looking over the sensor with a loupe.At first I tried just gently brushing at the dust with the lenspen, but this didn't seem to work too well as the thing tended to just push the dust around. After that I tried wiping over the whole thing in rows ""squeegee style"" and this worked much better. I must have tinkered with the thing trying to find the best technique for 45min to an hour. Eventually I decided the easiest thing to do was remove the loupe, brush across the whole thing edge-to-edge (not stopping or starting in the middle), then put the loupe back on and look to see what was left. Then rebrush those areas with any dust left, always moving from edge to edge. Next time I'll be able to do this much more quickly.I went back and forth from cleaning to putting the lens back on and taking a test shot (f/32, defocused shot of a brightly lit wall at ISO 100) about 3 times before I was reasonably satisfied, but I still didn't manage to get every single speck off of the thing. When I stopped there were about 5 very tiny specks that seemed to be too small to cause much trouble and I didn't think I was ever going to get the thing 100% free of the really tiny stuff using this method. I also used a blower blub to blow off the tip of the lenspen thing a few times in case that did anything (I couldn't tell). I suspect that the lenspen isn't really capable of always holding on to all dust, so it's probably limited to cleaning off everything but 4-5 extremely tiny bits that won't affect the image enough to matter to most people.One thing I read said that you probably shouldn't use the lenspen until after you've done at least one ""wet"" cleaning. So my next cleaning is going to be the wet method and I'll probably reserve the lenspen for certain situations like removing a long fiber or something really big when I don't want to wet clean the whole thing. I'll probably also throw it away after 10 uses or so. I won't try to use it to remove anything stuck on by something other than static electricity.So the lenspen isn't that great but it isn't totally worthless. It does have the advantage that it doesn't require any liquids or other stuff, but it doesn't seem to attract dust or cancel the static charge that is usually what's keeping the dust from being blown off. The triangle shaped tip seems a bit odd to me; a spatula shape like the swabs would seem to make more sense.So overall I'd say it's worth trying out since it's pretty cheap, but I should have done a wet cleaning before using it. I don't see any signs of problems after using it, but I wasn't trying to pick off any glued-on crap or do anything else ""rough"" with it, so I wouldn't really expect any problems.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 16, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R35Y1A8R8CX2BY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001QUIEIS#wasThisHelpful","R35Y1A8R8CX2BY","A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2RU4U1JZ3DMP5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The lid does not seat well enough to smother coals as my Big Smokey Joe does,  or even well enough to keep smoke in lolThis grill makes life easier, having the charcoal right in a tub ready to use under it, the winged grates make adding coals easier,  and the propane ignition to light it works great, but honestly speaking I wouldn't buy it again for as much as it cost  -  good plan but missed it by that muchand the Weber 7403 Char-Basket Charcoal Briquet Holders WHERE included with mine","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12TYYK31BZ0XU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N634VD0#wasThisHelpful","R12TYYK31BZ0XU","A1RJ4BW5Z1BNUL","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1RJ4BW5Z1BNUL?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mine is giving me issues turning on, sometimes it will come on with a simple push of the button and sometimes not lol .When it does work the tripod  is moving at the laser spins causing the beam to move up and down ( YES the tripod is secure in the ground ) .The  tripod included with this model is just to weak for the head to be stable on the top, especially if you crank the shaft up at all. With the shaft raised about  four inches the beam was bouncing almost an inch at 25', this was driving me NUTS trying to level an area - until I realized the beam was moving.  The receiver has about a two inch ""area"" for reception also, if you are above or below this area in elevation it does not detect anything, a ""course"" setting on the receiver telling you if you are above or below the beam would be VERY helpful.  Sending this back and hopefully the next one will turn on when the button is pressed ( every time lol  ) and getting one with the heavy duty tripod because when it did work right it made life a LOT easier.

"The design of this ring is very nice, but the proportions are all wrong. It's a narrow ring, for one thing, 6 mm thick rather than the 8 mm that most of my plain bands are. I knew this from reading the product description but I guess I really didn't understand what a difference 2 mm would make. But on my finger it was so thin it looked silly.As if to make up for its inadequate width, it's too thick. I'm not sure exactly how thick it is, but since it ends in a sheer 90 degree angle (rather than some sort of tapering or beveling) the thickness is magnified. It kept getting caught whenever I went to put my hand in my pocket.The diamond (actually a CZ, but come on, you didn't really expect a diamond for this price) is also tiny, about the circumference of the tip of a not-too-sharp pencil. And it doesn't pick up the light at all; I was hoping it would glitter a bit every now and then, but not even waving my hand under a lamp let it pick up any luster.The brushed steel is good quality, and the brushed finish nicely matched my large bangle bracelet, which is what I'd bought the ring for in the first place. Also, the black plating is a nice touch. Having in on only one side made the ring surprisingly versatile: If I wore it with the plating facing ""down,"" closer to my carpals, it was a very different look from wearing it with the plating facing ""up"" toward my fingertips. If you had the same design on a better proportioned ring, it would be a great piece. As it is, though, I just couldn't make myself like the ring, try as I might. After wearing it once, I shipped it back to Amazon, and as always I'm very grateful for their no-hassle returns policy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2NSZKXP1Z2HSP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IPR58S#wasThisHelpful","R2NSZKXP1Z2HSP","A19V2TRL68EOHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19V2TRL68EOHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Sara Gruen wrote one of the great triumphs of modern literary fiction a decade ago, but it's been slow going for her ever since. Consider this newest book, At the Water's Edge. It's a by-the-numbers romance novel about a woman stuck in a toxic marriage. The device that sends her to the Highlands to become a fish out of water is so unapologetic a plot convenience that I couldn't help rolling my eyes. The setting doesn't really pop or come into play at all. The supporting characters are forgettable. Neither the war nor the hunt for Nessie get anywhere close to the pride of place they deserve. So all you have is the romance plot. Now admittedly that's far outside my usual preference (I really did think this would be more of an atmospheric period piece with an ensemble cast) but even if that weren't so, it's a bland story. Competent, but bland.","3.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IUS5XMDGHSGW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385523238#wasThisHelpful","R2IUS5XMDGHSGW","A19V2TRL68EOHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19V2TRL68EOHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I didn't realize when I requested this book that it's the third in a series. And the review deadline did not leave me with nearly enough time to read the first two books. I did look them up on Amazon and read their summaries, but it turns out I didn't need them all that much, because this book never refers back to its predecessors without giving a lengthy explanation of what's being invoked. This was useful for me, but for its intended audience--people who've read the series from the beginning--I have to imagine it would get old fast.Anyway, the book's not that interesting. I found the characters flat and two-dimensional. I found the politics overly simplistic and too blunt to be believable. I found that the people running the conspiracies gave away too much of their plans too early, denying the reader the satisfying experience of looking at wheels within wheels and trying to piece together what's going on. I mean, that's the point of reading thrillers, isn't it?All in all, reading this book felt much like reading the summaries of the first two books: like it was a sketch of a thriller, boiled down to its barest minimum elements, with none of the storyteller's craft brought to bear on building it up.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27UOPPS91BQGO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590799992#wasThisHelpful","R27UOPPS91BQGO","A19V2TRL68EOHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19V2TRL68EOHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This overcoat fits well and looks quite good if I do say so myself. Actually, I don't need to say it myself; I've gotten quite a few compliments on it. Unfortunately, it's too light.

"This is obviously a large and in-your-face ring. You wouldn't wear it to be subtle. I have a few other rings of which that's true, but I found this one even more so. Despite that, it's still a very tasteful ring if you feel comfortable pulling off that style. It really does look good, though all the black inlay in the various etchings gives it a pretty dark look when compared with your other stainless steel pieces.However, it's not at all a comfortable ring. To begin with, the sizing's a bit off: I ordered an 11, and it did not fit comfortably on the finger on which I'd intended to wear it; too loose. So I switched it to a finger that usually takes a 12 but can fit into some 11s, and while it got over the knuckle with no problem, it felt tight.On top of that, the band is too thin, and feels kind of brittle. I didn't feel like it was in any imminent danger of breaking, but at the same time I had little trouble imagining that happening eventually.  It felt very light on my hand, too.It was also hollow under the stone. Now that's common, unfortunately, but this was much more hollowed out than I'm used to. A huge cavity had been scraped out of the already-thin steel, not just under the stone but a good long way down either side of the ring.Altogether I was quite disappointed. I sent it back, and as usual, I appreciate Amazon's hassle-free returns policy.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FSL9YZWKFTJH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CS7NEP6#wasThisHelpful","R3FSL9YZWKFTJH","A19V2TRL68EOHV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A19V2TRL68EOHV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have viewed several of Rob's videos on YouTube and that is where I first came into contact with his theories.  This book goes into much greater detail than his videos and this book is quite impressive.  Rob treats this topic with a lot of respect and thoughtful meditation.  It's hard to argue with his conclusions, which he lays out like a great teacher would.  I highly recommend this book.  The manner in which the material is presented is compelling and stimulating, but easy to absorb and read. I am only about 1/3 in and I'm very impressed with it.  Can't wait to get back into reading it tonight.  Edited to add that the more I read, the more impressed I am.  The chapter on the xy male/female chromosones is amazing.

"A little about my background.  I've had bad skin with a lot of acne and scars.  I've been using aha products since the early 90s when Alpha Hydroxy products came to market, along with other exfoliation methods.  I've gotten TCA peels (in the doctor's office), 2 rounds of laser treatements, etc....just wanted to explain where I'm coming from in this review.  Let me be very clear about this product.  It's a fantastic product with several different ""peel sources"" used in the product.  Smells great, and gave me skin like glass.  And what is amazing is that only a thin layer is needed per application, which means it will last a very long time.  I want to give a very strong caution to people in terms of expectations.  If you have serious hyperpigmentation, age spots, etc....using this product alone will probably not do anything in terms of fast fading.  You have to use a lightening product along with exfoliation in order to get a good result to treat problems like that (many great lightening/vitamin C products on the market). For example, I exfoliate much more aggressively than the average person because I've been doing it for 20 years and have tough skin.  I do two major peels a week and use much milder exfoliation products during the week (Shea Terra black soap).  I use a product like this, and then do an AHA peel right behind it.  It helps products penetrate much better, and you get a quicker result that way.  However, not everyone can do that.  But the point I'm making is that for TOUGH PROBLEMS, you will need to do more than an exfoliation like this provides because it will take a very, very, very, long time, to see results.  Depending on what you want to treat, you need to use topical serum lightening products, maybe some plant stem cell products, etc.....Dr. Gross' retinol plus ferulic acid product is phenomenal and quite mild for those with sensitive skin but wonderfully effective.  I use quite a few natural products (you can see my reviews), as well as other products (matrixyl, plant stem cell products, etc....).  I rotate my products quite a bit.  Hope this helps the reader.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AV80K93ES10B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005H0ED92#wasThisHelpful","R1AV80K93ES10B","A1AE97J5Y2M2SA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AE97J5Y2M2SA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After being on antibiotics a lot as a child, I developed many ""issues"" related to that; leaky gut syndrome, candida overgrowth, IBS symptoms, uvitis, etc.....I have been able to live a relatively normal life because I took my health into my own hands many years ago while in my early 20s and investigated ways to naturally treat my problems.  One of my ongoing problems that has been greatly exacerbated by my age, has been insomnia.  I am sleeping better since taking black seed oil than I ever have my whole adult life.  I'm stunned.  I've taken melatonin since age 23 (I'm 48 now) and I still suffered with insomnia problems until I started taking black seed oil.  I sleep much deeper, don't wake up in the middle of the night constantly, and wake up much more refreshed.  For me, this one thing alone would be worth the price of admission.  However, all of the other remarkable health benefits are an added bonus.  The other thing I've noticed immediately is the leveling of blood sugar levels; I'm actually rarely even hungry and have to make myself eat at times.  I think this will help with some weight loss.  Very excited about this product and have purchased a 32 oz bottle so I won't run out.  You absolutely cannot go wrong with this oil.

I returned for the white pair because the price is so unbelievable; these are going for $80 elsewhere online, so get these while you can.

"If I could rate this zero stars, I would. As other Kindle users have noted, this app works great for a few weeks, then only streams sound with no video.  I was in the middle of watching a movie and all of a sudden, no video.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the problem is not fixed.  This is perhaps the most frustrating thing I've encountered with my Kindle.  The minor problems I've had with other apps were easily fixed by doing a reinstall, but not with this.  Clearly it's a Kindle issue.  I can easily stream Netflix movies on my laptop and desktop, so the problem is a Kindle problem.  Man, to say I'm bummed would be an understatement.

"I saw that there were many American cable channels included in this app but there weren't any that I could see.  This app is targeted towards Koreans mostly.  I give it 2 stars because the quality is amazing.  I wish there was an American equivalent (US TV is very hit-or-miss).  I'm sure our Korean brothers and sisters are very happy with this app and I don't blame them.  The quality is astonishing.  Ease of use and graphic quality are astonishing.  Fantastic.  When I clicked onto the movie section, there were really only lame, old, American movies.  Old black and white movies, many I had not even heard of...totally cheesy.  I highly recommend this for our Asian friends but not for Americans.  I'm deleting this...imo, there is some false advertising going on here.

"I downloaded this app and immediately noticed a major problem.  This app works fine if you click onto the ""featured"" videos.  There is an ""X"" on the right hand side of the screen and you click the X and the video is stored on your unit.  However, I don't want Justin Bieber, Bollywood, JayZ, etc....downloaded.  If I actually use the ""search"" function, I'll get a list of videos.  There is no way to download the videos when you do a search.  No X appears anywhere on the screen.  The dates the videos were put on YOUTUBE go off the right side of my Kindle unit.  There is no way to shrink the page.  I went into settings to check and see if I could change the settings in some kind of way and nothing exists in the settings options that explains how to make the SEARCH function useable.  I emailed the company that puts this out because they provide customer support in the ""settings"" option.  I went back and forth with this company in 3 emails and they didn't answer my last email when I clearly explained the problem I'm having.  They asked for a screen shot...I asked them how I did that on a Kindle unit (they didn't answer my direct question).....they then asked for a description of the problem and I described the problem.  I asked them if the fact that I'm on a 7 inch Kindle is a problem and no answer.  So at the end of the day, I'll remove this from my Kindle because I have absolutely no explanation from anyone regarding why ""searched for"" videos do not have a download option anywhere.

"I have been perusing the apps store here at Amazon since getting my Kindle Fire a few weeks back.  I stumbled on this one, read many reviews, and decided to try it.  Wow. It's truly amazing.  Channel guide is clear but I have a few complaints.  First, no blocking the ads as far as I can see, and what's up with the subtitles in other languages?  I see no way on the settings menu to change the captions/subtitles option, so on some channels like HBO and a few others, I get subtitles in Spanish and other languages, with no way to stop the subtitles from appearing that I can see.  Weird.  Another weird thing is that some channels are running ""live"" on my Kindle, but many are not.  I thought it would be great if I was really tired, to go to bed and watch something I wanted to finish watching, but do it in bed while about to go to sleep.  But if it's not a streaming live connection to the channel, I don't see a way to do that.  But overall, this is really an amazing app to have.  I clicked onto HBO and to my happy surprise, there was Girl With The Dragon Tattoo playing. Maybe I'll get caught up on Homeland Season 2 if Showtime runs it as a marathon or something.

"This is my third Shea Terra purchase and I believe that hands-down, these are the best of the best in ""natural/organic"" skincare. I don't know how or why the ingredients seem to be at a different level of ""active"", but they are.  You see results the first time you use them, and this product is no different.  I've used topical C off and on for many years now, but this seems to be like those products on steroids.  The lifting and tightening effect for me is almost immediate.  It probably helps that I use the black soap products, but this is an extraordinary product.  I use it right after I cleanse my skin morning and night, then let it dry, then apply my other products as usual. Instead of toner, I'd highly recommend this product.  I like the smell...it is delicate and faint.  The active ester C in the product is the icing on the cake.  Try it ladies, especially if you are in your 40s, to jump start any other products you are using, and to tone and tighten your skin.  I tried to grab my skin to test the elasticity (because my skin was that tight), and I could barely grab any...that's how tight and lifted my skin had become after useage.  Not in a dry, tight, way, but in a firm, lifted, ""young skin"" way.  I don't think you'd regret this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 19, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/RT60BTCP1KDHH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003WNXZZO#wasThisHelpful","RT60BTCP1KDHH","A1AE97J5Y2M2SA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1AE97J5Y2M2SA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Tonight 11pm, I needed it.My upstairs central air suddenly smelled of plastic, so--with the A/C turned off, and my wife on standby at the thermostat--I headed up the attic with a fire extinguisher.  I didn't smell any burnt plastic in the attic even after she turned the A/C back on, but the upstairs bedrooms still did, so I figured the problem was with the A/C or the ducts.I found that the attic A/C air intake and various housing components' tape covers were flapping about.  I removed the original foil insulation tapes, wiped down the surfaces with paper towel dabbed in rubbing alcohol, then applied this foil tape to cover the openings.  I also took the opportunity to tape up various holes and rips in the foil ducts, which ended up taking almost an hour.Afterwards, I had my wife turn on the A/C, and voila, no more funky smell.  I've hopefully also improved the A/C efficiency ever so slightly with the hole patches.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HYLPFUCBIT3Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NG622Q#wasThisHelpful","R1HYLPFUCBIT3Y","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This tall board book (roughly twice the height of typical board books) is beautifully illustrated fully on both sides of the pages; the left and right sides form one scenary, with a sentence on a light background.  Unlike many recent board books which copy/paste simple drawings, and only 1 side of the page at that, this book is a work of art.It's among the favorite books of my daughter and son since birth.  We can easily spend several minutes between page turns, and the scenes are enjoyable even to the tired parent.Their eyes linger edge to edge, consuming all the colorful flora and fauna, and experience the progression of the seasons from Spring to Winter.  My 3-year old now likes to count and discuss various details of the book.The sentences are brief, yet cute and descriptive of the scene.  The final page of the book has Nicholas the Bunny going to sleep, which I is our kids' cue to also go to sleep.This and Goodnight Moon are popular classics for excellent reason.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKQ8FTOKG75A2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0375827781#wasThisHelpful","RKQ8FTOKG75A2","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006M9F50S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0Inner OCD demon compelled me to somehow keep my wife's assorted boots and Uggs from being strewn and flopped over other shoes.She already had 1 pair of spring-loaded boot shaper that was gifted, but was reluctant to use it from fear of it stretching the leather or fabric.  They were also cumbersome to insert or remove one-handed, tended to be too short for her taller boots, and expensive (relatively speaking).I tried plastic boot clips from the store that sells ""containers"", but they twist, causing indentations and still flop to one side (at least together...).These Household Essentials Boot Shapers are a godsend!  Priced very reasonably (~$6.50 for 2 pairs), and can be trimmed to fit either tall, medium, or short boots.  The size guides have perforations and guide lines to help cut properly.  When not in use, they fold perfectly flat to be unobtrusive.The hanger holder feature is a bit dubious, since the friction required depends on the boots' inner material.  However, the ""hanger"" hole is great for pulling the boot shaper out when using the boots.The force of the boot shaper spreading doesn't stretch the boot material, so it's definitely suitable for leather, Ugg, etc.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RE73H1712YAMI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006M9F50S#wasThisHelpful","RE73H1712YAMI","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

With my previous model-specific cradles, they became totally useless after I sold my old phone, so I usually gave it away or bundled it with my sold phone.The microUSB male plug is on a fore/aft hinge, so it's easy to remove the phone in a hurry, without worrying about bending or snapping off the plug.It comes with a square 2.1A wall wart plug (power plugs do not fold) and 2 USB cables (one for data, one for faster power-only).I wish it had a slot for extra battery charger, but otherwise it's perfect.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IQ9C01JV3VBD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00EWUNXMG#wasThisHelpful","R3IQ9C01JV3VBD","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I've been holding off on purchasing this until the 4Ah battery bundle became available, but the monkeys swinging across my lawn jungle forced my hand.  I decided to just use the 2Ah battery that I already had for my GreenWorks 80V leaf blower.The shipping weight is 72 pounds (mower-only package), but the box was light enough to carry by myself.  Packaging is minimal, yet sturdy, with cardboard spacers.  The box contained the mower, handle bar extension, manual booklet, and quick-start sheet.The only assembly required were 1) attaching the handle bar extension using 2 bolt/knob combos and 2) snapping on the right-side mulch discharge chute.  Alternatively, you can leave off the side chute, pull off the rear mulching block, and attach the clippings collection fabric bag.  The entire handle assembly is adjustable to 3 heights using the pair of built-in 90-degree twist knobs.  Theres also a lever to adjust to 7 different cutting heights.To prepare to mow, simply lift the battery cover flap on raised protrusion on the center-top of the mower, push in the battery until it clicks into place (release button is used when removing the battery), then lower the flap.No messy, smelly gas or oil needed.  No nauseating exhaust!  The electric motor is far quieter than a gas engine; my toddlers fell asleep fine during my mowing.  Theres none of the headaches of maintaining a gasoline engine:  buy/store/pour jugs of gasoline, buy and keep engine oil topped off, buy fuel stabilizers, deal with spills, clean/replace spark plugs, burn off excess gasoline for off-season storage, etc.To turn on, you push and hold the green button on the upper-right of the handle, then grasp the green lever arm together with the handle bar, then let go of the button.  When you release lever, the mower turns off completely; there is no idle.  To restart, youll need to repeat the hold-button and grasp-lever routine.  There is no cord-yanking involved.The mower is very easy to push (note its not self-powered), so I speed-walked most of the time.  Its easy to turn 180-degrees for parallel mowing.  The blades cut very near to the outer edge of the wheels (see attached picture), so theres minimal need for overlap.  Theres a rubber rear skirt to protect you from any rock or debris projectiles, which is a godsend for my yard, full of landscape stones and sweet gum tree spike-balls.The 2.0Ah battery from my leaf blower had plenty of power to mow the  acre of greatly-overgrown grass and weeds (yesterday 5/17 was my first mow of the season), then power the blower to clean the mower.  Itll probably still have enough power for the string trimmer (on backorder), but I plan on buying either the 4.0Ah battery once its available or another 2.0Ah.For storage, the handle bars easily fold over at the base for fast, compact storage.  I actually have my mower resting vertically in the garage for maximum space savings (see my first picture).  I feel its also light enough for most people to carry it to the basement for winter storage.Im very happy with the 80V mower and leaf blower so far.  This Fall, I plan on selling my 24 gas snow thrower to replace with a GreenWorks 80V model as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R367Q481L3UF0L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SSBL02U#wasThisHelpful","R367Q481L3UF0L","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The GreenWorks GBL80300 is a bit heavier than my corded Toro 51609 (~14 lbs vs ~11 lbs, respectively) due to the included large battery, but well balanced.  The power on/off button and 3 speed settings button on top of the handle are easily reached, even while gloved.  With the Toro, I'd often inadvertently change the speed setting because of the poorly placed dial.The battery has a 3-level power indicator, which is activated by pressing a button on the battery itself, even when detached.  The battery is easily detached by pushing the release button and pulling out the pack.  To attach, just push it in.  When charging, the included charger runs an internal fan, which makes a soft but noticeable whirling noise.This blower easily clears several inches of powder snow off my front porch, driveway, and sidewalk.  The highest setting is surprisingly strong for a battery unit, requiring two hands for extended use.I'm planning to purchase a Greenworks 80V mower as well (battery & charger not included), but will opt to also purchase a 4AH battery, rather than solely rely on the blower's 2AH battery.  Note that this new generation of 80V battery and matching equipment are much more expensive than Greenworks' previous generation of 40V battery and equipment.I'll update in a few weeks, after the ultimate test of clearing the evil sweetgum tree ""fruits"" (hard, brown spherical spikes that fall down by the thousands, clinging mercilessly to the lawn in wait of twisting a victim's ankle).Versus a corded blower:I got fed up with my Toro blower's power cord always snagging, having to walk back around obstacles, and unwinding/rewinding/repositioning/unwinding/etc. around the house.  The hassle made me second guess the decision to forgo the $300/season landscaper cleanup of my tiny ~0.2 acre lot, or perhaps even revert to using a rake.  Although this unit costs double that of the Toro--which can additionally vacuum/mulch leaves--the wireless convenience makes it definitely worth it (like a laptop vs desktop PC).","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3QUJSQ55D1FU5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00R6Z4SEQ#wasThisHelpful","R3QUJSQ55D1FU5","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The set comes as shown with a purple frame / red gate and a yellow regular panel (so, 2 panels total). The latch, hinge, etc are all plastic, so the gate feels a flimsy and needs a little wiggling to properly.To open, you toggle down the vertical switch near the top middle, then while holding the thumb slide at the top, lift and swing open the gate (see my pictures). You also have to hold the thumb slide when closing. The vertical lock can be left always unlocked if preferred, since the gate is too difficult for a child to operate.At $110, a regular non-gate set of 8 panels come out to $14 per. At $43, this gate set works out to $29 gate door + 1 panel ($14) which you may not even want. Gate door being double the price of a regular panel is not unreasonable, but forcing the purchase of an extra panel is unsavory.I use it with an existing panel set for a makeshift ball pit.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KHABGCEYYXDJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00IX69TF0#wasThisHelpful","R1KHABGCEYYXDJ","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"After about 13 months of use with my NON-iSpring 6-stage RO system installed last year by a local vendor, the water taste had noticeably changed.  By then, I'd been trying to schedule for weeks a date/time with the same vendor for filter replacement.  When the tech finally came, he didn't have the alkaline filter with him...  I said goodbye to him, and onto Amazon I went.These filters fit perfectly with my RO system.  This is by far the best bargain for RO filters, and even includes a replacement membrane (replaced every 3 years).  The local RO shop charges ~$150 to replace the 6-stage filters annually (not the membrane), and that's with the ""6 months"" filters being used for 12 months, and since iSpring's includes 6 of the ""6 months"" filters, its an even better value.  And you can replace the filters at your own convenience.Only caveat was I had to call iSpring to request 4 free quick-fit adapters to thread onto the stage 5 & 6 filters (my previous ones had quick-fit built into the filter cases), with several wraps of Mr. Gasket 2842G Teflon Tape.  Phone support was very prompt and helpful.Check YouTube for simple ""RO filter replacement"" videos.  You'll want to clean the Stage 1-3 filter canisters (the big vertical ones), since they get grimy after a year.If you don't already have a horizontal mount for the stage 5 or 6 filters, I'd recommend S5-TO-S6 RO Kit for 2.5"" diameter Inline Filter (buy 2 if you need a pair for both filters), which will keep the stage 5 & 6 filters stable and less prone to hose leakage.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1B48C3M1BE8P5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BNGRIX2#wasThisHelpful","R1B48C3M1BE8P5","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

If you want a flush wall mount, get a simple wall mount without ball and/or articulating arm.- All the screws, washers, and nuts were bundled in one bag, so you have to manually sort all of them, then reference the manual to figure out which is which.  Also, there was no suitable washer included for the smallest monitor mounting screw (all washers' inner diameter were too big).TIP:Finding the ideal monitor and wall screw positions are difficult to do alone.  To simplify, trace and cut a template of your monitor face-down on a box (like the Amazon box that the wall mount shipped in), then measure and mark the mounting plate's holes on that box.  Tape the template onto the mounting plate.  Once you find the ideal wall position with the template/mount combo, mark the wall mount holes using a pencil or thumbtack.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3HJDN9P5F58AC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GTT0VO#wasThisHelpful","R3HJDN9P5F58AC","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

HOWEVER, it seems from the 4th product image and recent reviewers that the manufacturer has recently updated the hole placement to be oval to accomodate Verizon models.Pros:+ Nice looking soft clear case looks like your phone is encased in glass, rather than an ugly plastic slab+ Tethered dust/water caps for headphone and USB jacks, great frome blocking dust and lint from pocketing all day, every day+ Offered in many color options (just the sides or entire)+ Fits well all around, and volume/power buttons operated fine under the raised nubs+ Half the price of Samsung's OEM caseCons:- $4 shipping and seller doesn't offer via Amazon Prime, so you don't have Amazon's no hassle return policy- You may need to contact seller to replace yours with updated case if you have Verizon Note 4------* Encased Shell Holster Combo Case with Kickstand & Belt ClipIf you want a holster, this may be a good choice.Pros:+ Kickstand+ Case snaps onto included belt holster+ Sturdy kickstand that works in both vertical and horizontal mode, although horizontal is a bit wobbly+ Case alone is slimmer than expected+ Fits Verizon bottom mic hole+ Low priceCons:- Slick plastic surface, although it does have a slight bump texture- Front of top & bottom portions are exposed due to need for use with the snap holster- Available in ""any color so long as it is black""------* JOTO Armor CaseProbably the best KICKSTAND case for Note 4.Pros:+ Oval cutout for bottom mic to accomodate both Verizon and ""normal"" Note 4+ Layer of soft rubber-like TPU + hard outer shell+ Flush kickstand works for horizontal, but is flimsy.

"After trying 4 other cases, I've ""settled"" on this one.  It actually enhances the phone's appearance, rather than detract, while offering great protection.Below is a comparison of 5 various Note 4 cases, with notes on Verizon bottom mic hole compatibility.------Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Protective CoverSamsung original case, which I've settled on after trying at least 5 cases.  Note that if you register your phone on samsung.com, you'll receive a 50% off accessories code good for 30 days, so you may want to check samsung.com's price prior to purchasing on Amazon.Pros:+ Sleek, functional, very attractive, and doesn't even look like a case.+ Back has bump texture to prevent slippage+ Back blue color is very vibrant and shimmery like a blue morpho butterfly (also comes in black or red)+ side and front edges are black rubber (rather than cheaper TPU), with extra protrusions at the corners for enhanced drop protection+ Power and volume buttons are encased under well-defined protrusions, rather than cutouts.  You can easily find and press the buttons by feel.+ Cutouts for jacks and mics are perfect, with the bottom mic cutout being oval to fit any model Note 4 (Verizon's, which I have, has the bottom mic hole 2mm further from the USB jack than AT&T/T-Mobile/Sprint.

"I've been using Brother P-Touch label maker to tag assorted power and network cables, but needed something quicker to tag in assorted colors for the unfinished basement tubes, wires, and cables.Along with Sharpie Retractable Ultra Fine Point Permanent Markers, 3 Colored Markers(1735794), I was able to quickly tag cold (blue marker) & hot (red marker) water pipes and where they lead.  Same for reverse osmosis water system inlet and outlets to sink and fridge.  Water bypass tubes to backup sump pumps and sprinkler.  The uses are endless.Pros:+ Tag portion is above the loop enclosure (easier to differentiate among crowded cables).

"Since my babies run, roll, & crawl on the lawn, I wanted a toxin-free solution to the weeds and crabgrass.  Whether you think pesticide/herbicide concerns are overblown, you can't argue with immediate results from weeds being physically removed versus waiting days/weeks with repeated chemical use (which cost money).Some folk remedies sounded dubious at best:* Vinegar:  costs money (albeit cheap) & also kills healthy grass* Boiling water:  boil multiple pots of water, then lug it around while trying not to scold myself??  No thanks.* Pull by hand:  not only tedious and painful, it's almost impossible to pull the entire root by hand.This Fiskars tool is pure genius:  the tried and true method of pulling weeds by the root via an ergonomic, lightweight tool.I bring along a small cart with a paper grocery bag to eject the weeds into and a container of grass seed mixture to fill up any soil gap.  After I'm done, the paper bag of weeds is left on the curb for weekly pickup.  Going green with a green thumb:  2 green thumbs up.Pros:+ Very easy and comfortable to operate.+ Instant results, and can be seeded immediately.+ No toxic chemicals.  Lawn can be used immediately.+ No $ spent after one-time purchase.+ Lightweight.  No heavy container of herbicide to lug.+ Eject mechanism further simplifies and speeds up weeding.  And fun!+ Super-herbicide resistent weeds?  No problem.+ Green.  0 chemicals.  No pollution.Cons:- This model doesn't have a handle hole for hanging, although the other 2 do.  You could hang it upside down at the base if you have a long hook, but dirt will fall and the handle will be tilted.Wishes:* A plastic cap for the claw-end would be nice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1IZL9RM7IXIH4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0030MIHAU#wasThisHelpful","R1IZL9RM7IXIH4","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the Chase Amazon Visa 3% back credit card, which I was happy with.  I had set my Chase checking account to auto full pay the card each month, so the only thing to remember was to periodically use the saved credit points on a purchase (can be an odd value like $3.21; doesn't have to be $20 increments like most point cards).  And free extended warranty!With that great experience, the new Amazon Store Card with 5% sounded even better.  But what's the catch??  For purchases over $149, Amazon Store Card automatically switches the benefit option from 5% credit to 0% credit with 6+ months extended financing.  Sneaky sneaky, but I figured I'd just be vigilant to manually change the reward option back to 5% credit.Not so fast.  Amazon Store Card becomes your default payment, so my subscribe and save purchase (costing over $149) automatically got the extended financing.  Since I pay in full each month (especially with its ridiculous 25% APR, I hope everyone does), this amounts to LOSING a 5% discount:  a $200 invoice should've been $190 after 5% credit, but now I've lost out on that $10.I've reverted my default payment to Amazon Visa, but then miss out on the extra 2% discount for subscribe and save.  For regular purchases, I now have to manually change regular payment option to the Store Card, confirm it's 5% credit instead of extended financing, and manually pay the monthly statement while adding on the previously forced extended financing amount.And the Store Card does NOT have free extended warranty, which Chase Amazon Visa has, so I use the Visa for more expensive purchases.  But then it kind of defeats the purpose of the Store Card.Now, if I close out the Amazon Store Card, it'll mess up my credit length (already -23 points from Store Card's hard credit inquiry).  I'll close it out regardless in a few months for my sheer spite for it.By the way, regardless of your credit score, your starting limit is amazingly low.  That itself is not a big deal; GE / Synchrony Bank (which manages the Amazon Store Card) automatically raises your limit after several months of full payment.I'd highly recommend applying for or staying with Chase Amazon Visa instead (I'm not affiliated with Chase).","1.0 out of 5 stars","October 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXN08N44HGIIX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008A0GNA8#wasThisHelpful","RXN08N44HGIIX","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've been using the 18"" x 36"" for my kids' bathtub for almost 9 months now, and love it.Pros:1.  Non-slip:  My 2-year old has never slipped while using this mat.  The full-size tub (2008) already has a textured surface, but my toddler often slipped on it before the mat.2.  Sitting & standing comfort:  The thick rubber and big suction cupped bottom provide plenty of cushion.3.  Good grip:  Large and copious suction cups provide excellent stability even on textured tub surface.4.  Easy to clean:  After each bath, I just splash the top and bottom a few times with a small bucket of clean water, then hang top-down to dry over KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket5.  Perfect coverage from back of tub to the drain.Cons / Wishes:- Some cute pattern options or brighter colors would be nice for kids' use.  However, better boring white (it's actually more like ivory, with cross-hatch pattern) than leaching colors or chemicals.Tips:* Be sure to measure the dimension of your tub bottom from the back to the drain.* It may have smelled initially of rubber, but scrubbing it with soap and sponge, then hang dry for a few days got rid of any smell.  You'll obviously want to clean it before first use anyway.Other great kid bath accessories:KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket:  to organize scoops, toys, and hang dry the bath matSkip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby:  keep the kid from banging head or touching hot faucetBRICA Bath Kneeler:  your knees will thank youSkip Hop Moby Bathtub Elbow Rest, Blue:  your elbows will thank you, and it'll absorb water from your wet arms (rather than dripping to bathroom floor)Munchkin Lazy Buoys Bathtub Toys:  we've purchased multiple bath toys, but this is by far the most interactively fun toy set.

"My wife and I happily used NorthShore Premium Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), 17 x 24, Case/100 (4/25s) at ~$0.28/pad for our first child's diaper changing needs, but switched to this one (~$0.10) for almost a third of the cost for the second child.  Big mistake.  We don't care too much about the thickness or absorbency (just catch the occasional accidents and leaks!), but these underpads pill and strip way too much.  Whenever we scoop up our infant, cotton strands are stuck to our fingers and baby, resulting in much gnashing of teeth and non-PG exclamations.

"My wife and I had purchased this book shortly after our daughter's first birthday, but hadn't actually read it to her until she had turned 21 months, due to the fragile paper pages (vs a board book) and the sheer number of books we had already purchased.The first time I read this book to our daughter, I thought upon the first page that the calligraphy-style font choice and wasted page spacing were poor, but the story still endearing.  The book progresses with a story of the mother recounting her experience with her daughter through childhood, then imagining her future.  Around the middle of the story is the passage, ""Someday I will stand on this porch and watch you waving your arms until I no longer see you.""I cried.While I am already a daddy's girl's daddy, the story made me realize even more just how fleeting parenthood can be.The illustrations are also light, yet profound, in water color style.I rate this book 4 out of 5 stars because it's not really a kid's book, but rather more of a mother's, yet seems overpriced for a short, sentimentality book.  And where's the father in the story?!  So sexist... (only sort of kidding).

"Instead of awkwardly holding a quart or gallon can by the metal handle (or precariously holding the Ziploc), you just slide your hand through the grip.  It feels very natural and comfortable, and brush dipping isn't obstructed by your other hand and handle.

No need to pry open gallon or quart cans each time or even cleanup.

"My walk-in closet, which has the pull-down attic stairs, has been noticeably cold in NJ winter, even though it has its own central-air vent.

A few hours after installing this attic stairway cover, the temperature difference became only 3 degrees F, confirmed again a few days later.This unit was very easy to assemble (like a mini tent), and probably took less than a minute.

"Previously with a standard car snow brush, I'd open a side door, stand on the ledge (I'm 5'10""), then swipe back and forth to clear one corner of the SUV roof, then repeat from the other 3 doors, inevitably resulting in some snow inside the car.  Similarly, I'd clear half the snow from the windshield, hood, and the back from one side, then repeat from the other side.  Now you're cold, covered in snow from hand to torso, and lamenting the wasted minutes of spiked hot chocolate time.With this ingenious device, you can clear the entire SUV all from one side in seconds.  You detach the handle from the head, twist it on, then extend the handle (twist locks secure); whole process takes 3 seconds.  The side of the foam head curved away from you is used to push the snow off to the other side, then you spin it halfway to the side curved toward you to pull the snow off.  Repeat this a few times (or just stick to the push technique), and the car's ready to go.  No discourteous and illegal ""snow missiles"" anywhere on your car.PROS:+ Easy to push/pull snow off the roof & hood very quickly and easily+ Head (orange portion) is solid foam to avoid scratching the car paint; bright color makes it easy to locate in the trunk/backseat+ Compact:  handle bar collapses, detaches, and clips lengthwise to the head+ Base of handle has an ice scraper+ Sturdy:  I've been using my first one for 3 NJ wintersCONS:- A brush attachment would be great for wiper well clearing (I just dig it out with the scraper portion or by hand)I've purchased another for the second car, and gifted 3 more to relatives.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 20, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPFEL54KU5V4D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001DKQZCS#wasThisHelpful","RPFEL54KU5V4D","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Whether snowboarding or commuting to work, this is the scarf to have.  It's attached/adjusted via velcro in the back, so it's easy to put on and take off, without messing your hair or glasses.  This is especially handy when you're wearing a helmet/goggles or earphones.  I usually keep the nose/face portion down, but it's great to use on windy days.  The vented nose and mouth openings help breathe easily and minimize goggle/glasses fogging.

"I wasn't sure whether the water pressure from the 2 outside faucets were weak because of my Gardena hose attachments or the recently plumber-installed pressure reducer (from 80 to 45 psi) in the basement.  I had recently purchased the house, so there was no basis for comparison, other than that the outside water pressure was pitiful compared to other houses.  So I purchased this gauge to determine the source of the water flow issue and to use in adjusting the pressure reducer to 60 psi.I placed this gauge directly on the backyard faucet:  67 psi.  Surprisingly high for the low water pressure.  I shut off the water:  0 psi.  I then placed it at the end of the 1/2"" Gardena hose with accessory adapter:  67 psi.  Hmm, I guess the hose and attachment are ok...  Front yard, both scenarios, again 67 psi.  I set the water flow to almost a trickle:  67 psi.  I check the basement's post-pressure reducer section of piping:  67 psi.

"This also comes in a smaller size Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green, which is roughly 2/3 in size of this Boon Lawn, but other parents who have the smaller one all said they'd prefer this bigger one.  I actually wish Boon offered an even bigger one, since this one just about holds my 1 child's items (since ~6mo - now 1yr old) with daily organizing.  However, as impressive as some of the Tetris-master parents' customer pics are, Boon Lawn in reality holds far less, unless you want wet counters from your meticulously stacking hands or drips from edge-hanging bottles.The green ""grass"" blades hold upside-down bottles well, although sometimes plastic bottles tend to pop off if not stuck properly.  Since there are so many blades, you can rest or stack various size parts without them falling into a crevice (they'll gently rest on the grass tips).  You can even vertically stick baby utensils, handle-down.Downside is that since the blades are so densely packed, they're hard to thoroughly clean by hand.  However, the grass (the entire grass portion is a single solid piece with holes at the bottom) and the white tray are both dishwasher safe.  You'll want to clean the grass and the tray at least once a week (whether by hand or dishwasher), since the old drip water pools in the tray and gets dirty.Boon Stem Grass and Lawn Drying Rack Accessory, Blue/Orange is a must-have addition, not only utilizing vertical space to hang nipples/seals/vales/etc., but also to minimize surface contact (faster drying & less germs).  OXO Tot Bottle Brush & OXO Tot Straw and Sippy Cup Top Cleaning Set are also great cleaning companions.OXO Tot Bottle Drying Rack, Green is a similar baby drying rack, but with much-wider spaced blades.  Downside of that is it won't stack small items.  Upside is you can vertically place thicker baby plates (like the excellent Oxo dish), which Boon can't.  Bowls are fair game, so I personally prefer Boon's versatility (I just use the adult dish rack for baby plates & bowls).","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 12, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30YV6LAJFA22O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004OR1DTC#wasThisHelpful","R30YV6LAJFA22O","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Upon my home inspector's recommendation, I researched and bought various types of water detectors.  Aside from Honeywell RWD41 Water Defense Water Sensing Alarm, which I also have and is prefect for perimeter water detection (e.g., around a water boiler, laundry, etc.), this is the perfect water alarm.I have 10 of Glentronics GWD-HWA--for various bathroom/kitchen sinks, sump pumps, a/c units, etc.  These take 9V batteries like Energizer LA522SBP 9V Lithium Battery for Smoke Detectors, which last much longer and are more convenient to test & replace (slide vs screw cover) than ""Froggie"" 3x AAA types.  This also has a detachable sensor that can be dangled over a deep sump pump pit or into dubious crevices.  There have been no false alarms for the 10 alarms in 1 year, other than one had water splashed so vehemently into a sump pit that it had splashed onto the sensor (which was really legitimate).  As you can see from the picture, the 2 metal contacts on the detachable plate must come in contact to sound the alarm (putting a finger on each electrode will also ""test"" it, since your body conducts the electricity).Seriously, this is less than $10 and will alert you of a potential liquified doom of your home.

"I have a high water table that caused the Liberty Pumps 287 1/2-Horse Power 1-1/2-Inch Discharge 280-Series Automatic Submersible Sump Pump with VMF Switch to run every few minutes, even during dry weather (2008 house has 9' ceiling basement & is very close to a reservoir).  Since the basement had flooded by several inches during 2011's Hurricane Irene during a blackout (prior to my purchase of the home), I was paranoid about ground water.Additionally, the previous owner had to replace the sump pump after only 3 years, so I wanted to minimize the on/off cycle, which not only is bad for the sump pump, but is annoying (constant on/off whirl heard from the main floor) and a waste of electricity.  I first bought Glentronics, Inc. BWC1 Basement Watchdog Dual Float Sump Pump Switch with Controller to ""raise"" the water level switch.Installation for this piggyback switch was easy:1.  Plug the sump pump power plug into the back of the this device's power plug, then plug it into the wall power outlet.  Note that the power plug is quite large in all dimensions, but it stayed put and didn't lean out at all.2.  Using the supplied metal ring and flat-head screw, tie the float along the sump pipe at the appropriate height, determined by your water table during a dry week.  Note that ground water can still persist for days after a rain had stopped.3.  Test by lifting the bottom of the float with your finger or screw driver (or dump water into the sump pit).Using the Watchdog to ""raise"" the pump activation trigger--to about 2"" below the basement surface--cut the sump pump activation to occur only every few hours, which was indeed an improvement.The switch reliably activated the pump.  However, the switch was supposed to continue to electrify the plug's outlet for at least 10 seconds upon activation to ensure sufficient water has been pumped out, but mine only went on for a few seconds after water level receded below its float (often for a begin-end cycle of only ~5 seconds).  The pump itself would have turned off upon its own float switch hitting bottom, but there was plenty of water still left during these early shutoffs.  Manually lifting the Watchdog's float switch with a screwdriver would indeed activate the pump until the entire pit was empty.I later had installed a second pit and (Zoeller 98-0001 115-Volt 1/2 Horse Power Model M98 Flow-Mate Automatic Cast Iron Single Phase Submersible Sump/Effluent Pump) with another Watchdog (on separate, dedicated 15A outlet/circuit/fuse), but it had the same issue of turning off too early.After several months of looking for a better solution and much gnashing of teeth, I bought 2 of Little Giant RVMS-10 1/2 HP Piggyback Vertical Mechanical Float Switch, which are basically the same idea and installed the same way.  The RVMS goes deeper into the pit since it's basically a long stick with a purely mechanical on/off float switch, but you can trim the stick's depth as needed.  It also reliably pumps the desired depth of water for the expected duration (the depth of the float's stick:  ~6.5"").  We now go days without any water pumping.---FYI,I additionally had installed Liberty Pumps SJ10 1-1/2-Inch Discharge SumpJet Water Powered Back-Up Pump for each of the 2 sump pits in case of pump failure or blackouts.  No batteries to maintain or replace, and no time limit during extended blackouts.  Only requirement is sufficient water pressure (I believe ~30 PSI; I actually needed the plumber to lower mine from ""dangerous"" 65 PSI).Also, You may want to consider also purchasing water alarms like BWD-HWA (takes a 9V battery), which will alert you if there's contact with water (e.g., sump pump failed).  I also have these alarms around the house (under the sinks, behind the laundry, by a/c handlers, etc.), and they've proven very worthy (sump pump didn't run during a night blackout and water reached a threshold just under the water-powered pumps; laundry unknowingly had leaked when using jumbo load size).

"I needed a very large magnet board (I bought the 60cm x 90cm, roughly 24"" x 36"") to hold novelty (fridge) magnets I've collected around the world.  Since the largest magnet/dry-erase board I could find top out at only 14"" x 30"", this was a great find.  A large magnet sheet I had previously purchased turned out to not be magnetic enough to hold a fridge magnet.Pros:+ HUGE+ Magnets stick very strongly (doesn't slide)+ No borders/frames+ Can be mounted horizontally or verticallyCons:- Not dry-erase (not meant to be, but most magnet boards are also dry-erase)- Magnetic bond is a bit too strong, so magnets can't be glided to a new position (pry magnet with your fingernails, then reposition it)- Surface is prone to smudge (it's stainless steel, so it's typical)- Over $100?!I bought it ""like new"" via Amazon Warehouse for only ~$44, which was less than half price.  1 short edge was very slightly bent (barely noticeable), but was easily bent back by hand.I also bought STEELMASTER Soho Collection Magnetic Board with Dry-Erase Pad, Pen and Magnets, 14 x 24 Inches, Silver (270162450) for dry-erase use, which I've mounted vertically next to this Blomus board for a paired look.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T7ESLLFWIFCN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00008W6D5#wasThisHelpful","R2T7ESLLFWIFCN","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'd used this upon ewg_dot_org's recommendation on safe laundry detergents, but will try alternatives.Pros:1.  Rated very highly on ewg_dot_org and goodguide_dot_com.Cons:1.  Doesn't fully dissolve, leaving clumps of detergent on some clothes.  Ironically, the package recommends using cold water, which is likely a big factor in the problem.2.  The box--with pull-off tie at the upper 1/4 of the box with no securing--results in potential spills and airborne powder.3.  Requires you to make a paste with the powder and water for pre-treatment.  Have an old liquid detergent cap or plastic cup handy.4.  Cleaning ability is just ok (many bibs and shirts need to be washed twice).  Followed instruction on the box, which states to use 1 scoop for a small or medium load, 2 scoops for a large load.Personally, I've found powder form to be quite a hassle.  Method free & clear laundry that I had used previously sufficed, but I'll now try Seventh Generation Liquid Laundry 4x, Free and Clear, 40 Fl Oz. 2 Count.[update]I've been using a long, empty water bottle to stir the powder to properly dissolve before loading clothes, which prevents the clumping & residue problem.

"This drawer sits under my Latissima+, taking up only minimal footprint UNDER it (extra 4"" width & 4"" depth), while saving much more space than the OEM Discovery Box accessory, which sits with nothing over it (needs to flip up).  The drawer tray glides smoothly, and the entire drawer is made of metal with black coating.  The drawer is very sturdy.The drawer is designed to be 6 capsules wide and 10 capsules deep.  Each slot is separated from the other with a slight lip, while the deepest 2 reside on a single, long slot:  likely to allow for the 10th to easily slide to the 9th position.  I cut the coffee sleeve's capsule label to sit on the front-most slot for easy reference (what do color-blind people do??).HOWEVER (the reason for -1 star), the last 2 slots (total of 12 capsules) frequently get caught and crumpled under the upper lip of the front frame because the entire drawer is not tall enough.  If you have the drawer sitting at the very front edge of your counter for maximum drawer-pulled-tilt, you can get away with 9 capsules-deep.  BUT if you have the drawer sitting further back (kitchen counter space is precious!), you'll need to pry off the ball glides on the bottom of the drawer tray.  I used a monkey wrench to rip off the 2 ball glides (back bottom of the drawer tray; very easy, no physical effort), and now all 60 capsules sit fine while I glide the drawer all the way in and out.While the manual ""hack"" was annoying, I highly recommend this drawer tray, and even consider getting a second one to stack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 20, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YQ7ZE6ZAM56F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ATA6IKM#wasThisHelpful","R1YQ7ZE6ZAM56F","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Such a simple, yet brilliant idea!  Yet, in real life usage, practicality falls a bit short.PROS:+ Looks elegant.+ Adjustable courseness.  Both salt and pepper have respective adjustable knobs on the bottom.+ Salt and pepper are always in one spot together.  If you need one, you probably need the other anyway!+ Pepper grinders are plenty, but matching salt grinders are usually hard to find.  While the necessity of freshly ground salt is dubious, the idea is appealing.CONS:- Refill is a pain:  A.  Hold the base on a tabletop and yank the top off.  If you don't hold it steady on a tabletop, you'll end up spilling the contents everywhere.  B.  The contents are under a flimsy O-shaped plastic sheet cover that barely stays in place because the once-sticky rim has become clung with salt and pepper residue.  Lift the sheet from the side that needs refill.  C.  Origami one hand with the flimsy plastic sheet lifted one side to fill the tiny U-shaped crevice of salt or pepper side with your other hand.  Try your best not to spill salt/pepper chunks into the other section or bounce off the stem onto the table.- Does not hold much salt or pepper compared to typical tall salt/pepper grinders.- Depending on the coarseness adjustment, both salt and pepper may inadvertently grind at the same time (ex: if salt adjustment is not tight/fine enough, turning top activates both pepper AND salt).- Remnants of salt and pepper tend to cling to the bottom of the grinder (like any grinder), so if you want purely just salt OR pepper, it won't happen.  It probably won't make a difference by taste, but may aesthetically (bits of inadvertent pepper).Once the novelty of a combo salt/pepper grinder wears off, you have a gimmicky grinder that doesn't hold much AND is a pain to refill.  My wife doesn't care much for this, but if the salt/pepper refill sections were better divided with hinged lids instead of a plastic sheet, I'd still give it 5 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU6TJTFSWVLO3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002CHG65W#wasThisHelpful","RU6TJTFSWVLO3","AGRBMXQKF1E20","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AGRBMXQKF1E20?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I wanted to put up 3-digit individual number signs, but could barely get the hammer drill to make a dent in the brick walls.

"If you have an older PC (desktop or laptop) that either doesn't support wireless or only support old, slower wifi standard, this Trendnet USB wifi adapter is a nice way to update the computer to connect at high speeds to modern, secure wifi networks. The device is a small USB dongle that attaches to any spare USB port. Once connected, it allows the PC to join 5ghz AC wifi network - reducing interference and adding a lot of speed. Additionally as a modern wifi connector, the Trendnet supports better security modes then what an older PC may have built in.  This device works on a laptop or desktop without opening it up.  That makes it great for non-techincal users.  I also like the 3 year warranty.The only downside is inherent in the device - it is an external dongle and can get in the way especially on a laptop, but this is a small complaint; this is a great inexpensive way to add life to an old computer.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RVCVVLMW7JDZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BKFYJX8#wasThisHelpful","RVCVVLMW7JDZZ","A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'm not a gym rat, but I know the importance of protein after a workout.  I typically bring a bar with me.  The problem is that bars don't always travel well.  They freeze or melt.  This is a good compromise.When I can't bring a bar, I bring a blender jar along with protein in it.  That means I have a mess to clean up afterwards. This solution solves the problem with a disposable pouch that you add liquid to.  It won't freeze or melt and is great to carry anywhere.  I'm keeping a few in the workout bag and I'll probably travel with these.The ingredients are standard for low-cost protein shakes.  Lots of chemicals and artificial stuff.  I prefer more natural products.  The taste is completely acceptable for the type of product it is. Nobody drinks this stuff for the test, but it's not horrible.

"These headphones are a decent cheap pair of bluetooth headphones. I use them at the gym, and they work well, lasting about 3 hours per charge. Unlike many other headphones, the mic on these works decent too, making it easy to talk on the phone. However, the Mpow headphones have two major flaws. The first is somewhat inherent in the design, but you will get no - and I mean no - bass from the speakers. Everything will sound as tinny as an old AM radio. This is no huge deal when exercising and no one would mistake these for anything resembling audiophile headphones, but till, the sound quality is among the worst I have heard. The second flaw is that it is difficult to properly untwist the headphones for wearing - they curl up into a coil when no on your head and when you uncoil them, they tend to get kinked into weird shapes that make it hard to properly seat into your ears.These flaws aside, the price is good and they work, so as a fairly durable pair of cheap workout 'phones, these are OK.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SFJ3H9YBUY7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V7N3ZUG#wasThisHelpful","R1SFJ3H9YBUY7","A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1T2ZO4ARVSUGE?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"These wine glasses are unique and look great - the aeration grooves down the sides of the glasses stand out and add a bit of style. However, I detected no difference in the quality of the wain, and these glasses do not appear to provide any special aeration; if you are serious about wine, you'll still probably want to use a decanter.  That said, the real negative for these glasses are some of the ridiculous health-related assertions claimed by the manufacturer in the included informational sheet. Apparently these glasses magically reduce the calories in the wine and even make it so you can drink more without getting as drunk - all the while causing less ""damage"" to your bodily organs then drinking wine from a normal glass!

"And I say ""beware of the version published by General Books LLC "" because this particular publisher specializes in taking copyright-free books (such as this) and recreating them using OCR technology, then selling them at a highly inflated price.Within Amazon, books are generally grouped by the same title regardless of whether there are multiple publishers - which there are for this book, as it's now copyright free. Consequently, when one of these books with multiple publishers is reviewed, you will see the reviews of other publishers versions associated with it. And as a result you need to be very careful to make sure you've bought a decent version. The version available from General Books LLC is NOT what I would call a decent version. To be quite frank, it's awful. Full of mistakes (OCR does that, when there's no actual editing to catch the software-generated mistakes), tiny font (verging on the unreadable), no table of contents, no index. By now you should get the idea.General Books LLC puts together books using an OCR automated scanning device which can miss complete pages. There are many many Typos and no table of contents. There books receive NO EDITING of any kind, also, the OCR scanning is done by a robot (which the publishers website outright says can miss pages and which does not scan in images). This is all stated on the publishers web site (google them and read for yourself to get all the details). And with this particular book, you can't do the ""Look Inside"" thing for the General Books LLC version to see what you're getting. (And when General Books LLC does let you do this, you'll see something like the following - ""Just so you know...This view is of the Paperback edition (2009) from WLC. The Paperback edition (2010) from General Books LLC that you originally viewed is the one you'll receive if you click the Add to Cart button at left..""They do this because if you saw the actual reproduction of their version, you'd NEVER buy the thing..... Enough said! General Books LLC are flooding Amazon with these low quality publications (450,000+ listed so far) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with the original or with better quality imprints associated with them. For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first).All that said, I loved this book as a kid, still have my old illustrated copy that's almost in pieces, and it's a tragedy to see it being descecrated by a ""Publisher"" like General Books LLC. Basically, they're scamming people.And in response to the two Comments below criticising this review: Gentlemen, I suggest you check how Amazon publishes reviews and then READ MY REVIEW. Amazon does NOT allow you to publish a review for a book from a specific Publisher - Amazon groups a book with numerous different publishers together. This is why buyers get caught out by books published by General Books LLC - they rely on people inadvertantly buying from them for the bulk of their sales. Do a bit of checking for yourself before criticising.Please Note that I said:""Within Amazon, books are generally grouped by the same title regardless of whether there are multiple publishers - which there are for this book, as it's now copyright free. Consequently, when one of these books with multiple publishers is reviewed, you will see the reviews of other publishers versions associated with it. And as a result you need to be very careful to make sure you've bought a decent version."" Lest you do not understand, let me reiterate in a more simplified version:(1) Amazon groups books by title. This means different versions from different publishers are grouped together. Review one, review 'em all.

"And I say ""beware the General Books LLC reprint"" because when you do the ""Look Inside"" thing, you'll read ""Just so you know...This view is of the Paperback edition (2009) from WLC. The Paperback edition (2010) from General Books LLC that you originally viewed is the one you'll receive if you click the Add to Cart button at left.."" And that's correct. The General Books LLC version is a completely different book. To wit....General Books LLC puts together books using an OCR automated scanning device which can miss complete pages. There are many many Typos and no table of contents. There books receive NO EDITING of any kind, also, the OCR scanning is done by a robot (which the publishers website outright says can miss pages). This is all stated on the publishers web site (google them and read for yourself to get all the details).Within Amazon, books are generally grouped by the same title regardless of whether there are multiple publishers - which there are for this book, as it's now copyright free. Consequently, when one of these books with multiple publishers is reviewed, you will see the reviews of other publishers versions associated with it. And as a result you need to be very careful to make sure you've bought a decent version. The version available from General Books LLC is NOT a decent version. To be quite frank, it's awful. Full of mistakes (OCR does that, when there's no actual editing to catch the software-generated mistakes), tiny font (verging on the unreadable), no table of contents, no index. By now you should get the idea.General Books LLC are flooding Amazon with these low quality publications (450,000+ listed so far) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with the original or with better quality imprints associated with them. For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first).","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KRVFPHCAUKFX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1770450386#wasThisHelpful","R1KRVFPHCAUKFX","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Picked this up after reading a short story by Larry Correia on Baen's website. It was fun so I bought this one after taking a quick look at the Amazon Reviews. And all those reviewers who raved about this book were spot on. From the first chapter where Owen's boss gets a helping hand out of the building, thru to the last chapter, I literally didn't want to put this one down. Loved the guns and the gun descriptions - got to admire a writer who can throw a Finnish Lahti 20mm into a Novel and make it plausible (I assumme this is the one and only Antti Lahti designed L-39 ""Norsutykki / Elephant Gun"" - a good choice for monster hunting for sure given it was designed as an anti-tank rifle).Anyhow, aside from that level of accuracy on the firearms side of things, I really got into the monster-hunting / H P Lovecraft / vampires-are-evil stuff. And the action. Did I mention the action? It's all really well done. And there's even some fairly good characterisation. In fact I went and ordered every other book by Larry Correia before I even finished this one, including pre-orders for the ones in the publishing pipeline. That's how much I liked this one!!!And I do like the way Larry disses the Anne Rice school of vampire lovers. Hilarious. As someone who liked Anita Blake-Vampire Hunter before Laurell Hamilton went weird with her (the original Anita and Owen would have got on fairly well methinks, staking out vampires together and discussing the merits of different guns and ammuntion....) this book is a startlingly good entry into the genre.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 14, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1U3PVM4TEYEEY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1439132852#wasThisHelpful","R1U3PVM4TEYEEY","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Korsuarkkitehtuuri was a type of architecture exercised by Finnish troops during the trench warfare period of the Continuation War (WW2 to the rest of us).

"Most books on NZ in WW2 concentrate on the military and on the campaigns and units involved. This book, ""Beyond the Battlefield"" by Gerald Hensley is the dramatic unknown story of New Zealand's involvement in World War II told, pretty much for the first time, in an accessible, popular and enjoyable read. Savage, Nash, Fraser, Freyberg, Churchill, Roosevelt, Menzies, all great names from New Zealand and world history during the Second World War and all involved in the story of New Zealand's response to the global conflict and therefore the destiny of our nation.The book examines a key part of New Zealand's history during which time, under the immense pressure of fighting a war on both sides of the world, the country moved from being a quiet and faraway outpost in the Commonwealth to a strong, independent nation playing an influential role in the shaping of the United Nations. New Zealand's sometimes rocky relationships with its wartime allies Great Britain, Australia and the United States during a period of great world turmoil are all exposed and explained in an engaging and thoughtful lookinto the human side of diplomacy - highlighting the irritants, the cross comments, the subterfuge and intrigue that are the real drivers of history.The author, Gerald Hensley,  was trained as an historian before he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served there for 20 years and was then appointed Permanent Head of the Prime Minister's Department. In that role he worked for Sir Robert Muldoon and David Lange before becoming Co-ordinator for Domestic and External Security and later Secretary of Defence.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2TGDK0NGRIMB9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0670074047#wasThisHelpful","R2TGDK0NGRIMB9","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Illustrated with maps and never-before-seen photographs, the book provides a rare and fascinating insight into the NZSAS.A quote from the Chief of the NZ Defence Force:""Like any family, 1 NZSAS Group's stories are part of the glue that binds them together. But for reasons of operational security, the activities and personalities of New Zealand's Special Forces have, until now, largely remained their own - shrouded in secrecy. This book has an essential role in informing anyone with an interest in how this Unit's special capabilities have been relied on in numerous deployments, over a range of environments, across the decades of its existence. Such unusual openness I believe cannot help but promote confidence, and ultimately improve the level of understanding of 1 NZSAS Group - whose history deserves the accolade it aspires to of being the elite Unit of the New Zealand Defence Force.""Well worth reading if you have an interest in the SAS, and want to know more about the New Zealand SAS.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VLW9OJ9SJZYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002NEQIC0#wasThisHelpful","R3VLW9OJ9SJZYF","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The story of a small force of Australian Special Forces commandos that launched relentless hit and run raids on far superior Japanese forces in East Timor for most of 1942. These Australians were the men of the 2/2nd Australian Independent Company - a special commando unit. Initially stranded without radio contact to Australia, the Japanese declared these beared warriors `outlaws' and warned they would be executed immediately if captured. The Australians drawn mainly from the bush, were chosen for their ability to operate independently and survive in hostile territory. As film-maker Damien Parer said after visiting in Timor in late 1942, `these men are writing an epic of guerrilla warfare'. Expertly researched by Paul Cleary, who is fluent in Tetum, the main language of the indigenous group of East Timor, it contains black and white photos.The author, Paul Cleary, is a senior writer with The Australian newspaper and a researcher in indigenous development at the Australian National University. In a career spanning 20 years he has reported on politics and economics in the Canberra press gallery, and has also worked as a correspondent in Southeast Asia and as a political adviser. Awarded a Chevening fellowship by the UK Foreign Office to study at SOAS, University of London, he became an adviser to government of newly-independent East Timor. His work on the Timor Sea resource negotiations led to his first non-fiction book, ""Shakedown--Australia's grab for Timor oil"". The Timor veterans whom he met while based in East Timor inspired this book. He speaks several languages, including Vietnamese and Tetum.By far more readable than earlier, rather dry, accounts.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3P0I2623KJ8BO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0733623182#wasThisHelpful","R3P0I2623KJ8BO","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The 1st Independent Company was formed in June 1941 and the following month, with the threat of war with Japan looming, it was sent to Kavieng, New Ireland. The company was based at Kavieng, where it was to protect the airfield, but sections were also sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland, Vila in the New Hebrides, Tulagi on Guadalcanal, Buka Passage in Bougainville, and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers. In the event of an invasion, the company's role, as understood by Major James Edmonds-Wilson, the officer commanding, was to resist the enemy long enough so that the airfield could be damaged and other military instillations, such as fuel dumps, could be destroyed. The company was to then withdrawal to bases further south where they could wage a guerrilla war. The company soon found itself at war.On 21 January about sixty Japanese aircraft, including bombers, dive bombers, and fighters, attacked Kavieng. The commandos' shot down a number of aircraft, but the schooner, the Induna Star, which was the company's only means of escape, had also been damaged. Despite this though, the schooner managed to sail to Kaut. Meanwhile, the commandos started to withdrawal over land to Sook. Later that day the Australians received a message that a Japanese naval force of an aircraft carrier and six cruisers was approaching New Britain. The Japanese landed in the early morning the next day. As the lead Japanese troops reached the airfield, there was some fighting as the Australians blew the airfield and supply dump. The Japanese landed between 3 000 and 4 000 troops, hopelessly outnumbered, those commandos still fighting around Kavieng fell back to Sook, but not all of them made it. Some were captured. On 28 January Wilson gather his men and moved to Kaut where they repaired the Induna Star. Wilson intended sailing down the coast at night and hoped to reach the east coast of New Britain. By 31 January they had reached Kalili Harbour, but by then, Wilson learnt that the fighting on New Britain was over and that the Japanese occupied Rabaul. Wilson decided to sail for Port Moresby, but on 2 February the schooner was sighted by a Japanese plane which strafed and bombed them - destroying the lifeboat and causing a number of casualties. The Induna Star was now taking on water and Wilson considered any further resistance useless.The Australians were instructed to sail to Rabaul, with the Induna Star being escorted by Japanese aircraft until it was met by a Japanese destroyer. Thereafter, the Australians were transferred to the destroyer and became prisoners of war. After a few months at Rabaul, the officers were separated from their NCOs and men, and the officers were taken to Japan where they remained in captivity for the rest of the war. The NCOs and men had a much sadder fate. At the end of June, these men, along with the 2/22nd Battalion and other members of Lark Force, how had been captured on New Britain, and about 200 civilians, boarded the Japanese passenger ship Montevideo Maru. There were between 1 050 and 1053 prisoners were aboard. Unescorted by other Japanese ships, the Montevideo Maru sailed from Rabaul on 22 June, but on 1 July the ship was sighted by an American submarine, the Sturgeon, off the coast of the Luzon, in the Philippines. Firing its torpedos, the Sturgeon sunk the Montevideo Maru. Only a handful of the Japan crew were rescued. None of the prisoners survived. All 133 men from the independent company who were aboard the Montevideo Maru were either killed or drowned.Those sections that had not been with the main group at Kavieng, those who had been sent to Vila, Tulagi, Buka, and Lorengau, faired better. Throughout 1942 these men worked with the coast watchers, reporting Japanese troop movements, until they were either evacuated or escaped from their various locations throughout 1942. Later during the year, one of these sections fought along side the 2/5th Independent Company as part of Kanga Force, in New Guinea. But the 1st Independent Company was not reformed and its survivors were subsequently transferred to other commando units.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KO4MBB1OMQ82/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0958669384#wasThisHelpful","R1KO4MBB1OMQ82","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Interesting little (192 pages) book that looks at the first steam-powered automobiles of the 1830's and their possibilities. These were interesting early attempts to move steam-power away from the limitations of railways and at the possibilities inherent in the technology of the time. It seems that the first attempts at steam lorries (France) and steam coaches (England) were halted by the commercial vindictiveness of the Railways (surprise ... seems similar to what happened to commuter tramlines in the 1930's and immediately post-WW2). If they had not been, MacAdam's and Telford's roads could have seen a massive growth in freight and passenger transport far earlier than actually occured.Circa 1828-33 the railway engineers (and their supporters) still considered the steam coach a threat to their efforts. Thus they were ready to fight against it in public and in Parliament. After the success of the L&M Railroad become evident, railways swallowed most of the capital that could have been used for the development of road vehicles. After this the premier steam coach builders crashed and burned by around 1840, and there was little faith in the technical and commercial feasibility of the steam carriage among those who mattered.In looking at the alternative, Beasley probably overestimates the possibilities. The technology of the time simply wasn't that mature - take a look at the Traction Engines used for agriculture as a successful commercial example - slow, large and heavy. For road-based steam-powered vehicles, there were constant problems with the steam engines (which had to be both light and powerful), the axles kept breaking, suspension was either nonexistent or inadequate, steering, brakes, etc. On the rails, all these problems were less of an issue, first of all the engine could be heavier (and thus overbuilt) and secondly one could avoid the jarring and bumps and need for quick changes in power that were pure hell for such machines like Gurney's, Maceroni's or even Hancock's on the common roads.The concept of steam carriages did arouse some discussion at the time: This is Benjamin Cheverton in the Mechanics' Magazine in October 1833:""As the public mind is now roused to a sense of the immense utility of railways, for all the grand communications between different parts of the kingdom, more especially those which radiate from the metropolis, it becomes a duty to arrest those attempts which are made to divert it from an object of such paramount importance, by representing the probability of steam carriages being so employed on common roads as to render railroads unnecessary. It is not denied that if these conveyances can be established - though the fact and not the probability should be allowed to have any influence - they will prove to be of considerable use: subsidiary to the railway train, they will on the various cross-roads and branches, act as feeders to, it but never as substitutes.It is not too much to hope, that communication on the main lines will become so active, that steam carriages and waggons, however improved, would never be equal to it on common roads; but the all-important point is, that this very activity has its origin in the improved ways: they are both the means towards an end and the cause of it. The steam conveyances may produce and be competent to a greatly increased intercourse between places, but they could never enlarge it beyond their own powers of achievement. Could the present communications between Manchester and Liverpool be carried on by steam coaches, and the transit of goods by steam waggons? Could any other roads than those of iron bear it? It will, indeed, be admitted that railways will answer only on the grand routes, and that steam carriages, and Mr Saxton's invention of the locomotive pully, in conjunction with a subordinate and less expensive kind of railroad, that may with the aid of this beautiful contrivance be made to accord with the undulation of the country, will sufficiently supply the demands of intercourse in every other place. Thus things will be in their right places, and a harmony of order and gradation be the result.""And another interesting note: Hiram Maxim (inventor of the Maxim Gun - aka machinegun) attempted a steam powered aircraft back in 1894. Maxim invested 20,000 in building a huge, hundred-foot-wingspan, multi-winged machine, in England. It was powered by two lightweight 180-horsepower steam engines that he'd designed for it. Maxim began flight tests in 1894. On the third try the plane was powered up to forty miles per hour, left its track, flew two hundred feet, and crashed. After that, Maxim lost interest in flying. He went on to other inventions.It's certainly a good look at an interesting ""might-have-been"" - after all, back just after WW1 the Stanley Steam Car outperformed the Ford Model T and Steam Cars were a commercial success into the late 1920's. The books a bit short but nevertheless an interesting look at an alternative technological path that might have been followed.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2P7ICF8M6K35T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=031326144X#wasThisHelpful","R2P7ICF8M6K35T","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"LOC Kargil is an Indian War Movie about the Kargil War with Pakistan. Back in 2003, it was billed as the most expensive Hindi movie ever made. And as well as the budget, it had great locations (the Himalayas) and a good collection of Indian ""name"" actors to work with. Sadly and disappointedly, it's a flop. And that was also the reaction of the Indian viewing public at the time. It could have been India's ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Black Hawk Down"" but alas, it's downright boring.The basic storyline of this 4 hour film covers the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when the Pakistani's crossed the LOC and penetrated deep into Indian territory (completely to the surprise of the Indian Govt and media at the time). It was an interesting and rather challenging war from the Indian perspective, especially given the logistics of fighting high in the Himalaya's, and one that the Indian Army responded to heroically. Pakistan initially denied any involvement, claiming the intruders were 'freedom fighters'. However it was very soon all to apparant that this was a lie and that the 'freedom fighters' were actually Pakistani Army soldiers that were deeply entrenched high up in the mountains on the Indian side of the demarcation line. I followed the war quite closely at the time and was interested in how this movie would portray it (obviously, I was hoping for an Indian version of ""Saving Private Ryan"" but alas.....). To read a bit of background on the war, I'd recommend starting with War at the Top of the World: The Struggle for Afghanistan, Kashmir and Tibet, Revised Edition for a general backgrounder, then diving in to Kargil 1999: Pakistan's Fourth War for Kashmir. Most of the other books available on the Kargil War are by Indian authors and strongly biased. These 2 are probably the best available for at least a general picture.What's obvious from the books on the Kargil War is that the Indian Army, operating under an enormous disadvantages, in incredibly hostile terrain and against fanatical fighters displayed a level of committment, bravery, technical expertise and professionalism that resulted in a crushing defeat for the Pakistanis. So much so as to lead to Pakistan actually considering escalating the local, low-level conflict into an all out nuclear confrontation. And Bill Clinton then saved their sorry asses. Anyhow, there was the basis for an incredible film here.So, there's the background. On to the Film. Overall, I think the main problem here is that while Bollywood is good at traditional Indian musicals, they just don't have any idea how to make a good war movie. I'd put it down to plain incompetence - after all, there's enough successful war movies out there that it should be possible for a professional director to figure it out.Cons:This is where we state, upfront, that the film sucks. The battle scenes are downright awful - corny, not just poorly done. There are long, pointless and (to the western ear anyhow) awful sounding songs. I know, I know, songs are traditional in Bollywood movies, but this is a WAR MOVIE. Do even Indian Soldiers do Bollywood musical routines in the middle of a war. I think Not! There's no apparant main storyline or even a good subplot or two that I could figure out (the subplots I could figure out were all cheesy romantic stuff) and the soldiers in the movie don't really achieve anything. For 4 hours, soldiers die over and over on the same mountain.Basic synopsis of Plot: (1). Gather the troops and discuss the attack plan, (2) Flashbacks to the men's wives (3) The approach - troops marching in a long line (4) Soldiers running up Mountain and shooting, usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men rescuing him. (5) Defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success (6) Flashback to wives and the singing of 10 minute songs. Repeat 4 or 5 times.Apparantly the director worked without a script and it shows. There's no flow to the movie. There's no sense of progression from one battle to another. It's just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. And the explanatory scenes are awful.Pros:There are LOTS of bullets and blood.Many of the props including the uniforms, badges, weapons, artillery, helicopters etc etc were all authentic Indian Army equipment.Thats about it for Pro's.All in all, I really wanted to enjoy this movie. It's not as if there weren't all the ingredients for a good, if not great movie. Sadly, it sucked.","2.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRF3WMQNP25CL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000171QVE#wasThisHelpful","RRF3WMQNP25CL","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's been fashionable to knock the British Empire for a few decades now, and as the world becomes more literate and books become more international, events that received little or no attention both at the time and for decades afterwards start to move into the spotlight. The Bengal Famine of 1943 is just such an event and one that this book disects in some detail. There have been others - see for example The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919 - another famine blamed on the British. The authors of both books, Majd and Mukherjee, have basically the same premise - in Majd's case that deliberate policy of genocide was practiced on the Persians, In Mukherjee's case, that Churchill in particular was waging a ""secret war"" on the Indian people, and Mukherjee does blames Mr Churchill's policies for being largely responsible for one of the worst famines in India's history.And it was a terrible famine - some three million Indians died as a result of the famine of 1943, with the majority of the deaths in Bengal. Mukherjee's book is a gripping and quite scholarly investigation into this event. Mukherjee's analysis is that the scarcity was caused by large-scale exports of food from India for use in the war theatres and consumption in Britain - India exported more than 70,000 tonnes of rice between January and July 1943, even as the famine set in. Churchill turned down pleas to export food to India citing a shortage of ships. As imports dropped, prices shot up and hoarders made a killing. Mr Churchill also pushed a scorched earth policy - which went by the sinister name of Denial Policy - in coastal Bengal where the British feared the Japanese would land. So authorities removed boats (the lifeline of the region) and the police destroyed and seized rice stocks.Mukherjee tracks down some of the survivors of the famine and paints a chilling tale of the effects of hunger and deprivation. Parents dumped their starving children into rivers and wells. Many took their lives by throwing themselves in front of trains. Starving people begged for the starchy water in which rice had been boiled. Children ate leaves and vines, yam stems and grass. People were too weak even to cremate their dead. Dogs and jackals feasted on piles of dead bodies in Bengal's villages. Survivors were men who migrated to Calcutta for jobs and women who turned to prostitution to feed their families. The famine ended at the end of the year when survivors harvested their rice crop. The first shipments of barley and wheat reached those in need only in November, by which time tens of thousands had already perished (but which does argue that attempts were being made to alleviate the effects of the famine).Mukherjee writes eloquently and passionately, as befits a local historian, stating that it was ""not so much racism as the imbalance of power inherent in the social Darwinian pyramid that explains why famine could be tolerated in India while bread rationing was regarded as an intolerable deprivation in wartime Britain"". Other reviewers have essentially supported Mukherjee's arguments and conclusions, understandably if you're Indian.While it's detailed recounting of the famine and it's effects and aftereffects, I'd have to diasgree with some (but not all) of the author's conclusion. Officials of the British Raj excepted, many of whom cared deeply for the people they ruled (read Plain Tales from the Raj for the views of the British), the British were focused on fighting and winning WW2 and a few million Bengali peasants were not important in the scheme of things. And yes, there was a certain element of racism involved - Bengalis were not particularly highly regarded and Bengali peasents even less so. As with Persia in WW1, it was not genocide, it was not particularly deliberate, just a focus of effort on the war and the ignoring of the fate of millions of civilians who were at best, irrelvant to the war effort. Tragic for the millions, but Churchill was a ruthless man who put Britain first and foremost, and as he himself once said ""there is no-one as ruthless as an English Gentleman at bay"". After all, this is a man who was willing to plunge Scandanavia into war just to open a second front against Germany, authorise the deliberate mass murder of German civilians thru the firebombing of the cities they lived in, and redrew Polands post WW2 borders with the stroke of a pen, resulting in the post war deaths of perhaps 2 million German civilians - how do a few million Bengali peasants possibly compare (looking at it from 1940 eyes rather than now). And in his eyes, he was justified in doing so. Churchill was a great man, but he was also a War Leader, and a ruthless one at that. And he put Britain first and foremost in everything.In this, Mukherjee's explanation of Social Darwinism is probably as accurate a conclusion as any. All in all, a well-detailed and well-written book about one of the little known side-shows of WW2 but with a lot of (understandable) emotional content. If those Bengali's were my ancestors, I'd be justifiably angry as well.Kinjal - re your comments. My apologies for responding within the review but Amazon removed my commenting privileges some time ago (I transgressed the guidelines somewhat inadvertantly) and haas never seen fit to restore them. Yes, I agree, Churchill was definitely racist in the modern sense of the term. He also wanted India to remain part of the British Empire - he was vehemently opposed to independance. And he was a great man, but as with all great men, he had flaws. As far as the Bengal Famine goes, other British politicians and military commanders disagreed with him, as Mukherjee points out. And yes, I can understand the outrage, especially if one is from Bengal (and having spent some considerable time in Dhaka and Calcutta myself back in the '80's, and having made good friends there, I can to a certain extent empathize). As I said, Churchill had his flaws - he abandoned Poland to the USSR after Britain went into WW2 using Poland as the reason, he was quite willing to throw Finland to the wolves, he was more than happy to draw Norway (and would have drawn Sweden) into the war if he could've. He did absolutely nothing for the European Jews. But also as I stated, he was Britain's war leader and he put Britain first and foremost at all times.Sue: well, I did get you riled up didnt I. And no, it was not genocide. Famine yes, millions of deaths, yes. But as for defending Churchill, no. No need. The man stands on his own merits as a great leader. And I would reiterate, one should see his acts in the context of the times. Simply, as with the Persian Famine at the end of WW1, the Bengali peasants were not a factor in the war - if they had been, something immediate would have been done. At the time, Britain was fighting for her survival, the Japanese were on the borders of India and it was the overall war that was important to Churchill and the British. Sad, yes. Tragic yes, but a deliberate act of genocide - No! Also, you have to keep in mind that at the time, in 1943, much of the countryside was in a state of endemic revolt against the British and the Indian National Army, made up largely of deserters and turncoats from the British Indian Army was fighting with the Japanese against the British. This made the population of Bengal very much a potential 5th column if the Japanese penetrated out of the hills and into Bengal itself. Despite this ""state of endemic revolt,"" at one and the same time the famine also caused the British Army major logistical problems which were caused by massive gifts of food by the locally stationed British and Indian troops to the starving people - which threatened to stall the forthcoming offensive against the Japanese. As always, nothing is black and white.....However, that said, I think Mukherjee has done a magnificent job in documenting this little known and little-remember famine. I personally was aware of it, but had no idea of some of the details until I read this book.And as for my commenting privileges, sadly, Amazon removed them not for riling up the Sues of this world, but rather for posting a series of comments on scam books published a scam publisher called General Books LLC, whom I have been highly critical off. And they are a scam. As for reviews, well, I write what I think and Amazon users generally seem to like my reviews for whatever reason - if they arouse some discussion around the book or my omments, I am happy - and I sure do not mind people criticising my reviews or commenting on them - that usually brings a whole lot more interesting comments and views out. And I am not a sensitive soul :)","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RMKCQKWKMHU32/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0465002013#wasThisHelpful","RMKCQKWKMHU32","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I've always been interested in the Hittites but really, there's very little available other than a very few textbooks on the subject. For those who know nothing about the Hittites, this is a really really really (you get the idea) good historical novel that manages to get you well and truely under the skin of Suppiluliumas (""Pure Spring""), King of Hatti and gives you a good in depth exposure to Hittite culture and the Hittite people while at the same time giving you a good history lesson. As the previous reviewer has noted, the book is liberally laced with quotes from Suppiluliumas' own Annals. Every character in the novel bar one is based on real people who are historically documented (there are a lot of Hittite clay tablets that have survived) - fascinating in itself, and the author includes a short bibilography at the end.In all honesty, this is one of the best historical novels I've read and I wish I'd come across it sooner, I'd rate it up there with Mary Renault's Alexander Trilogy (Fire from Heaven, The Persian Boy and Funeral Games), Wallace Breem's Eagle in the Snow or Rosemary Sutcliff's Sword at Sunset as far as historical novels go.For those more or less unaware of the Hittites, they were an Indo-Aryan people who set up a kingdom centered at Hattusa on the Central Anatolian plateau around the 18th century BC. The Hittite empire reached its height around the 14th century BC, encompassing a large part of Anatolia, north-western Syria about as far south as the mouth of the Litani River (a territory known as Amqu), and eastward into upper Mesopotamia. Under Suppiluliumas and his immediate successor, the Empire was extended to most of Anatolia and parts of Syria and Canaan, so that by 1300 BC the Hittites were bordering on the Egyptian sphere of influence. After approx. 1180 BC, the empire disintegrated into several independent ""Neo-Hittite"" city-states, some surviving until as late as the 8th century BC.Although established in the Bronze Age, the Hittites were forerunners of the Iron Age, developing the manufacture of iron artifacts from as early as the 14th century BC. Recent excavations have discovered evidence of iron tool production dating back at least as far as the 20th century BC. Hittite weapons were generally made from bronze though as iron was rare and precious. The Hittites were famous for their skill in building and using chariots, a skill which gave them a military advantage. In fact, the first battle recorded in any real detail is the great chariot battle of Kadesh (read (Qadesh 1300 BC: Clash of the Warrior Kings (Osprey Military Campaign Series)), fought between the Hittities (commanded by the grandson of the subject of this book, Suppiluliumas, and the Eqyptians in 1274 BC.For more light reading on this subject for the casual reader, I'd recommend the following:Hittite WarriorHittite Fortifications c.1650-700 BC (Fortress)Bronze Age War Chariots (New Vanguard)For other works of fiction set in Hatti, you might like to try the followingThe Hittite (the main character is a Hittite, but the real story is about the Fall of Troy using an outsider to give a different viewpoint)Hittite Must Die by Moshe ShamirHittite Warrior (Living History Library)The Hittite by Noel Gerson - An age of violent splendor... sensual paganism... barbaric cruelty...At the head of the onrushing Hittite legions was Lord Marduk. He was young, he had great wealth, high rank and his wife, Arinna was the most beautiful woman in the empire, but her warped passions drove him to seek another woman's arms... OK, you get the idea, and the cover picture looks more Roman than Hittite to me. It's trash, and quite laughable as far as historical accuracy goes.....Like I said, ""I, the Sun"" is the best fictional treatment of the Hittites you're going to find. Read and enjoy. Personally, I didn't put it down until I'd finished it. And then I reread it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/RU2VHRQQDAPPF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0440039517#wasThisHelpful","RU2VHRQQDAPPF","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very interesting look at one aspect of WW1 - the junior Officers in the British Army. You get passing mention of them in many books on WW1, but this is the first actual look at these junior officers that I've come across and it's quite fascinating, if sad at times, read.In general, British junior officers in the First World War had a life expectancy of six weeks, hence the title of the book. Most of them were fresh out of High School - usually the products of the British ""Public School"" system (that's private schools to the rest of them) where the upper class and upper middle class children went. And they went from High School to Officers Training Units and from there, more often than not, straight to the Western Front. And on the Western Front they died by the thousands, many of them leading their men from the front in a charge out of the trenches and across no-mans-land, knowing that the German machine guns were waiting and would be trained on the man at the front and knowing that many of their predecessors had fallen before them in identical attacks that more often than not had failed.The author really does focus on these often overlooked men (boys really) who were so crucial to Britain's war effort. He bases his book on a huge range of first person accounts that are available - many of these being letters and diaries sent home or back to their school. We can see from these what motivated these men, the kind of life they lived on the front and in the trenches, how they led and motivated their men, and how they tried to behave in the short time many of them had left before they died.WW1 was the death of the Edwardian era, and the junior officers that were slaughtered were the potential leaders of an entire generation. It's a well-written and poignant look at these boys, for that was what most of them were, and a tribute to them as well. Well worth the read for anyone interested in the history of WW1.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GWWM5CBHYM38/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0047DVIDY#wasThisHelpful","R3GWWM5CBHYM38","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Definitely, this is a Creationist interpretation of Genesis that rather boggled my mind. I came across this in a (christian) friend's bookcase and browsed through it out of interest. Before I go any further, let me say that this book will only be of interest to those who believe in the Bible as, literally, the Word of God AND who are prepared to buy into Beechick's rather implausibly constructed little fantastical interpretations of ""histpory"". Anybody else, like me, will alternately giggle hysterically and beat their head on a brick wall out of despair. I know most buyer of this book will probably (a) be amused or (b) be offended or (c) start you praying for my soul, as my friends often do but hey, this book deserves a review from a non-religious, non-creationist perspective given that it is presented by the author as ""history"".So, as a non-believer (ahem) and the somewhat respectful son of a devoutly religious Methodist Minister (sadly, now passed away) who was also a very knowledgable scholar of Biblical Studies, who read and wrote Hebrew, Greek and Latin - and who had a library of some thousands or religiously-oriented books, many of which I have read over the years and which I have inherited and kept in my Dad's memory, I have to say this is a subject I have argued over many a time. And on past experience, I expect to convince no-one. However, it IS a subject I find quite fascinating - that, on the face of all the evidence, people still persist in trying to interpret the Old Testament books as the literal word of God.To quote from the book: ""Read evidence here that the writings in Genesis are more ancient than historians admit. Moreover, the Sumerians and other early peoples left us documents that corroborate the Genesis history. So Noah was real, and Adam......"" Interesting indeed. Seems not to have dawned on the author that, rather than corroborate, Genesis may actually have been based on these Sumerian texts. That's not corroboration by anyone's standards.Noah ""was real"" - well, the problem here is that flood myths exist in most cultures world wide, with certain variations which are largely based on what happened at the end of the last ice age some 8-10,000 years ago. There are very few flood myths in Africa (wasn't affected much by the end of the ice age and subsequent flooding). In North America, the indian flood myths relate to ""Land Rising"" - in all probability due to the collapse of the north american ice shield and the subsequent land rising as the ice and water drained off through Hudson Bay and (proven) raised world sea levels by 400 feet. Many other ""flood myths"" exist around the world, there's entire books on them and their linquistical variations which can be used to date them and source the origins. So was ""Noah"" real. In all probability, the Genesis account (which, plausibly, is descended from the Sumerian ""Noah"" myth) may well have been based on a real person, but the Sumerian myth is still just the Sumerian myth and all this proves is that Genesis in all likeliehood sourced this particular myth from Sumeria, along with the list of ancient kings (for more on this, read David Rohl's Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation. Very interesting study of Genesis as it relates to known events and archeology.Adam - lingusitically, the biblical name can be traced back to the Sumerian, original meaning ""Red Earth Man"" - neolithic burials more often that not had the bodies coated in red clay, the phrase seemingly relates back to these ancient burial practices.Eve - through Hebrew to Akkadian to Sumerian, the name Eve can linguistically be traced back to Innana / Ishtar, the Sumerian goddess.Yahweh - interestingly, God has many names in the old Hebrew texts. One of which has now been traced back via linguistics and archeology (including old Sumerian texts) to the High God of Ugarit, one of the old Sumerian cities. So in all likeliehood, the ""Yahweh"" of the Old Testament was one of the old Sumerian Gods adopted by the people of Israel and later turned by stages into a monotheistic God (there's a tremendous amount of material on early Judaism as a polytheistic religion and it's evolution into a monotheism - interesting stuff).So yes, one must agree with Beechicks initial statement that ""the writings in Genesis are more ancient than historians admit"" (except, unfortunately, that historians DO admit, it is indeed the standard theory). The point to this little ramble is that Beechick in this, as in her other books that interpret the Bible, takes a very basic premise that may well be accurate, and then twists, turns, manipulates and embellishes until it's a wildly implausible fantasy.IMHO, absolutely nothing wrong with a Creationist interpretation of history if thats what you personally want to believe. You've made a, presumably, informed decision or come to your faith in a way that's valid to you. However, inflicting this nonsense on gullible children as ""education"" is another story completely. This isn't the Bible taken as Faith, this is fantastical nonsense masquerading as history.I do respect Beechick's work in Homeschooling, altho she's now somewhat dated in her approach. But her Biblical-related books are pure nonsense and inflicting them on children as ""history"" is irresponsible. There's a distinction between Faith and Idiocy.Teaching3: I don't know that we know whether Jesus believed Noah was a real person or not but it seems somewhat irrelevant. We do know ""Noah and the Flood"" type myths exist worldwide and date to approximately the same period of time - linguistic analysis of oral versions can also tell you where these stories originated and roughly date them. The Biblical version was merely one of many and that it originated from the Sumerian version seems likely.Simple Bible Book Guy: Hmmm, definitely not ranting against Christianity per se. I send my 2 kids to a private religious (christian) school, having a strong belief that the education of the young should include a strong moral component. I would see my review as more of a rant against Beechicks rather unique interpretation of history. Its more than a little implausible IMHO to try and balance up a literal interpretation of the Bible against actual history. I did read almost all of the book in fact. It was a bit of an eye-opener at the time, hence the rant.Re the old myths being based on earlier oral stories passed down. For sure, I agree its far more than likely. One wonders how far back some of these core myths and legends actually go. The Adam vs Red Earth association for example - I recall an old neanderthal burial site somewhere where the bones had been coated with red clay. Quite intriguing. And then when one looks also at the linguistic studies in the origins of language and Nostratic - the identification of the first language - it gets even more interesting (if you are interested, take a look at The Origin of Language: Tracing the Evolution of the Mother Tongue - quite a fascinating account for the layman). Also, for a good archeological take on the first two books of the Bible, try David Rohls Legend: The Genesis of Civilisation.lovethelord - I prefer to think of it as a book review combined with a rant. The book as holes you can drive a truck through if you have any knowledge of ancient history. I find it tragic that something like this is passed off as ""history"".Anyhow, thx for all the comments and discussion.

"Just picked up an old version of this (how can you argue with a cost of 1 cent) and ended up reading it in an evening. It's a captivating short novel for children set in Canada's aptly named Barren lands - the huge area of Canada that stretches from the northern treeline north to the Arctic Ocean. The Barrens are a world of their own, beautiful and hostile, almost uninhabited and uninhabitable. Mowat's book takes us into the world of the Barrens through the adventures of two teenage boys, one white, one Indian. They accompany a hunting expedition north, go off on a side trip of their own, lose their canoe and from there, the adventure really begins.Lost, with no way to get back south, they must do their best to survived a winter in the Barrens. And they do, making mistakes but learning from them. They hunt (and there's no romanticisation of the hunting and killing), they build a shelter for the winter, the process of surviving a winter in the barrens is explained - the food available, the ability to live on a diet that's almost 100% meat (as long as there's sufficient fat available), the making of pemmican, how to dry meat and how to freeze food before the winter sets in, how to make clothes for the winter, how to build a fireplace within a hut without a chimney that won't smoke you out, eskers and how to use them to travel on (that was one bit that was completely new to me). The detail is both fascinating and woven in as an integral part of the story in a way that's entertaining.Written in the early 1950's, there's a lot that's now history - the use of birchbark canoes for example, as well as the hostility and fear that existed between the Indian tribes and the Indians and the Inuit. Also, the isolation of the Indian settlements in the North back then - the reason for the hunting trip in the first place was that the tribe was on the verge of starvation - something which wouldn't happen these days as the Fed would be airdropping supplies in! Makes for an interesting historical lesson though, particularly as, back in this period, entire settlements were occassionally wiped out due to starvation.All in all, a beautifully written childrens story with a lot of lessons on history and survival woven into it. A great read for any young child and a good intro to practical survival skills. Your kids going to want to go into the woods and try out some of this stuff after reading the book. You may too!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 31, 2010","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OEPOKRM6UF1S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0553260677#wasThisHelpful","R1OEPOKRM6UF1S","A38CKJ7C1K71JF","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A38CKJ7C1K71JF?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This Bissell carpet cleaner is a very basic but functional machine.  If used correctly it will be better than some rental units and even poorly trained professional services.  The key is patience.  Assembling is simple.  Im blind and had this thing together in five minutes, it may take you longer if you try to read the directions.  Just close your eyes and do as I say:  First, unpack the box carefully.  I saved the Styrofoam in case I have to return the machine.  I took all the papers and threw them into the bottom of the box since I cant read them anyway and they mean nothing to me.  The top of the box held the small bottle of cleaning solution and the water tank.  The handle has two screws taped to it and you will need them to secure the handle to the main body.  At the bottom is the primary unit with the middle part.  That middle part slides and locks into the bottom part and is then secured by the two screws.  Make sure the two parts are flush before trying to install the screws.  The screws are similar to drywall screws, they are designed to bite into the plastic and are not meant to be removed repeatedly.  Once you have the two bottom pieces together, insert eh handle into the hole on top of the middle piece and just slide it in.  The handle can be collapsed for storage if you want by turning the tightening knob back and forth for tighten and loosen.  On the top of the handle is the sprayer trigger, just under the hand hold.  Also, there is a cord clip to hand the cord if you prefer.  The final part is the water bottle that installs with the plug side down into the main body of the unit.You put the hot tap water into this part.There are two pedals, the small one on the left releases the main body and handle to lay down flat to the floor so that you can remove the waste water tank, just like the average vacuum claner does.  The middle is the power switch.  There is a stiff brush that is deliberately mounted loosely designed to scrub the carpet and loosen ground in dirt and work the water and cleaning solution into the bottom of the carpet or rug.  It does not revolve and works just by moving the machine back and forth.In order to clean, you add a single capful of the solution  less is better!  and then add the hottest tap water you can get from your tap.  Be careful to know if your carpet is wool or some typethat can shrink with hot water.  I have cheap, polyester rugs so any hot water temp is OK.  Place the water bottle onto the unit and start on and end of the carpet where you will pull the machine, not push.  Use the solution sparingly, using too much solution will just make too much foam, leave your carpet sticky and make them get dirty much more quickly.  The key is to be patient and rinse well.  Start by turning the machine on and then slowly pull the machine while squeezing the trigger.  Do one good pass with the trigger spraying and then at least a couple slow passes withjust the vacuum.  Go slowly to suck up as much water as possible.  Pretend you are trying to walk in neck high water and you should have the right pace.This is a great little machine for smaller areas but if you are incredibly diligent and patient, you can do a large room, it will just take many fill-ups and waste tank emptying.  When the vacuum stops sucking up water, you should hear a change in the sound of the machine, this means that the tank is full and needs to be drained.  Step on the little lever, lay the handle flat on the floor, unlatch the two laches on the sides of the waste tank and  pull straight up to avoid spilling.  You will inevitably spill some so dont be upset with yourself.  Although fairly obvious, if the spray stops, you are probably out of water and need to refill the water tank.I highly advise doing a thorough job of dry vacuuming with your normal vacuum before you use this machine, it is designed to rinse dirt, not dry vacuum.  Allow the carpet a couple hours  at least  to dry before walking on it.Personally, I like to do a full rinse cycle with pure water and no cleaning solution.  I dont want unnecessary chemicals or solvents left behind.  If youre patient enough, its a good way to ensure all the solution is out of the carpet.After its totally dry, go over with a dry vacuum again to pick up dirt and hair that has wicked up to the surface.  Its a simple process but a time-consuming one.  In general, the slower you go, the better the results when it comes to vacuuming out the water.Analternative method would be to put the cleaning solution into a spray bottle and spray it onto the top of the carpet prior to the wet rinsing, that way only pure water is rinsing out the carpet.  It adds an extra stepbut may work better depending on your situation.If you have really ground in dirt or animal deposits, I suggest getting on your hands and knees with a scrub brush and cleaning solution prior to using the machine, then rinse the heck out of it for a very long time.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RPYY0Z1QU85NR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0070YQOTU#wasThisHelpful","RPYY0Z1QU85NR","ALZJMBRRKUEON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALZJMBRRKUEON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I ordered two bags of this seed last spring and had a decent beginning of a lawn a few months later.  I started with pretty much just dirt and a couple trees and ended up with a nice covering, certainly not a lush lawn but something that looks like a lawn from the street, mows easily and grows quickly.  I have an average sized front yard, about 60X30 and two bags of this seed did a good job.  I'll add more this spring.  What I especially liked about this particular seed is that it sprouted within a couple weeks and actually looked like grass within a month.  The birds didn't eat much - I did cover it withloose soil - and it grows very well in the shaded area of my Oak and  Sugar Maple.  I let the seed go almost two months before cutting the first time in order to grow some deep roots and keep the mower deck up about 3"" with a weekly trim during the summer and fall.  We'll see how well it does after this Wisconsin winter it's first full year on the ground.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RSF982UMRKY8P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003AYWIR6#wasThisHelpful","RSF982UMRKY8P","ALZJMBRRKUEON","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/ALZJMBRRKUEON?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is comfortable and easy to use, the seat puts you up high enough to sit properly while being low enough to be able to actually get off the thing when you're done.

"When I upgraded my Samsung Smart TV with the built in software upgrade option it rendered the internet and widgets useless that I used to be able to access amazon prime movies with.  I went in search of something that would remedy that, because their tech support at Samsung told me it was not their issue it was Yahoo Widgets I needed.  (That isn't true - you can't even buy widgets from Yahoo-most likely Samsung can't afford programmers to fix that software upgrade that ruins your internet).  Anyway, this little Amazon Fire Stick remedied everything. It returned all my options like getting access to my Amazon Prime movies and Hulu Plus TV and now I am happy again.  There isn't a lot of difference between the Fire TV Stick and the Fire TV - you only need one or the other and I didn't realize that, so I bought both thinking they would work together.  Actually, I am keeping both because I can use Amazon Fire on the big tv (its remote has voice command and is a bit more convenient).  But the Fire TV Stick has most of the same features without voice command so I am using it on the smaller Samsung. I find both Fire TV and TV Stick have extremely high definition and nice selection of games, prime music, prime movies, Hulu TV and everything I really wanted.  Love both.  Thanks!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SCA68F269VGX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R1SCA68F269VGX","A2Z5W4JDUT2EBY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z5W4JDUT2EBY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought the 22 inch to use as a PC monitor and tv with the amazon fire stick.  I had to learn my way around to make everything look good.  With the Amazon fire stick, the picture is amazing, very clear and wonderful.  With the PC it is NOT until you tweek it as follows:  I found no difference between using a HDMI/DVI cable and an HDMI cable (as a TV).  But the picture with EITHER cable as a PC Monitor was very fuzzy until I did this: Go to Menu/Source List and change the SOURCE name and link it to the option PC.  When you do that (I found that tip from another reviewer below-thank you!) the resolution is so much better for PC Monitor use.  Also I did Menu Mode Magic Angle/Standing Mode and it improved again.  I agree that you should NEVER EVER do an update from Samsung under the Samsung upgrade option because it will RUIN the tv rendering it useless for internet use.  I did that recently on my large 40 inch Samsung and that is why I had to buy Amazon Fire for both because the Samsung software upgrade is faulty probably so you will spend more and force you to buy another TV - there is no support from Samsung to fix once you upgrade it either.  They just tell you to contact yahoo to download widgets and Yahoo doesn't have widgets to buy.  So heed this warning NEVER update software through that link. Otherwise, the price of $167 was very good considering can be used for tv and monitor.  And Amazon Fire stick OR Amazon Fire are great with this TV if you did the software upgrade and want to access your amazon prime video's again.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNV4KWFWP5X61/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BCGRX9M#wasThisHelpful","RNV4KWFWP5X61","A2Z5W4JDUT2EBY","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2Z5W4JDUT2EBY?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Have had mine since Feb 2013 and I didn't experience as many issues as others have with this printer, in fact I actually like it.  It DID take a LOT of work to get the WIFI to work, and after I got it going, I did end up just using a cable to connect it to my laptop, but it prints nicely, and scans well IF you can find the scan program in photoshop or word for example, because the Epson icon doesn't have the 'scan' option that I could find, you have to either use a program in your software or try to use the printer screen which I find semi difficult.  What prints out is nice and I do like mine for photos or color printing, even though the ink is semi pricey.  I replace it about twice a year, and do very light printing though.  The WIFI part is sort of a joke though.  I give it four stars because it does have a very difficult set up process and if your system updates you sometimes have to reinstall it again, so recommend to keep the passwords on file, it requires a lot of them.  I think I will opt for a color laser printer to replace this when it goes out.

"Nice black and white laser printer that is reliable and has easy set up. Since its not a network printer it only needs a USB cable which you probably already have from a previous printer, and to buy extra toner for later, it even comes with toner for immediate use that will probably last a month. Perfect for a student that needs reliability. Toner is not expensive to replace. I'm ordering a second one today because we constantly have issues with the network printers in our house that are multifunction and don't print when you need them the most. We needed mapquest directions asap this morning on an Canon MP 560 printer that stopped working. If you love simplicity and reliability and need a compact printer to save space, this one is a GOOD ONE. I am keeping one Epson xp-600 Wifi printer for photo printing but replacing two others with this version, which will solve many printing problems and be very cost effective.

"Received chair and assembled fairly easily.  It is not as comfortable as I'd imagined, slighly stiff to sit on.  I ordered the cream version and it did have one small tear on the upper back side but I ignored it.  What I do not like is the fabric is definitely NOT real leather and has a chemical smell to it that doesn''t go away easily.  Also the base has gold and black plastic, a little bit tacky really and I suggest trying to assemble the arms to the back and seat loosely then tighten it down, its very hard to get it lined up and the back doesn't fit very well, ie, one of the screws wouldn't go in no matter how hard I tried, and I had to try to loosen the other screws.  The workmanship is so so, I like the look of the white but I wouldn't order another and I do worry that the chemicals might not be healthy to sit on.  I may end up donating it - wasn't the quality I expected.  Edited for update: It is now March 16th and I have grown to like it more.  I put seat pads on it to make it more comfortable and the smell is slowing fading.

"Description from Amazon.com, two books in one volume.THE CHRISTMAS COTTAGELacey Quinn does not believe in happily-ever-after or the legend of the Christmas Cottage. But her best friend does, and she's the one getting married. It's Lacey's job to make sure everything at the cottage is perfect for the newlyweds. Instead, she finds herself snowed in with the best man, and she begins to wonder if fairy tales really can come true.**This one was not bad.  Lacey and Ean were meant for each other and it was fun seeing them come together. Ava was a Bridezilla of the first degree and extremely annoying.  I dont mean just a bit annoying, there was no way to like her.  That Lacey put up with her is credit to a long term friendship. For me this was a book to pass the time, kinda fun and romantic but just okay.Deets Rating: 3.5EVER AFTERAva Callahan wants desperately to believe in love everlasting. But when Brian McCabe walks back into her life and upsets her carefully organized world, her commitment to perfection makes it hard to accept the love that's right in front of her. Will it take a night in the Christmas Cottage for Ava and Brian to find their happy ending?**Brian is Masons best friend.  Mason and Ava were about to be married but they broke up in The Christmas Cottage book.  Now Brian is back wooing Ava 8 months after the break up and Mason is about to marry someone else.  I still find Ava to be beyond annoying.  I dont really care if she and Brian get together because who is this Brian anyway and what does he see in this poor excuse of a woman, Ava? Too harsh? Maybe.  This book was torture for me to finish since Ava is not my idea of a sympathetic protagonist.

"I do like my romance with some suspense and mystery and this book delivers on all three.  Jasper is the hunky Earl that is also intelligent, fearless and kind.  The combination that all romance readers love.  Hermione is a bit of a tom-boy for her time and likes to drive her phaeton with her beautiful matched grey horses.  That is until her father loses the horses in a card game.  There is something amiss when the winner of the horses is found.well, I will let you find out for yourselves.Manda Collins has given us a well-constructed mystery with some delicious sensuality and perfectly nuanced characters.  I turned pages anxiously to find out who was behind the mystery.  I was rewarded by a I-never-saw-that-coming surprise which was most satisfying and made sense. Hermione and Jasper had a friends to lovers romance, even though Jasper used his personal skill to ensure that he won her hand.This is the second book in The Lords of Anarchy series, but it is a standalone novel with side characters from book #1, A Good Rake is Hard to Find, playing important roles in this story.I received this book free for review from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DUWJ82OLXSEH/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V37BCSS#wasThisHelpful","R3DUWJ82OLXSEH","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you have read the previous books in this series then, like me, you have been anxiously waiting for Bears story.  He has been the big oaf in the other books where the family relies on his brawn but they dont give him much credit in the reasonable thinking department.  However this is how Bear wants it with the family but he shows his intelligent nature to Catriona and his ability to solve family problems where no one expects it of him.  You certainly dont need to have read the previous books to enjoy this one.  Ms. Enoch peppers this book with all of the MaArrcLawry family and their children (bairns) and does a good job of bringing the reader up to speed.I loved this addition to the series.  I stayed up until 4am to finish reading it I was so entranced with the story.  The writing is top-notch from an accomplished storyteller.  The protagonists are so well suited for each other and so sublimely sensual with those heated encounters. The bad guy isnt quite as bad as I usually like him to be, but he holds his own and is integral to the story. The side characters carry through their personalities into this book which makes it a delight for series readers.If you want a cant-put-down novel then this is your book.

"This is my first foray into this genre of the Amish Romance for that reason it is hard for me to say if these stories are typical of the genre.  As in all genres there are good writers and those who dont speak to the reader.  In this book I found both.  All the stories were very predictable and each practically beat the reader over the head with the moral of the story.Im not saying I will never read this genre again but I am saying I will definitely do a bit more research before I give it another try.

"Gwyn Creadys Time Travel romances are full of action, adventure, sex and laugh out loud moments and this one does not disappoint.  Serafina asks her fortune teller friend Undine for help in claiming her stolen fortune.  The help she gets is Gerard Innes from NYC in the twenty-first century. Gerard wakes up in Scotland in the 18th century and is hard pressed to figure out what is going on.  Serafina whisks him away from danger almost immediately and the chase is on.  It is she and Gerard running from the bad guys and then she and Gerard running to claim her fortune.  The question seems to be if they will be successful before Gerard is taken back to his own time or even if they will survive in Serafinas time. Peppered throughout the adventure is Gerard being the typical advertising executive even helping the tavern owner to increase his business.  As Serafina and Gerard rely on each other their romance flourishes.  Will Gerard choose to stay in Scotland with Serafina? Will it be possible? Will Serafina want to go with Gerard to The 21st century?This is a light, fun time travel romance.  It is very sexy and very funny.

"FIRST SEASON (originally published in 1983)Widowed Lady Anabel Wyndham was married right out of the schoolroom and has never before experienced the delights of a London Season. She's dazzled by the attention of the fascinating Sir Charles Norbury, a man whose touch seems to melt her very soul, but a notorious rake. She's drawn to handsome friend-of-the-family Christopher Hanford and the comfort and serenity he offers. But how does one choose between two such charming suitors? Anabel is finding that love is so much more dangerous the second time around.**That blurb neglects to mention Anabels three precocious children, William, Nicholas and Susan.  They are really the stars of this book and help to focus the story.  I truly enjoyed this book because so many of the current romance novels dont feature children in pivotal roles, it was a welcome change.  The bad guy doesnt seem all that bad until toward the end, the good guy is rather wimpy at times and Anabel is indecisive most of the time.  That leaves the children to do their best, in childish ways, to rectify the situations. Kudos to Anabels mother for being the only mother in Romance Novel history to hold her tongue and let her daughter decide her own fate. That Georgina, Anabels cousin, had to lose weight to be accepted was rather sad but I suppose true of all eras.BRIDE TO BE (originally published in 1999)Emily Crane is the toast of the ton-and she couldn't find it more tedious. Until she encounters the darkly sensual stranger whose life she once saved and the London Season becomes infinitely more exciting. Recently returned from the wilds of South America, Lord Richard Sheldon has only contempt for tiresome London chits, but he finds himself stunningly intrigued by the dauntless Emily Crane. When the two become embroiled in a budding scandal and are forced into an engagement, they discover a passion more dangerous than any killer...**This is very much a Mystery/Historical Romance.  It appears that life threatening near misses may be actual murder attempts on Richards life.  At least that is the notion that Emily decides and Richard poo-poos. Soon Richard comes around to Emilys ideas and since they have been compromised into a betrothal they will work together to figure out the mystery and then go their separate ways.I enjoyed this romance novel.  Again the premise was quite original yet believable.  There is a feisty heroine, a paranormal medium, quirky artist parents, a stuffed shirt Duchess and sons, not to leave out a handsome hero and his weepy mother.  My only negative is there was too much time spent running away toward the end of the book. Deets Rating: 4, Sexy Rating:5.Deets General Impression:  Both of these books are very entertaining and original, more so than many contemporary offerings.  It would do all of us die-hard Historical Romance fans to delve into the back-lists of authors and Im sure we will find hidden gems like these two.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R296BJQHEFKDFJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XWMC7AO#wasThisHelpful","R296BJQHEFKDFJ","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is very much a romantic suspense novel with touches of the paranormal just like most of Kearsleys books.  The setting is Wales and the characters are for the most part English.  Not only do we get a mystery but also some insightful looks at Welsh history. Once again Kearsley touches on all of my favorite tropes; romance, mystery, suspense and learning something new.  The author has combined a real life setting with fictional characters and plot.  Once you start reading you are immersed in the setting, time and place.  It is not apparent that there is evil lurking but there is something that is just a bit off.  As an involved reader you will try to help Lyn figure it out but it is often elusive and difficult to know who to trust. This is truly a wonderful book from a supremely accomplished author.I recommend this book to all who like a good mystery and a happy ending with doses of history thrown in for good measure.I received this book free for review from the publisher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1VHRLVXTCBHZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VGY4RA8#wasThisHelpful","R1VHRLVXTCBHZP","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a very sexy book with sparks flying from the get-go.  In the beginning Connor and Faith have a teasing bantering relationship that, because of some scary circumstances that throw them together, becomes hotter and hotter until they cannot deny the attraction any longer.  All this before the snowbound encounter. These two both have troubled pasts but Faith is more recent in her heartbreak and is being very cautious with her heart.  Connor knows what he wants and it is Faith forever.There is really nothing new in this story but the characterization is done so well it is as if these are people we know and we are rooting for their HEA.  Connor is An Alpha male that Faith tries her best to adjust to his demanding nature.  Faith is so anxious about falling for Connor that she often puts up stumbling blocks. This is the fourth book in the series and characters appear from previous books, but this is a standalone novel.

"That description from Amazon is so well done that I wont repeat it here.  This is a very emotional book.  The chaotic past of Ria is slowly unfolded for the reader throughout the book.

Ria was such a tortured soul and Vikram was so full of hurt, I needed to know how these two became so damaged.

He is here to see Claire who has infiltrated the party as an upstairs maid, she is really an accomplished jeweler.  She seems to be a thief looking for jewels.  She broke off an affair with Nick several months earlier and he does not know what she is up to but he will find out and perhaps help her or win her back or both.There is romance, mystery and suspense in this short story by Ms. Bourne who is a master of those genres.  There is an evil villain and a sweet innocent in need of protection. The addition of this side story was a bit of distraction since I really wanted more of Nick and Claire in this short story.  I wished this story had been a full length book as so often happens to me when I read an accomplished authors short story. Rating: 4.5-stars, Sexy rating: 4, Christmasy Feeling: 52. A Scottish Carol by Susan KingHenry Seton and Clarinda Hay have a history but they were torn apart by the Napoleonic War and now in a blinding Christmas Eve blizzard are stranded together at Henrys estate.  Will they renew their once thwarted love affair?I liked this short story of two souls who are destined to be together and who complement each other.  Rating: 4-stars, Sexy Rating: 3, Christmasy Feeling: 53. Christmas Larks by Patricia RiceIvo Whitney-Harris was wounded in the war. After 5 years, on his way home he is attacked by highwayman and suffers a serious head wound. Sarah Jane Langsdale, at 17 years old, watched her childhood friend, Ivo, become betrothed to another, breaking her heart. When she discovers him, ill and suffering, in a house destined to be an orphanage she attempts to nurse him back to health.Another story of a reunion during the holiday season.  I liked the plot but thought it was slim on holiday feeling. A cold abandoned house does not give off a warm Christmas vibe.  Rating: 4, Sexy Rating: 3, Christmasy Feeling: 14. In The Bleak Midwinter by Mary Jo PutneyKim Stratton has been sequestering himself in the tower attached to the family home since he arrived home from the war all scared and broken.  He has refused to see anyone except his loyal batman Jamie who has helped him recover.  Before the war he had an understanding and was in love with neighbor Roxie.  But now he has refused to see or speak with her for the past 6 months.  Roxie is running out of patience and will see what she can do to end this nightmare.War leaves its mark not only on the soldier but also on those left behind.  This story is a tribute to those who serve and those who pick up the pieces.  It is a lovely story but with little holiday feeling.  It could have been any time of the year. Rating: 4.5, Sexy Rating: 5 not explicit, Christmasy feeling: 25. Old Flames Dance by Cara ElliotIn this story we are treated to two romances.  Brothers Kim and Edward and Lily and Roxie.  Now Roxie loves Kim but Kim has been wounded in the war and has not allowed any family or his betrothed, Roxie, to see him.  Edward asks Roxie if the two of them could announce their betrothal and have a marriage of convenience if Kim still refuses to see her.  Meanwhile Lily, who once loved Edward and since has married twice and been widowed twice, comes to the Christmas ball.  Yes you guessed it.  She loves Edward and wants to marry him.  How will this work out?  Rating:4 ,Sexy rating: 3, Christmasy Feeling: 16. A Season for Marriage by Nicola CornickCaroline Camden is married to Piers Camden for 6 months and they have been struggling.  She loves him but he is afraid to love her because he saw his parents totally neglect everyone and everything because of their obsessive love for each other.  Will the Christmas Ball bring them together?Rating: 4, sexy rating: 4, Christmasy feeling: 17. Miss Finch and the Angel by Jo BeverleyLord Gabriel comes at the summons from his Godmother, Lady Holly.  She wants him to dance with all the Last Chance single ladies at the ball so that other gentleman will want to do likewise. (Yeah, right, Lady Holly.  Were not falling for that ploy.)  Gabriel falls for it but he seems intriqued by Clio Finch, so much so that there is a chance he will forget his mission from Lady Holly.Gabriel is my favorite character in the entire book; Clio not so much. Clios character and background was not developed as well as Gabriels. However, this was a sweet story and proved that the Last chance Ball was working its magic. Rating: 4, Sexy rating: 2, Christmasy Feeling: 28. Mistletoe Kisses by Anne GracieIn this story a spinster is forced to leave her home to become a teacher but she is looking forward to one last Christmas alone in her childhood home.  A raging snowstorm has caused an accident on the road and a gentleman and his sister are stranded at the only home until the storm passes. Will love bloom for John and Allie? This story has the most Christmasy feeling. Rating: 4.5, Sexy rating: 3, Christmasy feeling: 5+Deets summary:  I enjoyed each of these sweet stories.  Only three had the feeling of the Christmas season but each story was full of romance and warmth.  Lady Holly was a fairy godmother and matchmaker extrodinere and I found her no nonsense demeanor to be delightful.  Each of the stories are related to the theme of the Christmas Ball as the last chance for spinsters to land a husband.  The stories are short and will be a delightful addition to your holiday reading.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E701FM552WTF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00RRT32HU#wasThisHelpful","R2E701FM552WTF","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This was very well done for a novella.  Deft characterization and interesting plot points.  There were characters introduced who will have their stories told in the upcoming series.

"I got this for my TV and Surround sound system.  I like that It is off the floor and plugs right into the wall outlet. It also plugs in so that one of the holes in the wall outlet is free to plug in something else. So in other words it has turned my two hole wall outlet into a 4 hole outlet, three of which are surge protected.

"I really like this surge protector because it gets those cords off the floor and right into the wall outlet.  Turning my two hole outlet into six is also a plus.  I really can't speak to its effectiveness as a surge protector since I've been lucky and not needed protection since I got this. I have my computer, phone, lamp, printer-scanner and even my electric pencil sharpener plugged into that outlet.

"Louis has had enough of being a vampire and wants noted London physician, Dr. Howland, to ""cure"" him.  But the cure is always very temporary and requires blood and medications frequently.  Arabella is fascinated with Louis before she knows that he is a vampire and falls for him.  She is in love and swears to stand by him once she finds out. There are dangers surrounding their alliance and nothing is simple or easy.This is a compelling romance between a vampire and a human.  It is in the vein of Dracula or perhaps an Anne Rice novel.  It is dark, violent and not all that much romantic unless you like your romance bloody and quite dangerous.  Personally this is not in my wheel-house.  However this book is well written and is sure to appeal to those who do like Gothic Vampire stories.I received this book free for review from the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BNEVIFKVZFS7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011JD9TYO#wasThisHelpful","R2BNEVIFKVZFS7","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This arrived well packaged so all we have had to do is take off the Styrofoam, tape and plastic sheeting.  Then it's time to fill the ink wells.  This comes with 4 bottles of ink, blue, red, yellow & black, that completely fill each ink reservoir. (There is a see-through plastic window for each reservoir.)  According to the specs I shouldn't have to add ink for 2 years. YAY!  This is the reason I got this printer after I had read a very favorable review in the Wall Street Journal.  I was really tired of buying ink all the time.  After filling we had to wait about 20 minutes for ink charging. Then it is just put in the CD and upload the software to the computer.  I printed off the test page and all was good.This was a very easy installation!  It took me about 30 minutes all together with the wait time on the ink charging.  I have uploaded photos showing my husband filling ink wells.  The instructions suggest using plastic gloves and as you can see he has ink on his thumbs because he was too impatient. So my advice is to use the plastic gloves.  We will be moving in a few months and there are very complete directions in how to move this printer with full ink wells.I have printed several different items using card stock and computer paper and all printed well.  I've also scanned items and that went well.  Absolutely no complaints.

"There is much wrong with that book description at the top of this Amazon page since Mili did not get permission to leave India from her grandmother and Sam is trying to secure an annulment for his brother, not a divorce. I really get annoyed with these misleading descriptions.  An annulment was necessary because Sam's brother had already married and impregnated someone else.  Mili didn't inform her grandmother of her plans because granny was of the interfering type and would have tried to thwart her plans.This is an emotional story.  I laughed, a lot, and I cried.  It is delightful in the way it brings to life the Indian culture.  I learned so much from this novel about Indian family relationships, food and fashion.  But the slow to develop romance was just perfect.  We saw the movie director playboy slowly falling head over heels for Mili.  And we saw Mili defiantly refusing to succumb to his charm. The troubled past of each character added to the emotion I was feeling as the reader.This book has had a tremendous amount of hype in the romance reading world and I just had to see what all the fuss was about.  I'm so glad I read this book.  Even with some of the confusing Hindi words here and there I enjoyed them all. If like me you enjoy a book that opens up new ideas and introduces new cultures then definitely pick up this book.I'm looking forward to reading and reviewing Sonali Dev's soon to be released The Bollywood Bride.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RNG5Y20CSQMBR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JVW6GQ0#wasThisHelpful","RNG5Y20CSQMBR","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you have read books by Grace Burrowes then you will recognize the Haddenfield family from Burrowes' Lonely Lords series.  Nita is one of Nicholas', Earl of Ballefonte, sisters. His other sisters are Della, Susanna and Kirstin all of whom will have their own story in this new True Gentlemen series.Tremaine St. Michael arrives at Nicholas' estate in order to negotiate business for a herd of Nick's precious merino sheep.  Nicholas is bent on matchmaking one of his sisters with St. Michael.  There is some back and forth negotiations with St. Michael not going along with the matchmaking until he gets caught up in the lives of the Haddenfields and totally falls for Nita.  Nita falls for Tremaine but there are obstacles and a side story that involves the entire family.This is a most complex and riveting novel.  I have to say that Grace Burrowes is at the top of her game with this delightfully, insightful and compelling novel.  She has us holding our breath through hair raising scenes and moments of terrifying events.  The romance is so very believable in its slow development with realistic dialog and breathless love scenes.  We are given in depth looks at each sister so that we look forward to their romantic stories.I highly recommend this book to all romance fans.  This one is truly at the top of my best-of-2015 list.(It is not necessary to have read the Lonely Lords Series to enjoy this book, but if you haven't read that series, I think this book will compel you to read Nicholas' story when you finish..)Nicholas: Lord of Secrets (The Lonely Lords)I received this book free for review from the publisher.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2F5BT66E297ZJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00TFZ0D8A#wasThisHelpful","R2F5BT66E297ZJ","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for lots of Christmasy warm-fuzzies you will have to wade through almost 400 pages of melodramatic angst.  Now Im all in favor of some troubled protagonists but this is a bit over the top for me.  If you like a hero who, granted, is a hunky, retired Delta Force soldier with an inability to talk and PTSD.  As well as our heroine who is anxiety ridden because of being on the run with her son from her ex.  Then this is your cup of tea.  Did I mention the hunky soldiers sister who has run off and left her daughter in the care of these two less than mentally sound people?  Just too much drama for me when you throw in the psycho ex-husband. I gave it a 3-star rating because Ms. Wilde writes some believable dialog.

Jeremy Keane is a character we have met in a previous book by Sabrina Jeffries and it is good to see him get his own love story.

He has no hard feelings and thus attends the wedding of his former fianc where he meets Jeremy and hires him to paint his sister's portrait.  The book slows down a bit in the beginning but not for long.  This is a romance with some surprises and secrets that long to be uncovered.

"Well...not so much passion, but certainly a slow building affection that becomes more and more romantic.  Eventually binding Camille and Jonathan, this closeness will see Jonathan as Camille's protector.I enjoyed this novel.  It is part suspense, part mystery and part romance and Ms. Ladd gives us all three with some surprises thrown in also.  This is sold by Harper Collins Christian so there is no sex which is welcome to some readers.  The extent of physical interaction is a kiss. There are nice characters, there are not so nice characters and then there are really down and dirty characters.

"This is the first book in Julie Anne Walker's The Deep Six series.  It is the story of six former SEALs who band together to form a salvage company to find lost treasure at the bottom of the Caribbean. Their civilian goal is set aside when they agree to help CIA agent Olivia Mortier, an agent they met when in the employ of the Navy.This is action packed and when Ms. Walker writes action she can pull you into the story as you quickly turn pages to find out what will happen next.  It is also sex packed with the lust that does more than simmer between Leo and Olivia.  They are often thwarted in their lovemaking attempts which is sometimes very humorous. Olivia is made very human by her very human reaction to violence.  Side character, and civilian, Maddy has an initial horror of her circumstances but seems to adapt rather too easily to the situations.  The remainder of the salvage crew all have distinct personalities and I look forward to each of their stories.It always amazes me in these highly violent Romantic Suspense books how the H/h can find time to get-it-on while all kinds of crazy is going on around them or just before their hook-up.This is a taut thriller and I can surely recommend it to all Romantic Suspense fans.I received this book free for review from the publisher.

"Sloane is getting over being dumped by her fianc by becoming a workaholic.  Her friends want her to snap out of it so they are delighted with the idea that she is going to vacation in Scotland to find her ""Jamie Frasier"".  Of course Sloane has no intentions of finding anyone but with her friends arriving in Scotland in a few days she needs someone to pretend to be her found boyfriend.  Galen is the hunky Scot behind the bar at the Black Thistle and Sloane propositions him to be her ""boyfriend"" by offering a hefty sum that he needs to upgrade his bar.  The pretend part works well for a while until feelings start to surface.There is lots to like about this novel.  There is a hunky Scot and a determined American.  The writing is full of the humorous banter that always puts a smile on my face.  The bickering between the H & h is just fun especially with the Scottish burr that the author can almost make you hear.The story progresses well and we think early on that there will be a happily-ever-after but then our H/h start to over think the relationship and others try to come between them.I liked this book!

"This is my first time reading an Alexandra Hawkins book.  Although the premise was good, two friends wagering on who could seduce a beautiful debutante, the debutante was so overwhelmingly nave and seemed out of character for the era.  I kept wondering where were her parents, who seemed to love her, when she was traipsing around unchaperoned. The Duke and the Marquess were rakes in the truest sense.  Both were hedonistic rogues one with a conscience and one who was a sociopath.  Fair warning, there are two scenes of rape.This is a dark novel that could have used a bit more fleshing out.

"Yes, this is a sizzling novel; safe to say it is a bit raunchy but feels like reality of the times.  It doesnt gloss over the morals and attitudes of society by focusing on the simpering debs at the ball.  This is about those who are trying to just hang on in society and perhaps even feeling some panic at their perceived downfall. Or some who have learned how to play the game for their own advantage.I enjoyed this darker regency romance.  The characters were brought to life and felt very real.  The good guy had his faults and the villain was truly evil.  Iris was very lucky when she pursued being a mistress that she encountered Martin who was an honorable man since the ton was full of the dishonorable type.

"I dove into the first chapter thinking I would just read a few pages.  Well.....I had to keep reading because it was so funny and I had visions of a Rom Com movie dancing in my head.  This is well written by an author who is better known for her mystery series.The bride, Megan, is terrified of her mother, Nicole, who is rather autocratic and definitely overbearing but written a bit over the top.  That is why Megan has been unable to confront her mother with the news of the broken engagement.  Josh is a really decent guy (as well as hunky and handsome) who sees a way to solve both his business problem and at the same time help out Megan.  He didn't plan on falling for her. Side characters play an important part in the shenanigans in this story and set up future books.  Megan's two childhood girl pals are her bridesmaids and confidants.  Megan's grandmother is sharp as a tack but plays at senility, and if she's a bit over the top, well, she is lovable.  The scenes of humor are a bit contrived but that never stopped me from laughing out loud.If you want a light, laughable, romantic and sexy read then this is your go-to book.  And who doesn't need one of these funny books once in awhile.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1C42HQCGR9E96/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00M7C185A#wasThisHelpful","R1C42HQCGR9E96","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love time-travel romances.  At least I love the idea of them.  So often I've been disappointed but every now and then I come across a hidden gem and this is one of those.  This story is superbly plotted and so rich with time-slip explanations that the reader starts to think it could actually happen.  Our Fifteenth century Highland Laird is, of course, the epitome of virile masculinity and handsome.  Our Victorian miss is sweet, tender and much put-upon by her female relatives. There is a villain that we hope gets his comeuppance and a group of kindly old scientists who aid in the understanding of time-slips.  This has been just a delightful book by a very accomplished author.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S8MEZDYIERJ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008GWT0CI#wasThisHelpful","R3S8MEZDYIERJ8","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"An Eloisa James book is usually a slam-dunk for being a page turner.  This one is no exception.  We are introduced to our hero, Vander, and our heroine, Mia, when they are teenagers and in an embarrassing situation.  The story then picks up years later when Mia, who has sworn to never even talk to Vander again, is in his study proposing marriage. Of course Mia can't tell Vander the ""real"" reason for the proposal and so Vander, justifiably, is angry at her effrontery.In many books, I find I yawn and shake my head at the use of this trope of misunderstanding or blatant holding back of information between characters.  In this book it all makes sense that Mia can't really divulge the reasons for her proposal and why Vander accepts also is totally understandable.  So what we have here is powerful writing by a talented author.  That these two find common ground is also skillfully accomplished.This is a sexy, well written, totally engrossing Historical Romance. I recommend it for all romance aficionados.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CQVBPK2PQGHK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JBETURA#wasThisHelpful","R1CQVBPK2PQGHK","A3RF010MX29BQP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3RF010MX29BQP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I cannot tell a lie! I really liked the first book in this series. I found it near impossible to finish this one.  Not a bit of it felt like the regency era except maybe the carriage rides. The heroine was supposed to be a proper young lady but continually delved into compromising situations. She was to instruct the hero in properly comporting himself when she continued to be improper.

"Okay, does that title grab you?  Hm-m-m, do you think maybe this is a sexy book? Does the fact that Romantic Times Magazine dubbed it ""Book of The Year"" at this year's convention mean anything? Well, what can I say, yes, the title grabbed me, I figured it was sexy and if Romantic Times thought it that good maybe I should just see what the fuss was all about.Sexy does not begin to describe all the sex in this book. Some sensuous, some rough, some play-acting all written VERY well.  Ansel is truly a gorgeous hunk and who could resist his French accent. Mia is confused about her future for most of the book but has fallen for Ansel although she tries to deny the attachment. What happened in Vegas started something that traveled all the way to Paris.Yes, I read this cover to cover, all 416 pages in two days.  I had trouble putting it down when I really needed to sleep so I picked it up again first thing the next morning. These characters were believable and their lusting for each other was also believable.  I kept waiting for this initial infatuation to wear off.  I could not see how these two were to get a happily-ever-after.  That is why I kept turning pages.  I was totally hooked on their attraction and their scorching chemistry.

"Throughout this series there has been a welcome side element introduced that goes beyond the expected romance.  In SLOW HAND I learned about ranching in the west, in ROUGH RIDER I learned all about the workings of the rodeo circuit. In this offering Ms. Vane gives us some valuable lessons both pro and con of wildlife management, wolves in particular.  I am really enjoying my romance novel with a side of fascinating lessons.This the third book in the Hot Cowboy Nights series is a standalone novel.  I did think it was more in the ""military romance"" genre because we didn't get to the ranch until about 2/3 of the way through the book.  Reid was a noble hero, he was a good guy who in my opinion fell for the wrong woman.  Haley was annoying from the beginning with her incessant fanaticism and her total inability to see anyone's point of view that might differ from her narrow focus. I kept wondering throughout what Reid saw in her.Not liking the heroine does put a bit of a damper on my opinion but I have to say that Victoria Vane does write a good book.

"This the third book in The Wallflower Series is Evie's story, one of the four young women who were wallflowers during their husband-hunting seasons in London.  She is the shy one, with a self-conscious stutter who tries to fade into the background at most society functions.  She is also abused by her extended family and kept from visiting her dying father, a prominent gambling hall owner. Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent, is an unrepentant rake who is in dire need of money.  Evie is also desperate to get away from her abusive family and comes to him with a proposition he can't refuse.  ""Marry me."" And he does.For many readers this book in the series is their favorite.  I tend to like all of the books with over the top fan-girl squees.  Yes, I did just say that.  This book like the others has a supremely sensuous romance, beautifully crafted love scenes and characters that the reader falls in love with.  This entire series is splendidly entertaining and I do suggest that the reader start at the beginning with Secrets of a Summer Night (The Wallflowers, Book 1) (or the unofficial prequel Again The Magic).

That Ms. Kleypas can bring about that transformation is the mark of a superb writer.In the first book of this series Secrets of a Summer Night (The Wallflowers, Book 1) we become fans of the four wallflowers and hope for their happily ever after.  Annabelle found hers with Simon Hunt. Now Lillian Bowman is searching for hers at a house party at Lord Westcliff's estate. That she manages to attract two interested men is somewhat surprising since she has been out in society for four seasons without any takers.  There is an evil villain and a not very nice aristocrat, Sebastian St. James, who try to throw a monkey wrench into the romance of Marcus and Lillian.

"Do we need another recording of Arensky's overplayed Piano Trio in D minor? Probably not, but I welcome a complete recording of the two trios, which is rarer. The question is whether the Leonore Trio offers anything better than the Beaux Arts Trio or Borodin Trio; each performance is distinctive and dissimilar. I would say no. The Beaux Arts Trio delivers a superior interpretation and they would be my first choice for a complete set of Arensky's piano trios. The Borodin Trio recording on Chandos is also decent, although much slower in performance.The Leonore Trio gives a crisp and urgent performance of the Piano Trio in D minor (1894). Yet there's something lacking in the first movement, notable for its striking themes combining Brahmsian thickness of texture with the lyricism of Tchaikovsky. There's a deficiency in force and elegance so beautifully conveyed by the Beaux Arts Trio. However, Leonore is particularly sensitive in the sorrowful and moving slow movement, while letting loose with lively rhythmic zest in the finale. There are many other great performances available, but Hyperion's excellent sound engineering is hard to beat.While Arensky's Piano Trio in D minor is a staple of the trio repertory, his lesser-known second Piano Trio in F minor (1905) is on the periphery. Despite its minor key, this is an upbeat and luminous trio, heavily influenced by Chopin and Tchaikovsky. All the forward momentum and strong active piano writing of the first movement, however, suggests Schumann. It's quite shocking that this movement is in F minor because the music is so bright and warm. Even in the second movement, a sort of Chopinesque song without words, Arensky eschews melancholy in favor of sweet tenderness. The finale also looks to Chopin, particularly in the rhythm and contours of his waltzes. Some lovely lyricism and rhythmically interesting variations are heard, mostly restrained, but some extroverted and passionate.Conus's arrangement of Rachmaninov's Vocalise is a nice bonus, even if it's been recorded before and in a much more passionate performance by the Eroica Trio. The melting beauty of this work is well suited to the trio medium. The intense central section with low bass material sounds very expressive on the piano and Rachmaninov's passionate strains are so affecting when played by the violin and cello alone.Bottom line: There's no shortage of recordings of Arensky's D minor trio. While the Leonore Trio's performance is sincere and impassioned, I think the Philips recording with the Beaux Arts Trio is the go-to choice.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3W3A46Z5WF6MP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HPZZO4A#wasThisHelpful","R3W3A46Z5WF6MP","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Son of the more famous composer Harald Saeverud, Ketil Hvoslef (b. 1939) is largely a composer of instrumental music incorporating rock and jazz elements. His Piano Trio (2010) is merely OK and not enough to gauge his talents as a composer. This single-movement 21-minute trio mixes tonal and atonal writing, includes minimalist gestures, and dissonant monophonic lines played in unison on all instruments. The textures are at once spare and then intensely active, while the mood of the work is accordingly introspective and suddenly dramatic. The content is unremarkable and even in the extensive solos for each instrument I found the material unrewarding.Little known outside of his home country, Fartein Valen (1887-1952) garnered attention from Glenn Gould, who recognized Valen's talent at polyphonic writing. Valen is at his best when he aims to express darker moods, particularly in his piano music. I don't think his Piano Trio is as interesting. It represents his pursuit of radicalism and breaking away from late Romantic foundations. In essence, the trio is Valen's crossing of the atonal Rubicon. The opening ""Moderato"" is full-blown Schoenberg in its aesthetic, although Valen's usage of tone rows is not dodecaphonic in the Second Viennese sense. The ""Scherzo"" is a wildly hectic and atonal rhythmic exercise, uneven in its quality. By contrast, the ""Largo"" creates a soundscape of desolation and introspection. In the ""Finale,"" Valen brushes shoulders with Webern, indulging in swirls of dissonant activity, wide spans of registers, and frenetic counterpoint that borders on the chaotic. This is prickly and melodyless music, difficult to appreciate without seeing on the page. After such an atonal marathon exhibited in this finale, Valen brings the music to a close with a startling triumphal major chord. Whatever Valen's reason for this, the major chord sounds as jarring as a tone cluster occurring at the end of a diatonic piece.Klaus Egge (1906-1979) continued the tradition of Valen's dissonant counterpoint, although he generally adhered to tonality and less to serialism. His Piano Trio is not as effective as his piano sonatas and less forward-looking than Valen's trio. While the inspiration for the trio is the Soviet-Finnish Winter War of 1940, there's not enough dramatic weight and harrowing emotion to suggest this conflict. The opening ""Allegro con impeto"" is tonal with profuse dissonance, optimistic in outlook, and chock full of post-Romantic gestures. At the emotional core of this trio is the lovely ""Adagio,"" a movement of sweet reflection and tenderness, featuring an intense climax of expressive power worth hearing several times. Equally gripping is the finale, which shows off strong thematic material and riveting momentum. Here Egge is inventive and inspired with his rhythm and forward drive.Bottom line: Valen's expressionist trio is the most effective item on this recording and yet I can't say I care for it all that much. I prefer his piano music. Egge's trio is also uneven and shines mainly in the gorgeous slow movement. The trio of Hvoslef is hit-and-miss, an experimental and unimposing work of minimalism and atonality.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EZE8NGPKA9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BI8SEO2#wasThisHelpful","R1EZE8NGPKA9R","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This thoughtful program features the piano works of four Norwegian composers, each studying with the other and thus representing a continuous thread of modernism in Norway: Valen taught Egge who taught Mortensen who taught Wallin.Little known outside of his home country, Fartein Valen (1887-1952) is better known now after garnering attention from Glenn Gould, who recognized Valen's talent at polyphonic writing. Valen is at his best when he aims to express darker moods, exemplified in the Four Pieces, each atonal and steeped in the expressionism of Schoenberg and Berg. ""Nachtstuck"" has a feverish and dark anxiety about it, reminiscent of early Schoenberg. It is difficult to detect any waltzing in the ""Valse Noble,"" which is more Berg than stylized dance. Desolation and fragility are conveyed in the Bergian ""Lied Ohne Worte."" In the ""Gigue,"" Valen strives for atonal counterpoint in the manner of Webern; sudden volatile eruptions add to the drama. Valen's best solo piano piece here is the ""Intermezzo,"" an explosive and somber piece, taking turns at harsh and aggressive expression followed by respites of bleak meditation.Klaus Egge (1906-1979) continued the tradition of Valen's dissonant counterpoint, although he generally adhered to tonality and less to serialism. The Piano Sonata No. 2 ""Patetica"" is one of his most significant works: jagged, expressive, astringently modern, and influenced by Bartok. The opening ""Grave stentato"" is a heady mixture of crunchy dissonant chords, harsh dissonance, and forceful rhythm. The slow ""Canto Etereo"" is by contrast spacious, bleak, and wraithlike, comparable to Feldman. The ""Finale"" is a decent essay of drama and energy in similar dissonant garb as the first movement.Finn Mortensen (1922-1983) studied counterpoint with Egge and was influenced by the Darmstadt school. However, his early work is largely under the shadow of Hindemith. His Piano Sonata has vestiges of his early preoccupations with neoclassicism, but it is emotionally distant from Hindemith's world. The ""Quasia una fantasia"" movement is completely atonal, angular, and liberal with tone clusters. Whiffs of Messiaen occasionally emerge. Even more arresting is the ""Fuga,"" a lethargically slow fugue of dark ethereal beauty, amassing speed and volume halfway through and giving vent to expressive and volcanic outbursts.Rolf Wallin (b. 1957) studied composition with Mortensen, but took a more avant-garde path of fractal and computer-generated music, which makes his textures similar to Xenakis and Ligeti. Seven Imperatives (2001) is a fascinating cycle of miniatures, each conveying a specific kind of action or motion. The colors generated in ""Push"" are based on computer calculations, but the result to my ears is American ultramodernism: intense mechanical rhythms and savage tone clusters redolent of Ornstein, Antheil, and Cowell. ""Sink"" is a gentle and fragile evocation with icy delicate figures. ""Spin"" is one of fast scintillating ostinatos while ""Stab"" attains its character through a brutal and severe tone cluster statement. ""Lean"" is the longest of the cycle at 8 minutes and explores a static soundscape of mystery and deserted solitude, reminiscent of Feldman's ""Palais de Mari.""Bottom line: An interesting survey of lesser-known modern piano music from Norway, thoughtfully linked together through the teacher-pupil relationships between the four composers. Valen's pieces will satisfy lovers of expressionism while Egge and Mortensen produce strong essays of serious modernism; Wallin's colorful and experimental cycle is deserving of revival.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3263Z812FEQGQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002SSZ7BY#wasThisHelpful","R3263Z812FEQGQ","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All but forgotten outside of Norwegian music history, Fartein Valen (1887-1952) did receive some recent attention from Glenn Gould, who recognized Valen's talent at polyphonic writing. Valen is at his best when he aims to express darker moods. I also think he excels in solo piano pieces, but these chamber works are less effective.The String Quartet op. 0 is a student work, late Romantic with small traces of Valen's future radicalism, namely in the chromaticism and slow contrapuntal writing. The opening movement is tender and reflective with adequate part-writing, although its flat unchanging dynamics got a little boring. There's nothing outstanding about the ""Scherzo,"" which is textbook Mendelssohn in its carefree spirit and lightness.With the Violin Sonata, Valen embraces the expressionism of Schoenberg. Tonality is stretched considerably and the atmosphere is much darker and chromatic. Violent stabs of dissonance and crunching chords create a sense of tension and inner turmoil. Valen also pursues his quest for expressive polyphony, at times sounding like mature Reger. This new path of ""dissonant counterpoint"" culminates in the ""Fugue"" movement, one of rich post-Romantic gestures and an outpouring of intensity.The Piano Trio goes even further towards modernity and represents Valen's crossing of the atonal Rubicon. The opening ""Moderato"" is full-blown Schoenberg in its aesthetic, although Valen's usage of tone rows is not dodecaphonic in the traditional Second Viennese sense. The ""Scherzo"" is a wildly hectic and atonal rhythmic exercise, uneven in its quality. By contrast, the ""Largo"" creates a soundscape of desolation and introspection.

After such an atonal marathon exhibited in this finale, Valen brings the music to a close with a startling triumphal major chord. Whatever Valen's reason for this, the major chord sounds as jarring as a tone cluster occurring at the end of a diatonic piece.Bottom line: Valen is distinctive for being a founding Norwegian modernist composer, but I think he does better in his piano music. I cannot quite recommend this recording except to fans of the Second Viennese School. Even then, I would suggest first exploring other lesser known Second Viennese disciples, like Hans Apostel, Egon Wellesz, and Josep Soler. The Violin Sonata is the most interesting of works, while the Trio seems more experimental.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/REYJS7ES3Y2VP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JJ4MOKW#wasThisHelpful","REYJS7ES3Y2VP","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Paul Kletzki (1900-1973) was more renowned as a conductor than a composer and much of his output was destroyed during the Second World War. What I've heard of his music leaves me with mixed feelings. Some of it works and some of it merely shows promise. Although born in Poland, Kletzki later took Swiss citizenship. His style is no more advanced than early Schoenberg anchored in the late Romanticism of Strauss and Mahler. Kletzki's harmonic language is chromatic and tinged with early modernist dissonance, akin to Szymanowski. Unfortunately, Kletzki lacks the font of creativity, lush colors, and expressive grit of Szymanowski. These two chambers works are hit and miss.The Violin Sonata in D major (1924) is a passable specimen of early modernism with late Romantic lyricism and extended tonality in the manner of early Schoenberg. The first movement sets the stage with a mood of impassioned energy, although much of the content is forgettable. It is the remarkable second movement marked ""Andante lugubre"" that steals the show. Here Kletzki is not afraid to express gloom and darkness through murky chords and dissonant colors. This is no doubt the emotional heart of the sonata and fraught with elegiac strains. Effective and compelling. After a brief polyphonic ""Intermezzo,"" the next major event of the sonata is the finale, a passacaglia that alternates between stern and lighter frenetic expression. Kletzki leans towards modernism with his use of ostinatos.The Piano Trio in D major (1926) is less successful and unworthy of detailed commentary. The outer movements, extroverted though they are, lack inspiration and arresting moments. However, the ""Adagio"" is a powerful jewel, notably serious and melancholy with rich arpeggiation and Slavic melodic lines bearing some resemblance to Rachmaninov.Bottom line: Collectors of offbeat chamber repertoire may like the Violin Sonata, but the Piano Trio is a dud, except for its captivating slow movement. Much better chamber works of the hyper-chromatic Szymanowski/early Schoenberg stripe are those of Roslavets, Lyatoshynsky, Catoire, and Bohnke.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XS6IABG6ZO4A/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GF2WMT4#wasThisHelpful","R1XS6IABG6ZO4A","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Volkmann (1815-1883) is regarded paradoxically as a conservative Romantic embraced by the New German School. Much of his music is no more chromatic or advanced than Mendelssohn, but there's rhythmic fire and intense gestures redolent of Liszt. His two piano trios are early works cast from a post-Beethoven mold with nods to Schubert, Schumann, and Mendelssohn.Beethoven is the temperamental and stylistic model for the Piano Trio in F major op. 3, a magnificent work chock full of energy, passion, memorable content. The first movement opens with a Beethovenian pensive introduction--captivating in its own right--before letting loose a spirited Sonata-Allegro. Volkmann's piano writing is heavy and more virtuosic than his conservative peers. There's constant arpeggiation and activity, sounding like Schumann's most intense solo piano music accompanied by strings. Beethoven is suggested again in the ""Scherzo,"" which features a mesmerizing and wonderful trio section, notable for its dignity and pathos-laden melodic lines. Volkmann anticipates Brahms in the ""Andante,"" an impassioned movement with reflective qualities. The ""Finale"" resembles the sheer wild energy and drama of Mendelssohn's stormy D minor trio. Here Volkmann offers the listener a buoyant catchy theme, lots of diminished chords and unstable arpeggios, sparkling flourishes, and toe-tapping momentum.Volkmann's Piano Trio in B flat minor op. 5 was embraced by Liszt and Hans von Bulow for its highly unorthodox form and hints at cyclical structure and thematic unity. There's nothing in its harmonic language or push towards chromaticism that approaches Liszt or even Reubke and Draeseke, but it is an engaging and eccentric work. The trio turns the standard fast-slow-fast structure on its head, starting with a long ""Largo"" that is in a state of palpable anxiety and melancholy, often reminiscent of Beethoven. Occasional turbulence breaks the stillness and then slow meditative passages continue. In the ""Ritornell,"" the mood relaxes with tuneful and brighter ideas, although a sense of unease still lingers. Finally the work ends in a lengthy ""Allegro con brio"" notable for its free-form fantasy structure and recycling of themes from earlier movements. Beethoven and Schubert are still the foundation, albeit updated with early Romantic harmony and pianism. Volkmann is at his best when he aims to express intense passion, as is heard in the dramatic development section.Bottom line: I've enjoyed everything I've heard from Volkmann, which admittedly isn't much (his Piano Sonata and Fantasy and these trios). He is a melodist with a flair for youthful drama and virtuosic piano writing.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RV9AHHW22B0O6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000001RUJ#wasThisHelpful","RV9AHHW22B0O6","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Robert Fuchs (1847-1927) taught such illustrious composers as Mahler, Sibelius, Korngold, and Wolf. After hearing these pedestrian chamber works, I think Fuchs should have stuck to his day job. There's not a single work or movement here that kept my interest for more than a few seconds. This music lacks drive, tension, and basic essentials of interesting melody, harmony, and expressive content. If one needed proof that academic composers can write musical vapor, look no further than Fuchs. Even Brilliant Classics was compelled to cite this funny anecdote: ""Max Bruch showed Brahms some of Fuchs's music, to which Brahms simply replied, 'Where did you find such fine manuscript paper?'"" The liner notes brushes this off as no slight on Fuchs's talent, but rather a typical instant of Brahms's misanthropy. On the contrary, I think his reaction has force and it's a response I can relate to. I'm tempted to follow suit and remark on the recording's fine Klimt album cover and leave it at that.What surprises me is that all three of these uninteresting works are in minor keys and stem from Fuchs's late period, yet there's nothing inventive, dramatic, evocative, or emotionally investing about them. The Piano Trio No. 3 in F-sharp minor (1926) is tired and forgettable, offering zero tension or memorable ideas. The opening movement is all warmth and contented relaxation with flat thematic material. In the ""Andante grazioso,"" Fuchs seems to be writing an exercise in lyricism, in which he gives us a saccharine main theme and a slightly agitated central section. The ""Allegretto scherzando"" is the most distinctive movement of the trio, remarkably classical in aesthetic: bright Haydnesque phrases and a Mozartian tinkling piano part that flirts with Alberti bass figures. Nothing else stands out, although the sunny and rollicking trio is just OK. I cannot find anything positive to say about the finale, a duple meter folk dance with occasional canonic passages and sober expression.The Violin Sonata No. 3 in G minor (1915) is another late work devoid of quality. Despite its minor key, this is a bright and cheerful work. One indicator of how uninspired Fuchs was in this sonata is that the dynamics rarely change. Everything is uniform in mood. It's as if Fuchs is merely going through the motions of part-writing and academic harmonic progressions. The opening movement is warm and leisurely with not one storm cloud to be found, emphasizing a classical sensibility and safe interplay of instruments. I'll grant that the development section shows unexpected chromaticism, but much of it goes in one ear and out the other. Fuchs makes a terrible attempt at cantabile writing in the ""Andante sostenuto"" and the result is schmaltz and sentimentalism. The finale is of Dvorakian character, full of gaiety and energy and alternates minor and major key phrases; nothing special here.The Six Fantasy Pieces for Viola and Piano (1927) are more of the same, but Fuchs is consciously writing in a vein of nostalgia, as he looks back on the 19th century. Each piece is a stylized dance of melancholy character. Of course, ""melancholy"" to Fuchs means autumnal and restrained. The ""Allegretto con delicatezza"" is the only piece with an effective melody. High five to Fuchs. For once he manages to write a fetching theme with the lilt of Schumann and Mozart.Bottom line: Boring, dreadful, tedious. This is some of the worst chamber music I've heard in recent years. If you want strong Brahmsian piano trios and chamber sonatas, listen to Rntgen, Herzogenberg, or Gernsheim.","2.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MPUBF452OM7T/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSHH7ZA#wasThisHelpful","R1MPUBF452OM7T","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The music of Friedrich Gernsheim (1839-1916) might have survived had the composer not died during WWI. Many lesser conservative Romantics could not adjust to modernism or stay relevant after the Great War, but I think Gernsheim would have. He just never had the chance. Matters were much worse for his legacy because as a Jewish composer his music was willfully ignored and marginalized by the Third Reich. During his life, Gernsheim's reputation was that of a conductor, academic, and composer of a decidedly Brahmsian vein. Chamber music was his passion and these piano quintets reveal an accomplished master at work. The piano quintets have been recorded before on Toccata Classics, but I haven't heard the performances.Gernsheim is unabashedly Brahmsian in these quintets. No. 1 in D minor opens with what can only be called Brahmsian vigor and strength. Throughout the movement Gernsheim strikes a fine balance between dramatic and lyrical content in his thematic material. Wonderful things are achieved in the ""Andante molto cantabile."" Here Gernsheim is so evocative of Brahms in the way he writes for piano; comparisons with the ""Adagio"" from Brahms's First Piano Concerto are tempting. The result is a movement of slow passion, delicate beauty, and sublime turns of expressive harmony. In a startling twist of mood, the scherzo comes at the listener with the gruff violence of Beethoven. This is not a light Mendelssohn scherzo, but a toe-tapping highly active boisterous dance in the dark key of G minor. Gernsheim flexes his contrapuntal muscles in the lively finale, marked by classical phrasing and warm serenity.Gernsheim's chamber masterpiece is the Piano Quintet No. 2 in B minor. It reveals an upward curve of technical mastery and expressive force, most salient in the first two movements. Rich melodies and thick Brahmsian chords abound in the ""Molto moderato,"" which is a stately affair featuring massive extroverted drama and a fine interplay of instruments. Gernsheim looks to Beethoven for expressive dynamic extremes; sudden loud climaxes erupt and then fade prematurely. In the ""Adagio,"" Gernsheim lures us in with gentle lyrical A sections before unveiling his true purpose: a dark and turbulent central section, which is commanding in its power due to the excessive tremolos in the strings and dark-hued piano colors. I didn't find the short vivacious scherzo special; just a typical Mendelssohn clone. However, the ""Allegro giocoso"" finale is rousing and has astounding virtuosic passages on the piano fit for a concerto.Bottom line: Gernsheim is among the handful of first-class German composers who wrote chamber music in the wake of Brahms. His two quintets will delight Brahms lovers of all stripes: they're serious, memorable, and consistent in quality. Gernsheim's mastery of form, melodic invention, and his skillful writing for string ensemble and piano remind me of Rontgen and Herzogenberg.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RLCVEZOIB92U9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YZGY9CU#wasThisHelpful","RLCVEZOIB92U9","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"There's a good chance of being misled by the title of this recording ""Dutch Cello Sonatas,"" which is really the name of this series, now reaching six volumes. This particular volume might as well be called ""Rontgen: Cello Sonatas"" because over 60 minutes is devoted to his music. Even the performers admit that the three miniatures by Daniel van Goens (1858-1904) are essentially encores. It is hard to account for the complete neglect of German-Dutch composer Julius Rontgen (1855-1932) who stands apart from the legions of Brahms imitators and conservative late Romantics for one thing: melody. Whether it's the actual thematic material or voicings in his harmonic progressions, Rontgen is an outstanding melodist. Not even Herzogenberg and Gernsheim have such facility. It is no wonder then that he enjoyed a close friendship with another great melodist of his day, Edvard Grieg. Nothing of Rontgen's enormous output survives in the public consciousness, but what he offers in his chamber music is inspired and consistently high quality. He never phones it in.Having been blown away by Rontgens marvelous piano trios, I'm equally over-the-moon for these two cello sonatas, both serious and substantial minor-key works. The Cello Sonata No. 5 in B minor has the rich lyricism and intense beauty of the Brahms E minor sonata. The first movement is distinctly melancholy and tender in mood with gushing cello lines. Even more effective is the energetic second movement, which contains a rollicking toe-tapping theme. Rontgen demonstrates an inspiration for colorful and expressive harmony, yearning chromaticism, and dense piano writing.Yet even more exciting and intense, the Cello Sonata No. 2 in A minor looks to Beethoven, sometimes quite literally. Brahms hovers over the first movement, which is impassioned and turbulent with smoky dark colors and expressive cello lines. In the solemn and ruminating ""Adagio,"" the piano drives the harmonic direction with its progression of chords while the cello supports with counter melodies. Where Rontgen literally borrows from Beethoven is in the spirited finale. The theme is lifted straight from the rondo of Beethoven's Tempest sonata. I have no complaints. Rontgen knows how to craft strong thematic material and he employs the arsenal of an expert melodist, using gorgeous sequences.An interesting inclusion on this program are the Cinq Morceaux, which reveals a programmatic side of Rontgen. Each of these pieces is a musical portrait of characters from Shakespeare's Tempest. Those familiar with the play won't be surprised by the moods he aims for in each piece. Prospero's spirit servant ""Ariel"" is conveyed with light and airy textures; Miranda is exemplified by sweet tenderness and passion; Rontgen goes for a comical and boisterous march to depict the villain Calibran. The miniatures by Daniel van Goens are unashamed trifles: ""Scherzo"" has the upbeat attitude of Rossini; ""Invocation"" is like a cello song without words, serious and nostalgic; ""Menuet"" is neo-Baroque and charming.Bottom line: These two cello sonatas by Rontgen are terrific discoveries, passionate and strong minor-key sonatas that will appeal to anyone who likes Brahms and Grieg.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2717FN47N5NVJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002KUZC6A#wasThisHelpful","R2717FN47N5NVJ","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Nothing of Rntgen's enormous output survives in the public consciousness, but what he offers in his chamber music is inspired and consistently high quality. He never phones it in.In his trio No. 2 in B major, Rntgen hadn't quite found the expressive powers that we'll see crop up later. It is tempting to assume that he is nodding to Brahms's Piano Trio op. 8 with his choice of key and four-movement structure. The work is certainly redolent of Brahms without being blatantly derivative. The first movement ""Allegro molto ed energico"" has an abundance of Beethovenian energy and robust Brahmsian gestures, in addition to attractive melodic material in both themes. ""Un poco andante"" is a noble and expressive cantilena of startling beauty. Although quite lengthy at 9 minutes, Mendelssohn is the obvious model for the whimsical and charming ""Scherzo"" with its nimble flights of piano figures. Rounding out the work is a passionate and triumphant finale heavily suggestive of Brahms.A much better trio is No. 4 in G minor ""Entam."" Here Rntgen raises the bar for himself, concentrating on motivic development and dramatic content. The opening ""Allegro molto"" has all the weight and urgency of middle Beethoven with memorable themes to boot. I must quote Jeff Joneikis of Records International, who compared the first theme to ""a black rose blooming in the moonlight beneath the crumbling ramparts of a ruined castle wherein a white-robed figure with raven tresses is suddenly glimpsed out of the corner of one's eye."" Take it from us, Rntgen knows how to craft powerful thematic material. Equally effective is the yearning ""Andante tranquillo e cantabile,"" which features a ravishing lyrical violin melody and expressive arpeggiated piano writing. There's a degree of emotional depth here that presages Rntgen's later trios. In the final two movements, Rntgen develops melodic motifs from prior movements. The ""Moderato"" demonstrates to me just how fine a melodist Rntgen was. He knows how to write exciting and passionate music with almost neo-Baroque melodies relying on sequences for their impact. It works. His themes are striking even on a first hearing.Bottom line: Rntgen's piano trios are not merely mediocre items on par with say, Kiel, Fuchs, Reinecke, or Rheinberger. These are strong examples of serious Brahmsian chamber music, comparable in quality to that of Herzogenberg and Raff. All of his trios overflow with tuneful thematic material and expressive harmony. I think the fourth trio in G minor is the better work because of its dramatic activity and minor-key sobriety.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18PEAI5FQWPYZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004JQJFCK#wasThisHelpful","R18PEAI5FQWPYZ","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Elgar's great accomplishments in the realm of chamber music were all completed in the summer of 1917 during his stay at the secluded Brinkwells Cottage. There he penned the Piano Quintet, Violin Sonata, and String Quartet--all deeply personal minor-key works. The isolation of the cottage coupled with news of friends dying on the front colored the tone of these chamber works, which are serious, poignant, and introspective. Elgar's treatment of the instruments is surprisingly heavy and forceful, suggesting symphonic weight in sound that pushes the chamber texture to its sonic limits.The Violin Sonata in E minor, an exquisite work of its kind, is a full-blooded post-Brahmsian conception that attains orchestral sonorities. Elgar gives both parts equal significance, although frequently the piano takes on the drama, as evident in the first movement's coda, which unfurls as a rivulet of titanic chords. Apart from the gradually ascending climax, the second movement is quiet and contemplative, expressing tenderness and aching emotion through the violin lines. Brahms is evoked in the beautiful finale, rich with melody and sweltering passion. Overall, this is an excellent work, not quite at the level of Bridge's Violin Sonata, but certainly deserving of more attention.In the Piano Quintet, Elgar again strives for symphonic writing and gives the strings virtuosic and demanding parts that often carry the emotional gravity. Brahms is the major influence, which comes across most saliently in the first movement. Stentorian drama prevails in the first theme, but most remarkable is the powerful development section, a maelstrom of thick earth-shattering chords and cascading virtuosic writing for the strings. The Elgar who can move us to tears with Nimrod is also present in the slow movement, a heart-felt outpouring of pathos in which the strings carry the momentum.The Nash Ensemble has once again offered an astonishing performance with gripping urgency and immaculate dynamics. Ian Brown, the pianist, has recorded the Piano Quintet several times with other ensembles. His presence is commanding and matches the strings in all their vehemence and volume.Bottom line: The Piano Quintet is a significant work of dramatics and serious emotion that rewards repeated listenings. I would place it at the forefront of best English piano quintets in the literature, along with Bax, Bridge, and Vaughan Williams. The Violin Sonata probes similar emotional territory, although it doesn't have the lasting impression of the quintet.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D4VNKRRM85Y3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000002ZSL#wasThisHelpful","R3D4VNKRRM85Y3","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Alexander Tansman (1897-1986) assimilated many styles in vogue during the early 20th century: from late Romanticism and neo-classicism to French impressionism and modernism. I have found his music consistently uneven. Too much of it is derivative without offering fresh or memorable ideas. Tansman's expressive palette is elegant but emotionally detached and melody is not his strong suit. These works for violin and piano stretch across a wide period from 1918 to 1963. Virtually everything here is thoroughly shaded by the influence of Debussy, Ravel, and Stravinsky. ""Romance"" has a nostalgic air with ambiguous harmonies and cloudy impressionism, but Tansman doesn't have much melodic content to show. The Violin Sonata No. 2 begins with a schmaltzy and tepid opening movement that I have no desire to ever hear again. There's a Slavic Romantic flavor to the ""Andante espressivo"" and much more bite in the finale, which features thick chordal piano writing and Ravelian swirls of impressionist color. French modernism totally envelopes the ""Sonata una quasi fantasia,"" replete with bitonal colors, parallel 4ths, and changing meters recalling Stravinsky. I liked the hazy bleak impressionist mood of ""Andante"", but the finale is quite grating from its simpering optimism. Similarly, both Sonatinas are suffused in brightness, naivety, and mirth. One exceptional movement is the ""Andante cantabile"" of the Second Sonatina. This desolate polytonal piece possesses a fine lonely violin soliloquy with brittle piano chords aromatic of Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire.To my mind, the greatest work on this recording is the late Fantaisie (1963). Here Tansman abandons his gleeful insouciance and aims for greater depth of expression. His harmonic language is even more advanced, often bordering on atonality. Stravinsky's influence is still present, particularly in the first movement with its frantic pizzicato, dissonant clusters, and asymmetrical meter. Tansman manages to produce a dizzying combination of violin sonic effects and spiky piano colors. At times Tansman brushes shoulders with the German expressionists. For example, the ""Improvisazione"" and ""Finale"" are dark and mysterious and reminiscent of Berg. The ""Finale"" is compelling. It opens with dark tolling bass chords and unleashes waves of frenetic and agitated violin writing, which often sound microtonal to me.Bottom line: A half-hearted recommendation for fans of French modernism  la Stravinsky, Debussy, and Ravel. Only the Fantaisie and a few movements from the Violin Sonatas and Sonatinas appealed to me. I think Tansman is more successful in his solo piano music, even though much of that is passable, as well.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RIKNAVW7M5O4P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SCJIL6Q#wasThisHelpful","RIKNAVW7M5O4P","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I have found his music consistently uneven. Too much of it is derivative without offering fresh or memorable ideas. His expressive palette is elegant but emotionally detached and melody is not his strong suit. I'm giving this particular volume the benefit of the doubt because I enjoyed these miniatures purely for their sonorities and mood, which are primarily quiet and impressionist or mysterious in a late Scriabin mode. The performances by Danny Zelibor are meticulously dynamic and detailed, proving that Tansman's music sounds better than it really is by virtue of a nuanced interpretation.As a composer for the piano, Tansman is a miniaturist. Most of these pieces are 1-3 minutes in length and reveal the direct influence of Stravinsky, Debussy, Ravel, and Scriabin. Although the Piano Sonata No. 1 does live up to its subtitle ""Rustica"" with droning accompaniment and pastoral charm, it also bears the stamp of Ravel. Bitonal clashes of chords and colors, super impressionist scales, and jazzy rhythms in the finale are a testament to that. Tansman offers some surprising depth in the second movement, a desolate and emotionally affective work with a wistful melody and chromatic dissonance.Ravel and Stravinsky loom large over the remaining pieces, which fit into two types: fragile and mysterious impressionism or Stravinskyan modernism. ""Four Dance Miniatures"" and Book 1 of the ""Mazurkas"" feature elements of both. Several of the mazurkas are remarkable and held my interest, such as the haunting ""Moderato piu lento"" and ""Andante espressivo"", which sound like Alfredo Casella with ambiguous harmonies, delicate chords, and eerie lyricism. As much as these mazurkas are dances with asymmetrical meter, many are quiet and dream-like  la Debussy. Exceptions to this norm include the ""Etude Scherzo"", a rapid concert piece that explores many colors in the space of a minute.The ""7 Preludes"" traverse similar impressionist ground without the dance rhythms. I hear Casella again in the first of these preludes: a dreamy and languidly chromatic piece. Late Scriabinesque mystery is evoked in several others. The ""5 Impromptus"" are mostly exercises in harmonic color, ostinatos, and changing meter.Bottom line: You have to really enjoy early 20th century modernism and miniatures in general to appreciate Tansman. If you don't like Debussy, Ravel or Stravinsky, move on. Most of these pieces blend into each other after repeated listenings because they sound so similar. Yet I found Zelibor's playing hypnotic, especially of the mysterious and becalmed miniatures that can be admired simply for their sonorities.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JBGQCFLNJG1J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V872H78#wasThisHelpful","R2JBGQCFLNJG1J","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you like that brand of warm, lively, and unimposing chamber music without much depth, these two works are awash in delights. I don't find them impressive enough to revisit, however. I was hoping Stanford would employ a bit more drama and expressive edge. For that, one has to turn to Elgar, Bridge, or Ireland. With some exceptions (his Piano Quintet and 2nd Piano Trio), Stanford's chamber music is Brahms-lite with a jovial spirit. Too much of that goes a long way and he lacks the melodic richness of his compatriots, let alone other more successful emulators of Brahms on the continent.The Piano Trio in G minor (1899) is the best of this chamber pairing. It is a mature work and gripping mainly because of the slow movement, which so adeptly channels the sublime sorrow of a Beethoven adagio. This is as dark and introspective as Stanford gets and I wish he allowed this emotional feeling to bleed over into the outer movements. Beethoven's ghost appears again in the Scherzo movement, a rhythmically engaging and energetic little essay. The finale begins promisingly dark and ominous, but perhaps again like Beethoven, Stanford teases the audience and instead unfurls a sprightly rondo, occasionally passionate, but thoroughly light-hearted.The Piano Quartet in F major (1879) is less remarkable than the trio and often superficial. For all its felicity and buoyancy, there is a dearth of memorable melodies and interesting turns of harmony. The outer movements are joyful and triumphant, but rather dull and unfulfilling. Stanford proves himself skillful at writing academically in a vein Reinecke would have appreciated. But without appealing ideas and tension, Stanford doesn't make much of an impact on me. Only the ""Poco adagio"" movement has notable qualities about it: expressive heights of passion, darker anguished sections, and strong lyricism in the cello lines.Bottom line: These two chamber works are just OK. The G minor Piano Trio is the winner, while the earlier Piano Quartet suffers from mediocrity. Both are decidedly Brahmsian in flavor, diverting and jubilant in mood, and each contain strong slow movements. I can't understand why there's so much inspiration in these adagios, while the outer movements leave much to be desired.

"The reputation of Alexander Grechaninov (1864-1956) firmly resides in the field of liturgical music. He may have excelled at writing vocal and stage works, but I find his chamber music devoid of quality. Stylistically, it draws upon Tchaikovsky and Glazunov, but there's nothing memorable or compelling to encourage repeated listenings. This isn't bad music if you like subdued and quiet chamber music without much drama.I agree with Scott Morrison's assessment of Grechaninov's trios: ""neatly constructed, melodically undistinguished, and truthfully rather boring and complacent."" The ""Piano Trio in C minor"" begins inauspiciously restrained and timid. It's a slow movement without much melodic hook or expressive ventilation. With the second movement, Grechaninov strikes interesting ground. After a dramatic declamatory opening, promising an onslaught of intensity, he gives us a deceptively light menuetto theme, which is catchy and tinged with melancholy. Darker-hued bass writing lends the movement some gravity. The finale is cool and detached, featuring a nice solo cello cadenza, but the music is so meandering and dull. Not much improves in the ""Piano Trio in G major."" Even the liner notes can't say much about it except to chart its key changes in a drearily academic way. It's an active, but jumbled mess of ideas and melodically deficient. Boring in other words. Likewise, the second movement is sunny and amiable, but forgettable. One starves for harmonic sequences or motivic writing. A mild spark of talent emerges in the finale with interesting toccata piano writing and pizzicato activity.Grechaninov's ""Cello Sonata in E minor"" is an overall stronger work than the trios, but not by much. For once the composer lets loose some emotion and inspired part-writing. The first movement has a passionately agonized primary theme, although the lyrical second theme is hollow. Moving lyricism continues in the second movement, although I found the passionate crescendos that start and stop in an abortive fashion rather irritating. The finale is energetic right out of the starting gate with surges of intensity that promised much, but never delivered.Bottom line: Makes for decent background music for reading, but otherwise Grechaninov's piano trios are misfires. If you want strong Russian chamber music off the beaten path, seek out Taneyev's Piano Quintet, Lyapunov's Piano Sextet, Catoire's Piano Trio, and Sabaneyev's Piano Trios.

He may have excelled at writing vocal and stage works, but I find his chamber music devoid of quality. Stylistically, it draws upon Tchaikovsky and Glazunov, but there's nothing memorable or compelling to encourage repeated listenings. This isn't bad music if you like subdued and quiet chamber music without much drama.I agree with Scott Morrison's assessment of Grechaninov's trios: ""neatly constructed, melodically undistinguished, and truthfully rather boring and complacent."" The ""Piano Trio in C minor"" begins inauspiciously restrained and timid. It's a slow movement without much melodic hook or expressive ventilation. With the second movement, Grechaninov strikes interesting ground. After a dramatic declamatory opening, promising an onslaught of intensity, he gives us a deceptively light menuetto theme, which is catchy and tinged with melancholy. Darker-hued bass writing lends the movement some gravity. The finale is cool and detached, featuring a nice solo cello cadenza, but the music is so meandering and dull. Not much improves in the ""Piano Trio in G major."" Even the liner notes can't say much about it except to chart its key changes in a drearily academic way. It's an active, but jumbled mess of ideas and melodically deficient. Boring in other words. Likewise, the second movement is sunny and amiable, but forgettable. One starves for harmonic sequences or motivic writing. A mild spark of talent emerges in the finale with interesting toccata piano writing and pizzicato activity.Grechaninov's ""Cello Sonata in E minor"" is an overall stronger work than the trios, but not by much. For once the composer lets loose some emotion and inspired part-writing. The first movement has a passionately agonized primary theme, although the lyrical second theme is hollow. Moving lyricism continues in the second movement, although I found the passionate crescendos that start and stop in an abortive fashion rather irritating. The finale is energetic right out of the starting gate with surges of intensity that promised much, but never delivered.Bottom line: Makes for decent background music for reading, but otherwise Grechaninov's piano trios are misfires. If you want strong Russian chamber music off the beaten path, seek out Taneyev's Piano Quintet, Lyapunov's Piano Sextet, Catoire's Piano Trio, and Sabaneyev's Piano Trios. Even Anton Rubinstein's Piano Trios are better than this.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24JEO6QTUZIAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BGA1CSM#wasThisHelpful","R24JEO6QTUZIAR","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mark Bebbington, a major proponent of British piano music, has unearthed two obscure piano sonatas, but only the Hurlstone is a gem. The death of William Hurlstone (1876-1906) may have robbed Britain of a promising young composer. It is difficult to gauge how much of an impact he would have made, but his Piano Concerto and chamber music reveal admirable qualities. I don't think he was quite the budding genius as suggested by Vaughan Williams and Stanford. The music world suffered a greater loss from the premature deaths of Stanchinsky, Lekeu, Reubke, and Tausig. However, the Hurlstone sonata is his best solo piano work; the Capriccio is another worthy piece which can be heard on Toccata Classics.Hurlstone's ""Piano Sonata in F minor"" is spawned from the mold of Schumann and Brahms. The first movement has all the requisite elements of a good Sonata-Allegro: well-wrought serious and lyrical themes with an engaging development and dramatic coda. It is the second movement, heavily steeped in Wagner and Brahms, that impressed me most. Hurlstone exhibits startling expressive depth and passion with a central section of real power and emotion. Had he continued writing like this, he would have made a great mark in the British music world. The robust finale features massive Brahmsian chords and Schumannesque kinetic energy. Note that Bebbington plays much slower than Kenji Fujimura on Toccata Classics. This really works well in the slow movement with its drooping chromaticism and profound Wagnerian lines. Bebbington takes his time with every delicate line and milks each note for expressive effect. Fujimura is faster and more devil-may-care with his bravura, which is a legitimate and exciting approach, too.Benjamin Dale (1885-1943), on the other hand, is a composer I could have happily remained ignorant. I agree with the other reviewer's astutely and succinctly phrased assessment of the Sonata as being ""more perspiration than inspiration."" I marvel at the attention and praise it got in the press and even in William Newman's Sonata Since Beethoven; Newman devotes a couple pages of analysis to it. What is interesting about Dale's 40-minute Sonata is that it's structurally unique. Three of the movements--the adagio, scherzo, and finale--are conceived at a macro level as a gigantic Theme and Variations. Beyond that, I don't see what's so original or gripping that York Bowen would show deference to it. This is syrupy salon Romantic music alright, but it's way too sprawling and vacuous, lacking depth and strong melodic content in equal measure. In the first movement, Dale is obnoxiously sentimental, piling loads of sugary schmaltz onto Rachmaninovian piano writing. Between the wistful second movement and incoherent scherzo, I noticed a scarcity of interesting ideas. Only in the Finale does Dale deliver some fresh moments of Lisztian bravura and incandescent pianism of enormous technical difficulty.Bottom line: Hurlstone's Piano Sonata is not ground-breaking, but it's a fine work of Brahmsian trappings; the slow movement is sumptuous. Bebbington's performance, while markedly slower, displays a degree of nuance not communicated by Fujimura. I can only look askance at the Dale Sonata, which for all its superficial bluster and gargantuan length, left me cold.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10B6I00265T9R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003NVWKVU#wasThisHelpful","R10B6I00265T9R","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The death of William Hurlstone (1876-1906) may have robbed Britain of a promising young composer. His best compositions are the fine Piano Concerto, Piano Quartet, and Piano Trio. Hurlstone is not quite the budding genius as suggested by Vaughan Williams and Stanford. The music world suffered a greater loss from the premature deaths of Stanchinsky, Lekeu, Reubke, and Tausig. Hurlstone is not in their league. While this recording of his complete piano music is nice for completists, the quality is extremely uneven.As much as the liner notes wishes to convince us that these pieces are not mediocre juvenilia, many of them do betray a navet of youth. The Five Easy Waltzes, for example, were written when Hurlstone was just 9 and are curiosities at best. Compared to Korngold's preadolescent works, they are decidedly below the level of trifles. The Sketches are similarly innocuous, displaying Hurlstone's momentary fascination with all things classical in aesthetic. Indeed, most are cheerful Mozartian dances; cute and light-hearted. The ""Hungarian Air with Variations"" has Brahmsian vitality and gestures, but lacks expressive invention and variety. The ""Demon's Dance"" is more interesting, sounding like an Alkan esquisse with its quirky gurgling bass figure. Of the transcriptions, the Heller Tarantelle is the most striking. Confident and energetic, it has a memorable climbing melody and imaginative harmony. With the Five Miniatures, Hurlstone improves himself. These are all charming and possess fetching melodic ideas. 'La Simplicite' was a favorite of Hurlstone's to play in concert, but I liked the fifth 'Alla Mazurka' for its successful emulation of a Chopin waltz.Hurlstone's best solo piano works are the ""Capriccio in B minor"" and the ""Piano Sonata in F minor."" The Capriccio is an effective concert piece, brimming with full-blooded Brahmsian sonorities and rhythmic drive. The material alternates between lilting repose and extroverted drama; the last minute of the piece is a fiery cadenza of great bravura. Hurlstone manifestly poured his best ideas into the Piano Sonata, which is clothed in the accoutrements of Schumann and Brahms. The first movement has all the requisite elements of a good Sonata-Allegro: well-wrought serious and lyrical themes with an engaging development and dramatic coda. In the second movement, heavily steeped in Brahms, Hurlstone exhibits startling expressive depth and passion with a central section of real power and emotion. Had he continued writing like this, he would have made a great mark in the British music world. The finale is more in line with Schumann: fast, energetic, and urgent.Kenji Fujimura generates tremendous sonorities and plays the Sonata much faster than Mark Bebbington, who first recorded it. I don't know which is the more appropriate interpretation, but Fujimura's passion and momentum made a greater impression on me. If you're interested in Hurlstone's Piano Sonata, this is the better recording because Fujimura plays so well and I didn't find much value in Benjamin Dale's Sonata, which is coupled with Hurlstone's on the Bebbington recording.Bottom line: I have to be honest and say that most of these pieces are pleasant juvenilia without much substance. However, the Capriccio and Sonata are excellent specimens of British Romantic piano music influenced by Schumann and Brahms.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 28, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1DOHDPPP79H6X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V872JSU#wasThisHelpful","R1DOHDPPP79H6X","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Judging by these piano works and some of his chamber music, Karl Weigl (1881-1949) is deservedly marginalized as a composer. What I've heard of his music--I can't speak for his orchestral output--sounds conservative, melodically stale, and lacking in creativity. Except for the ""Isle of the Dead"" and some of the Night Fantasies, these pieces are benign and forgettable. In a way, the opening Six Fantasies (1942) are a sad testament to a failed composer. They were written after Weigl fled Nazi-occupied Austria and emigrated to the United States. None of these amount to anything special or beyond the tonal territory of Schumann, Brahms, or Pfitzner. The third ""Remembrance"" has some melancholic depth and there's heightened chromaticism and passion in the ""Capriccio."" It is not surprising that Weigl couldn't make a name for himself in the States after publishing these trifles. Similarly, most of the Pictures and Tales (1909), an early set of miniatures, are buoyant but unremarkable. However, I liked ""Once Upon a Time"" for its lovely theme over a dreamy and magical accompaniment. This piece works, but my high hopes for the rest of the cycle were dashed. ""Dance of the Furies"" (1938) is disappointing, too. Despite the inventive rhythm and dissonant colors, it doesn't offer much drama or excitement.With the Night Fantasies (1911), Weigl shows some talent. I wish he had continued composing in this vein of serious nocturnal brooding and daring chromaticism. ""Langsam"" is quite good: anxious, dark, and stormy arpeggios underlining very expressive harmonic progressions. Likewise, ""Unruhig, dransend"" has the indelible stamp of late Liszt: dark rumbling bass sonorities, anxious chromaticism and palpable tension. ""Zart bewegt"" continues the severity of the previous pieces and has a Slavic temperament. Weigl's best work is the ""Isle of the Dead"" (1903). Like Rachmaninov, Weigl was inspired by one of Bocklin's paintings of the same name. Many qualities are revealed in this 13-minute work, although it's not as effective as Rachmaninov's. It opens quietly and in a fit of despondence with piano writing confined to the lower registers. This moody and somber piece doesn't evoke Charon's oars for me, unlike Rachmaninov's, but there is a haunted atmosphere to it with intense Wagnerian climaxes that I enjoyed.Unlike the other reviewer, I have no qualms with Joseph Banowetz's interpretations. The problem is the uninspired music, not the performer.Bottom line: I think my 3-star rating is fair because more than half of these piano pieces are unremarkable and I'll never listen to them again. Yet there are two very good works here: the ""Isle of the Dead"" and the ""Night Fantasies."" I recommend them to those who enjoy serious and chromatic music resembling late Liszt, Mahler, and early Schoenberg. Everything else is in a conservative Romantic style and has few redeeming features.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34ZCHSMPKSXAR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007WB5CKI#wasThisHelpful","R34ZCHSMPKSXAR","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Afshin Jaberi (b. 1973) won't be familiar to many of us in the West. I don't know about his reputation elsewhere. What he offers through his compositions shows promise, but not the kind of substance and expressive ideas I'd revisit again. Stylistically, he strives for an East-meets-West aesthetic: a tonal framework of Chopin, Liszt, and Rachmaninov with Middle Eastern inflections and modal scales. There are some fine moments of rich sonorous piano writing and passion, but Jaberi's melodic and harmonic ideas are a little stale. Only a couple movements from his sonatas piqued my interest. I think the problem is Jaberi's insistence on safe and conventional Romanticism without much dissonant bite. I also wonder if he's all that capable of generating majestic or awe-inspiring music based on his Bah' faith. Even if that's where he gets his inspiration, it's not communicated very well. Liszt could produce a dramatic and profound portrait of St. Francis of Assisi through musical suggestion. Jan Niederle does it also with his stunning Piano Sonata based on St. Francis. But I had a flat reaction to Jaberi's evocations of The Bb, the founder of the Bah' religion.The First Sonata ""The Seeker"" is a good effort, passionately neo-Romantic with thick writing, but the melodic ideas are wanting. It's a little bit like watered-down Chopin and Rachmaninov. I'll grant the second movement has a lovely theme. In the third movement, there is also a fine amalgam of Middle Eastern colors and Lisztian arpeggiations and block chords. The Second Sonata ""The Path to Peace"" was a disappointment. Described as an expression of the horrors of war, the opening movement is not convincing. I expected something intense, dark, and powerful. Jaberi doesn't express anything remotely close to that. I suppose the rest of the sonata is a message of hope, but it is awfully maudlin and New Agey. The Third Sonata ""The Bedouin"" fares a little better but is mostly generic Romanticism by-the-numbers. Only the second movement shows some inspiration; it's darker, serious, and has appealing harmonic sequences. The final movement is strangely Bluesy and improvisatory.The Ballades are of lesser quality than the Sonatas, which doesn't bode well. Each has a dramatic subtitle that the music fails to evoke. These Ballades are quite improvisatory in nature, with chaotic ideas, rambling passages, and not much strength in melody or harmonic interest. The ""Eroica"" Ballade features lots of activity, stentorian chords, and impressionist whirls of notes, but little depth. Some odd choices of embellishment and passagework confused me, like the vapid simultaneous ascending and descending chromatic scale for no apparent reason.Bottom line: Fans of boisterous and sentimental neo-Romanticism may like this music. Jaberi occasionally stumbles onto charming and compelling ideas. I liked the First Sonata and the slow movement of the Third; I'll give him that. But his emotional sensibility is too histrionic and sanguine for me. His sense of pictorial narrative is not persuasive and neither are his melodic lines very special. There are so many better composers out there writing powerful and electrifying neo-Romantic piano music: Carl Vine, Heather Schmidt, Stephane Blet, Jan Niederle, John Pickard, and Lera Auerbach.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16EJVLKXPFTQD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U0S0NS6#wasThisHelpful","R16EJVLKXPFTQD","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When asked to name the best pianists of his generation, Rachmaninov replied ""Well, there's Hofmann and there's me."" Though widely acknowledged as one of the greatest pianists of all time, few realize Josef Hofmann composed. He left behind a modest oeuvre of piano music extending roughly to opus 60. Artem Yasynskyy recorded a volume of Hofmann's piano music, which complements this one. A couple Hofmann pieces appeared on the great Kaleidoscope recording by Marc-Andre Hamelin, which I highly recommend. The trouble with Hofmann's piano music is that's so uneven, which is why it's usually scattered across recital programs or recordings of piano rolls.Quite surprising for a pianist of Godowskyan technique, many of Hofmann's early pieces sound conventionally Romantic and no more adventurous than Schumann and Liszt. ""Ungarish"" and ""Polnisch"" are of average salon stock written when Hofmann was very young. The ""Impromptu"" stands out for its rippling Schumanessque figurations and melodic dash. There is also a startling sequence of flurries that sound reminiscent of Alkan's ""Scherzo diabolico."" I had high hopes for Hofmann's preludes, but only a couple have merit, particularly the dramatic A minor and dark E minor, the latter being the best of the set; a memorable elegy of throbbing pathos and Lisztian gestures. As for the ""Valse Caprice,"" it may be a mature work with a lovely Johann Straussian tune, but it is wholly innocuous salon material.Later on Hofmann's compositions would incorporate impressionist colors and display greater sophistication. The four ""Character Sketches"", for example, deserve revival in the concert hall. The opening 'Vision' has the flavor of Rachmaninov and early Scriabin. Suffused with rich and luminous washes of delicate arpeggiation, this is hyper-impressionism with remarkable depth. 'Nenien' is Slavic in character with a somber melody supported by a gentle arpeggiated accompaniment. 'Kaleidoscop' is a miniature masterpiece with astonishing piano writing and dazzling colors. Dedicated to Godowsky, the piece has all the technical demands and vigor of an etude. Busy and dramatic flurries of figurations surround a ravishing Lisztian theme. This is how you write an exciting concert piece. Biasini's performance is adequate, but not as satisfying as Yasynskyy's or Hamelin's. Her rhythm is rigid, mechanical, and her sonorities lack resonance. Hamelin's is the best performance, achieving a perfect tempo and grandeur that surpasses the others.The two ""Impressions"" are outstanding and need to be heard more often as encores. The first lives up to its subtitle ""L'Orient et l'Occiden,"" featuring an exotic pentatonic melody and sonorous impressionism redolent of Debussy's Sunken Cathedral. More famous is the second Impression ""The Sanctuary"", a great piece of virtuosity and etude-like writing characterized by Ravelian figurations and a passionate Rachmaninovian melodic line. This is the kind of piece that can sound too ""notey"" in the wrong hands and it needs full-blooded passion. Biasini does her best, but her persistent staccato touch and stilted rhythm detract a little from the aural experience. I prefer Hofmann's own recording and piano roll, but we need someone like Hamelin to do this piece justice.Bottom line: Hofmann's ""Character Pieces"" are gems and should be encores in the standard repertoire. I prefer the more intense performances and fluid rhythms of Artem Yasynskyy. The two Impressions are Hofmann's finest jewels, but the interpretations are wanting. Hofmann's own playing of ""The Sanctuary"" is far superior to what Biasini does with it. The remaining content is nice to have, all world-premiere recordings, but much of it uneven. Therefore, this is a half-hearted recommendation for completists. Kaleidoscope and Yasynskyy's volume are the better alternatives.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KUGTNE6ORV0G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000F1IOB6#wasThisHelpful","R2KUGTNE6ORV0G","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The lush arpeggios and dramatic arc bear kinship with Rachmaninov and especially Liszt. At times, the music so completely echoes Liszt that it sounds like it came from the Years of Pilgrimage. Hofmann's ""Piano Sonata in F major"" is an early work thoroughly tinged with the influence of Schumann. Its textures and structure are transparent and classical. Nothing too fascinating here, but the second movement is an enjoyable perpetuum mobile in which the styles of Beethoven and Schumann coalesce. The finale is lighthearted with rondo episodes having more in common with Liszt's bravura than Schumann.The ""Theme with Variations & Fugue"" is less impressive than I hoped, even though nothing about it suggests the authorship of a 16-year-old. Frankly, it is not that striking. Hofmann is restrained, quiet, and lyrical, but there's not much variation in the mood or texture. The fugue is extroverted and interesting, but far too short. Likewise, the three Chopinesque mazurkas are slight and forgettable, although the D minor has superior melodic ideas.Bottom line: Hofmann's ""Character Pieces"" are gems and should be encores in the standard repertoire. The Etude for Left Hand is also spectacular and highly effective. The rest is of lesser worth, although agreeable listening if you like Schumann and Liszt. If you haven't heard Hamelin's Kaleidoscope, listen to that first. If you like what you hear, seek out Hofmann playing his other wonderful piece ""The Sanctuary."" For those torn between Artem Yasynskyy and Fabiana Biasini, I'll just point out that Yasynskyy is more passionate and rhythmically fluid.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWDF1MWYH0YJN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V872I72#wasThisHelpful","RWDF1MWYH0YJN","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BIS has made it their quest to record the output of Finnish composer Kalevi Aho (b. 1949), who has garnered much acclaim in Europe. The bulk of his compositions are large-scale symphonies and concerti, so this present release of short piano pieces is a surprise. Unless the works list in New Grove's is incomplete, this recording contains all of Aho's solo piano works to date. A wide contrast of styles are on display here. The 19 Preludes are as tonal and gushingly Romantic as Schumann and Liszt while the atonal Solo II and Piano Sonata bear kinship with Sorabji and Corigliano. Quite a traversal of aesthetic growth.Aho's Nineteen Preludes (1965-68) are an impressive set of neo-Romantic miniatures. It is astounding to realize that these are student works, some written when he was just 16. Each are consistently imaginative and mature, exhibiting a variety of moods, textures, and technical difficulties. Some (1, 3, 14) dwell in a lovely realm of warmth and lyricism, redolent of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words. Others (4, 7, 10) have the pianistic excitement and dramatic verve of Schumann and Liszt. Aho adopts Bachian counterpoint in nos. 13 and 16, the latter being conspicuously modeled on a Bach invention. Then there's a couple highly expressive preludes of a gloomy disposition. No. 5 marked ""Grave"" sounds like late Liszt, possessing a haunting oscillating chromatic figure, stern tritones, and menacing lower bass writing. No. 17 is special: modern, troubled, and frightening in its evocation of a nightmare. The labyrinthine chromaticism suggests a spiraling anxiety and feelings of being trapped; so effective and feverish, it reminds me of Feinberg's morbid Scriabinesque pieces.Although constituting less than four minutes of music altogether, the Three Small Piano Pieces (1971) are not trifles. They are atonal, severe, and expressionist. The 2-minute ""Maestoso"" piece packs a lot of punch with its booming bass sonorities and accumulation of drama. ""Tranquillo"" is a hypnotic Feldmanesque dreamworld, highly chromatic and mysterious; a perfect distillation of music in the space of a minute. How effective can a 33-second piece be? Aho demonstrates just how in the outer ""Maestoso"", a fast and violent volcanic outburst of expressionism, tritones, and chromatic intensity. ""Wow"" was my reaction after hearing it. The Sonatina (1993) is another disarmingly powerful work, fully atonal with tone clusters and shocks of dissonance. Rich sonorities and frenzied energy infuse the outer movements, the last of which has Bartokian rhythmic bite.I happen to think the Solo II (1985) is Aho's greatest piano work, although pianist Sonja Frki reserves that judgment for the Sonata. This is serious and tough music of fiendish difficulty, boasting some astonishing passages of evocative Romantic gestures and pianistic activity. Indeed, Aho ratchets up the piano writing with cascading swirls of notes and sonorous textures requiring a level of strength, stamina, and alacrity that would confound many concert pianists. If I had to make aesthetic comparisons, I hear Corigliano's Etude Fantasy, Ronald Stevenson, George Flynn, and towards the end Messiaen. The Sonata (1980) inhabits the same soundworld as Solo II, but this time incorporates Sorabjian arpeggios, glissandi, and violent tone clusters, all utilized in an aim for expression and not merely sonic effect. Messiaen is recalled again in the final movement, which slowly fades into mysterious higher registers and whispering trills.This is my first encounter with Sonja Frki, but she is one to watch: a virtuoso with a faultless technique and expressive range. She handles the variegated features of Aho's piano music with commanding facility, from the emotional and lyrical content of the preludes to the cerebral and technical complexity of the Piano Sonata. BIS sound engineering is always impeccable and some would argue the best around today.Bottom line: I can see why MusicWeb International made this their 'Recording of the Month.' I haven't even heard Aho's orchestral music, but I can tell from these piano works that he's a first-class composer. There's not a dull piece on here. The 19 Preludes will appeal to fans of neo-Romantic piano music in the tradition of Chopin, Schumann, and Liszt. Those who like Berg, Prokofiev, and Bartok will enjoy his Small Pieces and Sonatina. The Solo II and Piano Sonata are his best works: atonal but accessible, very intense, and arresting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUB0XQLXDIC10/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OYKL1DC#wasThisHelpful","RUB0XQLXDIC10","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Adolf Jensen (1837-1879) had a glowing reputation for lyricism. Perhaps that was evident in his nearly 200 songs, but judging from these piano works, he had no better facility with lyricism than Raff, Scharwenka, or Anton Rubinstein. And they were better composers. For me, Jensen is on the lower end of mediocrity. His piano pieces are all innocuous and inhabit a pan-European Romantic soundworld that incorporates Schumann, Chopin, and Liszt. But they don't have any outstanding features or memorable content, aside from the Deutsche Suite, which I'll get to later. Most of this is ear popcorn: pleasant and occasionally enjoyable, but unfulfilling. This is the best summation of Jensen's worth I've read: ""[He] was essentially a song-writer; his musical expression seldom reached great emotional heights, and yet there was so much charm and delicacy in his conceptions."" (from the preface of a 1915 edition of Galatea)I like the idea of Erotikon, a suite of pieces based on erotic quotations from Greek mythology. However, the music is underwhelming and seems to have very little relation to the titles. ""Elektra,"" for example, is baffling in its restraint and ordinary Romantic mood. No angst or turmoil to be found, whereas the symbolists always appropriated the darker themes of her tragedy. ""Kassandra"" and ""Kypris"" are rather muted in effect. I expected more passion and sensual abandon here. ""Eros"" is better because there's palpable drama and extroverted activity. ""Die Zauberin"" is the best of the lot for its effective fusion of Schumannesque poetry with a serious Lisztian attitude.The Deutsche Suite is a much more interesting work. Here Jensen shows talent for composing in an energetic and entirely neo-Baroque fashion. The ""Courante"" is brimming with fetching melodic content and vitality. The ""Sarabande"" is suffused with Bachian poignancy and noble expression; this is Jensen's best effort. There's also an admirable quality in the ""Gigue"" with fugal writing that sounds like Bach or Handel transcribed by a Romantic.Reger's arrangements of three songs didn't stand out for me enough to comment. I'm not sure what he saw in them. Only the first of the two Romanzes struck me as something special, revealing depth, inspired melody, and pianistic figurations redolent of Liszt and Thalberg.As always, Toccata Classics offers the most substantial liner notes after the Altarus label. This time, however, the notes are laden with academic music analysis that only readers with five semesters of music theory will understand.Bottom line: This isn't bad music; it's just not likely to encourage repeated listenings. Godowsky provided fingerings for an edition of Erotikon, so I'm sure pianists (and singers) have found value in some of Jensen's output, but as a listener, I'm unmoved. Only the neo-Baroque spirit of the Deutsche Suite grabbed my attention. A couple of the Erotikon pieces and the first Romanze also have merit. This recording is for collectors of third-tier piano literature. All others should first explore Raff, Rubinstein, Henselt, and Heller.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 21, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1FSWX4O6YOSRB/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V872J6C#wasThisHelpful","R1FSWX4O6YOSRB","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Here is an unusual and welcome program of music for violin and piano by two major figures of the Soviet avant-garde of the 1920s. Grigori Krein (1879-1955) is not as well-known as his brother, Alexander, but was a prominent member of the New Jewish School that emerged in Russia. Krein studied briefly under Reger, but found no inspiration from the German pedagogue; evidently, he often galled Reger during classes. Instead he found his path following the footsteps of Scriabin.Krein's 20-minute Violin Sonata (1913) is a rapturous and sublime specimen of Scriabinesque effusions and ecstatic harmonies. Both piano and violin are equally important; take one away and the music still works. The opening ""Andante"" is a slow burn of mystic tension and languid chromaticism, awash with a sultry decadent atmosphere reminiscent of Roslavets. The movement leads right into the second, a much faster and lengthier allegro. Tritones, flutters of trills, and lush swirls of colors suggest at times Vers la Flamme. There's a strong melodic drive and rhythmic interest, too, that makes this sonata worth revisiting. This is Scriabinesque chamber music done right. The Poeme (1921) is in the same lavish soundworld minus the dark intensity of the sonata. Here post-Romantic lyricism and lush violin writing prevails; it's similar in style to Szymanowski and Catoire. I won't say much about the two short Pieces on Yakutian Themes. These slight and rather pointless works are sad examples of how socialist realism can neuter a composer's creativity.Connoisseurs of Russian modernists should be familiar with the music of Samuil Feinberg (1890-1962), whose piano sonatas are just a peg below the quality of Scriabin's. Yet most pianophiles think of him solely as a pianist and transcriber. By the time he composed his Violin Sonata No. 2 (1955), he had already succumbed to the hammer blows of socialist realism. This recording does not acknowledge that Feinberg wrote an earlier violin sonata, which was published as an ""Allegro and scherzo"" (1922). I would much rather hear that, although to be fair, Feinberg was so talented that even his conservative works have glimmers of import. This violin sonata is like a 5-movement suite. It opens with a neo-Baroque ""Prelude"" with slow contrapuntal activity, which has flashes of brilliance and showcases Feinberg's penchant for density and nervous harmony. The ""Intermezzo"" is a delectable little piece of melancholy, featuring a lovely violin theme. Only in the fourth movement does Feinberg assert his old self. It is packed with melodic energy, dramatic piano writing, and gestures one can hear in his piano sonatas. Then in the final ""Epilog"", Feinberg gets weird on us with an incoherent mish-mash of ideas. It starts out in a mood of disquietude and then erupts into buoyant exuberance. Out of nowhere a simply gorgeous violin line breaks through, followed by a turbulent and agitated conclusion. A schizophrenic finale to say the least.I am always impressed by the performances of Michael Schafer and Ilona-Then Bergh, who are one of the finest violin and piano duos recording today. Each have a remarkable command of technique and expressive power. They also have an affinity for the Scriabinesque, which is demonstrated over and over. I must shamelessly promote their recording of Leonid Sabaneyev's piano trios, the last of which I believe ranks among the greatest piano trios of the 20th century.Bottom line: Krein's Violin Sonata is a significant work brimming with languorous and feverish sonorities; a rewarding discovery for fans of Scriabin, Roslavets, and Szymanowski. Feinberg's is also interesting but uneven and not likely to impress those already familiar with his piano music.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R41R734YV39MO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004TNZVOE#wasThisHelpful","R41R734YV39MO","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The great Violin Sonata and Piano Quintet notwithstanding, it is easy to forget that Cesar Franck wrote other exceptional pieces of chamber music. His piano trios as a whole have been relatively neglected and high-caliber performances of them are hard to come by. If you're interested in acquiring a single recording of Franck's piano trios, I recommend the Trio Novanta performance, which is more fiery and intense. However, this 2-volume Chandos series with the Bekova sisters is a close second.Coming off the heels of the highly dramatic and dark first piano trio, Franck's second Piano Trio in B-flat major (1841) is less interesting. Its major key and subtitle ""Trio de salon"" implies something more frivolous, but that's not altogether true; there's some depth and the occasional passionate climax. While the work is lighter and a little nave, there's nothing wrong with its warmth and elegance, especially when good melodies are on display. I particularly enjoyed the second movement, in which the cello and violin take turns carrying a strong lyrical line above a waltzing piano accompaniment. The Bekova sisters are masterful at shaping phrases and infuse the trio with infectious energy.With the Piano Trio No. 3 in B minor, Franck returns to the turbulent soundscape of his first trio. Passion and urgency reign supreme here. The opening movement is thoroughly riveting, containing a wealth of ideas and strong thematic material. Pronounced tension and rich sonorous piano writing add to the drama. The second movement features a stunningly beautiful theme marked by tenderness and a sad nostalgia, which is disrupted by a central section march of gleeful character; a very catchy little march, by the way. The finale possesses some remarkably thick piano writing and rhythmic drive, touching on a variety of moods, at first sober and meditative and ultimately triumphant and defiant.Franck's last Piano Trio, ostensibly No. 4 in B minor, was originally the finale of his third trio, which would have been colossal in scale as a result. At the behest of Liszt, who felt the 18-minute movement was too long, Franck published it as a separate piano trio in its own right. I disagree with this decision and like to think of it as the true finale to the third trio. At any rate, this single-movement trio is comprised of many sections of contrasting moods, from lyrical warmth and introspection to Alkan-like perpetuum mobile and tempestuous Lisztian passages. This is essentially a Beethovenian voyage from darkness to light.Bottom line: These are three engaging piano trios, barely known to even chamber enthusiasts. The minor-key trios are the most gripping, each having memorable content and exciting harmonic turns. The Bekova sisters are a formidable ensemble on par with and often surpassing the Trio Novanta's performances of Franck's trios.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHJR6OZ9IWSKP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00000JINW#wasThisHelpful","RHJR6OZ9IWSKP","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The great Violin Sonata and Piano Quintet notwithstanding, it is easy to forget that Cesar Franck wrote other exceptional pieces of chamber music. His piano trios as a whole have been relatively neglected and high-caliber performances of them are hard to come by. If you're interested solely in acquiring a recording of Franck's piano trios, I recommend the Trio Novanta performance, which is overall superior. A close second would be the Bekova sisters on Chandos (Vol. 1, Vol. 2). With that said, this present recording is still enjoyable and offers two of Franck's early works for violin and piano, both of solid quality.Despite its relative obscurity, Franck's Piano Trio No. 1 in F-sharp minor should be in the standard repertoire. It easily outclasses the more famous trios of Smetana and Chausson. I can't understand why this trio has been recorded so infrequently. Take it from D'Indy: ""With its budding genius, this trio marks an epoch in the history of musical evolution."" Composed in 1841 when Franck was just 19, the trio is a weighty and passionate affair, exhibiting expressive momentum, stormy passages, and engaging thematic material. Quite remarkable for its date, the trio is cyclical at a time when cyclic form was only hinted at by Beethoven and not crystallized yet by Liszt in his B minor sonata. The trio opens rather ominously with a foreboding staccato motto theme, which should be as famous and recognizable as any classical tune. The first movement is an exercise in a slow boil of intensity that gradually builds until exploding with tempestuous outbursts and virtuosic piano writing. The second scherzo movement overflows with toe-tapping rhythms and engaging activity. In the final movement, Franck delivers a wallop of power and drive with a rolling piano accompaniment, soaring violin lines, chromatic octaves, and a forceful return of the motto theme. It is no wonder Liszt loved the work. Note that the performers take a slower pace and lack urgency and dynamic risk-taking. Trio Novanta plays with more fire and wild abandon, especially in the piano part.Coming off the heels of that first piano trio, Franck's second Piano Trio in B-flat major (1841) lacks potency. Its major key and subtitle ""Trio de salon"" and implies something more frivolous, but that's not altogether true. While the work is warm, elegant, and boasts good melodies, there are some degrees of depth and the occasional passionate climax. I particularly enjoyed the second movement, in which the cello and violin take turns carrying a strong lyrical line above a waltzing piano accompaniment. Here I think the performers do just fine, although Trio Novanta and the Bekova sisters are better-equipped at shaping phrases.The remaining pieces for violin and piano are delightful. The rarely-recorded ""Grand Fantasy on themes from Dalayrac's Gulistan"" is worth hearing if you like operatic fantasies. Franck selects a couple fetching themes from Gulistan, an 18th century opera by the totally obscure Nicolas Dalayrac (1753-1809). This 12-minute fantasy features lovely violin lines and an extroverted piano part with tremolos, arpeggios, and stern chords. The Andantino Quietoso (1843) is a major step-up in quality. Although an early work, it foreshadows Franck's later spiritual preoccupations. This tender and moving piece exhibits strong thematic material and a loftier degree of serious expression, with profound harmonies and a great agonized yearning in the violin line. This is just exquisite violin music.Bottom line: While Trio Novanta and the Bekova sisters offer better performances of the first Franck trio, the present recording is very satisfying. Of particular value are the two violin and piano works, especially the Andantino Quietoso.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1JNFRTOUTXXHX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007RTMCIK#wasThisHelpful","R1JNFRTOUTXXHX","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Yevhen Stankovych (b. 1942) is a Ukrainian composer closely aligned with the Soviet avant-garde of the 1960s and 70s, which included Silvestrov, Schnittke, Gubaidulina, and Denisov. Judging from these three symphonies, Stankovych deserves to be listed with that group. His music is not as great as Schnittke's, but there's a similarity of expressive palette, consistently dark and serious, evoking a bleak and troubled world.The Symphony No. 1 'Sinfonia Larga' (1973) is scored for 15 string soloists and has all the aesthetic trappings of Ligeti and Penderecki: tone clusters, glissandi, polyphonic layers of humming and shrieking strings, and ethereal sonorities of sweltering colors. Although atonal, the music has a tragic, introspective, and horrified air about it, like Penderecki's Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima. Yet it's not as discordant and harsh on the ears as this. Despite the clusters of sound, Stankovych creates a texture of neo-Baroque polyphony over a pedal point in which many shifts in harmony occur. The strings carry intense and haunting melodic lines that help make this powerful single-movement symphony rewarding on repeated listenings. Somewhat similar in idiom is the 26-minute Symphony No. 4 'Sinfonia Lirica' (1977), again scored for strings and composed as a single-movement work. Here Stankovych aims for a post-Bergian expressionist tonal soundworld, somewhat comparable to Schnittke; not quite astringently atonal, but certainly pushing the tonal boundaries to an extreme. Once again, Stankovych achieves his tremendous emotional tension and colors through layers of chromatic lines, pedal points, and clusters of chords. This is dark and uneasy music with broad melodic lines, painful and moving in their expressivity, which the liner notes compares to ""Scriabin's mellow lyricism.""Less compelling for my tastes, but not bad by any measure, is the Symphony No. 2 ""Heroic"", which diverges significantly from the others. Cast in three movements, it is scored for full orchestra, features a prominent percussion section with snare drums, and even a piano. The symphony was written as an anti-war protest and the opening movement has a more declamatory and extroverted character, although it is still disturbed and angst-ridden. The highlight of the symphony is the second movement, in my view. Conceived as a requiem for the war dead, it opens with actual tolling bells and sustains a creepy quietude, interrupted by lyrical woodwind and brass solos and sudden waves of grief in the strings. The terse 3-minute third movement provides an apocalyptic capstone to the whole work; surely this is a commentary on the nature of man and his doomed propensity for war.Bottom line: The First and Fourth Symphonies for strings are gripping and powerful pieces of music, full of anxiety, horror, and tension. If you like Ligeti and early Penderecki, you'll really enjoy them. Compared to these, the Second 'Heroic' Symphony is more dramatic and violent, although the profound central movement is a respite of quiet melancholy. Lovers of Penderecki or Soviet avant-garde orchestral music need not hesitate.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1CL3EV4BZSEXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00NWZITA8#wasThisHelpful","R1CL3EV4BZSEXY","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mykola Lysenko (1842-1912) is said to be the father of Ukrainian classical music and a leading proponent of the instrumental dumka genre. I think Lysenko is more interesting from a musicological point of view. His achievements as an ethnographer and collector of Ukrainian folk song are profoundly important. Yet I struggle to hear any outstanding qualities in his music. Judging from this disc and the companion Toccata Classics release of piano music, Lysenko's output is uneven and mediocre. Most of it is sedate, limited in expressive range, and lacks melodic and harmonic interest. His style is heavily influenced by Chopin and Liszt, but comes off as generic Romanticism with a tinge of exotic color.These violin works are mostly in a Biedermeier salon style and quite forgettable. One problem I have with Lysenko's approach to this medium is that he gives the violin part too much prominence, reducing the piano accompaniment to an obbligato or continuo role. At first I thought this was because the piano was not adequately miked and thus Solomia Soroka drowns out her husband, Arthur Greene. I'm not sure how to account for this, whether Soroka is playing too forcefully, the mics are too close to the violin, or it's simply the nature of Lysenko's texture that the violin is always paramount and the accompaniment superfluous except when it underpins the harmony. All of this would be fine if Lysenko's violin writing was tuneful and had dramatic impetus.The ""Rhapsody on Ukrainian Themes"" has an enticing Ukrainian folk flavor, but the violin writing is underwhelming. The ""Elegiac Capriccio"" is more ""capriccio"" than elegiac. Even when Lysenko sets out to be serious in a minor key, he can't help sounding sunny and warm. A buoyant and energetic violin part saves the ""Fantasy on 2 Ukrainian Themes,"" which is packed with more inspired ideas. The best piece, I think, is the little ""Romance"" because of its affecting and memorable melody, not to mention superior voice-leading. I have to question Lysenko's depth of sensibility in a piece like ""A Moment of Despair."" I heard not a whiff of despair in this miniature. It's stylized, more reflective than doleful, and too consonant to really suggest genuine sorrow.Bottom line: Half way through the second playing of the disc I got bored and antsy to listen to something more substantial. It's a shame because I really enjoy Soroka's tone and her passionate playing. Her interpretations of the Roslavets violin sonatas, for example, are masterful and authoritative. Fans of violin literature may like this recording, but I don't think Lysenko's music is rewarding.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NWJWD64KS1FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SVF1DMU#wasThisHelpful","R1NWJWD64KS1FX","A3GRVGD58ZUXD0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3GRVGD58ZUXD0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I actually picked these up at best buy because at the time they were a little cheaper than on amazon.  Well actually i wanted the white ones but could only find them on the PDP website, and they have a horrible return policy that if i didn't like the headphones, i still couldn't return them.  That didnt sit too well with me being that I've never even tried or used them before so I didnt know what to expect.  If they were weak I wasn't going to shell out almost 200 for them, which is what i ended up paying back when they were worth that much.I ended up really liking them, but instead of returning them to get the white ones, i just kept the black pair.  Setup was pretty easy and straightforward.  it came WITH the stand :D which i really like, and i fell in love with the fact i could change the color.  that was a major selling point for me, i'm somebody who really loves to customize things as much as i can and appreciated the ability to set whatever color i wanted.Another feature i really like is that they're wireless, and i dont have to worry about being tangled in the cords because i lay in my bed a lot and use my laptop. and it's also nice to be listening to music or a video and walk away and still hear whats going on.The 3 different sound options are awesome too.  there's like a gaming sound mode and a threatre one and a heavy bass, so you can choose which one suits your current application, and it works on windows 8.My only beef with them is the ear cups.  they are soft and padded, and fairly large, but they still hurt my ears.  I have my ears pierced 4 on each side, and it puts pressure on them as its rounded. but again not much of an issue for those without a ton of earrings.the retractable mic is great too.I became addicted to gaming headsets and moved on up to the Astro A40's  those are much more comfortable on my ears as they're the larger rectangular shape, which i prefer, however I've got to say i'm honestly disappointed by the mixamp. it supposedly has multiple sound modes like the pdp, however i really do not notice any difference whatsoever when changing between them. my astros don't really have much bass at all. and not a lot of features and settings to play with.  i love that they rotate sideways to lay flat. but they didnt come with a stand....I was going to sell my PDP's since i got my astros and thought it was a good upgrade, but now i think im keeping them because they just have so many great aspects to them that they're worth hanging onto.

Dress fit as expected. she's 7 and wears 10 in clothes but 8 in dresses and it was perfect.  i found some adorable jewelry on amazon that matched this as well, gold with that teal color rhinestones, and it was so pretty together.  I paired this with small gold huggy hoops, a gold leaf hair band, a gold locket and a bracelet with the matching rhinestones. all bought from amazon prime. heres the pic of the combo i put together for her, minus a little black shrug in case she got cold.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3DHFP5AABENOO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LIWS0CY#wasThisHelpful","R3DHFP5AABENOO","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Only played through the first stage, and a couple adventure mode stages, and OMG already in love.  I got all giggly and cheese smiling while the familiar and classic music played, the beautifully animated characters and especially the cutsscenes.  So far im loving the story line too, link, gorgeous as always.This is just what i needed to tide me over a while until zelda wii u comes out next fall i believe for 2015. I bought my copy here on amazon for the twilight princess costume pack, which is one of my top favorite of the series, and caved as soon as i started this game and bout the hero of hyrule DLC combo back that includes the dark link costume, and all the new DLC content that will come out over the next several months.  I also downloaded the free Ganon costumes from club nintendo for registering the game.  So much stuff already and i've only been at it for an hour.I've been a zelda fangirl for almost 30 years now since the series first began, and played it as a child on the original NES, and Im very happy to see that the guys who made this game did not screw it up.  That's always a big concern with letting other people touch the franchise, im talking to you Philips..... the CDi debacle)  I dont know how i will accomplish anything now with so much hoard squashing to be had!  I hope you all have as much fun playing this game as i am!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39ML0HKZDWTSS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00KWEHBAG#wasThisHelpful","R39ML0HKZDWTSS","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am addicted to this coconut juice.  I first had these from the local grocery stores, one of them carries the larger cans, the other the small, so i grabbed a bunch of both, the small ones run about 89 cents and the larger 1.54.  I came here to see if I could find them by the case a little cheaper.  I have a mini fridge in my room full of this stuff (its my guilty pleasure)One time they were out at the store so I bought one of each of about 3 or 4 different brands of coconut juice that are ""comparable"" to this and they were all mediocre. None of them came close to tasting as refreshingly delicious of Foco's juice.  I've never had an issue with a metallic taste so I have no idea what anyone else is referring to so it must bot be a very common thing.  I've never had a bad can of this stuff.  There's the occasional dented can, but still tastes great!  I actually just got done drinking one and it's what prompted me to check here.It's sweet, but not horribly overpowering, i LOVE the diced coconut pieces, and as another reviewer noted, they are crisp and have some bite to them.  Other brands I've tried they were soggy mushy pieces that was not really a satisfying feeling coming out of the can.  I actually prefer to drink this one straight out of the can.  I'm more of a straw and glass kinda girl, and i love lots of ice, but these are the exception to the rule for me.  and even with some sugar in it, they are not that bad, they're 80% juice with water and SUGAR, not HFCS or any other weird kind of ""-lose"" at the end.  just coconut juice, water, sugar, and diced young coconut, so you know what you're drinking, and sugar, is not bad.  Everything in moderation.  even overdosing on water can kill you if you ingest too much at once so a i don't concern myself with the sugar in it.Once I get low on the ones i just bought i may snag a case on here if its a better deal than my local spots.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 23, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2SV37OMD7S3H0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003HD6NPI#wasThisHelpful","R2SV37OMD7S3H0","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Pretty good stuff.  I also came across this product from a youtube girl, and from her results, and then seeing everyone elses positive reviews i decided to try it out, and as far as whitening goes it's a visible difference after the first time, which if i recall from the instructions was 2 times for 30 minutes .My only thing with this is the taste is just awful. it has a barely there hint of mint with the rest tasting like eating some kind of medicinal cream.  I tried using the top and bottom trays at the same time, BIG mistake.  gag central. almost threw up so many times i just had to take one out so it doesnt really even matter to me if the top mold fits the bottom one perfectly , because I will not be using them together.  I can only do one at a time, and i also use a paper towel folded up that covers the back of the mold while in my mouth to help with the excess salivation and the horrible taste.the gripes though are very small to me because it definitely wouldn't stop me from using this.  its a teeth whitening system not candy so im totally fine with it.  I just had to put that out there because it was quite the process and had to adjust it to suit me. i havent been too consistent with using it, but ive started back up with it the past couple days and im happy with the results as expected.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ZVZDW9ERIHTM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BISHCC2#wasThisHelpful","R1ZVZDW9ERIHTM","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"was very disappointed with this movie.  it was AWFUL compared to the original.  its very pointless, full of extremely cheesy one liners, like every other sentence. they start just breaking tradition and culture.  There's really no plot to the movie at all. just them on a quickie ""mission"" while they bicker.  A lot of things were left unresolved. and it just strayed from a beautiful cultural masterpiece that made me teary watching it again, to being a yawn fest.this was definitely a failure of a sequel (as most of them are) and would have been better off not being made.","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 10, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R13F7G923OCNKY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004IDD9OO#wasThisHelpful","R13F7G923OCNKY","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"So i came across these at work, one my my leaders got this out of the supply closet, just a stash of random pens, and i fell in love with how it wrote.  unfortunately for me the little clip was broken so i was unable to see the brand, the model or the thickness, but i did have an idea.  I recognized the double heart logo that was stamped into the top as papermate, which greatly narrowed it down, then matched the style of the bottom of the pen.  it was hard to find these in particular.  I bought a pack or two of papermates, just like these but with white tips, turned out those were .7 mm so they were not as bold, but i was close, before that i got two other brands that came in 8 packs of colors, trying to find something close as i narrowed down which these were.  so now i have some 30 pens total and almost 40$ invested in just finding these pens...Thats how awesome they are.  they make thick, beautiful, bold smooth lines that dry really fast and don't smudge when you accidentally rub your arm over them.  They're click retractable, and this pack comes with two black, two blues and a red.  The tips will also come with a little waxy plastic shield thing on it youll have to peel off your your nails, this is to protect the tip and the ink, so no biggie, just dont forget to remove it.  I have no problems with the flow and its pretty consistent.  it does however, seep through a little if you write really slow and hold it in that spot too long, especially on thinner paper, but i can write on post its, envelopes, and documents without it bleeding and getting on any paper underneath it. (i like to write on top of other pieces of paper because pens seem to write more smoothly and clean when the paper pen can go down into the paper instead of the resistance of a solid surface pushing back on the ball)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R309Z16ZIPSIUG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003CQK9WI#wasThisHelpful","R309Z16ZIPSIUG","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I am very pleased with this lanyard.  I was bored at work and perusing amazon for items from my new favorite anime, and found this, the price was great, but i was very wary of ordering a non prime amazon item due to the last incident or two of buying this shipped direct from the merchant.  However, for $5 i took the chance, and so glad I did. I ordered it friday afternoon, and it arrived monday in the mail, from over a thousand miles away.  I got the notice my item had shipped within a couple hours of placing my order, and i honestly didnt believe it, i kind of thought of it like ebay how if you print the label it sends notification, but it actually was shipped!  I came home wondering what I had in the mail because there was no possible way this would be here, and dealing with paychecks being sent to and from that state from where i work, i have very little faith in the post office.

"Just got my skinonmi in the mail today and already put it on. i've used them before for one of my older phones and I've always loved their product.application is super easy.  I just sprayed the film while it was still on its backing, then lightly misted the device before spraying my fingers, peeled off the backing and it slid right on.  its super easy to work out bubbles.  i started laying my film from the bottom up so it centered around the S4 button, so it gradually made contact with the screen as opposed to just laying it flat and hoping for the best. (doing that will cause lots of bubbles.) with this method, i had only two large contiguous bubbles that were just solution that i swept off the sides. and with just a few passes, the shield was flat, bubble free, and perfectly aligned.The skinomi does have a slightly more tactile feel to it than the standard cheap pasty hard cellophane protectors, and while those may be all slick and smooth, they lift very easy, get gross under the corners and damage on them in visible, not to mention horrible dust and bubbling that you can never seem to work out. but it is still just as fast and responsive as it was previously without the protector, just not as slippery. which personally is fine with me, less chance of accidentally swiping something i didnt mean to.  One thing i haaaaate about the android OS, is the contact list, if you swipe too much to the side when scrolling through the list, sometimes it will register as you scrolling over a contact, and depending on the direction will start calling them! the surface having a softer vinyl feel keeps me from just swiping like a mad man and randomly calling the wrong person.I used to have a zagg, and they're cool and all, and really expensive.  I bought it on a whim at best buy because i was impatient and wanted it right away, and for the price and name notoriety, i figured it has to be good.  well it was, i was happy with it for a long time.  the installation though, which is usually fairly easy for me was just a bit more complicated.  i had also gotten one for my friend who is not only in the IT field but is very tech savvy, and he had the hardest time getting it on his tablet.  he seriously tried to put the backing on instead of the film.... because it comes clear on clear instead of paper like skinomi.  I also found that with the zagg i had, it had begun to fade and turn yellow. it was ugly against my white phone.  i eventually peeled it off and my old phone just went commando lol.The skinomi is very, very moderately priced. the first ones i purchased a while back were approx 3x the price they are here. and they also have a lifetime guarantee.  I can't attest to the clarity just yet because i just put it on so it kinda has that weird screen effect if you turn your phone on, and its also been so long since i had the last one that i don't remember, but i will update probably tomorrow when its all dried up and ready to go.  i do remember from the first one i had being terrified at the orange peel screen thinking OMG please dont stay like this, and the next day being relieved and amazed that it was back to normal, so maybe that will help anyone worried about resolution degradation.  sorry for my long rant, but thought id try to explain things best i can with actual examples and situations gained through my own personal experience.  Hope it helps someone :)btw i also bought this with a clear silicone case Cimo S-Line Back Flexible Cover TPU Case for Samsung Galaxy S III S3 (AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US Cellular, International) - Clear and it too is awesome.  i went with clear so i can get a skin decal, which is essentially like the screen protector, but for the body of the phone but with artwork as opposed to clear, this was i can have a clear case with a artistic decal underneath, and the phone body is still protected if i ever remove the case. decalgirl website has tons of awesome ones.  i just got my S4 a few days ago so im deckin this baby out!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1F7I7AW6DY8LJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BJS9EFY#wasThisHelpful","R1F7I7AW6DY8LJ","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i bought this mascara as a recommendation from my bestie.  I was looking for something with length, and volume and was disappointed with my purchase of maybellines megaplush, the teal colored tube.  i had been previously using the colossal lash version of that ( yellow tube) but it was old, and still not what i wanted.  but it was the closest i got out of the other ones i tried,  the mabellinestiletto one sucked, the loreal million lash sucked, the old school Maybelline Great Lash also really bad, and i think i had one that came in a black and baby pink metallic tube, with some kind of quilted pattern to it. but i don't remember the name.. i have not been happy with ANY of those.  and so when she told me about this i was skeptical, but had high hopes as she's a makeup fiend and always has beautiful lashes. and she was sooo right.this mascara made them super long without clumping them together. and was a dark black.  they also curled up on their own. so it seems this mascara is light enough to not weigh them down flat.  it really does suck that its not sold in the US anymore.  this stuff is hands down the best mascara ive ever used. when i get a chance i will definitely be buying a couple more tubes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30GOAFA9A3UH0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B001GNBW0W#wasThisHelpful","R30GOAFA9A3UH0","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Well first off, the color IS beautiful.  I bought the super red Beso color, and absolutely love the shade.That being said, I'm really disappointed by the claims this lipstick makes.  Its supposed to be All day, and smudge no bleed/transfer. however after it ""dries"" it still smudges easily.  to test it out i put it next to NYC's smoochproof liquid lipstick in REBEL, which comes with a clear gloss to go over it. New York Color, Smooch Proof Long-Wearing Lip Color, Rebel (483A), Lip Color .135 Fl. Oz., Lip Seal and Shine .135 Fl. Oz. I put both on my hand and let them dry, ran my finger over it and only the stila smudged, then i put the gloss on top of both, and the stila somewhat smeared.  For what i paid for this lipstick at beauty brands, 27$$ i find it disappointing that a 5 dollar walmart pick is more smudge proof and has better longevity than a 30 dollar high end brand.  i definitely have buyers remorse for how much i spent on it. like i said its a beautiful color, and i like it, but its not as good as it promises to be, and is way overpriced for its shortcomings.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3MP0TQJ317ZS2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007ZUGCL4#wasThisHelpful","R3MP0TQJ317ZS2","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"i actually bought this from target.  i was never the type to use moisturizers, didnt really think i needed them back then, but as of the past few years my skins become really dry, and even after washing my face, even with a scrub, my skin was STILL looking flaky and dry, so my makeup always looked like crap and i couldnt figure out why. i switched the the neutrogena face wash, just the standard orange in a pump bottle, and though it works awesome, afterwards, my face is suuuper tight and dry.  and thats where this little product comes in.it smells great, very fresh, clean and crisp scent but also very light. and speaking of light, a little bit of this stuff goes a looong way.  i was surprised by its texture really. i was expecting an actual cream, like your typical lotion stuff and i saw this green stuff and touched it and it felt really good lol. its cold, slick and not oily at all.  that was one thing that concerned me but nope, i put a little on my wrist, rubbed it in a little and once it dried it was just smooth and soft, no oily residue.i came on here because i was like, oh this stuffs awesome, and i wondered how others who bought it felt about it so i thought a good place would be to check amazon for other peoples comments, and was not surprised to see how highly everyone else spoke of it, so i had to put my word in too because im totally in love with this stuff..i wondered if anyone knows of any of those good little face scrubber things? like the Wave or just something good that scrubs the face, a little battery powered one. or a microdermabrasion  thing. i really want to try one of those. i am in my mid 20's and still get some bad breakouts, and i just don't know what to do anymore.there's rarely ever a time my face is ever 100% clear, and by the time it does, i break out again a week before that time of the month and it takes weeks to heal.  any advice is totally welcome and appreciated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 21, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R27P29OFPQDM4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003RF82UK#wasThisHelpful","R27P29OFPQDM4I","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was on my way to the gym when i stopped at the grocery store to grab some water and a small snack type just in case i needed it when i was in the organic aisle trying to find good healthy things instead of my usual crap, and i noticed these and they looked pretty good, i figured ive had dried fruit before, so these couldnt be too bad, its just apple and apricots. so i picked one up and tried it.i opened it up and it was a dark reddish brown color, speckled looking because its just chopped mixed and mashed up fruit, and it has the texture of a dried apricot once you bite it, it has that sticky center, but the bar itself didnt have a sticky residue. i took a bite and omg it was soooo good.  it was a little tart, like i expected it to be, and chewy, which i really liked the texture and surprisingly made me feel satisfied after eating it so i didnt crave other snacks. (i ended up eating mine hours after my workout at just an evening snack)Now, it does tastes like unsweetened dried fruit, so if thats not your thing then you may not like these, they arent like granola or other types of bars with additives and sweeteners or stuff so its not going to taste like a delicious rice crispy treat or nutrigrain bar...  i know how sometimes if youre expecting one thing and it totally is off then it can ruin it, like taking a drink of milk when you thought it was lemonade and youre like what the snap, ew. so just remember that if you want to try these.I saw one post where someone tried the same bar i did a few times and got hard pit things each time, i never had that problem.  mine was consistent in texture and no weird hard spots. though it does say on the package because its a natural product sometimes a little piece here and there might have gotten by.All in all i LOVE these bars, and am looking forward to trying the other varieties as well.  they were 1.88 at the grocery store so the price on here right now is actually cheaper than buying them individual so ill prob try a couple others then get a box of my fave, or the variety pack if they all end up being just as delicious, which im anticipating :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1APLFW9A3KT14/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0056AL68Y#wasThisHelpful","R1APLFW9A3KT14","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"when i bought this i was worried that it might be too small for my needs as i was spending a week away from home and i like to have options so i pack a little on the heavier side lol.  but i got it and was surprised at how much i could actually fit in it.  i had a few pairs of jeans, a pair of leggings, sweats, and shorts, about 7 tank tops, a couple dressier shirts, flip flops, flats, and skinny designer sneakers plus a few undergarments, 7 pairs of undies and some socks. stashed the toiletries bag in there... it zipped up just fine no issues with bulging or getting caught. it has nice pockets for putting things like chargers or things like that. and the pull out handle was long enough and didnt cause any strain.  i also like the wheels that were rubber so they rolled nicely and werent obnoxiously loud. the only nuisance was when rolling off of uneven surfaces if it doesnt tip it will hobble back and forth on its wheels but thats a given.  i found the trick was to actually slow down and not move instead of trying to counter the movements to readjust it.I'm very happy with this bag i love it and intend to use it a lot now that i plan to travel more frequently.  its similar in size to my airport carry on but its more compact and easier to carry around, and it also has the shoulder strap included, which i saw some didnt have on other duffels.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U9U21A3ISY6O/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000SRL6TY#wasThisHelpful","R2U9U21A3ISY6O","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"the hammer is nice, it does what i needed it to do, but there was something that i found a little unsettling with this hammer, initially it was the strong ""Factory smell"" it gave off when i received it.  the other was that it states on a warning label on the hammer that this product contains lead, and also instructs on washing hands after handling it.  it just made me a little uncomfortable keeping it around seeing as they pretty heavily made aware of the hazards of this little object.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BRD9A5RQHP89/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000NPR2U8#wasThisHelpful","R3BRD9A5RQHP89","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"so i first bought this a week ago, but wasnt sure if it included hardware or not (some do) so i ended up returning it and going with the Mako grip for about 21$ here on amazon, thinking i should have went with that one instead.the mako grip arrive, and first thing i noticed was a stabbing feeling on m fingers, the molding on it was not clean and had plastic shards sticking out i had to shave down AND sand, and secondly, that grip is definitely a mans grip.  im a chick and i have small hands and that grip was NOT working out, as nice as it looked and i wanted to like it, but i couldnt. so i sent that one back tooi ended up getting this hogue grip back again and now that its on my lower i absolutely LOVE it. i should  never have second guessed myself and went with my first choice.  its very comfortable and nonslip, but not soft and squishy or padded, its small enough that my hands fit perfectly around the palm swell area to the finger grips, its built ergonomically has waves in some areas that help your fingers stay in a comfortable position instead of sliding over the grip when moving, and it fit VERY snug onto my lower.  its a very comfortable grip to use and i love that its has a rubberized feel because the hard place was slippery.keep in mind though this isnt the beaver tail version i would have preferred, but that wont be in stock on amazon for 2-4 months, and this particular package does not include the bottom door and battery storage unit.  but it can be purchased separately.  at the time i bought this one i think the set was out of stock. so i figured ehh i'll just buy the other piece later or make my own cover for the bottom.If youre a female or just have smaller hands then this is a good grip in my opinion.  ill post a pic if it will let me.  its a great price and has a great reputation.  totally worth it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RK0AWYDFFMSO4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000H6C3P2#wasThisHelpful","RK0AWYDFFMSO4","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"when i saw this grip, i wanted to really like it. it had the features that i wanted and i heard it was a good make. however once i actually got it, i was a little disappointed with it.  the first thing i noticed was that there was pieces of plastic leftover from the molding sticking out of the finger grip areas. i learned this when i tried to hold it and it stabbed my fingers, luckily no cuts, but it was very rough and had sharp edges, definitely NOT useable.  I had to grab a razorblade and trim off the excess plastic, then file it down so there weren't any sharp edges and i could grip it comfortably.Which brings me to another point... the grip itself.  its kinda big, for me at least.  from finger grips to the swell on the back its a little wider than comfortable for me.  It's definitely suitable for a man, but im a chick and i've got smaller hands and though i prefer the design of this grip, its just not very comfortable to hold, i feel like i have to stretch my hand awkwardly to get it seated comfortable in my hand and it's not doin it :( .  I returned the Hogue grip i originally bought thinking it was missing hardware but it didnt have the screw, but now im thinking i want it back. i liked the almost rubber type no slip feel. it wasnt padded or anything. but it was smaller and it felt good in my hand to hold.I wanted to give it 3 stars cuz i was disappointed that it wasnt what i was expecting, but, im giving it 4 because even though its too big for me, itll work fine for you lovely men. but i had to knock off a star for the painful ugly unfinished sharp plastic that needed filing.  also had it on the hinge area of the bottom cover. had to cut and file that off too.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Q209AHICQAQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018O9MKG#wasThisHelpful","R16Q209AHICQAQ","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"WOW.... i have to say i was amazed. i wasnt expecting it to be as good as it was, and boy was i mistaken.  First off this movie is NOT for young kids. i dont know how it escaped a pg13 rating (especially by some of the unexpected imagery and content) but i wouldnt recommend it to anyone younger than 12 or 13.the colors are very vivid and set the tone quite well.  and even though its creepy, its still very cute.  basically its about a girl who feels kind of put off by her parents who are extremely busy and have no time for her. she finds her way to an idealistic version of her world, but as she will learn (as is the overall theme of this which another reviewer mentioned) the grass isnt always greener on the other side.  Whether she's able to escape it or not ill leave that for you to find out :)  this is a tim burton movie after all, anything can happen in the crazy worlds he creates.

"i bought this cup from a trip to Joanns actually back last spring and this is my FAVORITE reusable cup. i use it on a daily basis, it went with me to work every day before i got laid off, i take it with my in the car, use it at starbucks all the time, and its nice at night with lots of ice and water when i wake up and im thirsty, i always have a drink nearby.  I have a thing for these cups lol. i am addicted to them and always buy one if i find a cute one at the store, and i actually have this one too which i really like Copco Sierra 24-Ounce Cold Tumbler, Hot Pink but that one is not a double wall insulated one like this black damask one is.it fits in my car fine so i have no complaints about that. my cupholder has a silicone feeling molded insert/cover thing so i dont recall if the cup goes all the way down in the holder but because of the silicone liner it locks in there snug and doesnt slide or fallout when im driving.and im not sure about others who say it doesnt maintain it insulation and gathers condensation.  i've never had that problem with this cup.  the other one i linked to thats pink gets condensation, but has a silicone grip on it so it wasnt a big issue, but it did get my table and stuff wet so i fell in love with this one and its been the go-to. its always next to my laptop so i love that it doesnt sweat all over the table.. mine has never had condensation form on the outside so if youre looking for a good insulated cup thats cute then this is a good one. i typically prefer skinny narrow straws but this one is wide enough to put any kind of drink in, even thick smoothies or shakes, or stuff with fruit bits in it, and the straw has a little funnel like attachment on the end instead of a little mixing spade looking thing.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 24, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26DFLU43TIF8Q/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008BXWGR8#wasThisHelpful","R26DFLU43TIF8Q","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I bought this for someone special for valentines day this year, and im hoping he loves it!  he's loved the last two i bought him, and loves my taste in things since everything i get him looks great, but i gotta say i saw this watch and fell in love.I actually ended up buying this watch at zales, which was kinda stupid because its a hundred dollars cheaper here on amazon, but with the time constraint i didnt have a lot of choice at the moment so i couldnt amazon it like i normally would have. but ive had it in a wishlist for some time waiting for the opportunity to buy it, and i guess that time is now.It's got a hefty little weight to it because its steel, and it feels like it has some substance, not cheap and flimsy.  It's also actually pretty shiny. the metal is glossy, not matte as it appears in the photo, and the mother of pearl is very faint, its not loud and pronounced like the photo indicates either.  i had at first thought this was a different version of this watch model because the pearl was so loud in this compared to what i actually bought, but like another reviewer mentioned, it looks almost all black.  this doesnt bother me though as the over-pearlized look was kinda distracting and would have been a little much considering the heft, sheen, silver accents and diamonds, the color just would have been too much.what set this one apart from the rest was that the bling was understated.  i saw a lot of beautiful diamond encrusted watches and ones with tons of dials and little weird counters and calendars on it, but this is mainly more of a statement piece.  i tend to lean towards a classier, more simple, timeless look. doesnt need a ton of knobs bells and whistles, just elegant. and this fit the bill,it comes in a nice rectangular two piece box, its a blackish dark charcoal color and comes strapped around a little black bulova pillow, which makes a beautiful presentation as opposed to a clamshell velvet type standard box. i like this one better.all in all im very happy with this piece, and im sure he will be too. id definitely recommend this one for that special man in your life too.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3OITOJFHC935I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002IDTV0C#wasThisHelpful","R3OITOJFHC935I","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"though my review isnt going to be as awesome and thorough like a lot of others, i just have to comment on how beautiful this story is.  i agree with a lot of others that even though its a pixar animated movie, its just as much for adults, if not more than it is for kids.  not ratings-wise but content wise.the story follows the old man through his love, loss and promises, and the journey along the way.I will admit, i started crying in the first 10 minutes of the movie, its so incredibly sweet, and it reminded me of my own grandparents in that they were each others first and ONLY love, and my mama just recently passed, so the movie reeeally connected with me on that level because i can see my papa in the old man in the movie.it's definitely a little different than your typical animated film, but if youre into the kind of more mature animated subjects and dig a sweet story, then definitely give this movie a shot.  you won't be disappointed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D64O7ZXKE1KP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0055B7IPE#wasThisHelpful","R2D64O7ZXKE1KP","A1NYKD19R5JQWD","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1NYKD19R5JQWD?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"If you are looking for vacuum compression bags, you pretty much just want something that is very easy to use, durable, and helps you store more things in smaller spaces. You want something that is intuitive so that after you store something for a year, you do not have to read instructions again to figure out how to use it again for the next year.This set fits the bill. You get a pretty good deal for 3 bags. You can use it with almost any vacuum that has a hose even if it does not fit perfectly. The plastic is pretty thick and seems durable without having a strong plastic smell. Like others, I was a bit confused at first on how to use it, but after reading instructions on Amazon, it was a breeze for me to use. Yes, it was a bit annoying to have no included instructions on how to use it, but one minute after re-visiting this Amazon page, I am sure I will never forget how to use and will never have to look it up again.Unlike other reviewers may have mentioned, I had no trouble zipping the bags closed--I actually thought it was really easy and fast to do. Clearly, your mileage may vary...Note: I received this item for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.

"Pros:- Super comfortable! I find the headband super comfortable even after prolonged periods, which is quite rare for me for headphones at this price range. The ear pads are also very comfortable.- Good sound! I cannot really tell between my higher-priced luxury headphones and this set. I was really surprised by the sound quality for a headphone at this price range.- Did I mention that these are some of the MOST COMFORTABLE headphones I have ever tried?Cons:- Microphone. I really wanted to give this a five star review because of the sound quality and comfort at this price range, but I cannot. Before I say anything else, I just want to say that I really like the sleek design of the microphone being able to fold into the headphone when you do not use them--if you did not have the microphone expanded out, you would probably not even know that your headset had a microphone at all, let alone a microphone that was sleekly stored away. Unfortunately, for me, the microphone did not work really well on my Macbook Pro--it did not even record or transmit anything I said unless I was literally screaming into it (and yes, I am sure I set it up right on my Mac to record).

"I hate a dirty screen and am pretty compulsive about cleaning all my screens (tablet, phone, computer, tv, etc.). I have found that for minor messes and daily use, my most economical solution with great results is using the Moshi Teraglove and just plain tap water (though it saves me money from buying solution, it has a downsides of sometimes leaving streaks that are a bit frustrating to get out--but I cannot afford the luxury of buying special solution every few months).For dirtier messes, I usually used the iKlear solution, as it is or was what I see being used whenever I am at the Apple Store by the ""geniuses."" Why is iKlear Apple-approved and declared as safe and effective to use on Apple products? Mostly, it is because it is ammonia-free and alcohol-free so it won't damage the coating on your screens! Well, guess what?! The Eco Moist screen cleaner is also ammonia-free and alcohol-free! That means it is safe for my Apple products too! For several reasons, if I will be buying any cleaners on Amazon in the future, it will definitely be Eco Moist over iKlear. Here are some reasons:- No residue left behind when I clean! With iKlear, sometimes after I wiped the screen down, there is a streak or residue left over that I had to go over and clean again. I do not have the same problem with the Eco Moist.- Great microfiber towel provided. The microfiber towel provided is high quality and adequate in size. FYI, it is different than the smooth silky microfiber many people are accustomed too for cleaning eyeglasses--this cloth has a ""rougher"" surface which gives you a bit more friction when cleaning, so you can ""scrub"" easier. Though I say it is ""rougher"" for you to ""scrub,"" I am by no means implying it is unsafe or harder on your screen, as it is still microfiber. I am no manufacturing expert, but I think this ""rougher"" microfiber is actually more expensive than the super-smooth or super-silky microfiber cloths to make, as it is easier to make a flat cloth compared to a cloth with a rougher surface that is just as safe for your screen.- It got my fingerprints off REALLY easily--just one wipe was adequate. Again, there was no residue or streaking afterwards.- No scent! I kind of hate the iKlear scent when I am spraying iKlear. There is no scent with Eco Moist, which is much more preferable for me,- For a comparably sized bottle of iKlear on Amazon, the Eco Moist is cheaper AND includes the nice microfiber cloth with it. The iKlear does not always come with a cloth, so you are paying more for the same amount of solution and missing out on a new cloth. I kind of have low success with washing cloths after they are used for a long time, so I would have no qualms just reordering Eco Moist, getting a new cloth, and tossing my old cloth, especially if the prices remain the same and iKlear does not include a cloth.Note: I received this item for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.

"Pros:- This is a REALLY cute silicone stand.- It holds an iPhone 5 perfectly, as shown in my pictures, but it can also easily hold other phones (like my iPhone 6) and even tablets.- Easy to use--just put your phone on the back of the pig where there is a small bump--the bump will retract/conform to your phone right after placement.- Stays in place pretty well. Will not slide much if placed properly.Cons:- If you are looking for something SUPER stable, look elsewhere. The stand holds your phone pretty well, but it may fall if there is an earthquake or someone bumps the desk very hard. That said, it is NOT unstable...it is just not the MOST stable thing I have used. For my daily use, the stability is definitely adequate.- For $9.99, it is a bit overpriced for those that value function a lot more than form. Those that want super-stability can find other stands that are cheaper--however, they are definitely NOT as cute. I can definitely understand why people may pay a few dollars extra for something a bit less stable but a lot pleasing to the eye.I think this may be a pretty great item for stocking stuffers for the holiday season.Note: I received this item for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.

"The mechanism to retract the ethernet cord is well-designed and gives me no issues, unlike other retractable cords that I have used. It is easy to use--retracts when I want it to and pull on the ends, and expands when I want it to as well.I bought this because I wanted a compact way of carrying an ethernet cord in my backpack everyday. It is compact, but by no means small (has about a 3 inch diameter and is about an inch thick). Even though it is a bit thicker than I thought it would be, I appreciate that both the mechanism for retracting the cord as well as the overall product seems a lot more durable than I am used to seeing. Even though it is a bit thicker than I would want it to be, it is still WAY more compact and easily stored than a normal 5 ft ethernet cable that I fold up and tie up to put in my bag.I would appreciate it to be a LITTLE bit longer, but for my purposes the length has been fine.I have used this cord daily for more than a month now when I go to work without any issues and/or signs that it will break. It seems very well-made and made to last a long time even with my not-too-careful or even rough use with it. I will update if I get any issues.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22LLD4XYYIHNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064EKNKI#wasThisHelpful","R22LLD4XYYIHNP","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a very solid product that lets you use one of your USB ports to connect to an ethernet cord. It is compact and well-built compared to most of the other USB to ethernet adapters out there on Amazon. It is no wonder for me why this is one of the best-selling adapters with the most glowing reviews.The aluminum casing even matches my Macbook Pro perfectly. Unfortunately, even though it looks like it was made for my Apple MacBook Pro, it still does not match up to the Apple-branded Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter (I purchased this one Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter) in terms of ease of use with my Macbook Pro. For some reason, with this USB to ethernet adapter, whenever I connect to the network I most frequently use via ethernet, I have to restart the computer before my internet successfully works. I have to do this restart every time. With the Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter, the internet works perfectly well immediately as soon as I connect the ethernet cord into the adapter without needing to restart.That said, it works very well after I restart the computer and it does exactly the job it claims to do--it allows you to use a USB port as an ethernet port so your computer can connect to the internet via ethernet cord. I am sure the fact that I have to restart using this USB adapter and do not have to restart when using the Apple adapter is more due to my computer's settings, the limitations of connecting via USB vs. thunderbolt, or the settings of the network I am connecting to. It is not a knock on the build or quality of this Anker product or anything.Of course, this review may not apply to you if you own a PC or maybe if your network's settings are different. For my daily use, the Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet Adapter is worth shelling out the extra few dollars for the convenience of not having to restart my computer every time I connect to my work's network.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2O1MF3W4D2S5B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PC0H9IE#wasThisHelpful","R2O1MF3W4D2S5B","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was pretty happy with my Danco 9D00010306 Microban Hair Catcher, but I decided to try this one after my Danco one started growing mold.The reviews for this hair stopper seem to indicate that it is a bit more resistant to mold, so I tried purchasing this one. With just a few weeks of use, I can already see that this hair stopper is much better at resisting mold--I clean it a lot less and it still looks clean and mold-free despite the less frequent upkeep compared to the Danco Hair Catcher.This is a pretty cheap and effective hair catcher. It did the job that I bought it to do perfectly...I must say, however, that I find this Evriholder hair stopper a LOT harder to clean compared to most hair stoppers I have used. The Danco Hair Catcher was a LOT easier to clean--but I still did not clean it that often....so for now, I will stick to the product that needs less cleaning but is harder to clean.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JSWIQZNF73WJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0063KXYAY#wasThisHelpful","R2JSWIQZNF73WJ","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I usually look through the reviews very thoroughly before buying, but I trusted the Lodge brand because I was so happy with my skillets and other products from Lodge.I really wish I read other reviews. My brush also melted after one use. DO NOT USE THIS BRUSH UNTIL THE SKILLET IS COOLED OFF.I have alternatively used OXO Good Grips Electric Grill and Panini Press Brush with some success and it did not melt when the skillet was just as hot as when the Lodge Brush melted.Still, for fans of cleaning the skillet while it is still hot like me, I find it is most effective to just use tongs and a wet paper towel to clean the skillet.","1.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R28GS1G6YN3P5J/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00G0T3CE6#wasThisHelpful","R28GS1G6YN3P5J","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 0:23 MinsI have years of experience with several of these kind of electric swatter products, as my family has been acquiring them from Asia and bringing them to our home in the US before Amazon even existed or these were well-known in the US.This seems like one of the most well-thought out designs I have ever seen as it has rechargeable batteries, one of the largest racquet/swatter sizes I have ever seen, and 3 layers of nets.Despite the larger size and the 3 layers of nets, this is one of the swatters I have the most difficulty killing bugs with, strangely enough...I can't explain it. Sometimes I swear I get the bug, but the bug clearly survives or probably flew right through...Most alarming to me, however, is that when I am holding the button to turn on the electric charge as I am going to zap, it sometimes RANDOMLY DISCHARGES AND SHOCKS as if it has hit a bug, except it has hit nothing except air. This only happens if I am holding the button too long in anticipation of the bug...but it is surprising nonetheless. With other swatters, I can hold the shock button for several minutes with no random discharge of electricity/shock unless I hit a bug. Maybe it is part of the design or maybe it is just a defect in my unit...Still, I cannot complain too much, as it does eventually kill the bug._______________________________________________________________________________***EDIT 9/10/2015:Decided to post video/proof of random discharges.","2.0 out of 5 stars","July 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1RY0CU19S46U1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00POAJ0I4#wasThisHelpful","R1RY0CU19S46U1","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought these lab markers because people in my lab keep losing or stealing each others' so much that I wanted a set of my own.These work great and do exactly what I bought them to do. They have an extra fine tip that is easy to write with on several types of surfaces (tubes, slides, etc) and yield text that is very legible and easy to read. Most importantly, they dry fast and are resistant to many solvents I use regularly that would quickly wash away ink from regular permanent markers. They are as ""lab-proof"" as any other markers I have ever used.However, there is one flaw that is semi-annoying, but something I am okay with living with--the shirt/coat clip on the pen cap is easily detached from the rest of the pen cap (see picture). For $40.31 (including shipping) for 12 markers (~$3.35 per marker), I expected these markers to be pretty flawless. I will live with them for now, but I would check elsewhere first for pens without this flaw before ordering again, especially if you rely heavily on the pen clip in daily use.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3U6GG0WYO4OYR/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0017U4URQ#wasThisHelpful","R3U6GG0WYO4OYR","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have used several tempered glass screen protectors and the most recent one I had on my iPhone 6 shattered after a drop. Thus, I decided to try this one.I decided to purchase this because of the system provided to do a quick and easy install. I must admit that this is definitely the QUICKEST DUST-FREE INSTALL I have ever had for a screen protector. With other screen protectors, I can also get a dust-free install, but this was far easier and quicker because of the provided ""Align Holder.""However, for my first install, I noticed that even though I put the screen protector perfectly into the align holder, it was just a TINY bit off-center. Your mileage may vary, of course. Certainly the final placement was ""good enough"" but it was clear on my phone that the screen protector installed just a millimeter or so more towards the right than the left. When I looked at my home button, I could see that the distance between the button and the screen protector was larger on the right compared to the left. Meanwhile, the distance between the speaker at the top of the phone from the screen protector was greater on the left compared to the right.Thus, since I kinda have OCD, the screen protector not being exactly in the middle frustrated me--so I took it off and tried again. I was able to use the align holder again to carefully get the screen protector into the exact middle of the phone, but I noticed that there was a bit of resistance while I did this. Certainly, I could not simply ""place the top end of the glass against the align holder and slowly lay down on the screen"" as stated in step 4 of the instructions and expect it to all land perfectly. Instead, I used the align holder as a general guide for laying down the screen protector, noticing that I had to constantly adjust the screen protector along the align holder in order to make sure that the hole for the speaker in the screen protector landed exactly in the middle on top of the speaker port...then constantly adjust it so that the bottom landed exactly in the middle on top of the home button.Basically, there is a certain amount of ""wiggle room"" in the align holder so you still have to be careful if you care about it being EXACTLY in the middle. If you are not that anal, you could probably just follow the instructions blindly and achieve a final install that is dust-free and ""good enough"" in less than ten seconds--but do not expect it to be PERFECTLY aligned. If you want it to be dust-free and exactly in the middle, you still have to be a little careful and constantly adjust placement as you slowly let the screen protector down.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R141F934MYTZG3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YM3KKTM#wasThisHelpful","R141F934MYTZG3","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I bought this to hold my cell phone on my desk when I am doing work (I hate leaving my phone in my pants pockets) and also to hold the phone next to my bed.Whether it is clamped to my desk right next to my computer monitor so that my phone is easily glanced at if there are any notifications while working, or if it is clamped on my bed frame or nightstand next to my bed at night, the stand holds my phone really well.I used a lot of cell phone and tablet holders before for use in the home by the desk or in the car. I must say that this is pretty high quality and is much cheaper than similar products I used before. The arms of this holder strikes the perfect balance of being sturdy and also being flexible enough so that you do not have a workout of your arm when you are trying to flex the holder into a different position. Other products were the flex arm were either too weak or too hard to maneuver for me in the past, so I transitioned to straight bar mounts (RAM Mounts, Joy Factory mounts) that did the job, but were just a bit too hardcore and kind of an eyesore. This cell phone holder is the perfect one for me.This significantly enhanced my life so that I would purchase again if I lost or broke it. Particularly in the mornings...I used to have my cell phone just plugged in and laying on the nightstand without this holder/mount, and sometimes the phone would fall on the thick floor carpet when I would snooze the morning alarm or the phone would somehow get on my bed and get buried in the blankets--which could be a disaster since the bedsheets and my plush carpet could significantly dampen the volume of the alarm. With this cell phone holder, my phone is always in the same, safe place through the night and until I take it out of the mount to take it to work. If this company made a tablet mount I would definitely try it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QUJ1JS8AF73G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OS925K2#wasThisHelpful","R2QUJ1JS8AF73G","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"For $15 dollars you cannot really ask for more. Works great with my Dell 2713hm monitor.This is all I needed FYI, as I got a bit confused with some people saying you need the power supply--I did not need the additional power supply, as the 2713hm monitor can power the speaker. I am guessing if you have one of the newer Dell monitors, your monitor can power the speaker and you do not need the additional power supply. Your mileage may vary, of course.I installed this on my monitor in less than 3 minutes. I am tech savvy, but I suspect even the less tech-savvy will find this an easy install.I had no problems with any sound output from the speaker when any of my devices connected to my monitor via HDMI or DisplayPort. I connected my PS4, Macbook Pro, and iPad to the monitor via HDMI or DisplayPort and successfully verified automatic sound output through the speaker when I connected any of the devices to my monitor.

"I really wanted to like this. I like AmazonBasics products and how they provide high-quality cheap alternatives for several products.Unfortunately, this is way too large for my Macbook Pro Retina 15"".That said, for larger 15"" computers that aren't as slim as Macs, I am sure this is a great product. It is not a military-grade protector/case, but it seems just as well made with quality materials and just protective as other cases I have bought for other computers in the past, at a fraction of the price...if only it were the right size!!Additionally, when it comes to these accessories I like things to be minimalistic. Aside from the AmazonBasics label in the upper left corner, this is plain and minimalistic enough for my needs. The AmazonBasics label is less gaudy than how other companies like to label their products.If it were just smaller it would be perfect. Oh well.-----Update 6/23/15Two praises that made me change my review from 2 stars to 4 stars:1. When I tried to return my 15"" laptop sleeve, Amazon gave me a full refund and additionally told me to keep it for free and to not bother returning it! Great customer service. I ended up giving the case to a friend that had a large 15"" business/work Dell computer which the 15"" case fits perfectly.2. I purchased a 13"" case for my Toshiba CB35-B3340 13.3 Inch Chromebook (Intel Celeron, 4GB, 16GB SSD, Silver) Full HD-Screen. The case fits the Chromebook very well. It has some extra room in the case, but it feels like it keeps my computer very securely. I really appreciated this because the Chromebook is not the kind of computer that has a bunch of manufacturers rushing to create custom-cases that fit it completely perfectly, so to find a general case that adequately protects the Chromebook at such a low price point is really great!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IDKD8KMHEOOW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00CD8AFT8#wasThisHelpful","R3IDKD8KMHEOOW","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When it comes to shaving, I am a pretty utilitarian guy. I want something quick before I rush out in the mornings, but I also want a shave that actually lasts the entire day and does not cause irritation. Some people think that you can either have quick shave (electric shaving) or a smooth/close shave with no irritation/ingrown hairs/bumps (wet-shaving with a safety razor), and you can never have both. Frustrated with irritation from electric shaving a few years ago, I went to wet-shaving for a few years, which felt like a lot of fun, but even after I got good at it, I still got irritation and ingrown hairs. Thus, I went back to electric shaving recently, as I figure the minimal gains in preventing irritation from wet-shaving in my personal experience was not worth the extra time spent.I've been using the Braun 770cc Pulsonic Shaver the last year or so, and I've grown tired of how the shave does not last, and how I was getting chronic irritation/ingrown hairs/bumps in certain areas. I tried a bunch of stuff to try to troubleshoot this issue for me, such as alternating wet-shaving and electric-shaving every few days and all that, to no avail.Finally, I bought the Kyoku Pre-Shave Optimizer. I was actually REALLY wary of this product because I tried the Lab Series Electric Pre-Shave stuff and Lectric Shave Pre-Shave stuff to no avail. But no matter how skeptical I was, I just could not ignore all the glowing Amazon reviews...Just a few days of using this, I can already say this is the BEST shaving purchase I have ever made. Why?- My shave lasts for the 16 hours a day I need it to. My shave is MUCH closer than without this magic stuff. In fact, I would say it is almost as close as my wet-shave. This significantly improved the way my facial hair felt towards the end of my day (ie it was much shorter).- The irritation I get from my electric shaver is SIGNIFICANTLY diminished. I get no irritation after my shave, and the chronic parts of my face that are irritated are significantly reducing.- Unlike other Pre-Shave products, I do not hate the smell, and I do not have as much trouble washing it off.I bought this product with a Shisheido pre-shave lotion that got glowing reviews on Amazon, so after a few more weeks of using this, I will try the Shisheido pre-shave lotion to compare--will report back here when I do so. That being said, Kyoku set a pretty high bar...","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26ZI3YDQ5HIYT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0038JKYAQ#wasThisHelpful","R26ZI3YDQ5HIYT","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I received this item for free in exchange for a fair and honest review. I review all items just as if I paid for them.I have tried my fair share of lightning cables, including the apple lightning cable, the amazon lightning cable, and several others. I prefer the braided variety of lightning cables (as they are tangle-resistant), but they are often twice in price compared to this Omars cable so it is not a fair comparison.As far as non-braided lightning cables go, this is the best lightning cable I have tried. Why?1. 4 feet! I often find the 3 foot cables way too short, and the 6 foot cables way too long. Finding a high quality 4 foot cable is pretty great.2. Seems more durable (a bit thicker cord) than the Apple-branded lightning cables I have tried and broken many times already. However, only time can tell if this cord stands the test of time. I will be using this daily, and will update if this cord ever fails.3. The lightning connection is almost as thin as the apple-branded lightning cable! (See my picture). I have had trouble with my iPhone case with other brands of lightning cables (ie the Amazon lightning cable) because their lightning connections were too thick and would not fit with the case on. I have no issues with this one.4. Charges, connects, and syncs iPhone/iPad with computer with no issues--just like the original Apple lightning cable.5. Comes with a nifty 3m cable management sticker/mount to keep your lightning cord on your table or whatever surface you desire (see picture).

"Note: I am primarily using this to watch Netflix or listen to podcasts on my computer late-night or as I fall asleep in bed without disturbing the wife (I just cannot fall asleep as quickly without doing this for some reason, no matter how hard I try). I am not using this for professional editing purposes or expecting audiophile-quality for listening to music.I've been searching for a good set of bluetooth headphones for late-night listening that I can also use while falling asleep. I've had a good set of Bose Soundlink Around-Ear Bluetooth AE2W headphones for a few years that I have been pretty happy with, but they are just not comfortable when laying down (mostly because of the Around-Ear irregular oval shape cupping the ears instead of a perfect circle). I specifically need bluetooth headphones because I am terrified that I will choke on the cord in the middle of the night--probably an irrational fear, but a fear nonetheless. I tried a bunch of the other Jabra headphones that are in-ear, but I ended up returning them because of bad comfort and connectivity issues. Some quick notes on why these headphones are pretty great:1. CONNECTIVITY: If you had any issues with the other Jabra headphones in terms of connection, do not be afraid to give these headphones a shot. Jabra seemed to work out a bunch of kinks that plagued the older headphones, as these work perfect for me. They easily pair with my Macbook and connect automatically whenever I turn it on, without me having to play around with the computer and hope it randomly connects. I note that past headphones have a heavy focus on connecting with iPhones, iPads, etc., so they always seem to work fine with those devices, but computers were always a bit finicky. My computer will often not work with my Ae2w's without me shutting bluetooth off and then back on for my computer, but this is the first set of headphones that work just fine with my computer, pretty much every time. I will note that the distance of connection seems a few feet shorter compared to the Bose Ae2w's that I have, but it is still a good 20 feet or so. I think it might be because the newer bluetooth connections try to be lower energy, so it would make sense my older headphones might be able to connect at a longer distance.2. COMFORT. These are lightweight, slim, and small. NOTE THAT THESE ARE ON-EAR HEADPHONES (I searched furiously online for whether this was on-ear or over-ear for the longest time with no good answer, so now hopefully consumers that have the same question can find their answer here). I usually HATE on-ear headphones, and must admit that if I knew they were on-ear, I might not have purchased them. However, unlike other on-ear headphones, these are comfortable. They do not get too warm on my ear, and the tension on the headband isn't too tight so that it feels like my ears are being squeezed. In fact, I do not feel like my ears are being squeezed at all. I definitely wear these headphones for a few hours comfortably.3. POWER. Unlike other headphones that cannot be used as Bluetooth headphones while charging, THESE CAN. I am using this right now via bluetooth, while charging the headphones using the Micro-USB cable connected to a separate USB charger that is not attached to my computer. The Bose AE2W's were TERRIBLE because when you ran out of charge, you were FORCED to only use it as a wired 3.5mm headphone while taking the bluetooth dongle off to charge. With this set, I can charge this while using it via bluetooth, so that once I am finished charging, I can just take the USB cable off and already be connected to the computer via bluetooth. No need to re-attach a bluetooth dongle and then re-pair the device to the computer.I will update this review if I encounter any durability issues, etc.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHDV0WJW7WUWX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MR8Z28S#wasThisHelpful","RHDV0WJW7WUWX","A1JI0B5G8RUD5","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1JI0B5G8RUD5?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A lot of the ones on Amazon I have purchased only have the electrocuting metal lines going horizontally. You would be surprised how many insects you end up missing by chance because they just happen to squeeze between the two lines. This one has lines going horizontally and vertically, so you pretty much get the bug 100% of the time--and at almost half the price!Interestingly enough, I purchased this to kill flies and mosquitoes, but I ended up using it mostly to kill house centipedes on the ground. Those buggers are so fast. I end up putting this racket/zapper right up against the ground (so that all the electrocuting lines are barely missing the floor), and then trap and kill the centipedes this way.

"This versatile knife will be a great addition to any kitchen.  Sharp and easy to handle, it does everything I need it to do.

"I loved this novel!  It really caught me by surprise.  The titular Florence is a 70 something New York intellectual and she is very difficult.  Reading her story, however, is simply delightful, very entertaining, very engaging, very humorous.  The novel revolves around Florence, her son, his wife and their daughter, Emily.  The main relationship is between Emily and Florence, although for most of the novel, neither one would probably own up to having anything close to a relationship.  Brian Morton does so many smart things in this novel--I think this would be a great read for a book club.  Florence is a complete misanthrope, although I am sure most readers will identify, at least a tiny bit, with her desire to be alone.  Florence Gordon is a terrific novel and I think any reader with a touch of the curmudgeon in him or her will delight in reading it.

"The Liar's Wife is a collection of four thoughtful novellas.  Each story has powerful emotional resonance and each focusses on a character whose values and expectations are challenged by an encounter with someone else.  This collection is not a quick, light read, but rather each is a resonant, thought-provoking piece.  If you have enjoyed Mary Gordon's work in the past, I recommend this collection.  It is very well done.

"God is an Astronaut is a fairly interesting tale told through one woman's (Jess) email to a former lover about a catastrophe that befalls her husband's space tourism company.  The novel is written in a very straightforward fashion, so that fact that none of Arthur's (the former lover's) emails are present does not detract from the reading of the novel.  I do think, however, that some readers may be annoyed at this approach.  It did not much bother me.  The problem for me with this novel is that I found it hard to connect with Jess at all.  The  novel is a quick read, as one would expect in a novel told in only email format, and it does not get bogged down in the details.  It just did not make me want to tell all of my reader friends to immediately read this novel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2Z88IB9MKVXBZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1620403560#wasThisHelpful","R2Z88IB9MKVXBZ","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This volume is a great resource for the home cook.  This isn't a cook book, but rather a compendium of information about all different types of whole foods, but mostly the kind of foods you think of when you think about eating healthily (i.e., you won't find any information about hot dogs here).  Each food item has a dedicated two page spread with information about how to ship for it, the heath benefits of it, and environmental information about it.  The pictures are lovely and it is a pleasure to thumb through this book.  I know I will be using this as a resource in my kitchen for years to come.

"How to Build a Girl is an amusing coming-of-age story that takes place in early-1990s Britain. The narrator, Johanna, struggles with who she is and invents a new persona, Dolly Wilde.  Johanna is probably an average goth-like rebellious teen at this time, but finds more freedom in Dolly, who really is an over-the-top version of Johanna herself.  This novel is amusing (but personally, I did not find it as hilarious as others--the humor was a little too obvious and forced) and Johanna is an empathetic narrator.  She's not shy about sharing the details of her sex life, so if that is not for you, I suggest you keep searching.  Otherwise, How to Build a Girl is a fun read.

"I was pleasantly surprised by The Fortune Hunter.  I expected something light and predictable but this novel is a well-constructed, well-paced, well-written work of historical fiction.  It is certainly not heavy--but it is filled with interesting and flawed characters and is an engaging read.  I found it difficult, at first, to root for the main protagonist, Charlotte--it's hard to feel empathy for a very wealthy character, but Goodwin draws Charlotte so well, the reader cannot help but empathize with her.  Bay, her love interest at the beginning of the novel, is also an interesting character.  Who is the titular fortune hunter?  There are a number of characters in this novel in search of their fortune, even characters who have ostensible wealth.  I enjoyed reading this novel--it is pure escapism and a quick read.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39F9S2O75CE64/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250043891#wasThisHelpful","R39F9S2O75CE64","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"2 A.M. at the Cat's Pajamas takes place over the course of one day in contemporary Philadelphia--Christmas Eve Eve--and concerns three main characters:  a young girl, her teacher and the manager of a nearby nightclub, the Cat's Pajamas.  The story did not bowl me over or wow me.  I'm not sure I will remember reading it in six months time.  Bertino's style is reminiscent of Anne Tyler with a little John Irving tossed in.  Each of these characters is a little odd, and each has had his or her share of heartbreak.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, I would recommend giving this book a try.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12I4SXU2QPYEW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0804140235#wasThisHelpful","R12I4SXU2QPYEW","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I Can See in the Dark is, for lack of a better word, a dark novel.  Riktor, the narrator, is a dark, lonely, twisted soul.  He is simply not a nice person.

Of course, you won't be able to help yourself if you pick up this novel.  It is certainly not for everyone--if you enjoy dark tales and bitter narrators, this one will be a quick read for you.

"First let me say that Dear Daughter is in no way substantively or qualitatively comparable to Gone Girl.  Dear Daughter is a perfectly readable but ultimately forgettable thriller.  It succeeds on many levels where other thrillers fall apart.  The writing is excellent, the pacing works well and the ending wraps things up in a plausible and non-disappointing fashion.

"Robert Timberg's memoir, Blue-Eyed Boy is an honest telling of his difficult journey.  He was just days away from finishing his tour of duty in Viet Nam when he was badly burned by a land mine.  His injuries made him unrecognizable and his experience (with both the injury and the war itself, generally) change his life.  The memoir follows his life as he returns to health and becomes a successful journalist.  Timberg is brutally honest about his own shortcomings (and is likely very forgiving about those of others).  Blue-Eyed Boy is a page turner--it is an engaging and quick read.

"Panic in a Suitcase is a goofy and entertaining novel that I think, based on the other reviews, will appeal to readers who get the Eastern European sense of humor.  The novel's self-deprecating humor is terrific and actually made me laugh out loud (which does not normally happen).  The Nasmertov family, the subject of this novel, are originally from Odessa, and most of them live in Brighton Beach, Brookllyn.  The novel takes place over about 20 years, from the 1990s to today.  This novel is really just about their lives--nothing big happens and there isn't much of a plot, so if you are looking for plot, keep searching.  If, however, you just want a really hilarious read about a quirky family, this novel should be your next read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1P2D1DI7IR9BK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594632146#wasThisHelpful","R1P2D1DI7IR9BK","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have not read a book that I loved this much in a long time.  I am telling everyone I know (or at least those over age 16 who like to read) that they must read this novel.  The novel struck me as a combination of The Leftovers, The Road and the MaddAddam trilogy; it's literary fiction dressed up as science fiction.  A global pandemic has killed most people on earth.  St John Mandel's novel does not focus on the horribleness of the deaths, but rather contrasts the pre-pandemic world, and it's trivialities and meaningless obsessions,  with the post-pandemic world, with the strive for survival and the art that survives.  This novel is very well done and has so many thoughtful and provocative themes.  I think this would make a great book club selection for the thinking person's book club.  Highly recommended!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1KVL03WYVZF6B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385353308#wasThisHelpful","R1KVL03WYVZF6B","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Short stories are hard.  I think it takes more talent and creativity to make a short story (and even moreso for a short story collection) to really work.  Justin Taylor's Flings is an example of that difficulty.  The stories in Flings are all fine but they lack the resonance to make them truly excellent.  While this collection has an inner cohesion (the lack of which is sometimes a problem in other collections), most of these stories lack the wow factor that would otherwise separate them from the pack.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2H8W6CE5YWIPQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062310151#wasThisHelpful","R2H8W6CE5YWIPQ","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Lucky Us is an interesting novel--Amy Bloom tells the story with a rather jaunty tone, despite the fact that the story is generally a sad one.  The tone saves the novel from being too depressing, and I think it takes a while for the reader to realize that optimism is not the prevailing mood here.  The story of Iris and Eva, half-sisters who start out in Ohio, live in Los Angeles for a while and finally end up in Long Island and England, meanders for a bit here and there, but it is unpredictable without being implausible.  In that sense, it is a little bit like life.  The characters are generally believable and their stories will stay with you for a while after reading this novel.  I enjoyed reading this novel.  I would recommend it to any reader who appreciates and is looking for something a little different.

"Abroad is an engrossing thriller in the ""ripped from the headlines"" style.  I enjoyed reading it, but will admit that I really did not know much about the Amanda Knox story on which it is clearly based.  The novel is narrated by Tabitha (Taz) and it becomes clear very early on in the novel that she is the dead girl in the story, narrating from some other dimension, as it were.  As the story unfolds, Taz drops hints and red herrings about what happened to her in her time abroad.  Taz is a young Irish woman studying in Italy and she develops a relationship with both her American flat mate and a few British fellow students.  The novel is an easy read and quite a page turner.  Katie Crouch has given some depth and texture to the story many are familiar with.  This is an engaging read.

As he regains his memory, he realizes the horror of his life.  He is a corporate lawyer, dealing with contract terms and conditions, working for his (evil) brother and dealing with his crumbling marriage.  Sounds awful, right?  It's hilarious.  I found myself reading passages aloud to colleagues I was travelling with because they were so hilarious.

This is the story of a family in and around the time of the Revolutionary War.  The novel shifts in time, heading backwards, which may not be everyone's cup of tea.  As the novel opens, we meet Tabitha and her father, John.  The next part of the novel jumps back in time to when Tabitha's parents met and also concerns a young slave who works for Helen,  John's wife.

"This water bottle is a very nice water bottle if you are interested in eradicating all plastic from your water sources.  The silicone covering is a nice touch and keeps the glass from clonking on any table.

I use this at my desk at work.  It keeps the water cool and is, in my opinion, aesthetically pleasing.

"Deena Goldstone's collection of stories, Tell Me One Thing is full of well-constructed, well-written stories that pack an emotional wallop.  There are two sets of stories that involve the same character (one set, a man dealing with the death of his father; the other set, a woman dealing with the sudden death of her husband) and a few others that are standalone stories.  Saying that the first three stories are about a man dealing with the death of his father (which I know I just did) does not begin to address the nuances and the actual arc of the first three stories.

"Two Soldiers is certainly a bleak read--it is the diametric opposite of a ""fun summer read"" and is certainly not ""destined to be a book club favorite.""  So, what is it?  A dark novel about young criminals in Stockholm, particularly the titular two soldiers, fatherless boys.  These young men assemble an army of other, younger teens and the whole lot of them have no respect for life.  The novel also follows the police as they try to track them down.  It is a quick read, but dark and bleak.  If that is what you are looking for, look no more.  If you are in the mood for something a little lighter, keep searching.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3IA94DYEFE09B/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1623651352#wasThisHelpful","R3IA94DYEFE09B","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The Enchanted is an interesting novel--a story of doomed indiiduals on death row and the doomed individuals in their lives.  The story is narrated by a gentleman on death row--he's the one who thinks the prison he is in is an ""enchanted"" place.  It is an odd notion to posit and frankly, a bit of a stretch.  The novel itself is well-written; that itself is enchanting (although the prison is more horrifying than anything else).  There are no happy stories in this novel, no happy characters.  Despite that, the novel is an quick, easy read, but does not feel superficial at all.  If you read the first couple of pages and are intrigued, keep reading.  It will be worth your while.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R354B3WVK2MTTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062285505#wasThisHelpful","R354B3WVK2MTTO","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Kristiana Kahakauwila's This is Paradise is an intelligently written, cohesive collection of stories that focus on the side of Hawaii that is not paradise.  From rape and murder to sickness and death to dingy streets with broken windows, the characters in these stories were born in Hawaii and although some have moved to the mainland, they all return for various reasons.  The stories have similar overarching themes and that makes reading this collection feel more like reading a novel than reading a disjointed collection of stories.  All of the stories are strong.  I enjoyed reading this evocative and visceral collection of stories.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3870Q1943JO1I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0770436250#wasThisHelpful","R3870Q1943JO1I","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Book of You is a middle of the road psychological thriller, well-written, but at the end of the day, it does not have enough surprises or twists to merit more than three stars.  The story is disturbing (but in a good way).  It revolves around a young woman, Clarissa, who is being stalked by a co-worker who is seemingly mentally unstable.  She is also on the jury of a disturbing rape trial while trying to escape from Rafe, her stalker.  The novel does a good job of highlighting the difficulties in distinguishing a stalker from a relationship in the eyes of others.  The plot itself was just too conventional and unsurprising.  I kept thinking that there needed to be a twist at some point, but the novel just headed in an unsurprising direction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RO6Q3KX6XGIVU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062297600#wasThisHelpful","RO6Q3KX6XGIVU","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Three Brothers is a fine story that somehow lacks that extra something to vault it into five star range.  Peter Ackroyd is a terrific writer and this novel of, appropriately, three brothers in 1960s London is a engaging read.  The story is presented with a little too much aloofness and it is hard to really care about these three brothers.  Ackroyd's writing and wit is so good that this aloofness does not detract too much from the strength of the novel.  If you are a fan of Ackroyd, this novel is definitely worth reading.  If you are new to Ackroyd, I think Chatterton is a better novel to start with.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2E5954EMVRLKG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385538618#wasThisHelpful","R2E5954EMVRLKG","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It is very clear at the beginnign of All Our Names, that someone in Dinah Mengestu's novel is not telling the entire truth. Both narrator's focus on a young African man named Isaac.  The first narrator, another African man, discusses knowing Isaac in Africa while the second narrator is an American woman, a social worker, who has a romantic relationship with Isaac in the US.  Mengestu has constructed an interesting tale, juxtapositioning the grinding violence in Africa with the more subtle racism in 1970s US.  Who is Isaac?  That is one of the central questions of the novel, and Mengestu gives the reader a bit of a clue with the novel's title.  All Our Names is an interesting, provocative and well-written novel.

"The Visionist is a compelling novel focused on a young girl who seeks refuge with an 1800s Shaker community in Massachusetts.  Polly escapes from her horrible father with her mother and brother.  Her mother leaves the two children with the local Shakers and, almost immediately, Polly is so moved that she has a seemingly mysticis seen as  a ""visionist""--her presence in the community is quite controversial--some adore her, others envy her.  The story shifts between three protagonists, Polly, Simon, an arson investigator who somehow becomes interested in her story and another woman in the Shaker community.  While the novel starts of slowly for the first chapters, once Polly escapes from her father, the pace of the novel picks up and it soon becomes quite compelling.  I enjoyed this novel, although I did feel some of the plot machinations to be a bit contrived and hard to believe.  Still an engaging read.

"Dept. of Speculation is a uniquely crafted story of a marriage, from courtship, to children, to the difficulties of any marriage.  Jenny Offill tells this story with a engaging, almost experimental, style.  Let's face it, the romantic boy meets girl saga has been told traditionally many times over.  Offill's narrative in Dept. of Speculation is fresh and innovative.  She gets to the heart of the matter without telling every detail.  In some sense her focus on a few details tells the story more clearly than a more exhaustive narrative would.  I recognize that this style won't be for everyone.  If you want a traditional romantic tale, keep searching.  If, however, you are in the mood for something a little different, I recommend Dept. of Speculation.

"Amy Greene's Long Man is an extremely well-constructed, if a little slow, novel that tells three intertwined stories.  The overarching story is of a small town in Tennessee when the Tennessee Valley Authority is constructed and a dam is about to flood most of the town, essentially destorying it with the waters from Long Man, a local river.  The pageturner story is of a missing young child, Gracie, who vanishes just before her family is supposed to leave.  The final story is of Amos, a local drifter who has returned to the town with his own destructive agenda.  Could he have taken Gracie?  Greene's tale, particularly the mystery of Gracie's disappearance is very well-woven, very well-resolved.  My only complaint about the book is that the story is very slow to develop.  The writing is beautiful, of course, and there is much joy in reading the novel.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LF00IKNUSAGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307593436#wasThisHelpful","R2LF00IKNUSAGC","A4R8GJX3UZ1I","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A4R8GJX3UZ1I?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

The story is a family drama--but one told with a little bit a humor, which makes it so readable.

"Francine Prose's Lovers at the Chameleon Club, Paris 1932 is a fabulous novel.  Prose has crafted a rich tapestry of a tale, filled with intriguing characters and provocative ideas.  The story has multiple narrators,most of whom are crafting their memoirs years after the action in the novel takes place, although there are some contemporaneous narrations as well.  Each narrator has a different perspective and a different reason for masking or distorting the truth, and it seems as if no one is telling the whole truth.  The story revolves around a group of people in Paris from the late 1920s through the 1940s, although some of the narration takes place well after that.

Unremarried Widow is a compelling read, but it will break your heart.  Henderson is so human, so likeable and even though you know what is going to happen to her husband, it is still devastating.

One of the interesting pleasures of this novel is solving the mysteries of her history as well as her current situation.

"You can get brighter bicycle headlights if you spend more, but no matter how bright you go, it's still ruled by ""he who has eyes, let him see"".  Some people won't see you no matter if you put a light that blazes with the fire of a thousand suns.  This light is more that bright enough to get you noticed by anyone actually paying attention.What makes this light different is that it lights your path incredibly well.

"Note that this bike does not match the description in the following ways:- It does not have the updated NEOS derailleur- It does not have an 11-30T cassette; it is 12-28T- It does not have Dahon Roulez tires.  They are Dahon RotoloThat said, this is a great bike.  I received a HASA 6 speed folding bike for Christmas and rode it a few times before it broke and I sent it back.  I ride both a mountain bike and a cyclocross bike in addition to the folder.  The Dahon Speed D7 is much better to ride than the HASA and every bit as fun to ride as my full-size bikes.The geometry of the D7 is terrific  You really do feel like you're riding a big bike. The only difference is that the Dahon is more responsive to steering due to the tire size. The seatpost goes higher than the HASA I had (I'm 5'9"") and this made a big difference to adjust to the best fit for me.I looked into a number of brands and models before I got the Dahon, and I don't think you can find a better balance of performance and convenience for the money.  The Dahon Speed P8 looks like a great upgrade from the D7, but doesn't come with fenders or a rear rack.  Add those in and it's a big jump in price.  Tern bikes seem good but the lower-priced models don't seem to put performance as a priority.  If you want more relaxed ride at a $400-500 price point then Tern can do that (Dahon also has models that fit here).  But you won't find a fast decked-out commuter ride anywhere near this price elsewhere.If the price is the same between Amazon and others (e.g., ThorUSA is a reputable dealer sells on Amazon), get the latest model from someone else.  But if you can get a deal over other sellers, don't hesitate to buy it.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RUJKZ6AYFL9NI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00B8062NK#wasThisHelpful","RUJKZ6AYFL9NI","A32WID0VHTB7HQ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A32WID0VHTB7HQ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"One of my favorite quotations -- one that I've used before as a book review epigraph -- comes from the 1962 movie ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.""  It's probably my favorite Western, with a marvelous cast, including the luminous Vera Miles.  (I had a crush on Ms. Miles, who played Marion Crane's (played by Janet Leigh) sister  in ""Psycho"").The quotation comes at the end of the John Ford-helmed film, starring John Wayne and James Stewart: Stewart plays idealistic  lawyer Ransom Stoddard, who is credited with killing bully and all-round bad guy Liberty Valance, played by Lee Marvin. (Spoiler) Valance was actually killed by rancher Tom Doniphon, played to perfection by Wayne,  firing at the same time as the novice shooter Ranse Stoddard. The exchange occurs decades later, at the funeral of Doniphon, where newspaper editor Maxwell Scott, learning who killed Valance,  decides to stick with the original story -- that Stoddard killed Valance:Ransome Stoddard: You're not going to use the story, Mr. Scott?Maxwell Scott:  No, sir. This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.In the case of Thomas Jonathan ""Stonewall"" Jackson (1824-1863) so much of the legend has become fact that it was with delight that I read S.C. Gwynne's ""Rebel Yell: The Violence, Passion, and Redemption of Stonewall Jackson"" (Scribner, 688 pages, illustrations, notes, appendixes, bibliography, $35.00).I've reviewed many books on the Civil War, and this is far and away the best biography of a Civil War general that  I've read. Gwynne's book represents research on a monumental scale -- befitting a man who is immortalized on an actual monument, the Stone Mountain (GA) one, along with Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis.""Rebel Yell"" is about transformation, Austin, TX, resident Gwynne said in an interview published in his hometown newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman. Gwynne was particularly struck by how Thomas J. Jackson went from being an eccentric and unsuccessful science professor at Virginia Military Institute (VMI)  to becoming the skilled general leading the Confederate forces in the Shenandoah Valley campaign -- in a mere 14 months.If I had to pick any place in Virginia to live, I'd probably pick Lexington. I've been there and, along with Blacksburg, it's one of my favorite towns in the Old Dominion. In addition to Washington and Lee University, the town of only 7,000 is also home to VMI. Both Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson are buried in Lexington.Born in Clarksburg, VA, (later West Virginia), Jackson lacked the aristocratic lineage of Robert E. Lee, but he ended up being the general Lee trusted the most.One of the legends of the Civil War is that all of the Confederate generals were outstanding -- exemplifying what today could be called the ""Lake Woebegone Effect.""  Gwynne explodes that myth by describing incompetent Rebel generals who were almost as bad as Union commander George B. McClellan (1826-1885).  Many of the colleagues -- and opponents -- of Jackson like him served in the Mexican War.I knew that Jackson came from what later (June 20, 1863) became West Virginia, the only state that seceded from an existing state,  but I wasn't aware of all the details of his upbringing and family. I didn't know that his sister, Laura Jackson Arnold, was loyal to the Union. In the appendix entry on what became of the characters in the book after the war, Gwynne notes that Laura became one of two women awarded membership in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a Union veterans association. She died at age 80 in Buckhannon, WV in 1911.Gwynne's portraits of the generals who fought with and against Jackson are worth the price of the book. I kept thinking that if Lincoln had picked fellow Illinoisan U.S. Grant from the start, the war would have been over in a few months. (Yes, I know that Grant was an Ohio native and Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but it was in Illinois that that both men achieved their fame).Displayed in the campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley and later at both battles of Bull Run (Manassas to the Confederates);  Antietam (Sharpsburg to the Confederates};  Fredricksburg,  and his final battle, Chancellorsville, Jackson's tactics struck fear into the hearts of the Union generals who opposed him, often  to the point where they considered him almost supernatural. Jackson also impressed foreign visitors and military observers, especially those from England. If you extrapolate enough, Stonewall Jackson was a big influence on Union generals as diverse as George H. Thomas and William T. Sherman.Stonewall Jackson was shot on May 2, 1863, during the battle of Chancellorsville, by Confederate pickets. His left arm was amputated and he had injuries in his right arm. At first he appeared to be on the road to recovery, but his condition worsened and he died of pneumonia on May 10, 1863. He was only 39 years old. His last words were: ""Let us cross over the river, and rest under the shade of the trees.""Gwynne doesn't indulge in hagiography; Jackson's faults are covered. He was a deeply religious Presbyterian, a deacon even, but often his faith made him judgmental, blowing up incidents to the point where they seemed to be coming from a madman. His 1851 altercation with a fellow army officer named French in a military post in central Florida (today's Polk County) named, ironically after Union general George Meade, the hero of Gettysburg, is a case in point. He saw French walking one day with a young female servant and jumped to the conclusion that his fellow officer was an adulterer.Gwynne devotes considerable space to this and other incidents showing the judgmental beyond belief Jackson.  Stonewall Jackson was quick to censure officers under his command, often ruining their careers for reasons that seem to be trivial. On the other hand, this enigmatic man was a loving husband to his first wife, Elinor ""Ellie"" Junkin Jackson -- who died in childbirth --  and later to his second wife, Anna, the mother of his only surviving child, Julia.If you're a Civil War buff -- as I am -- or if you're just interested in wonderful biographies --as I am -- ""Rebel Yell"" is a must-read book. It reads like a novel, but it's based on extensive beyond belief research.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RB5QE2MJ9ILFL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451673280#wasThisHelpful","RB5QE2MJ9ILFL","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's appropriate, given that this year is the centennial of the start of the Great War -- later World War I -- that newspaperman Christopher Marlowe Cobb continues to be a larger than life figure in the third entry in the Kit Marlowe historical novel series by Robert Olen Butler: ""The Empire of Night"" (Mysterious Press, 384 pages, $26.00).In the first entry, ""The Hot Country"" Kit Cobb is battling German agents and Mexican bandits early in 1914 to get the story for his Chicago newspaper.In the second installment, ""The Star of Istanbul"",  Cobb survives the 1915 sinking of the British ocean liner, Lusitania, to continue his spying and news reporting. He packs a mean Corona 3 typewriter -- not to mention his Mauser pocket pistol.In ""The Empire of Night"" it's well into 1915 and Kit is now more spy than newspaper correspondent (his cover) as he's delegated by President Woodrow Wilson's spymaster Trask to see what the British and the Germans are up to.He's working undercover in a castle on the coast of Kent, not far from the White Cliffs of Dover, trying to determine what the castle's owner, Sir Albert Stockman is up to. Stockman, originally of German descent, may be a secret agent of the Kaiser. To his surprise, Kit discovers that his beautiful, 50-something mother, world renowned actress Isabel Cobb, has made another amorous conquest: Stockman.Starring in a touring production of Hamlet -- dressed as a man, playing Hamlet -- Isabel's offstage role is to keep tabs on the supposed mole, who's not only an ardent fan of Shakespeare but a man in love. We have the intriguing spectacle of a mother-son spy team.One evening, Isabel Cobb and Stockman leave the seaside castle, heading for Germany. The Germans are using zeppelins -- like the LZ 129 Hindenburg (Luftschiff Zeppelin #129) that exploded in New Jersey on May 6, 1937 -- to bomb London.I won't give away any more of the plot of this elegant thriller, other than to say that Kit Cobb, using the alias of Joseph Hunter, is using his foreign correspondent cover to spy on Stockman and the Germans. This means that Kit Cobb will have to follow Isabel and Albert to the German capital, Berlin.Like the previous two Kit Cobb entries, ""The Empire of Night"" is a meticulously researched page-turner that will appeal to spy novel buffs and lovers of historical novels, as well as any general reader intrigued with the power struggles of World War I. If you've never read a novel by Butler -- one of the great stylists writing today -- you're in for a treat with ""The Empire of Night.""","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3Q5VGJI37NV18/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0802123236#wasThisHelpful","R3Q5VGJI37NV18","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHENAstute readers of the William Monk detective novels by Anne Perry can always relate the events of the books set in the 1860s with today's headlines. ""Blood on the Water"" (Ballantine Books, 320 pages, $26.00), the twentieth novel in the series, is no exception.It's 1865 in London. While on patrol on the River Thames, Commander William Monk of the River Police witnesses an explosion on board the pleasure boat Princess Mary. The explosion is so severe that Monk himself is blown into the water.Some 200 people die immediately or shortly thereafter in an explosion that, as the investigation later discovers, uses the new Swedish invention dynamite. Monk begins his investigation -- only to find shortly thereafter that the case has been taken over by Sir John Lydiate, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, no friend of Monk.The Home Office, in charge of the police, apparently believes that because of the important people who died in the explosion, Lydiate is better suited to handle the case, even though the logical investigative body is the River Police.An Egyptian man, Habib Beshara, is quickly arrested, tried and sentenced to die. Monk tries to convince Lydiate and the Home Office that Beshara, who may have been involved in the plot, couldn't possibly have acted alone.Could the crime be connected with the soon-to-be opened Suez Canal, which would impact the British shipping industry and its ports in South Africa, among other places? Or was it an act of revenge for the continuing British colonial activities in Egypt, the Sudan and other places? (Historical note: Construction delays and diseases resulted in the 102 mile long canal -- connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea -- opening in November 1869, four years behind schedule).Ably assisted  his wife, Hester, Scuff, their more or less adopted street lad, and his old friend, disbarred lawyer Sir Oliver Rathbone, Monk vows to find answers  but instead finds himself treading the dangerous waters of international intrigue, his questions politely -- and not so politely -- turned aside by a formidable array of the powerful and privileged.Monk is convinced that he's on the trail of the perpetrators, when the small ferry boat he's on is rammed and Monk and the ferryman are almost killed. In an about-face, the case reverts to the force that should have handled the investigation in the first place, the Thames River Police.All the Monk novels feature outstanding character delineation and twists and turns.  ""Blood on the Water"" is no exception. It's an outstanding historical novel, as are all of Perry's works.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QZV1IOG2VP8H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345548434#wasThisHelpful","R2QZV1IOG2VP8H","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"If you visit the United Kingdom, be sure to include the northern city of York on your itinerary. I visited the ancient Roman city in 1979 and was enthralled by its setting at the confluence of the Ouse and Foss rivers and its architecture, including the York Minster and the remnants of the walls and gates like Micklegate.I think only Chester, which I also visited, rivals York for its Roman heritage. And, while you're in York, don't forget to visit the Shambles, a picturesque street of overhanging buildings, that was once an open-air slaughterhouse!Smallish (about 130,000 people) York has never been intimidated by the giant city in the south of England, London, and this pride extends to its role in the history of British Freemasonry.Historian David Harrison, whose books on Freemasonry I've regularly reviewed, tells this story in a new quality paperback, ""The York Grand Lodge"" (Arima Publishing, Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England, 144 pages, illustrations, appendixes, index, $16.00, available from Amazon.com).Like all of Harrison's books, the story of the staunchly independent Grand Lodge of All England at York, is both scholarly and readable. Harrison is a Mason; I'm not, but I'm fascinated by secret societies and alternative styles of living like the Amish, Quakers, Shakers, Mennonites, Mormons,  etc. and by ""Utopian"" communities like Brook Farm, Amana, Oneida, and New Harmony.  ""The York Grand Lodge"" also appealed to my interest in historical disputes.The London-based United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE) prevailed, but, as Harrison points out, the York Grand Lodge may have survived longer than originally thought and it also influenced that other northern lodge of rebellious Freemasons,  The Wigan Grand Lodge.Remnants of the Yorkists and their approach to Freemasonry  have surfaced in the 21st Century, as Harrison points out on pages 120-122 in the conclusion of his entertaining book.To clarify the differences in the U.S. between the York Rite and the Scottish Rite, I emailed Harrison. Here's his reply:""Scottish Rite is divided into the northern and southern jurisdictions in the US, they have 33 degrees.The York Rite is more of a collection of Masonic approved rites and orders such as the Royal Arch, Knights Templar and Mark degree. Again it's a US body.Some Masons are so keen they do both 'pathways': they progress from the normal blue or craft lodges ( the three main degrees) to enter other orders or grades. Albert Pike was a member if the Scottish Rite Southern jurisdiction - a 33rd degree Mason.""  * * *Who is Albert Pike, you ask: According to Wikipedia, ""Pike published a book called 'Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry' in 1871, of which there were several subsequent editions. Pike is still regarded in America as an eminent and influential Freemason, primarily only in the Scottish Rite Southern Jurisdiction."" Pike (1809-1891) was a native of Boston, MA who joined the Confederate Army in the Civil War after long service in the U.S. Army. He reached the rank of brigadier general (one star) in the Confederate Army.Here's what Harrison has to say about his new book:""The York Grand Lodge book was a pleasure to research; I visited the ancient city of York in northern England a number of times and I wanted to visit the places that the York Masons of the eighteenth century visited, places like the Punch Bowl tavern and the Merchant Adventurers' Hall. It was an honour to research the York Grand Lodge manuscripts, examine the Jacobite links of some of the Grand Masters and look at the Knights Templar ciphers. I thoroughly enjoyed writing the book, and I hope you enjoy reading it.""I certainly enjoyed reading Dr. Harrison's latest book and I think many readers will find it informative and enjoyable.

"I'm always happy to see a book for young readers that teaches a valuable lesson, and  Loren Long's ""Otis and the Scarecrow"" (Philomel Books, an imprint of Penguin Group (U.S.A), 40 pages, written and illustrated by Long, $17.99) accomplishes this goal with aplomb.It's big, square format book that's perfect for solo readers ages 3 to 5 and for adults reading aloud. It's the sixth entry in Long's Otis the friendly farm tractor series. Growing up on a Michigan farm, I never thought of our three tractors as particularly friendly, but Long transforms these mechanical workhorses into a lovable creature called Otis.From the publisher:""On the farm where Otis the tractor lives, the farmer has introduced someone new  a scarecrow to shoo away the pesky crows. But when Otis and the animals greet the scarecrow with friendly smiles, the scarecrows frown never leaves his face. So everyone leaves him alone.""Then one day, when a cold autumn rain sets in, Otis and the animals snuggle close and play Otiss favorite game: the quiet game. Otis knows the puppy and ducks cant sit still for long, and soon the farm friends begin to giggle and squirm, feeling warmed by one anothers friendship . . . but on this day, Otis can't seem to take his eyes off the lonely figure in the cornfield.""A deeply resonant book about subtle acts of compassion and standing up for others, featuring everyone's favorite tractor, Otis.""A story featuring a big-hearted, compassionate tractor like Otis is a  good a way of teaching young children about the values that humans so often don't practice. In an age where bullying -- particularly via electronic devices and ""social"" websites -- has become all too common by even very young children, the lesson that Otis teaches the other farm creatures -- and by, extension, readers of this book is particularly valuable.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R19PNODDKP7RNY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0399163964#wasThisHelpful","R19PNODDKP7RNY","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BOOK REVIEW: 'Please Stop Helping Us': Black Conservative Deconstructs Unintended Consequences of Affirmative Action, Minimum Wage Laws, Public SchoolsREVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHENEver since it was published in June, Jason L. Riley's ""Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed"" (Encounter Books, 184 pages, index, $23.99) has been attacked by the liberal establishment and black talking heads who continue to deliver the ""It's not our fault, it's white racism"" argument as an explanation for lack of progress for African-Americans. They pour boiling oil on Bill Cosby and Riley and others who call for an end to destructive black culture that despises intellectual activity and extolls the gansta hip-hop culture.At the end of this review, I'm including a HuffPost Live interview of Riley; I'm doing this to make this review as fair and balanced as possible.  I say this as I argue that I'm 100 percent with Riley, who has also been attacked because he's married to a white woman, New York Post columnist Naomi Shaefer-Riley. I haven't seen similar attacks on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who's married to an African-American.I've often wondered about liberals -- including Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama -- extolling the benefits of inner city public education -- while sending their own children to private schools like Sidwell-Friends in Washington, DC. Riley makes this point, too, in arguing for more education choices for urban African-American parents and their children.African-Americans deserve as many choices as affluent liberals who tell blacks to support public schools and then go and send their kids to expensive private schools, Riley argues. He tackles the argument -- made by liberals who support teachers' unions because the teachers' unions -- both the AFL-CIO one, AFT,  and NEA -- support Democratic candidates -- that charter schools and voucher programs harm the traditional public schools that most minority and low-income students attend. This argument says that charter schools and voucher programs siphon off from public schools the best and the brightest. Riley says that most inner city schools are staffed by union members who care more about job security than educating their students.What about other unions? Riley gives his readers a historical look at unions and how the traditional AFL craft unions refused to admit blacks and came up with minimum-wage laws and legislation like the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DavisBacon_Act) were originally intended to prevent the employment of cheaper non-union African-American workers from the South.What about affirmative action programs? Don't they help blacks? No, says Riley, who says that well-intentioned affirmative action programs for higher education designed to address past discrimination actually results in mismatching black students to highly selective schools like the University of California-Berkeley, where they are destined to fail because of the poor education they received in inner-city public schools. The result is fewer black college graduates than would otherwise exist. Too, he writes, affirmative action isn't working in highly selective public universities because Asian-American students outperform whites, blacks and Hispanic students.In a particularly touching example of how much of black culture denigrates learning as ""acting white,"" Riley quotes basketball great  Kareen Abdul Jabbar -- back when he was still Lew Alcindor -- describing his experiences as a studious kid at a predominantly black Catholic school in Philadelphia in the 1950s (Pages 42-43):""I got there and immediately found I could read better than anyone in the school. My father's example and my mother's training had made that come easy. I could pick up a book, read it out loud, pronounce the words with proper inflection and actually know what they meant. When the nuns found this out they paid me a lot of attentionwhen the kids found this out, I became a target.""Riley describes how, when living in his hometown of Buffalo, NY and living and working  in the DC area, he was profiled by police. He says he understands the profiling, because of the overwhelming disproportionality of blacks committing crimes. He says that abolishing stop-and-frisk laws and being soft on crime makes crime-ridden  majority black enclaves even more dangerous.To those who believe that Jason Riley is another black mouthing white racist ideology, I say read the book and look at the facts. As the saying goes, ""you are entitled to your opinions, but not your facts.""Jason Riley on Huffington Post discussing his book: http://live.huffingtonpost.com/r/segment/jason-l-riley-wall-street-journal/53ac7e0578c90a076700012e","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2OH4IY4GK78V8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594037256#wasThisHelpful","R2OH4IY4GK78V8","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHENIf there's a social problem or addiction that isn't dealt with in ""Rumble"" ( Margaret K. McElderry Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster's Children's Publishing Division, 560 pages, $19.99), Ellen Hopkins' young adult novel set in the greater Eugene, Oregon area, I was hard pressed to find it.Hopkins -- the New York Times' bestselling author of ""Crank"" and ""Smoke"" and several other Y.A. titles -- focuses on the Turner family, specifically Matthew ""Matt"" Turner, an 18-year-old high school senior in Cottage Grove, OR, who's still grieving over the suicide of his younger brother Luke.Luke, a standout freshman basketball player and sweet kid who idolized Matt, hanged himself after being outed as gay on social media and was subsequently bullied by his high school classmates (don't get me started on the horrors caused by the improper use of Facebook, Twitter and all the other electronic forms of poisoning the air! And don't get me started on the inherent meanness of many teens!)Matt's dad, Wyatt Turner, was a standout basketball player for the University of Oregon (the ""Ducks"") and now teaches science and coaches the basketball teams. Matt believes his dad's homophobic comments contributed to Luke's suicide, but he blames his former best friend Vince for posting the photoshopped pictures that outed Luke.Matt's atheism has become public with an essay he wrote for an English class that has gone viral. Even his therapist has a copy of an essay Matt believed to be private. In the document he writes that Luke's death proves that there is no God: There is no God, no benevolent ruler of the earth, no omnipotent grand poobah of countless universes. Because if there was...my little brother would still be fishing or playing basketball instead of fertilizing cemetery vegetation.Despite his lack of belief in a higher power, Matt is in love with a believing Christian classmate, Hayden. He's also attracted to Hayden's former best friend Alexa. Matt discovers that his disintegrating family is even more dysfunctional that he thought, with his dad having an affair with the woman he was in love with before he met and impregnated Matt's and Luke's mom. His mom, a real estate agent, is clearly an alcoholic, as is his dad. Matt's uncle, Middle East war veteran Jessie Turner, who operates a gun range, has a veteran customer who suffers from PTSD. This customer, Gus, plays a pivotal role in the novel.Everybody tells Matt to let go, to put the death of his beloved little brother behind him, to pick up the threads of his life. But it's easier said than done for the troubled teen.While ""Rumble"" is squarely aimed at Y.A. readers, I believe adults -- particularly parents of teens -- can benefit from reading it. Hopkins has the understanding of a therapist and the skill of a bestselling writer to put issues before readers. She's a baby boomer, but she thoroughly understands the younger demographic groups. Plus, the book is a page turner! Don't let the big page count scare you: Hopkins keeps the narrative moving quickly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R22JJJBNKWT7T8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1442482842#wasThisHelpful","R22JJJBNKWT7T8","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"""But they are all terrorists, aren't they?"" -- President-elect Ronald Reagan at a Nov. 19, 1980 briefing by CIA operatives who tried to explain the different Palestinian factions involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict (Pages 249-50) in ""The Good Spy""  * * *That comment by Reagan provoked eye-rolling by members of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), says Kai Bird in his magnificent account of Robert C. Ames (1934-1983) in ""The Good Spy: The Life and Death of Robert Ames"" (Crown Publishers, 448 pages, photos, maps, notes, bibliography, index, $26.00) but later events -- including the April 18, 1983 suicide truck bombing of the American Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon that killed Ames and 62 others -- may make Reagan's comment more prescient than the nuanced formulations of more sophisticated intelligence operatives.Bird says the bombing was carried out by Shi'a Muslims led by a young intelligence officer of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, who -- amazingly -- was provided a new identity by the U.S. and is alive today in the U.S.In a summation in the epilogue, Bird says: ""Robert Ames believed that a real peace was possible [in the Middle East]. The Middle East need not remain a perennial battlefield. He used his intelligence and charm to begin the peace process in the shadows of Beirut. His clandestine work was a catalyst for that symbolic handshake on the White House lawn. He was the good spy. But his work remains unfinished."" (Page 355).The April 18, 1983 attack was a geopolitical turning point, says Bird. It marked the beginning of Hezbollah as a political force. Even more important, it eliminated Americas most influential and effective intelligence officer in the Middle East  Robert Ames.What set Ames apart from his peers among the Arabists at the CIA was his extraordinary ability to form deep, meaningful connections with key Arab intelligence figures. Some operatives relied on threats and subterfuge, but Ames worked by building friendships and emphasizing shared values  never more notably than with Yasir Arafats charismatic intelligence chief and heir apparent Ali Hassan Salameh (aka The Red Prince).Ames came from a working class Philadelphia background and fell in love with Arab culture much the same way that Englishman T. E. Lawrence (""Lawrence of Arabia"") did decades earlier.While many C.I.A. operatives considered places like Yemen, Aden, and Saudi Arabia, ""hell-holes"" -- preferring London, Paris and other locales -- Ames welcomed postings to places where he could interact with the locals.Senior Mossad -- the Israeli counterpart of the CIA -- agent Yoram Hessel called the 6'-3"" tall Ames ""an American Lawrence [of Arabia ] a Lawrence with with Stars and Stripes."" (T.E. Lawrence was about a foot shorter than Ames).Hessel and other Mossad operatives got along much better with Ames than they did with other CIA Arabists. But Hessel said of Ames that his love of Arabs and their language and culture came ""with considerable baggage.Empathy in intelligence can be dangerous  An intelligence officer is not an advocate. When Ames came to Tel Aviv, his job was to listen -- and to see if what he knew measured up to reality. But he was clearly emotionally involved with the Arab world. We were always aware that he was presenting things through a certain lens. We didn't see him as an adversary -- but he certainly came from a different place."" (Pages 240-241).Ames deepening relationship with Salameh held the potential for a lasting peace. Within a few years, though, both men were killed by assassins, and Americas relations with the Arab world began heading down a path that culminated in 9/11, the War on Terror, and the current fog of mistrust.Bird was a natural to write the story of Robert C. Ames, not to be confused with CIA counterspy Aldrich Hazen Ames, who was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union and Russia to fund his living beyond his means lifestyle.Bird -- who knew Bob Ames as a neighbor when he was twelve years old, when Bird's father was a foreign service officer in Saudi Arabia -- spent years researching ""The Good Spy.""Bird says at the beginning that he didn't get official cooperation from the CIA, but he did interview dozens of CIA operatives -- many of whom are disguised with pseudonyms -- as well as current and former Israeli and Palestinian intelligence officers. He was given the first access to hundreds of Ames' private letters by Yvonne Ames, his widow. Bird was the first journalist or historian Yvonne Ames spoke to.""The Good Spy"" reads like a spy novel, and like the best spy novels, it's based on solid research. I fell in love with Kai Bird's writing when I read and reviewed his biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, ""American Prometheus"" more than nine years ago.I rank ""The Good Spy"" with Lawrence Wright's 2006 ""The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11"" as essential books that one must read to understand the realities of the Middle East.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3KGDNHX3D1GQ4/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307889750#wasThisHelpful","R3KGDNHX3D1GQ4","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The old saying that no man is a hero to his valet applies equally to a man's -- or woman's -- bodyguards. Security people have to be alert 24/7 to protect their clients from just about everybody. But can they protect the client from himself?in ""Remember the Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days"" (Weinstein Books, 336 pages, $26.00) Bill Whitfield and Javon Beard (with Tanner Colby) write that Michael Jackson was often his own worst enemy, failing to maintain control over his managers. Often, this lack of control by ""The King of Pop"" led to Whitfield and Beard not getting paid and falling behind on their utility bills and maxing out their personal credit cards.Like Jackson, both Whitfield and Beard  were single fathers and the erratic beyond description of their employer resulted in disrupted family lives. They were on call all the time, responding to Jackson's sudden impulses led them to buy all the classical CDs in a Best Buy or all the books in a used bookstore. (Jackson listened to classical music exclusively in the SUVs that took him about his duties and he was an omnivorous reader.)Jackson's immense fortune was tied up by lawsuits and contractual agreements, but he kept large amounts of cash on hand, the authors tell us. He used the money to help homeless people, but his bodyguards often had to resort to Top Ramen and canned soup for their meals when their per diem for meals was mysteriously cut off and they were weeks behind in their salaries.Jackson wanted his children to have a normal life, but that was an impossible dream as the family moved from luxury house to luxury house in Las Vegas, Middleburg, VA and Los Angeles. Jackson was a compulsive shopper, but many of his purchases ended up in storage units around the country, unopened.Whitfield, a former police officer, and Beard, a young, relatively green rookie, in alternating paragraphs reveal the facts of Jackson's last years:  his life in seclusion with his children, his financial crises, his preparations for the This Is It tour, and the weeks leading up to his death at age 50 in Los Angeles on June 25, 2009.Driven by a desire to show the world who Michael Jackson truly was, Whitfield and Beard have produced the only definitive, first-person account of Michael Jackson's last years: the extreme measures necessary to protect Jackson and his family, the simple moments of happiness they managed to share in a time of great stress, the special relationship Jackson shared with his fans, and the tragic events that culminated in the singer's ill-fated comeback, This Is It. The truth is far more compelling than anything you've yet heard.I think the two men -- and their talented co-author, Tanner Colby -- succeeded in their effort to show the man behind the myth that was Jackson. They say that ""Mr. Jackson"" -- that's how they addressed him -- was not ""The King of Pop"". That was his stage identity. They use the reference to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of Robert Louis Stevenson to differentiate the two sides of Michael Jackson.","3.0 out of 5 stars","June 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1HAH13R3IWS62/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1602862508#wasThisHelpful","R1HAH13R3IWS62","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHENIf you want information about Freemasonry, until now you've had the Internet -- with a mishmash of information of dubious quality, not to mention all kinds of conspiracy theories -- or a laborious search through dusty tomes in libraries.All this has changed as David Harrison, an author whose books on Freemasonry I've reviewed (see below) has written the perfect guide to the subject with his ""A Quick Guide to Freemasonry"" (Lewis Masonic, Hersham, Surrey, UK,  96 pages, black and white and color illustrations, $16.95, available on Amazon.com).This quality paperback is beautifully printed on glossy paper in a handy double-column format and has the answers to just about every question a new member would ask. It's also aimed at lodge mentors and established members, Harrison told me.And, to make it useful for traveling Freemasons, it has information on the Craft as it's practiced in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Harrison uses a Q and A format for his questions. If you want to know about the rolled up pants leg, you'll find it here. Different colored aprons? Harrison explains their significance. White gloves and hats? It's in the book. Harrison provides end notes and a bibliography. I found the FAQs to be very useful, and rituals in the UK and the U.S. are given proper attention -- along with the aforementioned sections on Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Harrison covers the roles of the officers, the festive board, toasting, and an examination of all the current English Masonic rituals: Emulation, Bottomley, Nigerian, the Bristol, York and Hull working. Effectively, the handbook is an easy-to-understand beginners guidea why, how, and when of Craft Freemasonry.And, to top off an excellent work, Harrison includes reliable web sites for Internet searchers -- a valuable resource! I recommend ""A Quick Guide to Freemasonry"" to members of the Craft, as well as those outside the Craft who want accurate information about Freemasonry. Did I say it's beautifully designed and printed? Yes, I know I did! But it's worth repeating; this is a handsome book that would make an ideal gift: a gift that would be appreciated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 4, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JGH80D088MDV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0853184402#wasThisHelpful","R2JGH80D088MDV","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHEN""L'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace."" -- General George S. Patton and his alter ego, Napoleon,  made ""Audacity, audacity, always audacity"" a famous phrase encouraging bold courage in the face of great challenge. John Bell Hood displayed many of the qualities of Patton -- something recognized by his battlefield foes including Gen. George H. Thomas, who defeated Hood's forces at Nashville in the closing weeks of 1864.  * * *""God alone knows the future, but only an historian can alter the past"" -- Ambrose Bierce;  chosen by Stephen M. Hood as the epigraph for the IntroductionWhat is there about Confederate General John Bell Hood (1831-1879)  that made historians and many of his fellow Confederate comrades in arms want tear him down? This destruction was taking place at the same time Union commanders praised the leadership qualities of the Kentucky native who is forever linked to his service on the frontier in Texas.  The sprawling Fort Hood army base in central Texas is named for John Bell Hood.Stephen M. ""Sam"" Hood of Huntington WV devotes an entire book ""John Bell Hood: The Rise, Fall, and Resurrection of a Confederate General"" (Savas Beatie LLC, Eldorado Hills, CA, 384 pages, $32.95) to setting the record straight on Hood, who resigned after his army was defeated by Union Gen. George H. Thomas at Nashville, Tenn. at the end of 1864. Sam Hood's tome -- the product of ten years of exhaustive research, with access to previously undiscovered documents --  is the latest in a series of books that aim to resurrect John Bell Hood to his proper place in the pantheon of Civil War generals.In his lengthy and informative foreword to Sam Hood's book about his collateral ancestor, Thomas J. Brown, who died before the book was published, blames much of the criticism of Gen. John Bell Hood on the ""Lost Cause"" ideology practiced by Virginians. They needed a scapegoat and the general who dared to comment on the battlefield shortcomings of Gen. Joseph E. Johnston was targeted by the Virginians as a scapegoat.  Johnston, born in Farmville, VA in 1807, outlived Hood by more than a decade, dying in 1891. That gave Johnston plenty of time to build up his reputation and tear down that of Hood. It's no secret that Virginians considered themselves a cut above the other states of the Confederacy.Too, there's the matter of the departure of the Southern Historical Society from the South's largest city, New Orleans, to the former Confederate capital, Richmond, VA. The society was formed in New Orleans, where Hood moved after the war, but left for Richmond in 1873. Hood was a businessman in New Orleans and died in 1879 of yellow fever along with his wife. His memoir ""Advance and Retreat: Personal Experiences in the United States and Confederate States Armies"" was  published posthumously tin 1880.In the introduction -- which should be carefully read, please don't skip it -- the author says  that ""some reviewers might call it [the book] a hagiography of General Hood and say that it lacks balance. In fact, this book does not require balance because it represents the balance that is missing from most modern books and articles that have been published about Hood and his tenure as commander of the Army of Tennessee.""Acknowledging that most Civil War history buffs will read books by authors like Wiley Sword, James McDonough, Thomas Connelly, and others,  Hood says his wish is that readers use his book in conjunction with those who've portrayed General Hood in an unfavorable light. The author describes the battles fought by Hood and his armies, noting in details the errors and distortions historians used to demolish John Bell Hood's reputation.I was as shocked as the fictional Captain Renault in the classic movie ""Casablanca"" to find that Hood's published version of many of the major events and controversies of his Confederate military career were met with scorn and skepticism. Some described his memoirs as nothing more than a polemic against his arch-rival Joseph E. Johnston. The publisher, on the Savas Beatie website,  notes that ""These unflattering opinions persisted throughout the decades and reached their nadir in 1992, when an influential author described Hood's memoirs as 'merely a bitter, misleading, and highly distorted treatise' replete with 'distortions, misrepresentations, and outright falsifications.' Without any personal papers to contradict them, many historians and writers portrayed Hood as an inept and dishonest opium addict and a conniving, vindictive cripple of a man. One writer went so far as to brand him 'a fool with a license to kill his own men.' What most readers don't know is that nearly all of these authors misused sources, ignored contrary evidence, and/or suppressed facts sympathetic to Hood.""This is the first time I've seen the author's debunking of the myths surrounding Hood --  and I found it refreshing. Writing history is as much of an art as it is a science, maybe more art than science, so it's important that opinions in history books be backed up by facts on the ground, or on the  battlefield in the case of war histories.Stephen M. Hood expected his work would be met with derision by historians --- and was pleasantly surprised when it was praised and honored. The book  was selected as the 2014 winner of the Albert Castel Book Award.The award is given biennially by the Kalamazoo Civil War Round Table to authors writing on the subject of the Civil War in the Western Theater.According to reviewing members of the Kalamazoo CWRT:The voluminous inclusion of citations to historical documents and other primary source material challenge previous interpretations of Hoods military actions. A look back at past author's interpretations of John Bell Hoods record reveals the biases, inventions, and myths that have darkly colored his Civil War reputation. This book refutes the aspersions of historians to name Hood the sole cause of the loss of Atlanta, and failure at Spring Hill, Franklin and Nashville. Margean GladyszAnyone who wants the true story of the fall of Atlanta and the Tennessee campaign needs to study this book. Graham HollisSam Hood makes a compelling case that Hoods reputation has been unjustifiably tarnished over the years by authors who have repeated half-truths and myths that are not supported by primary sources. Even people with little or no interest in Hood should read it as a cautionary tale that the things that everybody knows are not always true. Dave JordanUpdate on Awards: Sam Hood just emailed me that his book has received another award, from another Civil War Round Table (CWRT):""The North Shore CWRT of Huntington, Long Island, New York (the hometown of Walt Whitman) has named my book their 2014 Walt Whitman Award as the year's best Civil War book. I'll receive the award in Huntington on Sept 4, 2014.""  There's a pattern here that reflects the Union appreciation of Gen. John Bell Hood, with two Yankee CWRT's recognizing his qualities!","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MT0L5G0CAREQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611211409#wasThisHelpful","R2MT0L5G0CAREQ","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had a ""parking lot moment"" the other day after finishing Robert Bryce's ""Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper"" (PublicAffairs Books, 400 pages, appendixes, notes, index, bibliography, many photographs, illustrations, $27.99, also available as an ebook for the same price).It's a variation on  NPR's ""driveway moment"" -- which occurs when you're listening to an interesting story on your NPR station and you stay in the car with the radio on to listen to the complete story. My ""parking lot moment"" occurred when I pulled into a vacant space next to a brand new shiny black Lincoln MKZ and noticed the ""2.0 Liter"" plaque on the back of the Lincoln. This luxury car has the same size engine as my Dodge Caliber -- a 2.0 liter four-cylinder power plant! Of course the MKZ is a turbo engine, compared to the normally aspirated twin-cam four-banger in my Dodge, but the cars weren't that much different in size.The Caliber, Dodge's smallest car, was discontinued in 2012, replaced by the new Dart, which also has relatively small four-cylinder engines. This phenomenon illustrates the Smaller and Cheaper aspects Bryce explores in  Chapter Eight, ""The Engines of the Economy."" Beginning on Page 85, he discusses Ford's Eco-Boost engine -- the kind used in the Lincoln MKZ,  Ford Fusion and many other Ford products.The engines in today's cars produce far more horsepower than much larger engines, which also makes them Denser. In this context I was thinking of the 1951 Chrysler New Yorker that I drove for a few years when I was in college in the late 1950s. It had Chrysler's first Hemi engine, a V-8 with 331 cubic inches  (5.4 liters) and 180 horsepower. (Boy, did I love that maroon four-door sedan!)The little four-cylinder engine in my 2010 Caliber produces 160 horsepower and gets 23 city and 31 highway -- far more than the New Yorker, which is good because gas cost about 31 cents a gallon back then! And the Chrysler was a gas hog. And the Caliber is about half the weight of the '51 New Yorker, definitely Lighter.Bryce calls himself an ""agnostic"" about climate change. As I was preparing this review, the government released (on May 6) a new report on climate change  which presents a doomsday view of the subject. In the USA Today story about the report.Here's an excerpt from the USA Today story, based on the 800-page report:""Devastating droughts in the Southwest, ruinous floods in New York City, killer wildfires in Colorado, intense heat waves in the Plains: These are the some of the disasters today that are being exacerbated by global warming, and will continue to worsen in the decades to come, according to a massive federal climate report released today at the White House in Washington.""Climate change is affecting where and how Americans live and work and their health, and evidence is mounting that burning fossil fuels has made extreme weather such as heat waves and heavy precipitation much more likely in the USA, according to the National Climate Assessment (NCA), the largest, most comprehensive U.S.-focused climate change report ever produced.""If people took the time to read the report, they would see that it is not necessarily about polar bears, whales or butterflies,"" said meteorologist Marshall Shepherd of the University of Georgia. ""I care about all of those, but the NCA is about our kids, dinner table issues, and our well being.""""Climate change is here and now, and not in some distant time or place,"" agreed Texas Tech University climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, one of the authors of the 800-page report.""The choices we're making today will have a significant impact on our future,"" Hayhoe said.The assessment was prepared by hundreds of the USA's top scientists. It agreed with a recent report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that the planet is warming, mostly because of human activity.The assessment provides ""the loudest and clearest alarm bell to date"" for immediate and aggressive climate action, said John P. Holdren, President Obama's science adviser, at a press conference in Washington on Tuesday.""All Americans will find things that matter to them in this report,"" added Jerry Melillo, chair of the National Climate Assessment Development Advisory Committee.""Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience,"" the U.S. report stated. ""So, too, are coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York and native peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska.""Early in the book (in the introduction,  Page XX) Bryce provides a definition for this narrative: ""collapse anxiety"": ""The avalanche of bad news has led led many people to experience, or even embrace, what author Gregg Easterbrook calls 'collapse anxiety'.  Easterbrook describes the condition as a 'widespread feeling that the prosperity of the United States and the European Union cannot really be enjoyed because the Western lifestyle  may crash owning to economic breakdown, environmental damage, resource exhaustion...or some other imposed calamity.'""Bryce says that as we confront today's environmental and economic challenges, doomsayers preach that the only way to stave off disaster is for humans to reverse course: to de-industrialize, re-localize, ban the use of modern energy sources, and forswear prosperity. The doomsayers are against just about all of modern life (which doesn't mean ""Inconvenient Truth"" Al Gore is giving up his jet or his lavish 10,000 square foot home with its high energy bills).Bryce's rejoinder to the neo-Luddites and neo-Malthusians: Innovation and the unstoppable human desire to make things Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper is providing consumers with Cheaper and more abundant energy, Faster computing, Lighter vehicles, and myriad other goods. That same desire is fostering unprecedented prosperity, greater liberty, and yes, better environmental protection.On Pages 270-271, Bryce presents  some startling numbers about the cost of electricity per kilowatt hour (KH) in 2012:Denmark, a world leader in wind power, had the highest cost in the developed world at 41 cents per KW. The European Union's average was 26 cents.  Germany was 35 cents; the UK was 20 cents and the US was 12 cents.Bryce says electricity is ""only part of the story. You name it -- sun, coal, oil, uranium, natural gas, wind -- the United States has loads of each.""With in-the-field reporting from Ottawa to Panama City and Pittsburgh to Bakersfield, Bryce shows how we have, for centuries, been pushing for Smaller Faster solutions to our problems. From the vacuum tube, mass-produced fertilizer, and the printing press to mobile phones, nanotech, and advanced oil drill rigs, Bryce demonstrates how cutting-edge companies and breakthrough technologies have created a world in which people are living longer, freer, healthier, lives than at any time in human history.The push toward Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper is happening across multiple sectors. Bryce profiles innovative individuals and companies, from long-established ones like Ford and Intel to upstarts like Aquion Energy and Khan Academy. And he zeroes in on the energy industry, proving that the future belongs to the high power density sources that can provide the enormous quantities of energy the world demands.The tools we need to save the planet aren't to be found in the technologies or lifestyles of the past. Nor must we sacrifice prosperity and human progress to ensure our survival. The catastrophists have been wrong since the days of Thomas Malthus. This is the time to embrace the innovators and businesses all over the world who are making things Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper.Essentially, he says that so-called renewable energy like ethanol gobbles up land in the U.S.'s Midwest and in places like Brazil best used for food production and uses huge amounts of water. Wind power gobbles up birds and bats and solar power -- like wind power -- is far too inefficient. It's not Dense enough. We need more natural gas for generating electricity and for vehicle power and he says we need more nuclear power, the kind his hometown of Austin, TX uses to produce much of its electricity. This aspect of Austin, the most liberal city in the state, is explored at length in Bryce's 2008 book,  ""Gusher of Lies"".  I quote from my review: ""In Chapter 14, Bryce tells the story of the city-owned Austin Energy's investment in the South Texas Project, a 16 percent investment in the two-nuclear reactor project. Liberal opponents -- and Austin is the most liberal city in Texas -- derided the investment in the 1970s and 1980s with jokes like: ""Q: What do you have when you have Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, and the South Texas Project? A: Two moneymakers and a dog.""Despite cost overruns and delays, the joke has been turned topsy-turvy, Bryce writes: ""...over the past few years, the South Texas Project has emerged as one of the best deals the city of Austin has ever done. For three years in a row, from 2004 to 2006, the plant produced more energy than any other two-nuclear reactor nuclear plant in the country. Austin now gets about 29 percent of its electricity from the nuclear plant and that juice is likely the cheapest power in its portfolio.""  * * *I found the contrarian views expressed in Bryce's new book to be a refreshing antidote to the gloom and doom that pervades the TV screens and print media today. He shows us there is hope, as long as the human power to innovate and make changes is present.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PYXV729WPCQ0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1610392051#wasThisHelpful","R2PYXV729WPCQ0","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHENAlmost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze.Country roads, take me home to the place I belong.West Virginia, mountain momma, take me home, country roads.  --""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" --  written by Bill Danoff, Taffy Nivert, and John Denver, and initially recorded by John Denver. It was included on his 1971 breakout album Poems, Prayers and Promises.  * * *Why West Virginia? Why did thousands of artists, craftspeople, musicians, and other baby boomers come to the hills and hollows of the Mountain State in the 1960s and 1970s, when native sons and daughters were taking those famed ""country roads"" to places where there were jobs?Huntington author and figurative sculptor Carter Taylor Seaton tackles that issue in ""Hippie Homesteaders: Crafts, Music and Living on the Land in West Virginia"" (West Virginia University Press, quality paperback with many photographs, notes, bibliography, index, 240 pages, $22.99).My conclusion after reading this wonderfully readable book can be summed up in that real estate mantra (or cliche') LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. This comes easily to me, since much of my newspaper career on five dailies involved real estate coverage.West Virginia is an easy drive (or train ride, don't forget the AMTRAK passenger service that survives to this day in both the northern and southern parts of the state) from both the Midwest and the Northeast.These regions were the big feeders of transplants to West Virginia, although Mountain State in-migrants or transplants came from as far away as Beijing, China, in the case of Joe Lung, a potter who lived on a commune.As Seaton mentions in her interviews of forty people, cheap land and housing and friendly people were also factors, as well as the existence of a supportive state government, especially in the John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV and Gaston Caperton gubernatorial administrations.Jay Rockefeller, born in New York City in 1937 and now a long-serving U.S. Senator, was himself a transplant, via the VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) route. Many of the back-to-the-landers interviewed by Seaton came to the state as VISTA volunteers. Not specifically mentioned by Seaton, but a factor, in my opinion, is the presence of many colleges and universities in the state -- a large number for a state with only 1.8 million people. Places like Shepherd College, West Liberty University, Bethany College, Concord University, Marshall University, West Virginia State University (and its outstanding film program) and -- of course West Virginia University. Students at these institutions came from out of state and many of them fell in love with West Virginia and stayed.Bob Thompson, a jazz legend from the greater New York City area, attended historically black West Virginia State College as a music major in the 1960s and stayed. The world-famous jazz pianist remains  a fixture on Mountain Stage.  Another college student who stayed was  Andy Ridenour, a native of the Washington, DC metro area, who attended Concord College (now University) in the 1960s, and was one of the Mountain Stage founders.The arrival of talented, educated young people contributed to the creation of institutions like Mountain Stage, one of the longest running music programs on National Public Radio, on the air since 1983 and hosted by transplant Larry Groce, a 66-year-old native of Dallas, Texas.The two-hour show, produced by WV Public Broadcasting, is a showcase of music from the traditional to the modern and is distributed worldwide by NPR and the Voice of America. It was created by Groce, Andy Ridenour and Francis Fisher. Mountain Stage, like its Texas equivalent, Austin City Limits, introduced many people to the state in what could be called the second invasion of transplants, after the initial one in the 1960s and 1970s. Seaton writes that all of the creators and most of the regular performers on Mountain Stage are transplants.Tamarack, just outside Beckley, is another Mountain State treasure that couldn't have been possible without the contributions of transplants. Tamarack opened in 1996 and has become a world-famous showcase for arts and crafts. Many states have what I call ""Tamarack Envy"" regarding this landmark on the West Virginia Turnpike (I-64-77).  I recall attending a live performance of Mountain Stage in the Tamarack auditorium when I lived in Hinton, WV. It was wonderful, complete with the beautiful song stylings of Julie Adams, who joins with Groce to sing the opening theme of the program, ""Simple Song"" -- written by Groce.Another factor that attracted people -- including in 1993 Dave and Liz Kinchen -- to the state is a catalog of farm and rural properties called the United Farm Catalog, produced since 1928 by United Country Real Estate of Kansas City, MO.We were living in Los Angeles and I came across the catalog and touched bases with real estate agents in Summers County that were in the catalog for our cross-country move. Seaton mentions the publication several times as a factor introducing people to the affordable land and housing in one of the poorest states in the nation in terms of per capita income. But it's a state -- as Seaton points out repeatedly throughout the book -- that is rich in welcoming people, many of who virtually adopted the tenderfeet-in-the-extreme newcomers and showed them how to survive in a state that has four distinct seasons -- maybe five if you count the mud season!In conclusion, if you want to read about the REAL West Virginia, not the fictional state of ""Wrong Turn"" degenerates or moonshine-making hillbillies, pick up a copy of ""Hippie Homesteaders"" and find out what attracted a diverse group of mostly middle-class, educated baby boomers to the state.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3C8CAYCAFJF9E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1938228901#wasThisHelpful","R3C8CAYCAFJF9E","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Laura Brown's ""How to Write Anything: A Complete Guide' is the most comprehensive guide to writing I've seen. I wish the book had been available when I was in college more than 50 years ago.As it happened, I was blessed with wonderful English teachers in both high school and college -- teachers who inspired me to major in English, which led me to take up journalism as a profession.Brown shows the reader how to write everything: from letters of complaint, thank you notes, invitations of all kinds, speeches, cover letters for resumes, letters of recommendations, college essays, even book reviews.I liked the way she included examples of poor writing -- ""Don't do this"" -- along with much better examples: ""Do this.""She also includes writing by contributors, including college students. Yes, the book would be an ideal gift to any student.""How to Write Anything"" has  more than two hundred how-to entries and easy-to-use models organized into three comprehensive sections on work, school, and personal life.It's a book that's written in a style that's friendly and supportive. I've given a few speeches in my time and I agree with her statement that this activity is one of life's scariest experiences! In the speechwriting section (pages 408-412), she gives great advice on how to write the speech that's tailored to your audience, how to practice it before you get up on that platform (am I scaring you enough?) and how to have a friend critique it. In fact, having somebody you respect critique your writing is a great idea.Let's say you're applying for college. Brown shows how to write application essays that will stand out. Somebody is hogging the parking in your neighborhood, blocking your driveway. Brown shows how to write a note for the offender's windshield that won't end up with your tires slashed. A neighbor persists in putting out his garbage containers days before the scheduled pickup. Brown shows how to write the proper note.PowerPoint presentations are one of the most common tools in business, and Brown has spot-on suggestions on how to write effective PowerPoint slide copy. On point she mentions deserves singling out: Just because your Mac or PC has dozens of type fonts, don't make the mistake of using too many in a slide.""How to Write Anything"" is at once a how-to guide and a reference book. No matter how long you've been writing, you can always improve you work and Laura Brown has just the book for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 24, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PKFBO9TJHEIP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0393240142#wasThisHelpful","R2PKFBO9TJHEIP","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHENTwenty years ago, in 1994, Los Angeles Times staff writer Evelyn De Wolfe compiled in a paperback volume the goings and comings, the to and fro, the hither and yon of one Phlange Welder, the equivalent in many ways at the Los Angeles Times of The New Yorker's  signature character Eustace Tilley.Her book has long been out of print, so it's only logical that Evie would go to her computer and expand and update the book and publish it as ""The Life and Times of Phlange Welder"" (Ashlin Press,  CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 2nd edition,  76 pages, large format trade paperback, available from Amazon.com, $8.85).The late 1950s and early 1960s were a far different era from the grim newsrooms of today, where everybody seems to be waiting for the pink slip to drop.Newspapers were prosperous and many; Evie notes that five daily newspapers covered greater Los Angeles and the world: the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles Examiner, the Los Angeles Mirror, the Herald Express, and the Hollywood Citizen. In the 'burbs there were dailies, too, in Glendale, Pasadena, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys. Long Beach -- never a suburb, but a proud city by the sea -- had its daily paper, the Long Beach Press Telegram.Reporters from the five L.A. papers competed for scoops and everybody in that Mad Men era wore a hat--the ladies of the press included.The name Phlange Welder came from the unlikely source of a job advertisement in a government handout that landed on the desk of cityside reporter Ted Sell. Seems the government was seeking someone who could expertly weld flanges, described by Wise Geek  as "" internal or external ribs or rims ... may be used as a strengthening member, a guide, or indexing element or as a method of joining system parts such as pipes, tanks, valves, and blanking plates.""As Evie describes in the book, Sell tubed the handout -- in those vacuum tubes you see in old time newspaper movies -- with the Flange Welder ad circled, to copy editor Carl ""Pony"" Swenson with the question: ""Is this guy in the Blue Book?"" Swenson replied that he was and he preferred to spell his first name ""Phlange"".  Thus a legend was born:  Phlange Welder, man about the world and denizen of the L.A. Times Test Kitchen and the employee cafeteria.""The Life and Times of  Phlange Welder"" at first might seem like too much inside baseball for non-newspaper people, but I think general readers will enjoy  a look at an era that has sadly past, brilliantly chronicled by Evie De Wolfe. When Evie told me about the reprinting of Phlange's saga, she said to not get  too personal. I agreed, but I have to say I've reviewed her books on this site. And I worked with her on the Real Estate Section of the L.A. Times during my almost 15 years at the paper.About the AuthorA native of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Evelyn De Wolfe earned a bachelors degree from the University of Brazil at age twenty and worked with the U.S. Embassy as a translator and consultant and later as a researcher for Walt Disney and still later as a journalist for a newspaper in the Los Angeles suburb of Alhambra CA and later the Los Angeles Times for 40 years in various reporting capacities. She lives in the Hollywood Hills.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKMOBUKAJDR3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1492384992#wasThisHelpful","RKMOBUKAJDR3E","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"BOOK REVIEW: 'Leadership Blindspots': Management Consultant Shows How Executives Can Identify, Overcome Weaknesses That MatterREVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHEN  ""Any business today that embraces the status quo as an operating principle is going to be on a death march."" -- Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, quoted on Page 164 of ""Leadership Blindspots""  * * *Reports that say ... that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things that we know that we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know. Donald Rumsfeld, United States Secretary of Defense in the George W. Bush administration  * * * Rumsfeld's famous -- or infamous -- formulation, came to mind when I saw the ""Blindspot Matrix"" in Robert B. Shaw's intriguing and readable book ""Leadership Blindspots: How Successful Leaders Identify and Overcome the Weaknesses That Matter"" (Jossey-Bass, an imprint of John Wiley & Sons, 240 pages, appendixes, notes, index,  $35.00).According to Wikipedia, Rumsfeld was derided for his statement, but also defended by Canadian columnist and author Mark Steyn -- whose books I've reviewed -- linguist Geoffrey Pullum and Australian economist and blogger John Quiggin.Steyn called it ""in fact a brilliant distillation of quite a complex matter""; Pullum said the quotation was ""completely straightforward"" and ""impeccable, syntactically, semantically, logically, and rhetorically"".John Quiggin  wrote: ""Although the language may be tortured, the basic point is both valid and important.""  * * *In ""Leadership Blindspots"" Shaw presents (on Page 18) a Blindspot Matrix with Leader Capabilities: ""Known Weaknesses; Known Strengths; Blindspots, and Unknown Strengths. He goes on to say Known Strengths represent ""you know what you know."" Known Weaknesses represent ""You know what you don't know."" And Unknown Strengths include ""You don't know what you know.""This doesn't sound all that different from Rumsfeld's formulation,  which gave  filmmaker Errol Morris a title for his 2013 biographical documentary about Rumsfeld: ""The Unknown Known.""The blindspot risk is that leaders fail to respond to weaknesses or threats due to a variety of factors including the complexity of their organizations, over-confidence in their own capabilities, and being surrounded by deferential subordinates.Shaw's brilliant book provides a useful model for understanding how blindspots operate and why they persist, but at the same time suggests real, actionable steps to improvement. The book details a range of techniques that make blindspots stand out in sharp relief, so action can be taken before severe damage occurs - to a leader or his or her company.The one characteristic great leaders share is the constant desire for self-improvement. Good can always be better. These weaknesses and threats are called blindspots because they are invisible to the individual but have the potential to wreak havoc on one's reputation and long-term success. Identifying and fixing crucial problems is the leader's job, and sometimes the most debilitating problems are with the leaders themselves.In ""Leadership Blindspots"" Shaw cites many executives by name whose blindspots prevented their companies from achieving their potential goals. One in particular is Steve Ballmer, who retired as CEO of Microsoft on Feb. 4, 2014, replaced by Satva Nadella. Shaw uses the Howard Schultz quote at the beginning of my review to point out the flaws of Ballmer ""who failed to keep pace with more successful rivals in areas such as internet search, smart phones, and tablets,"" he writes. Microsoft's stock bumped up on Ballmer's departure.Shaw suggested that Microsoft's chairman and co-founder Bill Gates should give the new CEO a photograph of Henry Ford ""as a reminder of what needs to be done."" Gates has a photograph of Henry Ford on his desk.Ford, writes Shaw, is a case study of a leader who ""surrounded himself with sycophants who told the great man what he wanted to hear."" Ford's failure to keep pace with automotive developments by continuing to build obsolete Model Ts led the company to the verge of bankruptcy as it lost its massive lead in automotive production to innovators like General Motors and Chrysler.On page 97, Shaw writes that executives could benefit from a suggestion made by the great Peter Drucker years ago: ""He thought that leaders could learn a great deal by writing down the reasons behind their key decisions, including their expectations of what would occur.  Then, after a period of time, they should review the accuracy of their expectations and the lessons learned.""Shaw also provides dozens of case studies of executives who did the right thing, made the right decisions, treated their subordinates with dignity, listened to their contrarian views. These case studies are as valuable as the ones showing actions that harmed the companies in question.I'm not a big fan of most motivational business books, but I have nothing but praise for ""Leadership Blindspots,"" where insights are found on virtually every page. If I were a business executive or entrepreneur, I  would buy the book by the box full and distribute copies to my employees -- including the grunts who do the actual work!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RGA4HMG06ZE4F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1118646290#wasThisHelpful","RGA4HMG06ZE4F","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Reviewed by David M. KinchenThis is a review I didn't want to write. Not because the essays and short stories in Marina Keegan's ""The Opposite of Loneliness: Essays and Stories""  aren't good. On the contrary, I'm sad because they show so much promise and their 22-year-old author won't write any more.She died in a car crash five days after her graduation from Yale in May, 2012. Her boyfriend, who survived, on May 26, 2012 was driving the car to a celebration of the 55th birthday of her dad, Kevin Keegan, on Cape Cod, MA. Accounts of the accident vary, but the most reliable one is that her boyfriend fell asleep at the wheel and the car rolled over.The title essay -- 940 words written for the Yale Daily News -- went viral, touching people of her generation like nothing before. It reached more than 1.4 million hits from people -- mostly young people -- around the world.It's no exaggeration to say that Marina Keegan's star was on the rise when she graduated magna cum laude from Yale in May 2012. She had a play that was to be produced at the New York International Fringe Festival and a job waiting for her at The New Yorker.  Yes, a paying job for a college graduate, not something that is guaranteed these days, not even for a Yale grad.As a non-fiction writer, I was drawn to the eight nonfiction essays -- in addition to the title one. Even if you don't particularly like essays -- probably from being forced to read them in school -- don't skip Marina Keegan's; I don't blame the folks at The New Yorker -- I would hire Marina Keegan in a New York Minute, too!Marina writes about subjects as diverse as the joy of work for a Chicago pest control expert (""I Kill for a Living"") to the attraction of Yale graduates to the consulting or financial industry (""Even Artichokes Have Doubts"")  to inheriting her grandmother's pristine 1990 black Toyota Camry (""Stability in Motion"") and what a mobile trash container it became at the hands of a typical college student. (I wondered when I read this essay if this was the car in the accident.). When I started out in daily newspaper journalism at the beginning of 1966, feature stories were still a part of any respectable -- and some not so respectable -- daily newspapers. Today: Not so much.The short stories -- a form I love and one in which we need all the talented writers we can find -- are crafted with the skill of a much older writer, but with the freshness of a young woman. I thought about other young women writers of the past, say Edna Ferber and Dorothy Parker (we think of them as old, but they were young, too)  and what a great Algonquin Hotel ""Vicious Circle"" Roundtable it would be with Marina Keegan in it. Perennial college student and talented actor James Franco might be in my imaginary Roundtable. Sparks would fly.Anne Fadiman (you older folks out there may remember her dad, Clifton Fadiman, I do!) in her must-read introduction tells of the fire and passion of Marina that she experienced at a Nov. 10, 2010 master's tea honoring novelist Mark Helprin.Helprin opined that making it as a writer was virtually impossible today. Let Fadiman tell the story:""A student stood up. Thin. Beautiful. Long, reddish-brown hair. Long legs. Flagrantly short skirt. Nimbus of angry energy. She asked Helprin if he really meant that. There was a collective intake of breath in the room. It was what everyone else had been thinking but no one else had been brave (or brazen) enough to say.""In a follow-up email, Marina introduced herself to Fadiman, born 1953, an accomplished, award-winning author and, since January 2005, in a program established by Yale alumnus Paul E. Francis, Yale's first Francis Writer in Residence, a position that allows her to teach one or two non-fiction writing seminars each year, and advise, mentor, and interact with students and editors of undergraduate publications.In the email, Marina said that ""Hearing a famous writer tell me that the industry is dying and that we should probably do something else was sad. Perhaps I just expected him to be more encouraging hoping to stop the death of literature.""It's obvious throughout this book that Marina Keegan was determined to be one of those people! My wish is that her book will inspire others to escape the pessimism and do what they really want to do: write. If you have the talent and willpower of a Marina Keegan, you'll be happy with your furniture from Goodwill or even rescued from a Dumpster!","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RX5MKEQ0647WL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=147675361X#wasThisHelpful","RX5MKEQ0647WL","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them."" --Vladimir Ilyich Lenin (1870-1924)  First Leader of the Soviet UnionMarginal cost is the term used in the science of economics and business to refer to the increase in total production costs resulting from producing one additional unit of the item. Zero marginal cost describes a situation where an additional unit can be produced without any increase in the total cost of production. Producing another unit of a good can have zero marginal costs when that good is non-rivalrous, meaning that it is possible for one person to consume the good without diminishing the ability of others to simultaneously consume it as well. --Wise Geek.com  * * *Maybe economists like Jeremy Rifkin will stop writing books like ""The Zero Marginal Cost Society: The Internet of Things, the Collaborative Commons, and the Eclipse of Capitalism"" when they are replaced by robots who can do the same work as human economists at far less cost.This is already happening in academia, as many prestigious teachers are offering online courses for free or for a modest fee, he writes in a book that will probably discourage the hell out of many people already at the end of their job-seeking tether. At the same time, Rifkin's book is that rarity, a book about economics that general readers can understand and enjoy, even.Brick and mortar universities will be replaced by  massive open online courses (MOOCs) that also operate at near-zero marginal cost, he predicts. And young social entrepreneurs are establishing ecologically sensitive businesses, crowdsourcing capital, and even creating alternative currencies in the new sharable economy. As a result, ""exchange value"" in the marketplace -- long the bedrock of our economy - is increasingly being replaced by ""use value"" on the collaborative Commons.Rifkin describes how zero marginal cost economics  has already changed the face of manufacturing and has contributed to the jobless ""recovery"" from the financial meltdown of 2008 in a book that further confirms my view that economics is truly ""the dismal science.""The rope that Lenin spoke of is probably manufactured in an Asian country by automated machines, with only a few people around to make sure they're functioning properly.Shades of Charlie Chaplin's dystopic 1936 movie ""Modern Times""  -- said to be inspired as his iconic ""Little Tramp""  character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. According to the Wikipedia entry on ""Modern Times"": ""The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization.""In his 1995 book ""The End of Work"" Rifkin said that ""more sophisticated software technologies are going to bring civilization ever closer to a near workerless world.""Unemployed ""Little Tramps"" need not apply!Rifkin quotes himself on page 122 of his new book, adding : ""In the interim years, the projections I made back in 1995 of IT-generated automation  leading to technology  displacement in virtually every sector of the economy became a troubling reality, leaving millions of people unemployed and underemployed across every country in the world. If anything, the original forecast proved to be a bit too conservative.""Is that dismal enough for you?He goes on to cite statistics on the people in the U.S. and worldwide who are unemployed or underemployed, who have given up looking for jobs that have disappeared. (Chapter Eight ""The Last Standing Worker"" Pages 121ff.).Retailing will change drastically. If you've been in a Walmart recently, you've probably seen the self-checkout stations (I refuse to use them, hoping that at least some jobs will remain!).  It's no secret that the Walmart management people -- and other retailers -- would like to see workers disappear, with customers doing all the work. Rifkin writes that many people -- especially younger consumers who are already buying most everything online --  are using big-box stores to try on garments that they will later buy online,. And stores are reacting by charging them to use the fitting rooms -- or convincing them to use their own online service, making the store distribution center, he tells us.The capitalist era that Lenin hoped to see disappear inevitably will do so, Rifkin writes. Replacing it will be a new global collaborative Commons that will fundamentally transform our way of life.Ironically, capitalisms demise is not coming at the hands of hostile external forces. Rather, ""The Zero Marginal Cost Society"" argues, capitalism is a victim of its own success. Intense competition across sectors of the economy is forcing the introduction of ever newer technologies.Rifkin explains that this competition is boosting productivity to its optimal point where the marginal cost of producing additional units is nearly zero, which makes the product essentially free. In turn, profits are drying up, property ownership is becoming meaningless, and an economy based on scarcity is giving way to an economy of abundance, changing the very nature of society.Rifkin describes how hundreds of millions of people are already transferring parts of their economic lives from capitalist markets to global networked Commons.""Prosumers"" are producing their own information, entertainment, green energy, and 3-D printed products at nearly zero marginal cost, and sharing them via social media sites, rentals, redistribution clubs, bartering networks, and cooperatives.For Rifkin's 1999 speech  ""The Third Sector -- and the Rebirth of Civil Society"":  [...]I was particularly intrigued by Chapter  Ten, ""The Comedy of the Commons"", where Rifkin discusses Garrett Hardin's 1968 essay ""The Tragedy of the Commons"" and law professor Carol Rose's re-examination of the ancient principle of the commons in what Rifkin calls a ""salvo"" entitled ""The Comedy of the Commons."" This chapter also includes an account of Elinor Ostrom's publication of ""The Governing of the Commons"" in 1990. Ostrom (1933-2012)  won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2009 -- the first woman ever to receive the honor, Rifkin writes. Ostrom was associated with two universities: Arizona State and Indiana University.In this new era, identity is less bound to what one owns and more to what one shares. Cooperation replaces self-interest, access trumps ownership, and networking drubs autonomy. Rifkin concludes that while capitalism will be with us for at least the next half century, albeit in an increasingly diminished role, it will no longer be the dominant paradigm. We are, Rifkin says, entering a world beyond markets where we are learning how to live together collaboratively and sustainably in an increasingly interdependent global Commons.I have some issues with this: I don't think utility companies will be giving away their electricity or natural gas anytime soon. I expect my electric utility  company --TXU, based in Dallas -- will continue to send me bills every month, despite all the talk in Rifkin's book about  the Internet Commons. TXU and other utilities will be among the biggest holdouts, if I'm correct in my guesses.Without jobs, consuming will decrease and companies will find themselves without customers. Despite the ""Internet of Everything"" that Rifkin describes, customers are vital. When they're gone, the company disappears.It almost happened to Ford Motor Co. when they stopped making the Model T,  and took months to develop the Model A in the fall of 1927. Ford never regained its position as the biggest of the Big Three automakers. Bill Bryson describes Ford's blunder in his excellent ""One Summer: America 1927"" (Doubleday, 2013), which I've just read and which I recommend without reservation. I love Bryson's books.I suspect that most people will continue to be consumers, buying cars, houses, cell phones, TV sets, instead of renting them. Sharing bikes and cars won't be the norm outside of a few cities.  Corpus Christi, TX, the nearest large city to where I live on the Texas Gulf Coast,  is not Portland, OR: People there will need cars to get around a sprawling metro area with no rapid transit -- unlike the excellent Portland system, my favorite on the West Coast.On my  first reading of Rifkin's tome, I was reminded of the predictions trumpeted by Popular Science and Popular Mechanics magazines when I was in grade school, in the 1940s and '50s. You know the ones: Every suburban house with an autogyro in the drivewayexpressways where cars moved like trains, etc. etc. On further reflection, I recalled the disappearance of three places in the town I live in where you could rent a DVD of a movie. Netflex and video on demand killed them, leaving fogies who like to play DVDs limited to the handy Redbox kiosks at a couple of locations.My own profession, journalism, is not immune to the zero cost marginal society. In an article on ""robo-journalists"" ([...]) ""Computer algorithms are already being used to manufacture news stories about earthquakes and other data-rich issues and this same process could soon be employed for sports games and eventually more complicated news stories  rendering many journalists obsolete.""Human editors would probably still be needed to check stories before publication, but the actual process of writing articles could be handed over completely to artificially intelligent software programs.""The story goes on to say, citing a report in The Vancouver Sun, ""that the Los Angeles Times is already using robo-reporters for some of its content, thanks to a computer program developed by the newspapers digital editor Ken Schwencke."" The L.A. Times is where I worked for more than 14 years, from 1976 to 1990.""The article explores the ethical concerns of assigning routine news tasks to robo-reporters, which would 'lighten the load for everybody involved' according to Schwencke. Alfred Hermida, associate professor at the University of British Columbia, concluded that if the computer algorithm was created by the reporter, the generation of news stories by a robo-reporter would be acceptable.""  * * *O, brave new worldthat has such people in't!

"Readers of Anne Perry's Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novels have come to expect twists and turns and red herrings by the bushel full, but her newest entry, ""Death on Blackheath"" (Ballantine Books, 320 pages, $27.00) raises the bar in this respect. And that's a good thing, because much of the charm of these Victorian era novels is the clash of personalities in a world threatened by competing empires.Pitt has been challenged before by people who don't believe he has the right credentials or the gravitas to head the country's Special Branch, the agency that was created to protect the country from foreign and domestic terrorism (it was originally called the Irish Special Branch).He's the son of a gamekeeper, and he lacks the army or navy service that is deemed vital to men who head the agency. Through ability and success in solving crimes, he rose through the ranks of Scotland Yard and was named Special Branch commander, replacing Victor Narraway, who was removed from the post and elevated to the House of Lords in the wake of a corruption scandal. Pitt retains his ties to Narraway and in this novel, those connections prove to be invaluable.At first there appears to be no need for Pitt to be involved in the disappearance of a maid in the household of Dudley Kynaston, except that Kynaston is a high-ranking scientist working on naval weapons, especially submarines. The time of the novel isn't specified, but I'm guessing it's 1898 or 1899, near the end of the reign of Queen Victoria, when Europe's empires were engaged in power struggles that in 1914 boiled over and started the Great War, later known as World War I.There are signs of a bloody struggle outside the Kynaston house on Shooter's Hill in Blackheath, the area of southeast London adjacent to the Greenwich Observatory, today better known as the start of the London Marathon.What would normally be a case for Scotland Yard -- the blood, hair and shards of glass evident of a struggle outside the Kynaston home and the disappearance of the family's beautiful maid Kitty Ryder -- becomes a case for the Special Branch, with Pitt and his trusty right-hand man Davey Stoker becoming involved because of Kynaston's national security work.When a mutilated woman's body is found in a gravel pit not far from Kynaston's house, speculation begins that the scientist might be involved in what might be the murder of the unidentified woman who may or may not be Kitty.Questions are asked in the House of Commons and the pressure on Pitt becomes more intense as Home Secretary bureaucrat Edom Talbot, who becomes an instant foe of Pitt, pressures him to solve the case as quickly as possible. Following the advice of Narraway, Pitt manages to contain his anger at Talbot.As evidence mounts that seemingly implicates Dudley Kynaston in an espionage conspiracy and murder, Pitt needs the help of everyone, including the dogged investigator Stoker; his wife and confidante Charlotte; his sister-in-law Emily Radley and her husband Jack, who is considering a post with Kynaston; and his key to London's drawing room gossip, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould.Even with all these people providing information, the case baffles Pitt. Only through the kind of meticulous investigation work that distinguished his career in Scotland Yard can Pitt hope to unravel the tangled web facing him. Even this might not be enough; sheer luck may play a role.""Death on Blackheath"" sets new high standards for a Thomas and Charlotte Pitt novel. It has a complex and rewarding plot and outstanding characterization and even involves important events in Sweden, making it a book that fans of Stieg Larsson's ""Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy will find interesting.","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Q0PEC8I62LOT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345548388#wasThisHelpful","R1Q0PEC8I62LOT","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life.'"" -- Henry David ThoreauJoachim Fest (1926-2006) uses this quote toward the end of his engrossing memoir ""Not I: Memoirs of a German Childhood"" (Other Press, 464 pages, $15.95, trade paperback, photographs, index, translated from the German by Martin Chalmers, with an introduction by Herbert A. Arnold) to explain why he retained the conservative beliefs of his father in writing some of the best accounts of Hitler and Nazi Germany that have been published by any author. Many of the other writers on the subject approached it from a leftist perspective but Fest believed the Communists were as bad as the Nazis -- only they had better PR.The quote from Thoreau appears on Page 409, in the part of the memoir that deals with his adult life -- a relatively short section compared with his experiences up to 1945 when he was captured by American troops near the Remagen bridge in western Germany.Fest had joined the regular army -- the Wehrmacht --  to avoid being drafted into the Waffen S.S., he writes, much to the consternation of his father, who opposed the Nazi regime from the conservative spectrum of the Weimar Republic. His father said: ""one does not volunteer for Hitler's criminal war.""His father, Johannes Fest, was dismissed from his teaching position in 1933, when Hitler was elected chancellor and night descended on Germany. The footnotes by the translator and Arnold explain the literary and cultural references in Fest's memoirs and are an invaluable addition to the book for the general reader.""Not I"" is a depiction of  an intellectually rigorous German household opposed to the Nazis and how its members suffered for their political stance.  Fest offers a far-reaching view of how he experienced the war and National Socialism. True to the German Bildung tradition, serious bookworm Fest grows up immersed in the works of Goethe, Schiller, Mrike, Rilke, Kleist, Mozart, and Beethoven.His father, a conservative Catholic teacher, opposes the Nazi regime and as a result loses his job and status. Fest is forced to move to a boarding school in the countryside that he despises, and in his effort to come to terms with his fathers strong political convictions, he embarks on a tireless quest for knowledge and moral integrity that will shape the rest of his life and writing career.Here's an excerpt:In early 1936, from our place by the wall, Wolfgang [his older brother] and I eavesdropped on a rare argument between our parents. There had been a strangely irritable atmosphere all day. My mother evidently started it, reminding my father in a few short sentences what she had put up with, politically and personally, in the last three years. She said she wasnt complaining, but she had never dreamt of such a future. From morning to night she was standing in front of pots, pans, and washboards, and when the day was over she had to attend to the torn clothes of the children, patched five times over. And then, after what seemed like a hesitant pause, she asked whether my father did not, after all, want to reconsider joining the Party. The gentlemen from the education authority had called twice in the course of the year to persuade him to give way; at the last visit they had even held out the prospect of rapid promotion. In any case, she couldnt cope anymoreAnd to indicate the end of her plea, after a long pause she added a simple Please!My father replied a little too wordily (as I sometimes thought in the years to come), but at the same time revealed how uneasy he had been about the question for a long time. He said something about the readjustments that she, like many others, had been forced to make. He spoke about habit, which after often difficult beginnings provides a certain degree of stability. He spoke about conscience and trust in God. Also that he himself, as well as my brothers and I, could gradually relieve her of some of the work in the household, and so on. But my mother insisted on an answer, suggesting that joining the Party would not change anything: After all, we remain who we are! It did not take long for my father to retort: Precisely not! It would change everything!  * * *As an avid reader of just about every aspect of World War II and the Nazis, I was impressed with the insights Fest provides about everyday life in Germany. Fest's father had many Jewish friends and he urged all of them to get out of Germany as quickly as possible. Some followed his advice: all too many said the gangsters called Nazis would soon be gone, that Germany was too civilized a nation to continue the persecution of a people who had contributed so much to Germany. Fest writes about the special connection between German Jews and the nation, calling the destruction of the Jewish community a ""fratricidal"" catastrophe.""Not I"" is a must-read book for anyone interested in understanding how Europe descended into the madness described so vividly by British historian Mark Mazower in his 1999 book ""Dark Continent: Europe's Twentieth Century.""","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 16, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3L9LYWJ6G8NS9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1590516109#wasThisHelpful","R3L9LYWJ6G8NS9","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"""Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world. It's hard to get by just upon a smile..."" -- Cat Stevens, 1971  * * *Cat Stevens' hit song from 1971 aptly describes the 2014 job market for today's college graduates, making ""The Critical First Years of Your Professional Life by Robert L. Dilenschneider, with Mary Jane Genova (Citadel Press/Kensington Publishing Corp., introduction by Maria Bartiromo, 223 pages, trade paperback, $15.00,  also available in a Kindle ebook) even more valuable today than when it was first published in 1997.Faced with an unstable economy, recent college grads need more expert guidance than ever to land that dream job and make it rewarding and meaningful. Dilenschneider has written several self-help guides to negotiating the workplace, a confusing maze that is far different from past years like the 1960s when Dilenschneider got his start -- and when I did so, too.I wish I had this very readable book in hand in 1961 when I graduated from college with a B.A. degree in English and went to work as an insurance claims adjuster in Chicago. It would have cleared the underbrush of the business world for me. As the author points out, your first job today is not going to be your final one; the rules have changed radically.This invaluable guiderevised to meet the specific challenges of todays fast-evolving job marketshows how you can use your talent, originality, and initiative to sharpen your competitive edge. He even gives ""MIss Manners"" style advice on how to dress for success, something that sounds so dated, but really is important. Look for the ""powder blue suit"" anecdote if you doubt me.Dilenschneider graduated with a master's degree in communication and ended up in public relations, with a large firm and later starting his own company, the Dilenschneider Group, a New York City based corporate strategic counseling and public relations firm.  By 1966, with a variety of positions behind me, I finally found my niche: Journalism. I think I benefited by working in fields other than journalism before taking that reporter trainee position in Hammond, Indiana in January 1966.The first years of your professional life are critical to long-term success in any field. The skills you acquire, the contacts you make, and the lessons you learn will help you remain involved, adaptable, and always ahead of the curve. I like the interviews the author conducts with experts in a variety of fields, including the one from his 1997 edition with his his first mentor, Ohio State University professor Walter Seifert, now deceased. Be sure to read and absorb that interview on pages 185-188.  It's marvelous! Seifert sounds like the kind of guy I could have depended on to learn the ropes, a professor who worked as a newsman in Cleveland. I was fortunate at my first newspaper job to have a similar mentor in a co-worker who was a seasoned reporter. In subsequent jobs, I relied on advice from other reporters and editors, and eventually ended up mentoring others.Mentoring, negotiating the grapevine, how to conduct yourself in an increasingly uncivil world: Dilenschneider wants you to be polite and respectful of others, following the Golden Rule; this is outstanding advice that more people should absorb and practice in a world crammed to the rafters with boors.Learning what to do -- and what not to do -- in the workplace are among the many topics covered in this book, which I recommend as an immediate gift to someone who is about to graduate from college.Now a seasoned veteran of the workplace shares his insights, tips, and experiences in a thoroughly updated edition of a career-planning classic.Another excellent section discusses the differences between the generations, many of whom the young man or woman in the workplace for the first time will encounter. He's a member of the pre-Baby Boomer generation who writes that he thinks like the Boomers born from 1946 to 1964. I'm from this population cohort and feel like that, too. We did everything the Boomers did, but we didn't have that Rolling Stone or Time magazine cover!","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ACVRQ5TW644K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0806536772#wasThisHelpful","R2ACVRQ5TW644K","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It has been said that getting anything done in the Army bureaucracy is like mating elephants: It is done at very high levels with a lot of bellowing and it takes two years to get anything done.I'm guessing  that James David ""Dave"" Power III would find that quote about Army bureaucracy not unlike the first job he got out of college, working for the tractor division of Ford Motor Co.Despite having an uncle in a high-level position at General Motors, Dave Power, born in Worcester, MA in 1931, wanted to get his first job by himself, according to ""POWER: How J.D. Power III Became the Auto Industry's Adviser, Confessor, and Eyewitness to History"" (Fenwick Publishing Group, Bainbridge Island, WA, 416 pages, foreword by CNBC's Bill Griffeth, afterword by Dave Power, index, notes, trade paperback, $19.95, available at Amazon.com and other online sources, also available in a Kindle edition).Authors Sarah Morgans and Bill Thorness have produced a book that I've been waiting for...even if I didn't know it. I'm a car nut and I've also experienced the wrath of car dealers as an auto editor at The Milwaukee Sentinel in the 1970s, when one reporter I assigned a big Buick with a small displacement V6 engine  gave the sedan a less than glowing review after a week of behind the wheel testing. The Buick dealer complained and the newspaper decided to end the well-received auto section, sticking to non-editorial-produced ""advertorial"" sections. My auto editor job disappeared and I went back to my regular duties as real estate editor.What happened to me was nothing compared to what Dave Power experienced after he  started what was literally a family business, J.D. Power and Associates, in Los Angeles in 1968.  After making a name for his fledgling business when his research revealed the O-ring problems of  Mazda's Wankel rotary engines, his customers were mainly other Japanese manufacturers like Honda and Toyota. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Japanese manufacturers were just getting a toehold in the U.S. I remember my 1972 road test of the newly introduced Honda Civic as auto editor in Milwaukee. I praised the Honda, comparing it to the British Mini, but with much better quality. It was one of the first mass-market front-wheel drive cars.  I predicted success for the car at a time when VW was outselling it by a huge margin.Drawing on his background as a Wharton MBA and his auditing experience at Ford Tractor,  Power and his staff developed a statistically accurate tabulation of customer complaints and praise. The authors describe how, when the company that was initially his biggest foe -- Ford Motor Co.! -- challenged his model, Power hired three university statistics professors at $5,000 a head.  After examining his methods, all three pronounced them statistically sound. The rest is history, as they say.No other individual has had as broad an impact on the auto industry during the past fifty years as Dave Power. Dave's persistence in getting auto executives to listen to customer concerns was key to the across-the-board rise in car quality, and the influence of his J.D. Power and Associates rankings has permanently raised the bar on customer satisfaction.Enhanced with anecdotal quotes from Dave Power as well as dozens of industry insiders, ""POWER"" is a compelling study of an intelligent, polite, market-research regular guy wonk who bluntly called them as he saw them. His unblinkingly honest research ended up making customer satisfaction a watchword -- not just in automotive but in all manufacturing and service industries.Power's late wife Julie was an important factor in his company's success, as were his children who helped prepare the questionnaires for mailing to customers, complete with a shiny quarter pasted on the form.At first -- largely because of his involvement with Japanese car makers --  the Big Three (GM, Ford and Chrysler) was hostile to J.D. Power & Associates, accusing the firm of being pro-import and anti-domestic car. After all, it was based in southern California, where imports were more accepted than in other parts of the country. Soon, however, most of the makers came to realize the value of the studies and the company became a worldwide success, with offices in Detroit, Europe, Japan and elsewhere. It was sold to McGraw-Hill Financial in 2005.""POWER""  is valuable because it describes how the idea of asking customers about quality issues -- something that sounds like common sense today -- was far from that in 1968 when Dave Power started his company. The book will appeal to car nuts, of course, but also to marketing students and general readers interested in the subject. Topics covered include the Audi 5000 sudden acceleration issue, which turned out to be false, and John Z. DeLorean and his ""Back to the Future"" sports car -- and how DeLorean scammed Power -- among dozens of other anecdotes. Including his experience with the beautiful but problem plagued Jaguar XJ6 sedan he owned.","4.0 out of 5 stars","March 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2QTRFADTFBRPV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0981833675#wasThisHelpful","R2QTRFADTFBRPV","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Tuesday, February 18, 2014 - 15:12REVIEWED BY DAVID M. KINCHEN The case could be made that Susan Cheever was fated to write about poet, artist, novelist and playwright E. E. Cummings (1894-1962), if only because of her meeting Cummings when she was 17 and unhappy in the private school she was attending.She writes about meeting the older friend of her novelist father John Cheever in 1960 in ""E.E. Cummings: A Life"" (Pantheon, 240 pages, 18 pages of black and white images, notes, bibliography, index, $26.95).In a relatively short book that should be read by everyone interested in not only poetry but the arts scene in the first half of the 20th Century, she writes that Edward Estlin Cummings had been relegated to make ""a modest living on the high-school lecture circuit. In the winter of 1960 his schedule brought him to read his adventurous poems at an uptight girls school in Westchester where I was a miserable seventeen-year-old junior with failing grades.""I vaguely knew that Cummings had been a friend of my fathers; my father loved to tell stories about Cummingss gallantry, and Cummingss ability to live elegantly on almost no moneyan ability my father himself struggled to cultivate. When my father was a young writer in New York City, in the golden days before marriage and children pressured him to move to the suburbs, the older Cummings had been his beloved friend and adviser.""On that cold night in 1960, Cummings was near the end of his brilliant and controversial forty-year career as this countrys only true modernist poet. Primarily remembered these days for its funky punctuation, Cummingss work was in fact a wildly ambitious attempt at creating a new way of seeing the world through language. Part of a powerful group of writers and artists, many of whom were Cummingss friendsJames Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Hart Crane, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matissehe struggled to reshape the triangle between the reader, the writer, and the subject of the poem, novel, or painting. As early as his 1915 Harvard College graduation valedictorian speech, Cummings told his audience that the New Art, maligned though it may be by fakirs and fanatics, will appear in its essential spirit...as a courageous and genuine exploration of untrodden ways.Fashions impact on the arts as well as everything else in a society, but when he died at age 68 in 1962 Cummings was, after Robert Frost, the most widely read poet in the U.S., writes Cheever. To a large extent, his fan base was young girls like Susan Cheever. He was the poetry equivalent of a rock star to them, thanks to his playful use of the language and his beautiful love poems like:i carry your heart with me(i carry it inmy heart)i am never without it(anywherei go you go,my dear; and whatever is doneby only me is your doing,my darling).He was also a rebel against authority, which resonated during those pre-Hippie years when ""beatniks"" ruled. You might even make the case that he was a living, breathing grown-up Holden Caulfield. He was also a conservative, an anti-communist, a fan of Sen. Joe McCarthy  (R-WI),  perhaps influenced by his early 1930s visit to the Soviet Union where he saw a police state first hand. Cheever delves into astrology, noting that Cummings was a Libra, born Oct. 14. As a Libra myself, I understand what she's attempting to state: We Libras are a complicated mass of contradictions!In a relatively short book -- about 190 pages if you don't count the bibliography, notes, acknowledgement and index -- Cheever also provides the skeleton of a book that examines the American literary scene in the first half of the 20th Century -- in essence a book I'd like to see her write that does for this period what her ""American Bloomsbury"" did for the 19th Century.That book, subtitled ""Louisa May Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau"" succeeded in fleshing out the authors most of us laboriously plowed through in high school and college. In ""American Bloomsbury"" she points out that these authors -- now considered secure in the literary canon -- were once considered avant-garde types at odds with the establishment.In the same way, in the early 20th Century, Cummings, a product of a nineteenth-century New England childhood, was, in contrast to his ""man's man"" minister father, a slight, non-athletic youth who loved nature and had a sense of fun that went against the dour New England grain. He grew up in Cambridge, Mass., only a few blocks from Harvard, but he grew to hate the city for its self-assured intellectualism and prejudices.At Harvard, he roomed with John Dos Passos; befriended Lincoln Kirstein; read Latin, Greek, and French; earned two degrees; discovered alcohol, fast cars, and burlesque at the Old Howard Theater; and raged against the schools conservative, exclusionary upper-class rule by A. Lawrence Lowell.Lowell was the Harvard president who instituted a quota system that aimed at keeping Jewish students a small minority. He didn't care much for black students either at America's most prestigious university. Cheever also points out that women were not welcome at Harvard and were forbidden until well into the 20th Century from taking classes there. They had they own ghetto in Radcliffe.While Cummings raged against the anti-Semitism of Lowell and others, he wasn't free from it himself, as Cheever clearly states. Among the many poems, or parts of poems by Cummings that she reproduces is one that most people would consider anti-Semitic. She calls his anti-semitism ""indefensible.""To explain How to deal with the often vicious anti-Semitism of Cummings, Cheever muses on page 176:  ""Trying to re-create another time and place is difficult; trying not to let our own modern knowledge and understanding bleed into those descriptions of the past is almost impossible. On the one hand, a biographer's responsibility is to bring the past to life on the page in all its details -- including the relative knowledge and ignorance of the community described. On the other hand, shouldn't the biographer give the reader and the subject the benefit of everything known at the time of writing? Should poems and books be understood in a vacuum -- in the historical silence in which a writer connects viscerally and spiritually with a reader? Or should they be understood as pieces of the web of their own time and ours?""Cheever also describes Cummings' complicated relationship with women and the beyond horrible estrangement engineered by his ex-wife Elaine from his only child, Nancy. I marvel at how Susan Cheever managed to get so much material in a very accessible, relatively short book. Please forgive me for harping on the length of the book, but so many biographies these days are gigantic doorstops that intimidate most readers! Even professional reviewers!","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3GZO1P2EP38Q7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0307379973#wasThisHelpful","R3GZO1P2EP38Q7","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Richard Diana, M.D., author (with Sheila Curry Oakes) of ""Healthy Joints for Life: An Orthopedic Surgeon's Proven Plan to Reduce Pain and Inflammation, Avoid Surgery and Get Moving Again"" (Harlequin trade paperback, 352 pages, illustrations, appendixes, index, $17.95) is unique in the history of both pro football and medicine: He's the only board certified surgeon to have played in Super Bowl XVII. He was a running back and special teams player for the Miami Dolphins under legendary Coach Don Shula.Diana's book is fun to read -- something I never expected from a health and medicine book-- as well as informative and potentially life saving because of his anecdotes of his playing days for one of the best coaches in NFL history. His patients want to know everything about a real college student athlete who was drafted by the NFL and played for the legendary Ohio native Don Shula.Now 84 and retired, Shula was renowned for his no-excuses approach to football, and life in general,  Diana writes. From what I gleaned from reading this very accessible book, the good doctor has adopted Shula's philosophy whole hog.Dr. Diana's  eight-week plan for treating for treating joint pain and arthritis is unusual for a surgeon because it relies on exercise and especially diet modification to make life more comfortable for joint pain sufferers. In my experience, surgeons think about surgery 24/7, so it's refreshing to find one who believes it's best to try non-surgical approaches, leaving the surgery as a last resort.Based on cutting-edge research that has clarified the crucial role of a molecule known as NFkB in regulating inflammation, Dr. Diana's proven eight-week program teaches you to harness the power of this research to reduce inflammation, relieve pain and rejuvenate your joints.Dr. Diana explains in scientific detail: Which delicious foods reduce inflammation Simple exercises tailored to your ability The right supplements to help increase your mobilityDr. Diana explains the science behind joint pain and tells us what foods to avoid. I wasn't surprised to find an emphasis on healthy foods like wild salmon and colorful vegetables. Avoid what I call the South of the Mason-Dixon Line Diet, where everything you can imagine -- and somethings you couldn't imagine -- is fried and you're well on your way to reducing the inflammation behind joint pain. Drink green tea instead of coffee (ouch! I love coffee, but I know I drink too much of it), cut out sugar, increase your fiber and reduce your carbs, etc. etc. Dr. Diana tells all!I must be either lucky or doing the right things all along -- or both -- because in my mid-70s I have no joint pain. When everybody was running, I said ""No, thanks"" and walked a lot, something Diana says is good for you. I more or less (more now, less in the past!) watched my diet. On the advice of my cardiologist, I've dropped about 30 pounds and have kept those pounds off for nine months now.When I lived in Wisconsin, California and West Virginia, I would cross country ski whenever I had a chance. The original form of skiing, cross country or Nordic  avoids the joint stress of Alpine or downhill skiing. It's to walking what Alpine skiing is to running, I like to say. Nordic skiing is probably the most aerobic exercise you can do and you can get exercise equipment to simulate that exercise in your home -- but only if you consult your doctor.Joint pain strikes people of all ages, so get your hands on ""Healthy Joints for Life"" and practice the exercises and dietary recommendations the ""Jock Doc"" provides in this fun-to-read book.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BZ776I0MPOFE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0373892705#wasThisHelpful","R3BZ776I0MPOFE","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The American way of life  in the postwar world was a product of Chicago. From the steel in its new Miesian skyscrapers to its stacks of golden crispy McDonald's French Fries. The city was navigating the transformation of the cultural ideal of the common man into a national mass market strategy. -- Thomas Dyja, ""The Third Coast"", Page 336That statement by Thomas Dyja in his enthralling  book ""The Third Coast: When Chicago Built the American Dream"" (The Penguin Press, 544 pages, maps, glossy photo inserts, notes, index, $29.95) sounds a little overdrawn, but native Chicagoan Dyja provides more than enough information to make his point -- in an exceedingly entertaining book. I was attracted to the book -- as I am to all books about Chicago -- in part because it was where I moved in the summer of 1961 after graduating with a B.A. in English from Northern Illinois University, in DeKalb,  about 50 miles west of the Loop,  and began my first real job. It wasn't in journalism -- that came in January 1966 when I joined the staff of a daily  newspaper in nearby Hammond, IN -- but I was the small town boy in the mecca of the Midwest and it was marvelous -- paradise, even.My one-bedroom apartment on Grant Place in Lincoln Park cost me  all of $75 a month -- very affordable on my $5,200 a year salary -- and it was a short walk to  a place I fell in love with on first sight, Old Town at Wells Street and North Avenue, home of the Old Town School of Folk Music, Second City and many other attractions. The first two institutions are covered in the cultural section of ""The Third Coast.""Dyja describes -- to pick just one example --  how rock  'n' roll was born in the Chess Record studios with Chuck Berry recording ""Maybellene."" According to Dyja's account (page  293) Leonard Chess changed the name of Berry's song from ""Ida Red"" to ""Maybellene"" , pointing to a bottle of  Maybelline mascara that a secretary had left on the studio's piano.""It has to have three syllables"", Leonard yelled (he liked to yell, usually laced with a rich variety of profanities) , and with this pronouncement, rock 'n' roll was born in 1955. (The song title's spelling was changed to avoid a copyright infringement suit from the cosmetics maker).The book abounds with details like this -- something that appeals to my  inner trivia geek .Dyja notes that Leonard and Phil Chess were white men who made their money from black artists; but he adds that they -- contrary to some other accounts --treated Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and other blacks the same way they treated white artists. The brothers Chess were in it for the money, but so were the artists, including Berry, who earned  a living as a carpenter in his father's contracting business (Page 290-291) and vowed never to pick up a hammer after he traveled  to Chicago from St. Louis.If you're a fan of ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""The Colbert Report"" you'll learn -- if you don't already know it -- the connection with those two shows with Chicago's groundbreaking Second City improv theater, which grew out of earlier efforts like the Compass Theatre. Dyja describes the birth of Chicago improv -- which led to other theatrical efforts that made the city such an important theater center -- in considerable detail. Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Shelley Berman, Barbara Harris and the parents of Ben Stiller -- Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara -- all got their start in Chicago.Television innovations that we take for granted  were born in the city by the lake: The first host of NBC's ""Today"" show was Dave Garroway, a fixture in the Chicago School of Television on NBC-owned WNBQ before he moved to the Big Apple, broadcasting from the Merchandise Mart, along with Burr Tillstrom and Fran Allison of ""Kukla Fran and Ollie"" and Louis ""Studs"" Terkel's ""Stud's Place."" The latter show was an inspiration for the TV sitcom ""Cheers""  -- just as Dyja says the station's ""Vic and Sade"" was a ""kind of great uncle"" to Garrison Keillor's ""Prairie Home Companion.""I pride myself on my knowledge of Chicago (hometown of both my mother and father) but I was surprised at some of the details that Tom Dyja unearthed and placed on display in this book, which is enhanced because of its listing of sources and a wonderful bibliography. By the way, here's a link to my 2012 review of a book about Chicago in 1919, ""City of Scoundrels"":  [...]New York City-based NBC used Chicago -- at the end of the coaxial cable -- as a source of low cost programming, Dyja explains, noting that before jet air travel supplanted trains nearly every coast-to-coast trip included a Chicago stop. This flow of people made  made it America's central clearinghouse, laboratory, and factory.At the same time that the atom was being split at the University of Chicago -- which gets a great deal of coverage in ""The Third Coast"" -- the city provided a new home for the Bauhaus of Dessau, Germany, which was detested by the new Nazi regime. Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Lazlo Moholy-Nagy and others found a welcoming home in the city that created the steel-framed skyscraper and was the home of Louis Sullivan, Dankmar Adler, Frank Lloyd Wright, Daniel Burnham, John Root and many more.Moholy-Nagy, a multi-talented Hungarian artist,  found a patron in Container Corporation of America owner Walter Paepcke, who later bought the old mining town of Aspen, Colorado and started the Aspen Institute. Moholy's Institute of Design thrived and was later folded into the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), whose South Side campus featured buildings designed by Mies.This expansion of IIT affected the city's African-American community, at that time concentrated in Bronzeville, where the disastrous experiment of high-rise public housing like the Robert Taylor Homes led to many of the problems affecting present-day Chicago. Racial divisions were particularly highlighted with riots when blacks moved into formerly white, predominantly ethnic neighborhoods, Dyja points out. The maps at the front of the book are particularly useful to those unfamiliar with Chicago's geography -- and helped this former Northsider comprehend what was going on in White Sox territory.The election of Richard J. Daley as mayor in 1955 -- he was supported by legendary gospel singer Mahalia Jackson -- let to more construction that changed the skyline of the Loop. It was also the time of white migration to the suburbs and violent protests by whites against  African-Americans arriving in their formerly all-white enclaves.Dyja covers the city's rich literary scene extremely well, with his accounts of novelist Nelson Algren (""The Man With the Golden Arm,"" ""Walk on the Wild Site"") and his French mistress Simone de Beauvoir; Gwendolyn Brooks and many others. His account of how Hugh Hefner changed the face of magazine publishing is one of the best I've seen.""The Third Coast"" is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to understand Chicago -- and, by extension  the creation of post WWII urban America. On top of that, it's supremely readable. An unbeatable combination.  Update: For my Friday, Dec. 20 on-air review of ""The Third Coast"" with Craig Hammond of WHIS in Bluefield, WV: [...]/radioactivewhis and listen to the Dec. 20, 2013 broadcast replay.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UY01ZB6KASBY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1594204322#wasThisHelpful","R1UY01ZB6KASBY","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"When a publicist asks me if I want to review a book about investing, MEGO--My Eyes Glaze Over. I usually resist the impulse, but book publicist Anna Sacca has never steered me wrong so I agreed to read and review Timothy F. McCarthy's ""The Safe Investor: How to Make Your Money Grow in a Volatile Global Economy"" (Palgrave MacMillan, 320 pages, notes, index, $30.00, also available in a Kindle edition).McCarthy goes into great detail about how to get information, how to pick an investment advisor, how to invest  -- and much, much more, including how to avoid fraudsters like Bernie Madoff. At the end of each chapter, he summarizes in bullet points the lessons that should be learned in the chapter. This made it easy for me to glean the information necessary to follow a ""safe investor"" plan.If you watch any TV, log on to the web or read a print newspaper,  you'll quickly discover that Investing information  is everywhere; there are blogs, newspapers, magazines, and cable TV shows all dedicated to helping individuals invest in smarter and more successful ways.Yet despite all the efforts to educate the public on investing, McCarthy writes that most people still feel uncomfortable with how they should actually invest their money.Recent predictions about slowing economic growth, historically low interest rates, and volatile markets have investors scratching their heads about what to do with their money. And more than ever, people are scared about whether they can grow their money enough to last through their lifetime.Timothy McCarthy  has spent the last 30 years in the US and overseas providing investment solutions to individuals and their advisors. His book is crammed full of real-life anecdotes and examples of what to do -- and, even more important, what not to do when it comes to investing money that you can't afford to lose.The Safe Investor teaches investors how to organize their savings into three ""pockets"". This makes it easier for investors to budget their savings and investments into three categories: savings, investing, and trading, McCarthy writes: ""First, sit down with your financial advisor to discuss about a savings plan. Relevant information include your take home pay, monthly expenses, and a breakdown of what you spend on every month.  Once you are ready to commit to putting aside some money periodically (usually monthly), then you are ready to put this money into the three pockets.""The Savings Pocket has two objectives for. First is to not lose any principal. Second is to be liquid in case of any emergencies. Trade offs for the savings pocket is that cash sitting here will not have a real return.""The Investing Pocket is for true investments. This pocket is used to successfully minimize risks in a diversified portfolio. You and your financial advisor can decide which funds to invest in, while the book The Safe Investor, will expand on possible investments and recommended allocations. You will want to invest with a long term time horizon in order to capture compounding returns and further minimize risks of cyclical stock market activities. Meanwhile, the periodic deposits into this pocket will act as a buffer in order to lower the average price of your investments in case of a possible market bubble and crash.""The Trading Pocket is a psychological release valve. An investor that is constantly watching what the market does is also aware of popular trends and hot ipo issues going around. Rather than risk the majority of an investor's capital, the Safe Investor can save and invest, and have a third account that is proportionately smaller in order to make these sorts of bets. This will keep any investor looking to make 15%+ returns satisfied.""Savings Pocket is your ""rainy day"" pocket or for emergencies. This is short term money used for short term expenses.Investing Pocket grows more than your savings pocket but less risky than your trading pocket. The key thing is to diversify across a variety of asset classes, and across many country types and geographies. Use time in order to trickle in your investments.Trading Pocket helps to alleviate your brain's response to either panic when the market goes down, or become greedy when the market goes up. With this account, you can go ahead and make concentrated bets on stocks.""Source: Information taken from ""The Safe Investor"" by Timothy F. McCarthy, published by Palgrave Macmillan, 2014.  * * *McCarthy believes that  understanding  how to create  a  truly globally  diverse portfolio while applying the magic of time will help all investors navigate risky markets. He writes that U.S. investors often neglect foreign investments out of fear and ignorance.McCarthy  also explores the fundamentals of picking and evaluating financial advisors for those who want to understand the principles of investing but not actually do the work themselves.McCarthy  helps guide the reader along a straightforward  path to investment  success by telling engaging and actual stories to illustrate each of his seven lessons of successful investing. ""The Safe Investor"" will help even those readers with little interest or aptitude for finance to be comfortable in knowing what to do to manage their life investment plan and how to manage their own advisors.To show the kind of humor McCarthy uses, take a look at his ""Trickle In, Trickle Out"" anecdote on Pages 106-7:""Some people will know at least the 'trickle in' part of the formula by its traditional name, 'Dollar Cost Averaging.' I used to use that phrase until an evening meeting years ago  when a well-dressed woman in her mid-60s said, 'Please  forgive me for being so upfront, but none of my friends understood what in God's name you mean by this 'dollar cost averaging' thing....After showing them on a sheet of paper how just putting in a little in every year really decreases your risk over time, one gentleman exclaimed, 'Oh, you just tinkle in a little money at a time!"" His wife interrupted and said, 'George, I think you mean trickle, not tinkle. It's a bit more genteel.'With anecdotes like this, and with the puppy his mother promised him at the age of three -- an anecdote that really broke me up! -- I found ""The Safe Investor"" to be an exception to my ""MEGO"" rule.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R26RXTFUELIZ4X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1137279109#wasThisHelpful","R26RXTFUELIZ4X","A2P87NZWOXJ9YP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2P87NZWOXJ9YP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I usually run the TLR-HL's on my long guns, but I was looking for a Laser for my new AR Pistol with only 7"" of rail space,  so both space and weight were critical. Though I could buy a more compact laser only, my experience with the highly reliable and intuitive switches of the Streamlight TLR products kept me in the family. As much as I really would like a higher powered TLR2-HL version of the light/laser combo, at 3 times the price, weight and size, I can definitely live with the lower output light (the AR Pistol is a CQB/Home Defense weapon, so it's all within 20 yards for me).For either a home defense handgun, shotgun, or AR Pistol, nothing can currently touch the value of the TLR4 with Laser: just enough light, a good red laser, and Streamlight's great switches make this a great, compact, value priced deal.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ADTQT8S6ZBHO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0077RHYWQ#wasThisHelpful","R2ADTQT8S6ZBHO","A16SPGA83A4J8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16SPGA83A4J8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have been using the Hammerhead grips for almost 10 years on my featureless builds. It feels a lot like thin, traditional stock (think Keltec SU-16, Air Rifle, etc.) It also ""looks normal"", if you just swap out the grips and forgo installing your stock on this and padding your buffer tube.These are quick and easy to install (and uninstall), just like a normal AR Grip. It comes with a quality stainless steel bolt and washer, and is as solid as any other AR Grip. I have tried using the plastic cap accessories for the rear buffertube hole, but these seem to fall out after a few rounds; id suggest gluing it in place with your critical spare bolt parts and pins and leave it until you need it.If you are new to Featureless builds: Swap this grip with your traditional one, then swap your flash hider with a muzzle break, then pin your stock (assuming you have an length-adjustable, carbine stock) using a thick wire (a large paperclip works great!) though the small hole in the release piston (works for most magpul stocks; for those without a magpul stock, just drill a hole though the entire piston release area, and run a thin bolt though it, and locktite the nut on it).

"This is a well finished, well balanced, reasonably light weight springer air rifle. Easy to cock. Reasonably accurate out of the box (I am shooting 2"" groups at 15 yards, standing offhand. I'm sure I could shoot half that or better from a bench, but where is the fun in that!) So far with 100 pellets down range on day one, I am really liking this suppressed carbine.  As others have mentioned, the scope is too short in order to get to the eyebox comfortably, but it is reasonably bright, tracks well, and can adjust down to zero at 15 yards without shimming the rear mount; decent enough to get by with at 15+ yards during the break-in period, and would probably be survivable if you have long arms (otherwise, plan on upgrading the scope to a full sized Leapers or Centerpoint after break-in). Under 15 yards the scope is blurry, as the parallax is set at 30 yards, which is where the manual says to zero it at. So it is not a very good scope for close range shooting. I adjusted the trigger's second stage screw down to it's minimum setting, which seems to be pretty good...not exactly like my Geissele SSA-E trigger on my LR308 CSASS rifle, but certainly better than my stock Ruger 10/22 trigger! I think I can live with this for a while, though like many owners, I'll probably upgrade the trigger to a GRT-III after break-in.Noise-wise, it's quiet enough, even when still dieseling, to shoot in my urban backyard. If it get's even quieter after break-in, great! If not, it's plenty quiet to shoot in the city without a 911 call.I think this is a great all-arounder, and considering the price and it's low noise level, I give it 5 Stars.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTXST0Q4FUTQQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0052CP53I#wasThisHelpful","RTXST0Q4FUTQQ","A16SPGA83A4J8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16SPGA83A4J8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is why you should buy this scope for your air rifle:1) Price. It's about half the price of most other quality, air-rifle Mil-Dot, AO Scope, and comes with decent rings.2) You don't plan on shooting past 25 yards. 4x magnification with Mil-dot is just fine for shooting air rifle precision within 25 yards. If you plan on shooting past that on a regular basis, consider going to a 2x7, 3x9 or 3x12 scope (especially if you are target shooting at that distance and need to use your scope for spotting your hits)3) You want light weight! a 3x9 or 3x12 leapers will cost you an extra 5-6oz in weight. If you plan on sitting and shooting, the weight doesn't make that much difference, but if you plan on stalking game in the field, every ounce counts! (Especially when you get a bit older, or for younger or female shooters). There are a few lower weight variable options; see below.4) If you are left handed, you will want an Objective-based parallax adjustment ring like this one, NOT a side adjustment knob, as the side knob is on the left hand side, which is horrible for making regular adjustments for left handed shooters.5) You can live without an illuminated reticle. The only time you would use illumination is at dusk or night, but it is not nearly as important when using a 4x fixed power scope like this, as it is considerably more low-light capable than a high variable power scope (practically speaking, if you are shooting a variable power at dusk/night, you will likely drop the power all the way down to 3x in order to get the largest ""aperture"" you can, in order to get more light). The 4x fixed has better low light capability than a 3-Xx variable power set at 3x. All things considered, I choose a better low light scope like this, without illumination, as I can almost always make out my reticle in lower light anyway.6) You don't mind returning the scope to Amazon if you get a Dead on Arrival (DOA) scope: like some of the reviewers have mentioned, the quality control consistency appears to be lacking... some are good, some are not. Skilled budget shoppers can handle returning a dud or two on Amazon's dime. My first one was good to go.The closest size/weight/price capable Mil-Dot AO Air Rifle scope I have found to this scope is the CenterPoint/Crossman 3-9x32, which is 2oz lighter and illuminated. I have used both and find the overall quality of this scope (and included rings) to be better than the Centerpoint.Biggest downside to this scope is the very tight eye-box and no variable eye-relief distance. Most of my higher-end scopes for powder rifles (Burris, Primary Arms) have a much larger area in which your can see though this scope both front to back and side to side.

"I love the Mark 2 knife, as well as larger variants, but there are a few things you should consider before going with a bigger Mark 2, whether that be this Ontario, or the KA-BAR versions:Weight: My standard Mark 2 by Ontario, with leather handle, weighs in at 9.6 oz... quite light for a 7"" bladed utility/fighting knife, which makes for very quick snap cuts and fast and easy transitions from Tip-up to Tip-down grips and vis-versa. My 8106 FF weighs in at 13oz even. Though three ounces doesn't sound like much, it is significant additional weight, as it applies to speed and transitional grip control. Does it make a slightly better hacking tool or slashing weapon? Sure, a bit. But at the expense of speed and maneuverability. Depending upon your use model, this may or may not be a concern, but make sure and consider this issue. For self defense with a knife, speed and maneuverability are critical, which is why the USMC went with a 7"" blade (they tested dozens of different knife blade lengths and shapes when designing the Mark 2 back in 1942... there are good reasons for settling on this final design!)Handle: bottom line, it's plastic. Sure it works, but I prefer leather washers on a Mark 2. And not just for historical reasons: I like to customize the handles of my Mark 2's to fit my own hand and enhance both a Fencing & Saber grip (I prefer a bit narrower ""Commando-Style grip""). It's a very easy garage project to customize a leather handled Mark 2 with a Dremel tool, some sand paper and some leather dye; no so much with the plastic handled ones, which seem to always have air bubbles in the wrong spots, and cosmetically never seem to be color correct once sanded.Sheath: If you are buying a Mark 2 just to sit in it's box as a collection piece, this is not a concern. If you plan on carrying this in the field and around town, it is a significant issue to consider. Leather sheaths which come with factory knives are pretty thin and sometimes, not all that great of quality. At least this one comes with one of Ontario's ""SP"" nylon/leather sheaths, which are thick and stiff, but the attachment point (plastic belt loop) and security straps (plastic)  are nothing to write home about. Unlike a standard Mark 2, you can't just order up a Ka-Bar plastic sheath for $15 if you are looking for something lighter, or order up a Kydex sheath off of Ebay for it. No, you will be pretty much stuck with the factory sheath with this knife, unless you are willing to pay $65+ for a custom leather or Kydex sheath from Sky Storm... Ouch!In summary, if you want a Mark 2 that is slightly more biased toward being capable as a woods knife, and don't mind the weight, than this is a good choice. Otherwise, I suggest going with a USMC WWII tested and approved standard bladed Mark 2.","4.0 out of 5 stars","December 15, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWCE1FHLC5MVI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0018LTY66#wasThisHelpful","RWCE1FHLC5MVI","A16SPGA83A4J8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16SPGA83A4J8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"My ""Go-To"" fixed bladed defense knife, among dozens!With over 30 years of practical/tactical knife ownership, I have a pretty good collection of reasonably priced/good quality fixed bladed knives, including Becker, ESEE, Kershaw, Cold Steel, Boker, etc. Though I have plenty of prettier, pricier and more ""tacti-cool"" looking knives, I find myself strapping on my Ontario more than any other fixed bladed knife for potential self-defense/general utility use. Here is why:1. Grip. I grew up practicing with the 1st gen Gerber MKII dagger in Army Combatives training down at Ft. Benning, which requires significant grip changes during a fight; none of which can easily be accomplished with most of today's popular angled/finger grooved handles; I just cant live with a grip shaped for ""hammer-grip-only"" in a defensive knife. The WWII-proven grip style of the USMC Mark 2/Army M3 knives allows for quick grip transitions, which I believe are necessary for efficient CQB technique. The rounded pommel provides for a very quick and secure transition from tip-up to tip-down grips. The neutral center hump of the grip fills the hand well and works equally well in tip-up and tip-down grips. The leather handle version can easily be modified to be thinner/smaller/oblong via cutting or Dremeling, as well as to add some additional traction cuts; making it easy to create your own custom grip. I find the black paint on the handle to be a bit slick, so after custom cutting the handle for my preference, I sand the handle down then use my old Army boot polish kit to re-blacken the grip with dye then polish.2. Overall Knife Design. The USMC Mark-2 (1219C2 Combat knife) design was proven in WWII by the USMC to be both a good utility knife, and a good fighting knife. It can do both reasonably well, unlike the US Armys version, the M3, which only lasted a year before being canceled due to it being too fragile of a blade in a utility role, and a pretty poor slasher due to it's blade's short & wide belly and strait/bayonet blade. Very few knife designs can come close to the overall usefulness of the MK2s grip and blade combination. Speaking of the blade... very few blade designs allow for easy sharpening of the false edged clip; the MK2 design is great for that. If you prefer to have this knife to be more combat capable, and a bit less utility biased, a few hours of your time with a file, or a few minutes with a dremel or a bench grinder, will allow you to sharpen up the top 2.5"" of the clip pretty easily (because of the clip's wider angle than the lower blade angle, plan on using a 25 degree edge on the clip, rather than the 20 degree edge of the blade).3. Cost/Value. I have a hard time taking my custom etched and scaled Becker (or any other knife that I have over $100 into) and hacking away with it on the trail or in the garage without care of damage.... not so with any Mark 2 variant (Ontario, Ka-Bar, Cold Steel). At +/- $50, I don't mind scraping it up, dulling the blade, or risking a chipped edge. The 1095 steel is a bit on the soft side, but that makes it easy to resharpen/re-shape, and easy to get it hair shaving sharp with just a minor effort (even though it's just a 20 degree edge, I swear this knife will take the sharpest edge of any knife I own!).Other notes:Sheath: It's a medium thickness with good stitching; it works okay, but it's no SkyStorm!. If you plan on using it for military use, or just want a friction retention fuction, I suggest purchasing a Ka-Bar plastic military sheath for around $15 (available in black, tan, and if you can find one, green); these function well as a low slung ""semi-dangler"" (a ""dangler"" allows for comfortable sitting due to the flexability at the belt... the extra long nylon-web belt loop on the Ka-Bar military sheath provides a semi-dangler function). Though not cheap, you can also find custom Kydex sheaths on Ebay that are great, or my preference, a Skystorm leather solution (though I find it tough to spend more on a sheath than I did on the knife it's holding, a good sheath is critical as part of the system... kind of like a sling on a rifle!)Brand: I own USMC Mark-2's by both Ontario and Ka-Bar. If you don't plan on moding your leather grip, and like the natural leather look, than the Ka-Bar might be a better choice (but note: the crossguard on the Ka-Bar is swept/curved back (the 2nd mod of the Mark-2), where as the Ontario keeps with the first version of the knife delivered by Camillius in 1943, which has a flat crossguard...which I much prefer).For the price, nothing beats Ontario's version of the USMC Mark-2 as a fighting/utility knife, even after 60+ years of production.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R37PTAK6VZHG4I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0001WBIGM#wasThisHelpful","R37PTAK6VZHG4I","A16SPGA83A4J8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16SPGA83A4J8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"As reference, I have been sharpening knives for 30 years and have a box full of sharpeners.Quick note: If you are only going with ONE double sided sharpener, I'd suggest going with the Red/Green version (Fine/Extra Fine), as it will quickly sharpen a duller knife with the Red Side, and then refine the edge to a good useable field edge with the Green Side.If however, you already have the equivalent of the ""Red Side"" (a medium grit), then I'd say go with this model here, as it not only provides a good field edge with the Green Side, but then provides a final, well honed edge with the Tan Side.I already have the Course (Blue) and Fine (Red) single sided DMT Diafolds, which do a great job for rough and dull sharpening needs.

It is my first choice to use as a quick ""medium-ish"" grit sharpener among over a dozen of portable knife sharpeners which I own.if you can't properly maintain an angle when sharpening (no shame, it's takes a lot of practice!), but still need a portable/field sharpener, a simple Smith or Lansky ""keychain"" solution (Smith 2-Step or Lansky Quick Fix) sharpeners will do you pretty well, so long as you are conservative with the Carbide use. If you have the skills to hand hone, but are looking to shave a few ounces over the DCS4, or need a courser or smoother combo option, then the DMT Dual sided are a nice way to go, if you can afford them. (though they don't feel quite as solid as the Smith DCS4 due to the Smith's larger diameter handle).Considering it's value, for the tool bag or bug-out bag, the DCS4 is a great ""one sharpener"" solution.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3PGK8PMEX2C17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00009YV6L#wasThisHelpful","R3PGK8PMEX2C17","A16SPGA83A4J8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16SPGA83A4J8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The original tinted flap lasted 18 months with 4 active dogs. Seems reasonable to me. The replacement flap was clear, not tinted as shown here. The original tinted flap prevented my indoor cat from going through the door... he went through the replacement clear flap in less than an hour! Aside from that unique cat management issue, I highly recommend this segmented door and replacement flap over the traditional soft plastic flap solution; the attachment system of this door/frame solution is much more durable and survivable over the long run than the soft flap systems.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BN814X01NQZG/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004Q0C44K#wasThisHelpful","R2BN814X01NQZG","A16SPGA83A4J8H","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A16SPGA83A4J8H?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Not precisely certain why I liked ""The Barkeep"" so much, but I did.  It reminded me of ""Gone Girl"" which I read recently.  Lashner's writing is first rate - clear, precise - and his characters are first-rate - sketched out with a minimum of strokes, but I found them compelling.The whodunit is well-crafted and offers an intriguing twist at the end, but Lashner's description of family relations is terrific, and possibly that's where the feel of ""Gone Girl"" comes from.  You'll find yourself actually caring about the characters.Starts a bit slowly (first 25 pages had me wondering), but picks up speed and flows smoothly from there.Overall, and after the first 25 pages, for me, this was a great read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 1, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2HPG82KZ2DRDE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00C4ZW9HG#wasThisHelpful","R2HPG82KZ2DRDE","AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Big Sandford fan - Lucas has become an acquaintance of sorts - in fact, I think I know more about him and his life than most of the folks I see every day.  And that's a good thing, but it also means that since I like him, I cannot be fair and even-handed in my review so my only advice to anyone reading this review who has never read a Lucas Davenport novel is to skip back to the beginning and read the first Davenport and move forward in order.  If you like the first one, you'll like this one.One thing that Sandford does well is to make the horrific seem ""business as usual"" for Lucas and his partners.  The contrast of the midwestern charm of Minnesota and the vile crimes is part of what makes these novels work - the ""banality of evil"" theme is ever-present.So if you are a long-time fan of Sandford, this one will work for you.  If you're new to his work, go back and read ""Rules of Prey"" and move on from there.  You'll be glad you did.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3UHPG9CCKEMLQ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00FX7UL72#wasThisHelpful","R3UHPG9CCKEMLQ","AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Arkady Renko is among my favorite characters in detective fiction so I am always predisposed to like any book by Smith that features Arkady.  If you read enough mysteries and thrillers, you develop an affection for certain authors and their characters, and you become ""friends"" with them.  And as with your friends, you accept the characters - faults, flaws, and all.So I am not unbiased here, but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed this Renko adventure.  There is something about the setting - the ""new"" Russia - that is really appealing to me, and this particular Renko tale has added depth because the plot moves to Kaliningrad - a depressed and depressing vestige of the Cold War.Smith captures the paranoia that was necessary to survive in the USSR and now appears to be equally necessary in modern-day Russia.  Overall, it's a tightly woven and suspenseful addition to the Arkady Renko series.  If you've enjoyed the others, you'll enjoy this one.  If you have never read a Renko, start from the first and move forward chronologically.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 25, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJM5GYZL4FTW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BSA5MV8#wasThisHelpful","R3AJM5GYZL4FTW","AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Quick fix for rural areas with poor reception.  Don't give up on them.  I was bummed when they would not even pick up NPR from 15 miles away.  Started to repack it and send back then recalled a jury rig that we used to use to get signals on our radios back in boarding school out in the woods.  Grabbed a piece of aluminum foil and a twist tie.  Folded the foil so it was about 5"" tall and then attached it to tip of antenna with the twist tie.  Picked up the signal and even a station farther away - one NPR, one classic rock!  Sweet.  OK...so I look like a UFO conspiracist, but I live in the woods so don't care if I look all dorky.  Hey, I listen to NPR.If you want, you can get all scientific - see below.Does a great job of reducing mower noise,  Sound is good.  Fairly easy to program IF you read the directions.  Decent sound.The MathTo build an antenna that centers on a specific station (such as a weak station you want to receive better), use the frequency of that station in the following formula. Otherwise, use the central frequency of the FM dial (98 Mhz) for the formula to get complete coverage. In Tampa, Mix 96 transmits at 95.7 Mhz (95.7 on your FM dial), 98 Rock uses 97.9 Mhz, 103.5 Thunder uses 103.5 Mhz, et cetera.Formula:300 / (frequency in Mhz) * (5/8) * (1/2) = length in meters of the ideal 5/8ths antenna using twinlead 300 Ohm wire.To simplify the formula:93.75 / Freq in Mhz = length in meters of the ideal 5/8th's antenna.So, to get the length of the ideal 5/8ths antenna for the full FM radio spectrum (centered on 98Mhz):93.75 / 98 = .95663265306 meters, or 95.66 centimeters(which converts to 37.66 inches).To build a stronger antenna, multiply that result by a whole number.Example:  0.9566 meters * 5 = 4.783 metersSo an antenna made of (5) 5/8ths wave sections for 98 Mhz would be 4.783 meters long (which is 15'  8 5/16 "")","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2PE2QQSQMFIA9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013092CS#wasThisHelpful","R2PE2QQSQMFIA9","AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I never gave it much thought and generally regarded their instruction as fustian.This book is rendered nearly unreadable because the author does not adhere to common rules of grammar regarding the use of proper tense - it's all over the place.

The plot has just enough mystery to make it intriguing and reasonably realistic although the main character takes a few too many beatings for my taste - and certainly for his.Overall, quite a good read.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3N3CQ596HTMYC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004J4XGBS#wasThisHelpful","R3N3CQ596HTMYC","AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"It's important for anyone who chooses to use impressionism that the dots or splotches make sense when you step back.  This collection of random, idle impressions, taken together, means not much and is just plain hard to wade through.  Hemingway managed to capture life in Europe in about 10% of the words.  Hemingway's female characters are forceful and independent.  Salter's are sad, vapid shadows.As to the writing, no thought goes unexplored.  No sight goes undescribed.  It's just mangled, disconnected, prurient gibberish masquerading as modernism.  To his credit, I suppose modern American fiction had to take this step, but I'll thank him for his pioneering effort and move on to David Foster Wallace or Jonathan Franzen who have the clarity and power of coherent prose working for them.Move on.

"OK, most of the 1- and 2-star reviews note leakage and lack of fizz and then finally, nothing.I think I may have found the solutions to many of the problems listed (and I am not a shill for iSi - just a guy who hates to give up on mechanical stuff that goes bad).1.  NEVER remove the plastic tube and fill the siphon only through the tiny hole in the top of that plastic tube.  You will have less water in the tank, but that's the way it's designed. (and which leads me to the 4-star review: not that much capacity for each CO2 cartridge which makes it less of a deal but probably still better than seltzer in bottles.  Whew.).2.  Since you can't over-fill if you leave the tube in the tank, there will be less leakage, but you do have to be very careful putting the top back on after filling since it has a tendency to cross-thread which means it's not a tight seal.  So, be sure you seat the top gently but start again if there's a ton of resistance as you screw it down.3.  We have hard water and after a while, the nozzle got clogged and simply didn't let the water spray out.  Soak the entire head in white vinegar which should get rid of the scale.Overall, it's a much better deal that it seemed, but you have to be pretty careful refilling it and give it a good vinegar soak every now and then.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 22, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T4X2F0YKZMNE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00007JXR7#wasThisHelpful","R1T4X2F0YKZMNE","AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AD2QRU9ZXBQZ1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Always enjoy a ripping tale about Nazis - especially the post-war ""what-if"" plots that keep various Nazis war criminals alive and lurking about the globe trying to create the Fourth Reich.  This one is just plausible enough to be believable and entertaining.The characters in this book are pretty compelling, interesting constructs, but there are a few sentimental touches that strain credulity and dull the edge.  As well, the author needs a better editor - way too many notes, Mozart.At the end, during the exciting finish, Brown suffers a bad case of verbal diarrhea.  Every thought, every glance, every movement is recorded and even more annoying, each incident is described from the perspective of the different characters.  We get it - it's cold or difficult or painful or sad or...whatever.

"The author is an investment banker (which is like herpes so there's no such thing as a ""former"" investment banker - you always have ""it"") so I can understand how he can turn thieves into heroes.  Trouble is that investment bankers destroyed our economy - not making anything, not building anything, not hiring workers - just grabbing a couple of dimes on every dollar of any deal that they could devise.In this instance, Mickey is a convicted financier who's out and trying to recover some of his former fortune and avenge his wife's betrayal by generating a larcenous enterprise - teaming up with another convict who was part of a pump and dump penny-stock fraud - frauds that lost money for decent, trusting (but greedy) folks.  In other words, these two are scumbags of the first order.  Worse still, Mickey is not believable.  What corrupt financier (think Boesky or Milken) didn't hide a ton of dough, pay his fine, serve his time and get out with a still vast fortune?  And Mickey stole BILLIONS and comes home with a few grand in his pocket?  Lender can't have it both ways.  If you thought Tony Soprano was a swell guy and a good family man (and completely missed the irony), you'll be OK with this book.Lender is getting better - I'll give him that - but the fundamental flaws in his characters can't be avoided.Bit like his other book that built on the proposition that vaccines cause autism - a completely false and dangerous, unscientific theory.  Even that dope Jenny McCarthy gave that one up, but rich boneheads are still not vaccinating their children, exposing all of us to dreadful afflictions that were wiped out back in the 1950s.

"2.5 stars This was an amazon freebie and it's one of those books where...you keep reading even though you nearly DNF it several times. Something compels to you read on while at the same time you feel like you shouldn't. I couldn't like the main character. She just wasn't likable enough for me. I didn't like how she referred to her parents, I didn't like her actions and attitude, I didn't like her petulance, and I sure didn't like how she seems so obtuse when she's reading her birth mom's journal and it's spelled out for her: the guy you're hooking up with is a DARK ONE. Hello. Duh.Speaking of the dark one, Dorian is intriguing. But he's not quite alpha enough for me. There's a bit of the tortured soul thing, a bit of control, and then there's this vague hint that he's gonna be easily wrapped around her finger and end up meek instead of the strong type that I like. The sex goes from sweet to slightly violent to connection again. Dorian's nickname for her is ""little girl"" and boy is that fitting. So fitting.I'm torn. I'm torn about reading on because of how it ended and because I'm interested in Dorian Skotos, but I also didn't like the editing and thought this book could use a little more polish. Gabs gasps every few sentences at one point and it was annoying.But the story started to get good at the end and now I'm torn. Do I continue in this series? I don't know.

"I received an e-arc of this book in exchange for my honest opinion.Overall, this book was enjoyable. I think it took a little too long to get going and I found Riley frustrating. She keeps clamoring about being taken seriously, but she's twenty flipping two and acts like it. She acts like a the spoiled little rich girl that she is, with no clue as to how the rest of the world works. I didn't like her description of her friend, I didn't like her attitude, her actions, and had a hard time liking her.Brandon also acts way younger for someone who should be more mature based on his background. I found him difficult to like as well to begin with.The story did keep moving forward and I kept reading, but their actions and reactions often contradicted what they said they were trying to be, so this book fell short for me. However, by the end, I was definitely interested in reading more from Aubrey Parker and continuing in the Inferno Falls series.

She's returning to her roots after the death of her family, but she soon learns that it's not all fun and games and the family she thinks it is.

"This was a fun contemporary romance that blends everything that is really hot and popular right now: Jamie Fraser, rich independent woman, and kilts!I had the chance to read this for free thanks to Entangled Publishing. IT does not disappoint. This was a fun, great read with likable characters that you root for getting together. The accent is adorable of course and I am really glad that Sloane warmed up to Molly. ;)While I found her friends obnoxious, they do prove true and you root for the HEA from the beginning of the book. Makes me want to head right back to Scotland myself and find MY Jamie Fraser!","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R38VLSGTIDKAQL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y7XJR78#wasThisHelpful","R38VLSGTIDKAQL","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I outright stole the reading order for you from Michelle New's review. So here it is. And yes, you need to read them.***Reading Order***Rook & Ronin:Tragic, Manic , Panic**we meet Ford and Spencer in this series.Ford:Slack, Taut**we meet Merc and Sasha in Slack *Syd is referenced*Spencer:Bomb, Guns**we meet James and Merc gets a mention or two.James & Harper:Come, Come Back, Coming For You**Sasha, Merc and the whole gang show up.**Jax appears in the epilogueThree, Two, One: Jax is introduced (Arks brother)Meet Me in The Dark: Merc & Syds story brings us back to Sasha.***********************Sasha Ashton, formerly known as Sasha Cherlin, is all grown up. And she's a successful post-grad student, living her life, her away from the Company life. But life isn't all sunshine and roses. She's harboring secrets from her adoptive parents, a secret that keeps her terrified, she harbors longing for Nick who abandoned her ten years ago, she harbors longing for life, true life.Jax Barlow is an Agent. And he's determined to use Sasha as means to an end. But he wasn't expecting who Sasha is and what that might mean for him.This book was one of those books where you snarl at anyone who dares interrupt the beauty of all that this is. The twisty little ties coming together to form a complicated, celtic knot of love, loyalty, deceit, murder, psychosis, friendship, and all the other ties that bind.And you know what? That's my review. I'm not saying a damn thing more. Read the series in order. Get a handle on what The Company is, what it means, look for all the subtle clues that have been woven throughout, and then get this book. This Sasha chapter. And then ask yourself: could you have survived?","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R29MA0BW6C78D6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B010BUJC48#wasThisHelpful","R29MA0BW6C78D6","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"A thoroughly enjoyable historical romance that embraces that American Dream/Horatio Alger Ragged Dick fantasy of rags to riches, although set across the pond in London. This isn't just a romance but a novel that tackles the idea of self-worth, both for females and males, and non-conformity.Lucy and Trevor were childhood friends, struggling to survive in the a corner of the poorest section of town. Trevor always looked out for Lucy and Lucy only trusted Trevor. Determined to save her, Trevor takes advantage of overhearing something and shoves Lucy out to be the one selected, thereby saving her from being sold as a sex worker at a very young age by her own mother. Trevor makes his own way out of the gutter, but neither has forgotten the other.I really enjoyed how this story was wrought: from interesting side characters, to multiple historical references, this was a romantic page turner that had many facets to enjoy.Thanks to Entangled Publishing and the author for the early read! This is available now and if you love historical romances, this would be a good pick for you!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24A9NE9TI8KF6/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WRGWHT2#wasThisHelpful","R24A9NE9TI8KF6","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Bought it and then read it in the same day! I really enjoyed this romance from CD Reiss. From a glimpse inside the life of a paparazza (yes, a not i) to the gritty realistic background story of Laine and then Michael's own childhood background, it's a thorough, enjoyable read.I loved watching Laine and Michael come together, both knowing that they're basically committing career suicide if it continues, both reaching beyond themselves to think about the other. But I really enjoyed the friend characters as well. From the was-a-bitch Lucy to the foster brother Tom (how did she forgive him for that? I'd be SO mad, still! lol) to the celeb buddy with douchey friends, this whole book was like watching a romance movie in my head.I loved her S.O.S. books, but this one is my new fave CD Reiss book!","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2K7E527JJWFW2/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00XSYYB8C#wasThisHelpful","R2K7E527JJWFW2","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This was one of my Kindle Scout books and I'm so glad it was published. Just like I thought, once I opened the page, I couldn't put it down. It's a coming of age suspense novel and kept me involved with what I was reading. Rather than feeling as if I'm being told a story, I felt like I was riding shotgun with the characters, a quiet passenger on this ride that was just so puzzling.I think I would've liked a little more interaction with her dad as I felt really bad for him. And she shows emotion there, so I was kinda wishing she did a little more throughout the book. But she had SO much going on, it's easy to see why she just didn't have time.The way it ends is satisfying while leaving the possibility for more in the future. I vote for more!","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 25, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ESZKFANJU0OA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VF6T5C2#wasThisHelpful","R3ESZKFANJU0OA","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This review is long overdue. With medical crises and what is now my new life, my reading had been pushed to the wayside and I finally am picking up and getting my reviews out. My profuse apologies to Entangled Teen and the author for being so late when you so graciously granted me a review copy!With that being said, now to the review. This deserves every single gold star I can give it. Let's start with the cover. I'm not a complete cover junkie, but I have to admit that covers can lure me in. This cover is stunning in its simplicity and totally drew me in, making me want to read.But that cover is nothing to the story inside.Loosely, you can consider this a re-telling of Little Red Riding Hood. This is a fairy tale re-telling turned on its ear, made supernatural, and written in such a manner that you're gonna be guessing for most of the story.I don't want to give away a single thing, so I will leave this review by saying: Ms Harvey...I hope you write more in this world.

"I quite enjoyed this fun contemporary romance. Cassia and Bram complement one another well and I enjoyed reading their story even as I wanted to smack Cassia and tell her to get over it.When these two first meet, chemistry is evident but Cassia is dating this schmuck, Spencer. Fast forward a little while later and Bram's & Cassia's path cross again and Bram finagles a way to see Cassia daily. Their chemistry is palpable, but a relationship is hampered by their own insecurities and issues.Karen Kincy has a gift for dialogue; I loved their conversations and innuendos and flirtations. They felt real and not just contrived for a story. I liked how the story developed and I read this all in one sitting! Instead of just kink and sex, this is a book that explores romance and flawed characters who need to learn to let go and embrace moving forward.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1R5AXK50NP2EL/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00S48ZPI2#wasThisHelpful","R1R5AXK50NP2EL","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Let's start by saying this: THIS IS A STAND ALONE NOVEL. No, you do not need to read Rook & Ronin or the Rook&Ronin SpinOff series. Yes, Merc was a side character in those books, but THOSE stories are completely separate from this novel. STAND ALONE.Got that? :D Cool. I just don't want you panicking that you have to read a gazillion novels to catch up. And I don't want you avoiding this book because you think you need to read the others. You don't. This is stand alone, this is all by itself, and this is ... whoa.You should be warned: if you're looking for a romance with fluffy hearts, chaste kisses, Prince Charming, and Princess Honeypot, this is not the book for you.This book is gritty. It's suspenseful. It includes the horrors that humans are capable of inflicting on others. It touches bases on dubious consent. It contains violence. It's dark.Dark...yeah, okay, that's a start for this book. But then you kinda plummet into infinity and only little flickers of starlight to give you a little hope. Twisty? Uh, yeah. Messed up? Uh, YEAH.I've ""met"" Merc through the other books. He popped up quickly here and there within the other series. And he intrigues you greatly. You know he exudes danger, that he's a killer, that he's cold. But you also get the tiniest glimpses of some kind of honor code that is all his own. It may not be something you or I would define that way, but this man has rules.You're going to start reading this book and you're going to be hooked and not want to put it down and hiss at people who interrupt your reading. And while your'e reading, I guarantee you will go through some variation of the following inside your head as you're reading: ""WTH! Did he SERIOUSLY just do that?! Wait, what is going on? OMG STOP DOING THAT. Oh, good. OMG that guy is a jerk! COME ON, WOMAN. STEP UP! ... holy moly!""This book runs the gamut. Violence, sex, mind-screws, emotion, vengeance, all peppered with tenderness, care, glimpses of sweetness, and then...that ending.Out. Of. The.

"Disclaimer: I received an early copy of this book to read and review honestly. No other compensation was offered nor accepted.The Cabin Goddess introduced me to Kory M Shrum's DYING FOR A LIVING when the author was offering Read to Review copies. And, being the lover of Urban Fantasy that I am, I snapped it up. IT SO DID NOT DISAPPOINT. It was a five star read for me (and dudes...it's currently free to read over at amazon: http://amzn.to/1amuAwY) and so was the second book, DYING BY THE HOUR.It's not often that an author can keep the momentum going. But Kory M Shrum absolutely did with this third installment. This takes place along the same timeline as DYING BY THE HOUR, but told from Brinkley's point of view and with flashbacks that give you more to the story. It is seamless between flashbacks and the current timeline.What I loved about this book, as with the others in the series, is how the author brings her characters to life with emotion. Heart-wrenching, eviscerating emotion. From sympathizing with Brinkley to aching for his heartache, to all the feels for Jackson, Shrum takes you on another ride from the very first page to the very last.I will absolutely read on in this series. I cannot wait for the next installment!","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 8, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YMER70SQ797I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00V58YBT2#wasThisHelpful","R1YMER70SQ797I","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Perfect. This was absolutely perfect for me because I seriously adore Percy and his eccentricities and I LOVE his match made in birdland, with his ""Lady Peregrine"", Georgianna. Of course, no story is complete without a little wrinkle in the fabric of a good story and that comes in the guise of the pickle Percy finds himself in when it comes to an in-law who has her claws set on having him.With hearts aflutter, some squawking from a nasty old hen, and cute scenes of complete awkwardness from eccentric ol' Percy, this was such a delight to read.A short, fun read that's free from author Ruth J Hartman?

"FABULOUS Stroller and exactly what I was looking for. And you really cannot beat the price of this stroller.I have stage IV cancer and need to make sure I keep up with some form of activity for my health.

"Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.I was so excited to have the chance to read this sequel to  Butterman Time Travel Inc as I really really enjoyed the first book. I thought it fresh and exciting and something different from my normal reading.We are back to Alaska and Tristan & Bianca in this sequel and Bee is learning to deal with Tristan's fame and all that comes associated with it. All of this media attention etc right on the verge of her Induction Day. And Agent Garth is back...to make things hell.I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did the previous one, but it's no fault of the book itself. Hrezo has written her characters so well that my dislike for them was so intense that it was hard for me to continue reading because I couldn't stand them. Bee's parents annoyed me, Tristan pissed me off, Agent Garth, of course, was her horrid self. And I wanted to smack Bee as well, especially in the beginning, for being such...a teenager. LOL But again, I must stress, that the book is well done; this is definitely one of those subjective things and I was not in the right frame of mind to be able to ignore my dislike!The twist at the end, what is revealed, was a surprise to me and not one that I had thought of before.

"Although interesting, all of them, it could have gone into more depth. It could have elaborated the dark, and the creepy nature in all of them. Nearly believable, even.Still, I liked the rhythmic pace it is set. And because of that and no grammatical errors, or misspellings, or misuse of the words such as the ""too"" and the ""to"" (my personal peeve) - it was enjoyable to read. A quick read, for certain. I am not an expert at grammar, etc. Which is why I so admire well written works.Anyway, as far as who I will recommend it to? Easy. Anyone wanting a good, well written short eerie stories.

"It is not that I forgot to come and write this review; its that Ive been incredibly busy and, truth to be told, I have no idea how to write this review. Like all of my reviews, I shall fly by the seat of my pants. To sum up: this has to be one of the best sci fi fantasy series Ive ever read. It is brilliantly told, intricately woven, and man oh man am I glad I read it back to back. Junco is an amazing character who you both love and hate. Tier you want to love but youre unsure of what the hell is going on, and each character is like that: leaves you on a precipice.To begin, lets try a quote that basically sums up everything, in my opinion:""Lucan has placed us like actors on the stage. He's got us coming and going in so many different directions, it's impossible to figure out what's true and what's not.""Oh, dear.This final book, RETURN, is told from multiple points of view: You hear from Junco, Tier, Lucan, Ashur, and Annun. It is brilliantly told and lets you know that each character doesnt have the full story, doesnt know exactly what is happening or what to expect, and that Lucan has kept everything very, very close to the vest, even from his most loved and trusted family members. And that even LUCAN, the orchestrator, the puppeteer so to speak, doesnt know how it will end because it all hinges on Juncos reaction. Can you imagine? Existence in its entirety hinges on the unstable JUNCOs reaction. Holy. Effing. Hell.If you think I had a white-knuckled grip on my kindle and was snarling at anyone interrupting my reading time, youd be right on the money. As each person is taking his/her place on the giant chess board (damn near literally speaking, here, t00), the tension from each character at the unknown pretty much reaches through the pages and strangles you.JA Huss is a very modern author whose contemporary romances are burning up the TBRs. Im sure by now youve heard of her Social Media series that she released in the course of 12 weeks, one book/novella (120 pages average) every 2 weeks. Many were enticed by the sex, which, dont get me wrong, was hot. But they were hooked on the story. So hooked that they didnt even notice that one book in the sexually charged series didnt even HAVE any sex! Huss knows how to write and does her job well.If there is one thing you take away from my reviews of her books, please let it be this: Keep reading. I dont care if you dont like the main character in the first book of the series. I dont care if you dont think the plot is good enough to hold your attention throughout the series. You dont know s***. Huss builds her worlds and weaves her plots so intricately that she doesnt give it away in the first book. Hell, shell keeping you guessing until the last book. And thats when you hear the darn near audible SNAPS and CLICKS as everything solidifies into place. There are hints dropped left and right that are so subtle, you dont see them til you reread. I dont care if youre reading her erotica romances or this NA scifi series; I guarantee youll make that face of utter consternation as you try to figure it out and see what you missed. And thats why Ill keep reading her books.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 9, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3A1Z38FR81FRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GYKUO88#wasThisHelpful","R3A1Z38FR81FRD","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Disclaimer: Be jealous, bluebirds. I got one of the rare advanced reader copies! Don't worry; I also have this puppy on pre-order and will be happily devouring it again on November 5th!So, I think you all know that I'm not a fan of serials. I usually find them just not enough: not enough story, not enough background, not enough to keep me interested. And then I get annoyed with waiting. But with this series, I wanted more every single book. Huss had me hating her main character in the first book. So why would I want to read on? Because I'm a seasoned Huss-y. I know there's more than meets the eye. And you had all those hints about Grace and that there's something about her past.So I panted and waited, quite impatiently, for the release of each book every two weeks. Seriously...what serial do you know of that comes out every two weeks? And yet, I was STILL impatient. I didn't lose focus or interest because I HAD TO KNOW. And each book read like a full book: full of action and plot twists and characters you fell in love with. You had hot sex scenes in most of the books, sure, but the focus was on the development of this relationship, of two people overcoming their pasts, of two people becoming one and full partners.And I was not disappointed in this final installment, either. Wholly satisfying, the loose ends from the previous five books are all tied off and wounds are cauterized. And you get the deets that we were hoping to read. And, I admit it, I sighed. With contentment. And then I perked up...Will we get a Conner & Felicity story?!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E1WK4VMOWB3E/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OMC8MD4#wasThisHelpful","R3E1WK4VMOWB3E","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What fun, and new perspective on vampires. And the intro of new specie, Enchantress, gives this novel a wonderful and imaginative take.I liked that there is the ""true love"" - that is pure, and in the making from afar, though neither had known it was possible for either of them. Oh, but when it did happen, talk about ""falling hard"" and fast! Delightful. One cannot help but to cheer when finally their love is made known to one another. Glad that Louis is a good guy, although can be lethal. Then Eva, too, is no push-over. A strong female character with her own powers, and isn't afraid to demonstrate it for all to see. Not to brag, but for a purpose.Only one or two items that bothered me. It was a little annoying that Eva dithered. For a strong woman, who is not afraid so much of anything, has a difficult time being forthright about telling Louis of her feelings for him?! I thought that the authors did not do her justice in that area. It just did not fit her personality. In fact, it was opposite to what they have portrayed her as.  Another issue I had with it; it had left a couple of mysteries unresolved. Definitely saving for the sequel I suppose. This trend, the ""triquels"" and whathaveyou, is very annoying. Obviously, some novels warrant one, or two additional books, because the fans do not want the story to end. However, I believe that the authors must wrap up the first part of the story, fully. Otherwise, it is cheating the readers who have purchased their book expecting a fully told tale.As I've stated already, the book is great in itself, and I do recommend it for a good, fun read.Revised byKh","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R218H35ACFYJ6D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OJR1JMS#wasThisHelpful","R218H35ACFYJ6D","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review for a promotional tour. No other compensation was offered nor would it have been accepted.This was my first Cynster novel and I must say that I'm disappointed I have not read any before this! Rest assured that you can dive into this novel without having read any of the others previous. It may be centered on the Cynsters, but you do not need to know all of the other stories in order to enjoy Daniel & Claire's romance.I loved the setting, the time frame, and the connected feeling that is palpable between the characters from the grandmother to the aged butler to the youngest Cynster child. Plus their connection to the earth, to the Lady, and to things we often take for granted. Clean and sweet, I am very excited to join the readers who are already in love with the Cynster family and their tales. I am looking forward to Lucilla and Thomas's tale. You know it is to come, Lucilla knows it herself, but HOW will it come about is the question and I will be looking to read it soon! Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to find all the Cynster novels and read about Devil's tale, Demon's tale, etc. New Stephanie Laurens reader, right here!","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 2, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EB0TPB89UD9Z/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0778317471#wasThisHelpful","R2EB0TPB89UD9Z","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I had the pleasure and honor of receiving an early review copy of Ms Hartman's newest novel, A COURTSHIP FOR CECILIA. Like all books by Ms Hartman, a character (or two) are cat lovers and I love that! I'm instantly more inclined to like a person (or character!) who likes animals and just as disinclined to like them if they demonstrate cruelty or indifference to animal suffering. What can I say? I'm an animal adorer!A COURTSHIP FOR CECILIA had a lovely plot that kept snapping along with a background story that I want to know more about! I loathed Horace and I loathed Cecilia's mother. What a horrid woman and no kind of mother in my opinion. Because Cecilia's mother is miserable in her marriage and life, she seems determined to suck every ounce of happiness out of Cecilia's by forcing Horace, the disgusting slug, upon her as a betrothed, forbid her to visit with her brother the earl and his wife, Amelia, and generally be a pain in the butt.Luckily, Cecilia, while respectful of her mother's wishes and cognizant of trying not to betray her, has a backbone and dreams of something more. She dreams of something more with support of her brother Conrad, sister in law Amelia, and father and therefore finds the backbone to follow her dreams and enjoy the company of a Mr Radcliff.I thought Mr Radcliff's outbursts of rage against those who demonstrated the least bit of impropriety was adorable and I am so glad he had that crazy, endearing, smart uncle Percy.If you haven't read a Ruth Hartman novel yet, and adore sweet romances, regency romances, etc., then I suggest you pick one up pronto! From her contemporary romances to her regency romances, they're always a good read with a sweet romance and a wonderful escape for a few hours!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 28, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R25UE6X3580KIS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OQZBL9Y#wasThisHelpful","R25UE6X3580KIS","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Who wouldn't want the ability to be a super hero? That is what Gwen Maule gets although not by choice. I loved this heroine who is so human and flawed, fragile and strong. The setting and timeframe revolving around the recent vote in Scotland make this urban fantasy feel attainable, possible, and close.

"Disclaimer: I received an electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.""When a star about two or three times the size of our sun dies, it collapses until the entire mass of the star is concentrated at one point -- a singularity -- a black hole. As it's collapsing, it becomes denser and its gravitational attraction increases until nothing can escape its surface. In the case of the Earth, the escape velocity is seventeen-thousand miles an hour. But when the gravitational attraction is billions of times greater, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. Nothing can travel faster than light, so nothing can escape the surface of such an object. When the collapsing star reaches that size where its gravitational attraction is so great that nothing, not even light can escape, it's reached its Schwarzschild Radius.""The above quote is from Joules, Rachel's BFF in the book. He describes what you're about to experience as you journey with Rachel on her quest to find her missing sister. This book will run you through emotion after emotion. Sorrow, fear, disgust, horror, sympathy, empathy, heartbreak, and bitter relief. I honestly had no idea what I was getting into when I agreed to review this book and it was quite the amazing surprise. Bit by bit, piece by piece, more and more is revealed, and more and more is appalling, and you will be holding your breath in anticipation, and fear, as to what could be revealed next.Rachel is one hell of a character. Brave, strong, determined, loyal, intelligent, gutsy...you can't help but admire her and and be envious of Olivia and the devotion and love her sister holds for her. Even if you're totally loved and adored by your family, Rachel's love is POWERFUL. And you will gasp and grip your kindle tightly as Florentin weaves this story around and around.An excellent read.

"Disclaimer: I received a review copy from the publisher in exchange for my honest review as follows.3.5, rounding to 4I was delighted to be offered a chance to read this book in exchange for a review. I've recently found a few books here and there that deal with reapers and have become more and more interested in this kind of storyline. Morbid? Perhaps. But I like that justice you see displayed and the compassion that often comes with it.This book is no different when you're at the reaping part. Aaron displays great compassion for the recently deceased and there is fear for those who have to go to the Darkness. But the main storyline focuses around the new soon-to-be reaper and all that she discovers about the current Grim Reaper, her best friend, etc.I think I am too old for this book and its demographic. While I enjoyed reading the novel, I tended to roll my eyes a lot especially when it came to one of her best friends and the fight (""If you don't know why I'm mad, then you're stupid!"" etc.) or how Libbi's idea of fixing her best friend is to lie to him and tell him what he wants to hear or how, even after he causes her to get stitches from a display of violent temper, that violence is swept under the rug, especially when she learns about Aaron's past.  (Did you love that run-on? :D) I think I'm at the stage of my life where my tolerance for this is just absolutely gone.I am not a fan of Kyle: I found him manipulative, I disliked his tendency towards violence (doesn't matter he didn't mean to hurt HER, he meant to hurt someone), and disliked his woe-is-me crap.The ending could be termed a cliffhanger, but you could also read this as a standalone and fill in the ""after"" with your own imagination. If there's a second book for the ""after"", then hey! It was a cliffhanger! If not, then your imagination can take over.Thanks to Month9Books for the read!","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1XZBZKXFLIKZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L77YTI4#wasThisHelpful","R1XZBZKXFLIKZ","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full Disclosure: I received a copy of this book via Netgalley and the Publisher in exchange for my honest review.In all honesty, I was expecting something fluffier of this novel despite the description. It's been my experience that historical fantasy romances (or romances in general) rarely tackle subjects like violence, politics, violence and oppression of women, all while spinning a tale that is quite romantic, even if it looks like it is undeserved, unrequited, and unwanted.AVERY does all of this.As you're introduced to the land of Kaya, you learn that their people die in pairs. You find a bondmate, your eyes change color indicating as such, you live in your bondmate's heart and he/she lives in yours. When your bondmate breathes his or her last breath, you will follow shortly thereafter. Death by broken heart indeed.Except...Ava doesn't.Ava's mate, Avery, dies in the attempt to assassinate their sworn enemy's, Pirenti, queen. But Ava does not perish. Instead she becomes a halfwalker, something to be shunned, something to be ridiculed, an abomination. Her sole purpose in a life now devoid of color, taste, laughter, contentment, is vengeance.Posing as a man, taking her bondmate's name, Ava becomes Avery. She is shot down out of the sky and taken prisoner by the enemy, doomed to a life in a horrid prison off the coast. The journey goes awry and a delicate friendship is formed between her and her captor.It's a sweeping story indeed. It follows the development of the friendship, the fragile tendrils of blossoming love, the hurt of rejection, and every time we move forward, something else is revealed.I truly enjoyed reading this book and watching as the power of conviction is changed, minds are broadened on both sides, love develops, understanding blossoms, betrayals are revealed, and solidarity is formed under the truth. The one thing I didn't like, which is kinda stupid, is that pegasus was (consistently) spelled as pegasis. I KNOW. Author's right to spell it how she wants, but since it is something that is in mythology and I've only been exposed to the ""pegasus"" spelling, it was something I found a touch distracting. It's a stupid thing, but I did promise to be honest, so there it is.Five stars and I will definitely be wanting to read on and will pick up THORNE, which is now available!","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 13, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CIRBE3950OE8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BVR9W14#wasThisHelpful","R3CIRBE3950OE8","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"omfg it ends there?!?! gsyhxgfdsdhjvcfuknxsrol review to come. Jeez. Effing heck. I need more now! argh***********************************************Read through the KindleUnlimited program, so no idea if this shows up as a verified purchase or not.Um, WOW! So, one of my boyfriend's obsessions is the lore and myth behind the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. While I've read a few  books where they are the main characters or the main villain, my interest in the lore didn't really peak until he started telling me all about them. Passionate excitement about the lore got me going, I must admit.  And I am SO glad it did. While FAMINE is a book I would've picked up anyway, I was more eager to do so because of this new fascination with the horsemen.Holy. Wow.First, I send you to my little statement above all the asterisks. (Edited for amazon review due to people's delicate sensibilities and inability to handle curse words.)Yes, this book leaves you JUST LIKE THAT. Precipice and everything as the characters are looking down over a cliff.Monica Enderle Pierce's writing immediately sucked me in. Without seeming like she was telling me every little detail of the scene, I indeed got a full picture, so vivid I could practically smell the squalor coming out of Matilde's miserable apartment in the Sixth Ward. My curiosity was held firmly by the author as she brings Bartholomew to Matilde by way of the murder of crows, beasts he depends on and loathes at the same time.Bartholomew has been searching for 1500 years for a vessel like Matilde. Unfortunately for her, this means that so has Famine and her cronies. Bartholomew (remind me never to name a kid or a dog that; I keep mistyping it) goes by Monsieur to protect his identity. Matilde only knows him as Monsieur despite her constant attempts to uncover who he is. If no one knows his full name and only knows him as Monsieur, then Famine has less of a chance of finding them while they are on the run.Pierce does a wonderful job of story-telling. From the beginning, you know who Famine is, that Monsieur is somehow enslaved by her, and that the Catcher wants Matilde. But you don't quite know the details and it's parceled out to you in delicious chomps.It's wonderful watching the relationship develop between Monsieur & Matilde, to see Mr Vernon & Mrs Henderson utterly accept Monsieur as he is and keep him ensconced in humanity.And I had to love listening to Monsieur as he tells Matilde things like:<blockquote>""Hell and heaven are concepts created by men to frighten parishioners . . . because fear is profitable and faith has become a business. Frightened people will pay to have their sins absolved."" He'd found deterioration in all of God's houses. </blockquote><blockquote> I care nothing for the fabrications of that book. Animals possess souls, and they can and do seek revenge. </blockquote>He remarks on organized religion and teachings like this a couple of times and I kinda pumped my fist in the air with a FINALLY! YES! He isn't atheist, of course, as his fate is entwined with the Horseman and God's will. There is a God and there are the Horsemen and there is the Catcher, and the Beacon, and the Guardian, but no there aren't winged babies and this heaven/hell crap. I thought that was wonderful and it endeared Monsieur to me even more that he is willing to tell this to a child in such a matter of fact way.This book DOES evoke emotion. You think you're just happy getting the tale, but Pierce writes Matilde so appropriate for her age as she grows from an 8 year old to a pre-teen to an adolescent on the cusp of womanhood. While some readers may get annoyed with Monsieur, I found myself snarling at a petulant effing teenager who was grating on my nerves for her lack of respect, tone of voice, and utter lack of gratitude towards a man who, while he may not be forthcoming with hugs, took her out of the slums and is raising her to be a lady of means. While he had selfish reasons, too, and the pull of the Catcher, and of course Matilde will never have a normal life, he is caring for her, teaching her, arming her for her fate. So yeah, the teenage years bugged the hell out of me.While I might say it often when I read a good book, I know that this one is one that will stick with me and I'll be turning over and over in my head as I wait for the next installment. I can only hope that Monica Enderle Pierce is a fast writer. And I hope it's a short series of books of this length that totally enthrall and mesmerize you. While she could stretch it out to the end of days, I'm hoping that is not the case and I will soon be treated to the ending of this story. I would love to meet some of the contacts, see how Thomas Green is doing, and what role the Greens will have to play.I hope I didn't give you any spoilers and I hope you do read this. It was wonderfully crafted! And now I need to order a print copy as I definitely need to reread this one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 12, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3698JKMW4U355/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00JGSVMAY#wasThisHelpful","R3698JKMW4U355","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book as a part of this tour in exchange for an honest review.Much like book one, Garden of Eden, this book is very fast paced, with plenty of interaction between Eden and her fellow prisoners. Eden is learning to manipulate her magic while she and her friends uncover more of the Council's, and the island's, secrets.I'm enjoying the characters and the pace of these books, however I'm also frustrated as there are NO answers and tons of ambiguity. And just as you think you're getting somewhere, it leaves off, making you wait for another installment.Included in this book is a novella, which I enjoyed very much and would actually rate a star higher than the novel itself. I realize that my review this time around is more vague than ever, however, considering the length of this novel and how quickly you will be tugged in for the ride, I think it is better to keep story elements out of my review!

"Disclaimer: I received an early copy in exchange for an honest review; I also pre-ordered and purchased my own copy hence the verified purchase review!I normally am not a fan of serials. There are very, VERY few authors whom I will happily wait for when it comes to serials. I usually will just refuse to read and wait until the series is over and then snag them all up at once, or hopefully in an omnibus. JA Huss is one of those authors I'm willing to wait for. And apparently she understands and is sympathetic towards the wait and these puppies are rolling out every TWO weeks. Hello, gorgeous!So we left off in FOLLOW with Grace running away from Vaughn and his NDA, and running home towards her new job. She is mortified to discover that he is now following her @FilthyBlueBird account. We pick up with Grace confronting Vaughn about his tweets on her account. I found Grace's reactions adorable and relatable. She's mortified, titillated, tempted, and drooling. And I really liked Vaughn's reaction, too. Here is someone who normally doesn't fit into his use'em-and-leave'em NDA agreements, but he wants her badly and needs her to sign that NDA. His approach to her bank account and that hack to Starbucks may seem overbearing and controlling, but I thought it was sweet and one of those ""it is what it is"" situations. I mean, he has a point, right? Why do you work? To keep a rough over your head, food in your belly, and to be able to buy things. So, here is a simple way for me to take care of you. I'm on board with this. If I had a ton of money, I'd do that for someone I cared about to...oh wait, did I give it away? Nah, Vaughn gives himself away. Has he done this for other NDA girls? Yeah, I don't think so.So there are grand gestures in this installment, some honest yet brief conversations, and a rather decadent, indecent, delicious dinner together. Will Grace sign that NDA or what? Vaughn works hard to convince her to do so while he is internally puzzling out what makes Grace tick.But Vaughn is on to something here...there is something in Grace's past that makes her retreat into her twitter persona. Everyone has a dirty inner self, don't we? That's why there are fantasies, porn, and erotica, no? So you could argue that Grace is just letting her inner filthy bluebird out...but what's she hiding?

"A lot flimsier than I expected. The plastic is thin, two arrived with cracks in the plastic already (not yet broken, but I can tell they will snap fast because of those cracks.

"Very much a fun book, about these two, thirty something women, who are the very best of friends in the world. Their enviable friendship is a part of this Christian based novel, without aggressive preaching.The two women, Sue Jan, and Lovita, inadvertently gets themselves involved in catching some crooks against our country. And along the way, learns more about one another's inner tickings, gluing their already very close friendship.Also,  learns why they love their life in this small town of Wichita, and of the world that the God has created.Life's difficult and painful moments are dealt by the two are not only inspiring, but hilarious. What I came away from this book is, that life isn't just about smugness, and drudge. It's all in how you chooses to look at all of it. Most importantly, whatever it is that arises in life, it is only temporary. It shall pass. Therefore, the best thing to do is to leave it all up to its creator, and face it with humor, and do the best you can.Both characters are inimitable, and unique in every way. This makes them not only beautiful, but enviable.Get the book and read it. They'll be glad you did.By kh","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 8, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2GYHP8EN3GD20/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MU9JNFC#wasThisHelpful","R2GYHP8EN3GD20","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Disclaimer: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review as follows.Time is a river. Such a beautiful thought when you start to think about ebb and flow, deltas, banks, etc. When I first started reading this book, the first thing that came to mind was submersion. Jason Gurley's words, narrative voice, descriptions, etc., just completely submersed me in water. Fitting as we start with the first Eleanor, sitting in her breakfast nook, contemplating her swim and the rain.I admit, I was really mad at Eleanor's decision. I almost put the book down, unwilling to read further, but I kind of got sucked in by the writing. And I'm glad I continued.The repercussions of one decision seem to shape the event of things to come and how everyone reacts to certain things. While I had sympathy for the twins' parents, there was also this sense of rage that I had for the grandmother, too. And all of my sympathy went to Eleanor. No child should have to shoulder that kind of burden. And yet, how wonderful, too, that there is this rift for her.I don't want to give too much away, but if you're in the mood for a novel where the writing pulls you in, the characters tug on your emotions, and a touch of whimsy and what if, I'd urge you to pick up Eleanor.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1S74N3SFMEO84/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00K8IAZ68#wasThisHelpful","R1S74N3SFMEO84","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Thoroughly enjoyed it. A rare thing, of recent, when there are numerous amounts of e-books that are published by so many ""authors.""  Some, such as this author: Heidi Willard, are exceptional. There are many however, not in the least.  Not all are as talented, or gifted in writing an entertaining novel with the good research to back it up. My personal opinion is, if you are writing a historically based info book, at least get the correct facts to support the theme. Makes it more entertaining, educational, and credible. H. W. n my opinion has done just that.I expect, and look forward to, the remainder of the series. Also expect all of them to be just as well written as the BG#1, if not more.I will bet that she will exceed my expectations. Hope so.I cannot imagine anyone writing a good novel in 20 days. However, if one has it all together, I suppose it's possible.I am imagining that the two protagonists will gradually become romantically involved. How can it not? Looking forward to reading all of their adventures together.I also expect more revealing of the Will 's past. Having lived so many years, he must have enormously interesting tales of his past life. Also, looking forward to Violet's upcoming growth in her own experiences with Will.Not being a prude or anything, but I am glad that the author's editor convinced HW to drop the too racy parts. And toned it down to keep it all old fashioned romancing. It keeps better with the period.  That would have deterred me from reading it. My daughter wouldn't mind, but I'm older and that's not for me.I would recommend this book to everyone. I think it's a great read. You'll be hooked til the end, and look forward to more.Review by KHH","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BCKZ1SG4KRUT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E7TR7E2#wasThisHelpful","R2BCKZ1SG4KRUT","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Full Disclosure: I received an electronic copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. As follows:I adored this book. I thought it was quirky, cute, sweet, and I loved how it was contemporary with a touch of fantasy. A tooth fairy falling for her dentist? A dentist falling for a tooth fairy? Seriously, such a cute concept and I loved how shy both of these characters were. The take-charge sister and mother were adorable and I loved how they got involved as soon as they heard the doctor mention her name. There is an evil, nasty woman in the shape of Korkie and really...I've met people like that. Rude, delusional, and just nasty. She doesn't really get her comeuppance, but instead it's a touch more realistic with what happens to her. This was just fine with me!Ms Hartman knows how to write those romances that make you sigh with contentment, wistfulness, and happiness.

"Disclosure: I received a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.No stranger to Lia Davis's other books, I happily jumped at the chance to read this novella that deals with the relationship between Artemis and Evangelos.Recently learning that her soulmate is NOT dead and instead was banished to Earth, Artemis is given the task of delivering a message to her stepmother from her father, Zeus. In exchange, Zeus will restore Evangelos as a god, allowing Artemis and Evangelos to be together once more.For a short novella, this story had plenty of emotion and action. It can definitely be read as standalone as that is how I approached it, having not read the other books in the series. With some tense moments and bits of action, this was a fun, well-paced novella. Fans of Ms Davis will not be disappointed! I will be looking into the other books in this series to learn more about Ash and the other characters!","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 5, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SK4D01IXG0XV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MQ7YJJ8#wasThisHelpful","R1SK4D01IXG0XV","AR6SCQAD2XGTZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AR6SCQAD2XGTZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Mosquitos hate citronella. For years we've been spraying ourselves with chemicals that yield little to no results, leave us smelling awful and needing to strip down and bathe before we can touch basically anything.This product is brilliantly simple - it's a neoprene bracelet with a little compartment that houses a citronella disc. I live in the upper midwest where the mosquitoes are coined our ""state bird"". This product definitely lessened their effects while out and about. I won't say it eliminated them completely but nothing does, and compared to spraying awful chemicals on myself this one really held its own without the mess.

"If you spend any amount of time on the internet you quickly find yourself needing more passwords than you could possibly remember.

"I've owned Swiss Army knives for years. They've always been worth the price to me and are still constructed at a standard of quality that sets Swiss Army head and shoulders above the competition.This knife is an exceptional value for its price. The blade is sharp, the tools perform their functions quite well and everything tucks neatly inside. At 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a comparable Swiss Army knife, this knife is a great alternative for a child or someone who is prone to losing their knives.

"I needed a solution for storing my summer weight bedding that was better than my old method of cramming it onto the top shelf of the linen closet.

"I have bought many types and brands of tweezers over the years... from big box retailer no-name cheap tweezers to premium brands like Tweezerman. When it comes to tweezers you really do get what you pay for... a cheap tweezer typically doesn't have two completely smooth/flat tweezing edges and is a pain to tweeze with, resulting in slipped or broken hairs.With that said, I was incredibly impressed with this set. In this set you will find three tweezers: a straight tweezer, a slanted tweezer, and a pointed tweezer. My personal preference is to the slanted tweezer but they all have their place. These tweezers are on par quality-wise with some of the most expensive tweezers I have ever owned.

"My favorite cutting boards are those plasticy boards you can buy at big box retailers in a 4 pack for around $6. They're not without their shortcomings though: they warp easily (especially in the dishwasher), they tend to slide around on the counter and I consider them to be semi-disposable because they wear out sooner rather than later. For the price, however, I felt like I couldn't complain.These cutting boards totally blow those out of the water. In this set you get two cutting boards (one regular and one mini). The big mat is great for cutting larger things like big cuts of meat, large veggies, etc. and the mini mat is perfect for smaller veggies and dicing.The ""self healing"" property isn't 100% - once there's a cut in these mats you will always see it to a degree but the severity of it does lessen. I've ran these through the dishwasher a few times and have had no warping/bending/deforming with either mat. I love that they are flexible like my cheapo big box retailer mats but these ones are thicker, durable, and they stay put on my counter.

"I'm not a wine connoisseur by any means but I do enjoy an occasional glass (or three if the day's events warrant it!). I've been hearing great things about aerating wine for a while now so I was excited to try it for myself.This product works exactly as expected -  aerating infuses oxygen into the wine as it's being poured which, by some type of sorcery makes the wine more fragrant and flavorful. Yeah, I was a skeptic but now I'm a believer. Try a glass of non-aerated wine next to a glass of wine poured through this pourer and you will notice a substantial difference in the richness and fullness of flavors in your wine.

"I try to drink a considerable amount of water daily and with a toddler running around I've ditched the cups and resorted to using bottles. I love to have my water icy cold and my biggest gripe with most bottles is that they sweat like crazy and get condensation all over everything. Many of the double walled bottles I've looked are smaller in size and I don't have time to be refilling my bottle multiple times per day.This 25oz double wall insulated bottle is the best of both worlds. It's a larger size, it doesn't sweat, it's stainless steel (which is highly recommended over even BPA free plastic). It's easy to fill and my water stays cold in it for far longer than in a single wall bottle. When using the included pouch (which is a made of a neoprene material and is quite sturdy) the water stays cold even longer! This is great for tossing over my shoulder when running out the door.This set is great for anyone looking for a decently sized, sweat-free, icy cold beverage that's easily transportable.

"This is a great all-purpose server. The size of it is appropriate for pie but I love using it for pizza as well. It would also be great for cake and I intend to use it for just that the next time I bake one.The server itself is lightweight yet sturdy and the serving portion can handle heavy food items without an issue.

"This is one of those products you never realize you need until you own one. I was fine with just laying my phone on my desk. Yeah, the weight and pull of the cord while having it plugged in caused it to rotate around on my desk. And I'd have to either pick it up or rotate it back and lean over so I could view the screen properly every time I wanted to use it. But I was doing ok.Then this product graced my desk. It's a simple concept: a metal stand designed to A: hold your phone at the ideal viewing angle and B: Keep your phone in place while plugged into the charger. This stand really has one job and it does it well: it holds my phone, perfectly in place at just the right angle so it can be viewed and used. There's an opening for the cord to be threaded through, a lip on the stand portion that keeps my phone in place and a back rest to keep it at just the right angle. I can turn the screen on and have full use of my phone without having to pick it up or fight with the cord and rotating issues. The stand is heavy enough to handle the job but not any heavier than it needs to be. It's large enough to cradle a phone properly but not so large that it's cumbersome. It really is perfect.Sometimes the simplest concepts create the largest amounts of convenience, and that's exactly what this product does. Great product, highly recommended for anyone who spends any amount of time at a desk and wants/needs their phone to be fully accessible.

"I ordered this set for use with my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone. Looking to add a bit of dimension to my photos, I was really excited to try this product.This set comes with three lenses: a fish-eye, a wide angle, and a macro. The lenses screw easily onto the clip and the clip attaches easily to any phone. The lenses are great quality-wise and the included storage bag is handy for transporting and storage, keeping them free of dust and/or potential damage.My only gripe with this style of lens is that the other side of the ""clothespin"" style clip presses down on my screen. It doesn't press hard enough to damage anything in my opinion but it does partially obstruct your screen. On a phone where the camera is located on the corner I would expect it to press down on the outer edge instead of the screen. I still use this product on my S6 and am not worried about screen damage, but thought it was worth mentioning.Overall I'm really pleased with this lens. If you're looking to add some fun options to your standard phone pics, I highly recommend it.

"I ordered this product to use on achy muscles after working out or just at the end of a long day. I've used other products (ie: IcyHot) with varying success.

"These parent-powered nasal aspirators beat those old school bulb syringes out of the water. We bought a NoseFrida shortly after my son was born and promptly threw the bulb syringe in the trash. With this method you can get much better suction and in the exact amount you need in order to effectively clean baby's airway. My son is 18 months old now and we've used a few different brands now, each having its own pros and cons.What makes the BabyBubz aspirator great:-This is the first one I've used that is designed with two tubes and a collection container. This is ingenious! Mucus travels from the nose into the chamber and has no chance whatsoever of coming up the other tube (with the Nosefrida there is a filter in place but if baby is particularly stuffed up things can and will reach the filter, which they then advise you replace, and replacement filters aren't free!).-The shape of the end that goes into the nose is really unique. It's tapered to fit just inside the nose but is designed to prevent you from inserting too far. We found the shape of this one to be great for getting a good seal in the nostril without it going too far into my little guy's nose.Overall I'm really impressed with this product. It's easy to take apart and clean, works well, and like I said there is zero chance of anything you remove from baby's nose getting anywhere near you.

"This phone holder is awesome. I recently upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to an S6 and previously used a Runtastic phone case to hold my phone on my bicycle. This case irritated me for several reasons: it was expensive, I had to remove my phone from its case to fit it inside the Runtastic, and the sliding ""lock"" would unlock itself on bumpy trails so I had to keep a rubber band around it to make sure it didn't come open and toss my caseless phone on the pavement.So with that, I was a bit weary about another phone holder. Would it hold my phone securely? Would my phone fit while inside its case?Yes, and yes! This case holds my S6 perfectly while inside a pretty bulky Otterbox. The side arms have a multitude of ""clicking"" positions so they can provide a customized fit for just about any phone. The single tab on the bottom that braces the phone is adequate and allows the charging port and microphone to be completely unobstructed.I've taken this holder over some pretty rough terrain and my phone has stayed put. This is easy to install, easy to use, and works perfectly. It's everything I could hope for in a phone mount.

"We ordered a Knot Theory silicone ring for my husband a few months back and have been extremely happy with it so I was pretty excited to see the company offering womens' rings as well.My first impression of this ring was mostly a positive one: the color is gorgeous (maybe a touch less bright than the stock photo but not too far off) and the smaller dimensions are just what I wanted (the men's rings are primarily large and too thick for my comfort).When I put the ring on I was a bit concerned about the thinness of it. Don't get me wrong, it's not *too* thin - but it's quite a bit thinner than the men's rings and I questioned its durability for this reason. Well, I have an 18 month old who took an interest in it as soon as I put it on. He has tried to pull it off of my finger many, many times and the ring has held up beautifully. No rips, no tears, no signs of any damage whatsoever.I can't say enough good things about this ring. If you work with your hands in an environment where a traditional metal ring poses a safety hazard, or if (like me) you have a little one and don't want your ring scratching them, I highly recommend this product. It's so nice to be able to wear something in place of my wedding ring that won't scratch my little guy.

"My son has several smaller bath toys (ie: foam letters, little floating whatnots, etc.) that I wanted to keep from taking over my bathroom while still allowing them to dry properly. This hanging organizer is great - the front and top portion are mostly made of a heavy duty neoprene (which does not hold water). The ""window"" and back are a mesh material that allows air flow for proper drying. The neoprene gives the organizer stability without impeding the toys' ability to dry. The top portion has two heavy duty grommets for hooking the suction cups through. The organizer is roomy, durable, and just what I was looking for.The suction cup hooks, on the other hand, leave a lot to be desired. Out of the package one of them broke on me (a plastic pin came out that I was able to replace but I'm nervous that it could pop out again and pose a choking hazard). The hooks don't suction overly well to my tile shower either, but I imagine they'd do a lot better on a completely smooth shower wall. For now I'm using hooks I had on hand from another product and will probably just dispose of the included hooks. The organizer itself is worth the price... just expect to purchase a better set of hooks separately.I received this product at a discounted price for the purpose of evaluating and providing an honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 29, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31CDHLYI3SSC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Y41C52W#wasThisHelpful","R31CDHLYI3SSC9","A25TVH9W5A6IHP","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A25TVH9W5A6IHP?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a wonderful set. These teethers aren't like anything I've seen before... they're a flexible silicone but are actually on the thinner side. Full disclosure: when I got the package I was surprised by how thin they are so I wanted to make sure my son wouldn't be able to bite through one and have it pose a choking hazard. I bit down on one and gave a valiant effort at biting through it and was unable to. My son LOVES these. He currently has four molars coming in at once and tries to shove anything and everything he can back there. Most teethers are thick and are only able to reach the front teeth .These he can actually get back there to bite down with his incoming molars. He searches these out in our playroom.The bib is great as well - adjustable neck, open scoop at the bottom to catch messes, and flexible enough to be comfortable.

"I've been using wool dryer balls for a couple years now. Prior to wool I used to use those As Seen on TV blue rubber balls with the little nubs all over them. My reason for switching were that after some time those actually begin to ""burn"" and darken on the ends of the nubs and they emit an odor that's unpleasant and I didn't want it on my clothes.I thought I had a good thing going with my wool dryer balls until I bought these. There is simply no comparison. These are very dense, tightly felted, and generous in size. Six of these in the dryer helps soften your clothes and decreases drying time because the dryer balls work to separate garments as they tumble, increasing air flow. These wool dryer balls still look brand new (as expected). With a product like this you're more likely to have to replace them when one by one they eventually get lost.

"So I'm one of those people who had a ""bladder of steel."" I could go all day if I wanted to... never an issue, never an accident. My pelvic floor muscles were perfect. Then I had a baby, and oh how cruel mother nature can be. Despite doing the recommended kegel exercises (which I've always found to be an icky sensation and loathed doing them) my pelvic floor muscles became just another casualty of the miracle of birth.This product appealed to me for a number of reasons: as someone who is no stranger to the gym and has a firm grasp on how the muscles in our bodies work and what needs to be done to improve their strength, learning of this product was a ""duh"" moment for me. Doing ""kegels"" as described by doctors and mommy friends is basically like lifting weights with no weights and expecting your muscles to respond. Sure, resistance training has its place but not here. I know kegels can be effective for some but I was looking for better, quicker results. A recommendation from a close personal friend who has had success with this type of product and the opportunity to order a complimentary set finally pushed me over the edge and I was willing to give it a try.In this kit you will find six weights that get progressively heavier. You are advised to start with the lightest weight and if you are able to hold it in place for two minutes you can move on to the next weight. Honestly, I had a hard time with the lightest weight. My pelvic floor muscles are a mess. After diligently using the first weight as best as I could, once per day for 15 minutes at a time, I began seeing results in just a few days.I'm now on the second weight and I can feel a difference in the strength of my body in holding the weight in place. These weights give your muscles a reason to flex instead of just flexing against nothing so at least for me they eliminate that icky, uncomfortable feeling I get from just doing ""air kegels"". The weights are all exactly the same size so once you get used to them you don't have to keep getting used to a new size as you move up to heavier weights.I would highly recommend this set to anyone looking to work on their pelvic floor muscles, for whatever reason.

" 4:33 MinsThese are really nice. It comes in a great box, and did come with a partial charge. I did charge them over night though to make sure they were fully charged before using.They were easy to pair up with my phone as well as my tablet. And the connected back up with no issues.I love the look of these, they are a nice sleek design. And they fold up nicely. I keep them in the box when I am not using them and they fit back in with no problems. I do wish they had a storage bag or case to keep them safe when not in use. But for now the box will work.You can expand the head band and there is some wiggle room in the ear muffs. The ear muffs are really comfortable, there is lots of cushion to them so they didn't bother me at all. And the headband also has lots of padding. They are lightweight and fit good on my head.The sound on these are really good. I am no expert but I like the sound. Everything is crystal clear, good bass and there is no distortion, static or anything else. And they get very loud. With the over the ear design they do block out noise really well.

"When traveling for a night or more there are some things that just must come with me. From deodorant to medications. And normally I just use zip lock bags to put things in and it can be a pain. But now I actually have a bag that is the perfect size to hold it all.This is a large bag, bigger then the pictures make it look. I am able to fit plenty in it. And there is a smaller zipper pocket in it where I can keep my medications so I know right where they are.The bag is made of a nice thick nylon fabric that is easy to clean and looks good. The zippers are strong and the main zipper has rope attached to it for easier gripping. I have no issues with the zippers, they do not catch on the fabric or get stuck.There are handles on both ends of the bag and on both sides of the bag, so plenty of ways to get a hold of it.I am happy to have this as part of my traveling bags.Product provided at no charge for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3AHPHUY0FSO6W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170MP87K#wasThisHelpful","R3AHPHUY0FSO6W","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

" 1:50 MinsThis is super pretty. I like the design of it and the way it looks when it is lit up. All the colors are really pretty.It's simple to turn on. Just flip over the solar panel cover and slide the power to either colors or white light. And then put the cover back on top of the globe. Then when it gets dark enough it will light up. It looks great inside as well as outside. I also noticed it does not need direct sunlight for it to get a charge, but it does help.The glass pieces are super nice, but they do have sharp edges so I would probably keep small children away from it. And the calking could use better clean up.I also wish that the top was secured some how. It just sits on top of the base, it's not screwed in or anything. And it can fit on either end of the base.Even with those issues I love this thing.

" 0:55 MinsI actually like this phone wallet more then I thought I would. It's great. It was super easy to attach to my phone and actually what I did was attach it to my outerbox case that is on my phone and it works great.All I did was peel off the backing and stuck it in place. I applied and rubbed pressure on it for a few minutes to male sure it got a good stick to my case and that was it. It was ready to use. Now when all I need is my ID and CC I put them in this phone wallet and am on my way. Being someone that doesn't carry a purse this is wonderful. It is not bulky and it holds the two items securely. My only con is that I feel it should cover more of the card you have in it so that it isn't as obvious of what you have it in.

"I was a bit skeptical about this at first, but decided to give it a try. And I am glad I am.What a neat gadget. I used my GalaxyS3 and it worked perfect with it, although my phone seem tiny in it, lol. I also did not have my phone in any kind of case when I used it.Now to actually use this you do have to download apps that will work with it. I have only done the rollercoaster app so far. It seemed blurry at first but did correct itself. I do wish there was a way for us to correct it though. Seems like it could have been a sharper image but that could be the app itself. And since it was a free app I am sure that plays a part on quality.Now the adjustments for the straps are good, easy to do and I was able to adjust it to fit my big head. Comfort wise I give it a 8. But it is a bulky item so it will take some getting use to and most people don't mind things on their heads. The cushion around my eyes was soft enough and did not hurt in anyway. The nose again is something I need to get use to, not painful, just odd feeling.Having the remote is nice. It takes 2 AAA batteries that are included. I like that I can change the volume for sure. The remote works as a remote should. I did put Velcro on the bottom of the remote and on the side of the glasses so when not in use I can keep them together without worrying about losing the small remote.

"This build a snowman craft is pretty neat. It comes with 3 separate canisters so you can build 3 separate snowmen. Or if you really wanted to you could smoosh it all together and build one big one, lol.Each canister comes with everything you need for the snowman. Comes with the arms, eyes, nose and even the mouth. The foam is in a plastic bag and then the pieces are in another sealed bag.It is easy to play around with the foam putty to get what ever shape you are wanting. And you can remold it but be sure to do it all before it completely sets up and gets hard. I would say it took about 3-4 hours for it to completely set so you do have some time to play with it all.This would make a great craft at a winter party of any sort.

So when I came across this one by icooker I figured I would get it for him. So far he is pleased with how well it works. Says it does what it should and now he can finally fix those things that needed to be soldered.It comes with  the main tip that is on it and 5 extra tips of various shapes and sizes. And the tips are easy enough to change out that even I can do it. I like that it is a smaller iron and is lightweight so that either myself or my daughter can use it when we want to. There is a plastic sleeve over the handle near where the tips are so you won't burn your hand from the heat of the unit. You are able to control the heat of it as well. So I feel that gives me good control over things as I learn how to solder.The solder heated up quickly and does a good job. My husband is actually impressed with this little guy.

"I use tongs for everything from salads, to flipping bacon while it is cooking. And I love silicone tongs because they can be used on any type of surface with no worries of scratching things. And normally what I do is grab a small plate to put lay the tongs on or when using for a family style salad I lay them straight on the table and I always hated that and have wanted tongs with the built in stand. I will say now that I have some and have used them I am really loving them.I still end up needed a plate for when I use these on wet things but now I can use the stand to keep them up right and easy to grab. They stand up good, don't fall over or tip in any way. The tongs completely close so I am able to pick up thin things like bacon and they hold on to the bacon. They have good grip to them. The handles are comfortable to use, there is small divots for your fingers to rest at. And the lock and unlock loop at the ends work great, and are easy to use.

"I truly love this masher. My kids love when I make mashed potatoes and I try to make them often. Some times I whip them but I prefer to just mash them and the other mashers I have, have straight up handles and it's not the best design for the job. As soon as I came across this Kukpo masher I knew I had to have it.The handle being the design it is makes so much sense. It is flat and is a perfect size for my hands to hold it and mash things. The handle is made of a heavy plastic and the remainder of the masher is stainless steel. There are 2 different size holes in the masher that are perfect sizes to get the job done. And the oval design works great. It is large enough to do a great job on anything you need to mash. I have used it on potatoes as well as cauliflower and it worked better then others I have used.The handle feels good in my hand and I have better control when mashing. It actually took less work and time to get the job done. As with all Kukpo items, this is solidly made, strong, and looks great. Being stainless steel makes it easy to clean as well.

I then removed my curtain rod and slipped the rings on that way. Through the years I have found this to be the easiest and less stressful way to put up new shower curtains. Now since they are so tight once closed they do not open up by accident like many I have used in the past. They slide back and forth effortlessly and do not snag on the curtain rod. I am very pleased with these.Product was provided for my honest review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3LLDMHEWQ2PXY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011R29SX4#wasThisHelpful","R3LLDMHEWQ2PXY","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 6:44 MinsI am new to using a electric deep fryer but not new to frying. I normally use a cast iron pot and although it works great I wanted something bigger and something with baskets. So getting this is a real treat for me.It comes with 3 baskets, 1 large basket and 2 smaller baskets. You can either use the large one alone or use both of the smaller ones at the same time. It also comes with 2 removable handles for the baskets. The lid has a window to look through and also a filter to help reduce the frying smell.The plug goes into the back and is magnetic, that was kind of weird and I kept thinking it wasn't plugged in properly but it was.Before getting started I washed the unit and baskets out with some hot water with mild soap. I also made sure everything was dry before adding the oil.Ok so after I added the oil I was super excited to get started so I read the manual that came with it and umm had no clue how to get things started. They are very vague on how to get it going. But with some playing around I figured it out.Plug it in, hit the power button, hit the select button, then the +or- button to adjust the temperature you are wanting. Then hit the select button again to select the duration time, then hit the power button again. Now the duration time goes up to 99 minutes and once that time is up the fryer turns off automatically. It's a great safety feature unless you need more time to fry what you want, then you need to start that process over. But as long as you do it fairly quick the temperature stays. I know it all sounds daunting but it's a breeze once you do it a couple of times.Also when you turn the unit on and get it set the red power light will turn on and once it gets to the temperature you want it will turn to a green light.It does take the unit a while to get up to the temperature but once it does it keeps it's temperature really well. The light will cycle back and forth from green to red, that is normal, it is just doing it's job to maintain the temperature.  It was really great to not worry about me trying to maintain the temperature myself and have the unit do it for me. The unit is stainless steel and does get hot to the touch except for the handles and around the bottom. So you are able to move it around if needed when it is hot. Cool down does take a long time as well.The lid can be put on when the baskets are in the oil, there are slots on it to let the handles through. But for me I prefer to watch my food cooking so I do leave the lid off until I am done using it.I like how well the baskets are made, they do great in the hot oil and are easy to clean up. The tank can also be removed for easy cleaning.Storage is pretty nice, you can fit all 3 baskets and the handles in the tank once emptied for safe keeping.Over all I am very pleased with my first electric fryer and look forward to frying up things more often.I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16B3ITF2BH9CV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0178HNTB4#wasThisHelpful","R16B3ITF2BH9CV","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:01 MinsI have tried a few different hand grips and most are either to big for my hands, to hard to adjust or don't have adjustment. I had almost given up till I cam across this one.I have week hands that are getting weaker and I have arthritis so I really wanted something I could do to keep them moving and get them stronger. I want something simple that I can do while watching t.v. Well this is my solution.This Kylin sport hand exerciser is great. It is super easy to adjust, and I love that it starts out at 10kg(22pounds) and goes up to 10kg(88pounds). It is a good range for me to work up to and making it ideal for multiply users.The grips are a good size and are anti slip. They also don't hurt my hand like others have.Over all quality is good, The spring is placed securely and moves properly during adjustment.

"This is a really pretty tea light holder. I love the design and when lit at night it cast really cool butterfly shadows on all sides.It is on the small side. It is made of a softer metal and with that it is easy to bend part of the design. But to get the shadowing and illumination it is the way it needs to be. I do love the butterfly design. And  I like that it has a little carry handle and the way the top lifts up to get the led tea light candle in it. It's very much like a real lantern.The small size makes it great to put on a mantle or a shelf. It is also light weight so it's easy to grab it to turn the candle on and off.I could see using these for a outdoor dinner party. And they would make great party favors, it would be simple to attach a small name card to it.Over all it really is pretty and I do love the butterflies. It does add some nice ambiance to my bathroom and acts as a night light.The only con was mine came as is, it was not in it's own little box so it would not be good for gift giving that way.Product was provided at no charge for my honest and unbiased review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1OKARD29JW7GW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0170Z4EG8#wasThisHelpful","R1OKARD29JW7GW","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"What a great dog leash to have when you need to walk the pooch at night. No more carrying a flashlight and fumbling around with it. The light on this is really great, it is plenty bright and covers a large enough area in front of you. It's easy to turn on and off as well. And being able to remove the flash light is good for when you need to pick up after the dog or if you just prefer to hold it in your other hand.As for the leash, well for me I love it. It has a great handle that is large enough that one can get a good hold on it and it doesn't hurt my hand. Now being retractable can be great. And it does retract fairly easily with the push of a button. But it does take some getting use to though. And I would use caution if you are retracting it while not attached to a dog, it kind of does like a tape measure so it could flick the metal hook back and hit your hand. The leash can get up to 26 feet long, so lots of room for the dog when wanted. The housing of the leash is a heavy duty plastic and  seems pretty solid and the leash is nylon, is very strong and feels like it will last some time and hold up well. Over all I am really liking this leash.Product provided at a discount for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10ZNQVJYJCA1X/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0174M8XRS#wasThisHelpful","R10ZNQVJYJCA1X","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great backseat organizer. And it fit my Honda Fit and my VW Jetta so it seems to fit many car styles. I love how easy it is to install and remove. All I had to do was clip the top around the head rest and the bottom around the bottom of the seat. Both strap are easily adjustable so you can get them nice and snug, and I was able to tuck away the bottom strap into the seat so it does not bother anyone sitting in the front. I like how easy it is to move this from car to car and we can even leave the items in it when we move it.There are enough pockets on this for all my needs and then some.  My 10 year old is able to put her tablet in the both the upper slot and the lower one since neither of them are separated. And I am happy she now has a spot for her water bottle and any snack she may have.The material is polyester so cleaning it is fairly easy. I just soak it in the sink with some warm soapy water and wipe it with a wash cloth or a sponge. It does take some time to dry though so keep that in mind. Although it probably could be put on low in the dryer, not sure haven't cleaned it that way. The stitching is well done and the mesh seems nice and strong.

"One can never have to many containers when you have kids that tend to throw them away or just straight out lose them at school. This set is perfect for us. They are 12 in this set and that is great. I use mine for everything. From leftovers to craft items. And I use them for my kids lunches. They actually hold a sandwich pretty good with some chip even. And with the lids being clear I can see what is in it with out having to pop the top off.They are a thick enough plastic with a lid that snaps into place, even after many washes in the dishwasher the lids still fit perfectly. Oh did I mention they are dishwasher and microwave safe. I love that they all fit inside each other for easy storage. I don't have a whole lot of cabinet space so being stackable really helps.

"The though of using a shock collar on a dog kind of freaks me out, so this vibration collar is the perfect solution. And the fact that it starts out with a sound first is great. It gives the dog a chance to control the barking with such a harmless way. I know there are dogs out there that are stubborn and it takes a lot to control them, but luckily not all dogs are that way so this really is a nice option.All you have to do is put the battery in the unit and put it on the dog. You do need to make sure it is snug so that it detects the barking and is able to send the vibration if it is needed. Now it is suggested that you put the collar on without the battery for a day so the dog gets use to it and that does help for sure. I also like that once it starts helping you don't have to have it on the dog all the time. And the hopes is to not have to use it at all. It will take some time but it will be worth it if my dog stops barking all the time.Product provided for testing and reviewing purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 18, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHL0KEK5STP00/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B011B8VBOS#wasThisHelpful","RHL0KEK5STP00","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

And I do use the same design for the same type of product that I am using them on.They are large enough for my needs and they are easy to apply to just about any type of material you can think of. They are easy to write on. I actually have chalk markers from Stardom that I use on them and all my writing looks great. You can also use regular chalk on them.

"This doll house is pretty neat. I got it for my 10 year old and she loves it. She actually uses her Monster High Dolls in it as well as some Barbie dolls and Kens.I am only familiar with the plastic doll houses so I was really impressed with this wooden one. It is extremely sturdy and well made. And it was a lot easier to put together then I thought it would be. It took myself about an hour to put together, but I was taking my time making sure I did it correctly. And everything lined up nicely and properly.The dolls fit in it well enough but the furniture is smaller then my daughter would have liked. But the furniture is well made and will hold up to her abuse. The details on the house are really good. And it is holding up so far. And I like that it is a space saving design, It fits in a corner nicely.Now my daughter isn't into the whole Frozen theme stuff but she actually likes this one and has been enjoying it. And so have I, I mean one is never to old to play with a doll house. My daughter loves that it has 3 levels and 2 sides of play. Her and her BFF have been having more fun with it then I thought they would. But I hear them be very creative when playing with it. I don't know what age is to old for doll house play, but I will let her be a kid as long as she wants to be.

You can either have the tips of your pencils in the flap to protect them, or if you are like this house we leave the tips out and have the bottoms of the pencils in the flap.

It is easy to apply and I apply a thin coat so it doesn't take for ever to dry. There is a slight shine to it but nothing spectacular.As for how well it works. Well for me it worked as good as any other top coat I have used. I use a good quality nail polish to start with and I make sure that they are very dry before I apply any top coat. It went on with no problems, I did not have any streaking of color and there was no tackiness once dry. It left my nails feeling and looking smooth. It took about 6 days before my nails starting chipping. I see the word Gel being used with this top coat but it is not a gel, it is just a regular top coat, nothing fancy about it, it's the same as what you can buy anywhere. I think maybe the wording in the description is misleading and causing some confusion. That being said, it's a basic topcoat, it works and does as a topcoat should do.I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R86NIFMLNOBN0/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00N15MDIS#wasThisHelpful","R86NIFMLNOBN0","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Living in Western PA we tend to get a lot of snow and frost on our windshields and having to clean or scrap it in the morning is a pain in the butt. And then in the summer of course we get lots of sun and having a black car with black interior means it gets really hot inside.Well now with this dual windshield cover I have 1 item to help with both seasons. How cool is that. I no longer dread the seasons.I have a Honda Fit and this fit it nicely. I was able to put in on myself which is a great bonus. What I did was take the widest end and put that on the top of the windshield. I then tucked the flap into the door, closed the door and poof that side was done. Now there are 4 magnets on the cover, 2 on the top of it just before the flaps that tuck in the door and 2 at the bottom of the cover. So as I walked to the other side of the car I made sure the 2 magnets on that side were in a good spot. Then I repeated the process on the other side. That's it. I would have like a couple of more magnets due to windy conditions out here, but so far it seems to be staying in place.And with it being made of polyester it means easy cleaning. I just hose it down or wipe it down with a cloth. It folds up nice and small and comes with a case to keep it in.I received this at no charge in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R766DZBS1K9W5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VG7Q75I#wasThisHelpful","R766DZBS1K9W5","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

I do wish there was something on the bottom to hold it though for extra security. But for my piece of mind I just turn it on it's side and leave it sitting that way. The over all quality seems to be good. Seems well made and will hold up well.It is easy enough to install into the CD slot and just as easy to remove. It holds my phone nice and snug.

I also like that is has a small pouch to keep them in, it helps keep me from losing them. And the little nail file is very cute.

And it doesn't require a lot of effort to cut my nails. They are stainless steel and have good weight to them and feel good in my hands. I feel like I have a good grip on then when using them.

"These are a perfect fit for my husband and myself. We love the variety that the set has and they are cute. There are enough different designs and colors to satisfy us both. They come wrapped in 3 different groups so you could gift each group. that would be 3 gifts taken care of in one purchase.They seam to be pretty true to size. I have size 10 women and my husband wears 9.5 men. And they fit us both really nice, with lots of room for larger feet. We both like our socks to be a little lose. They have some stretch to them thanks to the spandex, so they will defiantly feet larger feet for sure. They are very comfortable and are nice and soft. The quality of the fabric is nice. The stitching is well done, and the colors and patterns look great. The material is breathable, not to thick yet not to thin, but the cuffs at the top of the socks are twice the thickness of the rest of the sock. These are defiantly higher end socks. I am really impressed and am very happy that I got them.I did receive a discount in exchange for my honest review and this is my honest review. I highly recommend these.

And I have learned that anything that comes from China or Japan runs small.The shirt did take some time getting to me, not sure what happened, but seller did get this to me and that is what mattered.Over all it is a good t-shirt just be sure to order a larger size or 2 depending on how you like it to fit.I received this shirt at no charge in exchange for my honest review.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 15, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R238510WHI3LCW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B014K5XHAU#wasThisHelpful","R238510WHI3LCW","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The title of these stating heavy duty fits them well. They are thicker, and stronger then I was expecting. They are a good size and can hold more then just an ID in them and that is great, it makes them much more useful.I have been keeping my S.S card and my daughters S.S cards in a clear sleeve to keep them protected and safe in a lock box since we do not carry them in my wallet. So the first thing I did was put them in one of these. With these sealing as well as they do I know the cards will be well protected now. I have also used them to put my license, credit card and cash in when we are out at concerts and other outdoor events. Having it attached to my neck using a lanyard just feels more secure to me and easier to get to when I need the items in it.

"We use a lot of water bottles in our house. We use them when bike riding, camping hiking or just going to the park. That being said we can never have enough.I like this stainless steel water bottle.

The opening is a but smaller then some I have making it harder for me to clean it out good, but at the same time I like the smaller opening because for me it's easier to drink out of.

"Living in Western PA means lots of snow and lots of frozen slippery ground. I am not a huge fan of boots and wear sneakers even in the winter and of course that means no traction on ice or snow. And now that I have these traction cleats I can still wear my sneakers.When these arrived they were folded in half and seemed small. I thought, no way are they going to fit my size 10 women shoe, but they actually fit great. They are nice and snug on my shoe.To put them on I had to straighten them out and stretch them to get on my shoes. I did have to fight some to get them to fit, but that is good, means they will not just fall off. The cleats have plenty of coverage of the whole shoe. They feel well made.

"These are actually pretty cute.

And per the information on the page for them I will try my best to remember to stick them in the sun monthly.The quality of the fabric on these is pretty good and they actually look nice. I don't mind having one in the hall closet where we put shoes and coats of ours and our guests. People actually ask what they are when they see it and thing they are cool.I do feel they help some with smells in the closet and help keep the cloths we have stored in a foot locker trunk we have.

"I have very dry feet all year long so I am always trying new creams, scrubs, and such to see what will help.Now as far as the ingredient list goes, the scrub is full of natural ingredients and I do love that fact. And it is not tested on animals. I do have to warn that the scent of lemongrass is very strong so if you have a sensitive nose this may not be the scrub for you. It is a easy to use tube all it takes is a simple squeeze and out comes the scrub.As per the directions I soaked my feet first for about 10 minutes to make sure the skin was soft enough to help the scrub do it's job. I then applied a liberal amount of the scrub onto my feet and let that sit for about 10 minutes. I then took a warm wash cloth and rubbed off the excess scrub. I do not have their foot cream so I did not follow up with any lotion afterwards. Yes my feet felt good after the scrub. My skin felt soft and I do believe it helped remove some of the dead skin I had. No it did not remove my calluses but it helped them some. I felt that I would need to use this on a regular basis to have it really make a difference. So far I have remembered to use it about 4 times in the past couple of weeks and the results are the same. My feet are happier then when I didn't use anything, but I feel they would be happier if I remembered to use it more often. Is it better then others? I don't know I haven't used others. Does it help? Yes is seems to help but it is by no means a miracle cure for calluses, or major dry feet. Who knows maybe using a lotion afterwards would help a lot.

" 1:21 MinsI have never tried nail scissors. Mainly because the thought of using them is scary. But I have used regular scissors to cut my nails in the past when I couldn't find clippers. And Yes you can use these on finger nails.These nail scissors are nice. They are long enough to help you reach your toenails with no problems. The handles are large enough to get a sturdy grip, and have a plastic coating to help keep your hands from hurting. The main parts of the scissors are stainless steal. The end has small little teeth to help cut the nail. And they are plenty sharp to cut the nails. Now I do not have really thick nails but I have seen people who have very thick nails that are hard to cut with clippers so this would be the perfect solution.These cut through my nails with such ease, although it did take some getting use to. What is great is after the first cut you are able to cut away at the nail to get a good shape. And since they do make such a clean cut there is no need to file the toenails after cutting them.Once I got over my fair of using them and getting use to them I am very happy to have these for my nail care.Product provided for testing and reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R16Z5550X6FH56/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012PZE9KE#wasThisHelpful","R16Z5550X6FH56","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Over all I am happy with them.Product provided at a discounted price for testing and reviewing purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R163UMTQ1LMR92/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013UK77M0#wasThisHelpful","R163UMTQ1LMR92","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:46 MinsI have two first aid kits at home. One we bought and one we create in a metal box. And my 17 year old daughter will be off to College next year and a first aid kit is a must for her to have while away and for my peace of mind.This first aid kit is perfect. It is light weight and has everything you need for pretty much any situation. I add aspirin, allergy medication and a few other things to it that I prefer to have on hand. And that I know she will eventually need.I like that everything in the kit is individually wrapped and easy to get to. There are two sides to the kit, each side is closed by a Velcro strip making it easy to get to. And it all closes with the zipper. There are two handles for easy carrying. And it is a soft case that makes for easy storing.This is a great kit to keep in the car, home, dorm, and in camping gear. I am very happy to be sending this to school with my daughter next year.Product provided at a discounted price for testing and reviewing purposes.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 5, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1408O3I2XEIMZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016X3OX9Q#wasThisHelpful","R1408O3I2XEIMZ","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:32 MinsThis is the first juicer I have owned and I am in love with it. And it has some weight to it. It's not a flimsy juicer that is for sure.It is nice and solid. Is stainless steel and the handles are silicone covered. The handles are large enough to help get a good grip on them and they do not hurt my hands when using.I am not sure why they say lemon and lime juicer, I used it for an orange and it worked awesome. And this juicer is plenty big to do a grapefruit even. I did not fight at all to squeeze all the juice out. I was actually able to do it one handed. The design, and weight of it make it so easy to use. There were no seeds or pulp in my orange juice either and for me that is a good thing since I hate pulp. And I truly love that juice does not going flying everywhere.Now when I first looked at the juicer I thought, how the heck is this going to work. Normally you would have the lump of the juicer go into the inside of the fruit, or at least that is what I always thought. But that would have not worked since it would have covered the holes and there for preventing the juice from getting through. So once I figured out that I was wrong on how to use it all was good. So what I did was cut the orange in half, placed it face down in the juicer and squeezed. That was it, simple as that. And then I drank my fresh squeezed orange juice.It was easy to clean, I just washed it off with a soapy towel and rinsed. I personally will not put this in the dishwasher.To me this is a must have juicer in my kitchen and now that I have it I plan on juicing things more often.Product provided at a discounted price for testing and reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 4, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R294DIC7XST7UU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B016DXUFIE#wasThisHelpful","R294DIC7XST7UU","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"With a family of 4 who all have electronics of some sort I am always looking for ways to set up charging stations though out the house.I like that this plugs straight into the wall outlet. I set it up in our computer room and have already used all 4 ports with usb plugs for my phone, my tablet, my husbands phone and a extra for one of my kids. The wall outlet I put this on also has a power strip plugged into it and both the plugs fit nicely, but I did have to put this into the bottom plug due to it's bulk. It's not super huge though, it's actually on the smaller side for a 4 port plug. I have not had any issues of over heating of anything. Everything charges as it should with no issues.

" 2:01 MinsI have loved everything I have gotten from Liger. They do make some really good products. So anytime I can test a set of headphones from them I jump at the chance.These Blaze headphones are easy to use and connect to my phone, tablet and computer. They were found and connected with no issues at all. And they reconnect to my device once I turn them on. Now I had knock a star off because this set seems to lose signal more then any others I have tried. I know part of my issues is the house I live in and I did keep that in mind.As for the sound, well I am not a expert in sound, but I think they sound is pretty good. Everything sounds crisp and clear. And even if you have just one side in your ear they sound good. There was no distortion, static or noise of any sort.The set does have the over the ear piece and that is not for everyone. They are not removable either. They did irritate my ears a little bit, mainly because I am not use to having something there. But I do love how great they work at keeping the headphones in place. And I when just siting at my desk I did just leave the over air piece off my ear and just let them kind of hang near my lobes. And they were fine just sitting there. These actually fit my ears really well and stay in place for me. They do come with different size pads for the air buds. The set also come with the usb cord and a small mess zipper bag to keep everything in when not in use.All the controls are on the right ear. On/Off switch is on the side and the volume control buttons are on the top. The controls are easy to get to when wearing them. I like that the controls are there and that there is no control block on the cord. The cord is flat not rounded. Not sure it makes any difference though.

" 1:21 MinsI have never tried nail scissors. Mainly because the thought of using them is scary. But I have used regular scissors to cut my nails in the past when I couldn't find clippers. And Yes you can use these on finger nails.These nail scissors are nice. They are long enough to help you reach your toenails with no problems. The handles are large enough to get a sturdy grip, and have a plastic coating to help keep your hands from hurting. The main parts of the scissors are stainless steal. The end has small little teeth to help cut the nail. And they are plenty sharp to cut the nails. Now I do not have really thick nails but I have seen people who have very thick nails that are hard to cut with clippers so this would be the perfect solution.These cut through my nails with such ease, although it did take some getting use to. What is great is after the first cut you are able to cut away at the nail to get a good shape. And since they do make such a clean cut there is no need to file the toenails after cutting them.Once I got over my fair of using them and getting use to them I am very happy to have these for my nail care.Product provided for testing and reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R270O3VCMBXYC9/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00LPQUWPG#wasThisHelpful","R270O3VCMBXYC9","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
" 2:38 MinsThorFire makes such great products and I am a huge fan of them. I love this LED headlamp. I already have a couple headlamps but they use special batteries. And they are great but I wanted something that had normal everyday batteries so that they are easy to replace if needed. I actually use rechargeable batteries most of the times so I am not wasting batteries. That being said, this headlamp uses 3 AAA so it doesn't add a whole lot of weight to the headband. The battery compartment is at the back of the head and is not any bulkier then some of the special rechargeable batteries.The straps are very flexible and wrap around your head and there is also one that goes across the top of your head. Both straps are adjustable as well.The light has 3 settings, high, med and strobe. The on/off button is on top of the light and is easy to get to and press. On the right side of the light is the on/off button for the sensor/motion light. Now this feature is pretty cool. When it is on it will turn off if there is no movement and to get it back on again all you have to do is move or wave your hand in front of the light.This headlamp comes in handy for when camping. Instead of carrying a flashlight I am hands for to do what I need to be doing in the dark. I am very pleased with this headlamp.Product provided at a discounted price for testing and reviewing purposes.","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R33U4AOGAYBIGC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B015QR2I56#wasThisHelpful","R33U4AOGAYBIGC","A3U3OU135L6FOA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3U3OU135L6FOA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"After seeing these books pop up in my Goodreads friends notifications for a while, I decided to finally take the Lux series for a spin.  I was forewarned that this series was very similar to Twilight, so I was a little apprehensive since I didn't really think much of that one (no offense to Twihards),  but I enjoyed this quite a bit more.  Sure, you've got a teen moving to a small town who just so happens to run into a group of students in her new school who possess an otherworldly beauty and mystique, and then she's in grave danger and the hottest one of all happens to save her with superhuman abilities, but that's where the similarities ended for me.I actually enjoy Daemon and Katy as our hero and heroine though  I honestly didn't feel like too much happened in this book. I think we were settling into the world and the characters.  I find it very amusing that Katy's a book reviewer and blogger.  The jokes surrounding her hobby are very funny, probably because it makes her completely relatable as a book reviewer/blogger myself.  It makes me wonder if the author dabbles in it.  Since she writes so much I'd wonder where she finds the time!Daemon is arrogant and often irritating, but he can be pretty funny too.  Though he and his sister have suffered loss, a loss of personality isn't one of them and I genuinely enjoy his development with Katy. They have great chemistry and this series seems like it's got potential to be somewhat racy for a YA novel.I enjoyed the read, but it wasn't perfect.  It didn't feel slow per se, but it had a bit more of a contemporary feel at times and I occasionally found myself wanting the book to amp up the paranormal. As someone who typically prefer adult novels to YA, this has proved to be a happy middle ground for me and I look forward to reading the rest.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3EMU87P84IEFA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00850ZM28#wasThisHelpful","R3EMU87P84IEFA","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I held off on reading this series for a long time.  I actually started it some time ago then stopped and then decided to resume it closer to the movie's release.  Ultimately I ended up watching the movie before finishing the book. There were times that the book read like fanfiction to me (and then I learned that's because it actually was), but I've certainly read worse.  While I thought the movie was pretty rushed, the book had the opposite effect for me and felt overly long, but that could be because I didn't find the melodrama particularly interesting between the main three, especially Simon's assured-to-be-unrequited feelings for Clary.Jace.  Jace. Jace.  Well at least he has a personality?  He comes off as pretty juvenile for me at times and I didn't always find it funny, so for me he wasn't as swoon-worthy as I'm sure he is for millions of others.  The chemistry with Clary is pretty good until the twist that made my eyes roll.  After that I was pretty sure I wouldn't be interested in seeing it play out for multiple books throughout the series.I enjoyed the magic, mythology and lore here, but it honestly wasn't something that I can't get anywhere else and better, so while I don't think I'll completely drop the series, I'm also in no rush to continue it anytime soon.  I'm much more likely to read the The Infernal Devices Trilogy instead because there are only 3 of those and they're complete.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTOPOE8D85ZRI/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0013TXA5Y#wasThisHelpful","RTOPOE8D85ZRI","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a great short novella if you're in-between reads.  Though the page count isn't particularly large, there's a lot of character development and story there that didn't feel any more rushed than a 350-400 page PNR novel.  It wasn't overly angsty either which was a relief and I found myself laughing quite a bit.  I enjoyed the charm and the wit and was ultimately impressed with Molly Harper's writing. This was my first time reading anything by this author and it won't be the last. The Half Moon Hollow novels appear to be standalones in typical PNR fashion, but I'm definitely a fan of her alternating between novellas and full novels. I like having the option of a fun, quick and satisfying read without investing a lot of time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 17, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R94CE7W65Y5K/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0064CLU0C#wasThisHelpful","R94CE7W65Y5K","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Oh boy, what a ride! While this book wasn't as quotable with the usual hilarious quips that make me love this series so much, it is definitely one of my favorite books of the series, if not my favorite.  I usually love books when the characters go on road trips or end up out of their usual element.  It usually gives a series a fresh perspective, revealing new aspects about my favorite characters and ultimately showing what they are made of when the going gets tough.  Ilona Andrews really brought their A-game from start to finish.  Kate and Curran, how can you not love them?  As solid as they are, or at least as solid as we assume they are, their relationship and feelings for one another are put to the ultimate test.I must say that bringing just about every essential character along for the quest set off my alarm bells early that nothing was going to be the same from here on out.  I feared that not everybody would make it back or make it back in one piece.  And they do take a hell of a beating in that department I'm sad to say.  But I believe everything that happened happened for the sake of pushing the story forward to the best conclusion possible.There were definitely frustrating moments making me feel for both characters as individuals as well.  I will always be a Kate and Curran girl, but I thought they handled the chemistry between Kate and Hugh D'Ambry (her father's right hand) surprisingly well.  I was genuinely looking forward to their scenes together and the outcomes weren't always predictable.  I was really engrossed in the back story involving Kate's heritage and felt satisfied with what was revealed. It felt integral to the story and to what we can expect of the series here on out.  So often I run into series where the overarching plot is merely peppered throughout the book instead of being the meat of it, making it very obvious that the author plans to drag the story out as much as possible.  I am so happy that wasn't the case here, though I honestly haven't read a disappointing Kate Daniels book.If we thought things were complicated before, this book proved to me that we haven't seen anything yet. I heard the series was going to end at 7, but then they decided to extend it to 10.  At this point I think 10 books is definitely the sweet spot.If you want a true page turner, this is one of the best you are going to find this year, guaranteed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RDIWEW2FWQMDF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009RYKYM4#wasThisHelpful","RDIWEW2FWQMDF","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"All in all I thought the story was original and unique enough to stick out in my mind which is definitely a good thing considering the tons of books I read throughout the year.  I see a lot of potential with the story, the world, and character development, especially in future novels. The beginning draws you in quite effectively.  I do think the novel could use an additional round of editing to cut down on repetition and improve the flow of the story.  It distracted me from the experience at times, but with tighter writing in the sequels (or even a revised version of this story) I could see it  being a true standout.  I also think a catchier titles could help draw more attention.","3.0 out of 5 stars","October 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2A5IQEYZTBQ6S/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BK9NILI#wasThisHelpful","R2A5IQEYZTBQ6S","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More like 3.5 stars.  This was my first time delving into the Love at Stake novels, or at least I think so.  What drew me to this book was mainly the title. I thought it'd be a parody of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo novel.  There was humor here and there, but this is first and foremost a paranormal romance, so the romance and drama take precedence.  I may have read a short story from this series before because one aspect sounded familiar to me; it was the VANNA angle in particular though I can't recall where I could have read it.  VANNA is a life-size synthetic device designed to look like a human woman. There's blood stored inside it to help curb a vampire's desire to attack real living people.  That provided a healthy dose of comic relief in this book.  Though the story appears to be a standalone, there is an overarching plot that I feel has been developing since the earlier books. But even still I never felt lost.The relationship between Dougal and Leah was decent but I didn't connect to it very much. Both were a little too down on themselves most of the time.  I also think the timing was wrong for me because I read this on the heels of another book where reincarnation was at the heart of the relationship.  I wasn't disappointed with the book, so I imagine fans of the series who have read it from the beginning should enjoy it. Though I doubt I will read all the earlier 13 novels, I might look into reading one of its stronger prequels to get a better feel for Kerrelyn Sparks's writing at its best.*ARC Provided by Publisher","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R11I6XVBYX7XLN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00BEFQZ18#wasThisHelpful","R11I6XVBYX7XLN","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I was sitting on this book for quite a while but I was glad to finally read it.  All in all the writing and characterization were top-notch.  It's not very often when I can connect with a heroine but I really enjoyed reading this from Karou's point of view.  Though I enjoyed her interactions with Akiva as well, I think I the first half of the book was more entertaining for me than the latter half.  The latter half takes on a darker and more serious tone and the series will never be the same from that point on.My biggest gripe is the cliffhanger.  While it doesn't totally ruin a series for me I found this one particularly frustrating.  I want to read the next one, but I am considering waiting until the series finishes or at least until a few more books are available. The twists and turns, while not completely surprising, were still shocking.  When it comes cliffhangers, I was very happy to have read the Fever books by Karen Marie Moning after they were all released (before she decided to continue them anyway).  I don't know how fans who read those novels in real-time stayed sane. And I feel like the Daughter of Smoke & Bone series could be of that variety.  The writing and intrigue are just that good, especially for a young adult novel.  Who knows, when book 3 is out I might give book 2 a go.  But for now I'm debating if it's worth it to continue right away.","4.0 out of 5 stars","October 13, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R31T6GLXJHAS4U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004QX076Y#wasThisHelpful","R31T6GLXJHAS4U","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Dark Mind is a well-done debut effort by Matthew Goldstein.  Though only a high school student, Cole's left with a huge responsibility that most adults couldn't manage.  He can prevent tragedy, but it's a constant game of chess to determine if the decision is the right one. If he can prevent a tragedy, it comes at a price elsewhere, namely to those he loves.  This give and take leaves him conflicted and leaves the reader wondering what he will choose, and the outcome is not predictable.All in all I enjoyed the novel.  It looks to be the start of a new series, so I would like for future novels to elaborate further on the paranormal aspects of the story.  Some sections felt a little too contemporary.  The cover is really cool.  I like that the style is a departure from your usual photoshopped covers with models or flashy text that comprise most of the covers this genre.  I'm definitely looking forward to a sequel.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 29, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXM8IVWH4W710/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00DE22FSG#wasThisHelpful","RXM8IVWH4W710","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"As a follow-up to Gilded Destiny, which I enjoyed quite a bit, I must say that Jaded Touch was also well done.  I feel like the Vesper species is a pretty unique addition to the world of urban fantasy.  My favorite part of this novel would be the origins and development of their race.  Though it's a short read, a borderline novella, it offers very solid world-building and it pulls me in as effectively as any full length novel, leaving me wanting to know what comes next.  The politics and dynamics between male and female Vespers adds just the right amount of tension while still keeping things unpredictable.  I still have questions, but I feel as if more layers will be peeled back in the next installment.The relationship of Jack and Three has me on the fence.  Though the dynamic didn't always work for me, they have a lot of chemistry.  As their own characters I liked them quite a bit though.  Scarred and tormented, Three has to march by the beat of her own drum due to her origins, so she's constantly getting into trouble. But deep down she is a genuine person and she's easy to root for.Considering how the first book ended I actually was expecting this novel to be a continuation of that one.  And considering how this one ended, there are even more possibilities for the next novel.  I won't be giving away spoilers here but I certainly wouldn't mind a revisit to what could happen between either of those potential storylines.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RKV1VQRI3VIQM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00ECFGL8E#wasThisHelpful","RKV1VQRI3VIQM","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Quin Lennox found herself lucky last time, managing to escape the alternate world of Vamp City.  But that world isn't quite done with her.  They need her powers to restore the magic of their world and free the vampires currently bound there. Vampire Arturo Mazza is sent to bring her back, and Quinn has learned her lesson than to trust him again after his betrayal.  However this time Vamp City has some leverage, her brother.  She has to return to save him, and Arturo's all she's got.  Has he learned the error of his ways? Or is she setting herself up for disappointment once again.The first book was one of my favorite reads last year, so the sooner I could get my hands one, the better. Palmer's morbid imagination really makes this series a standout to me, though I think certain dynamics of the first book didn't sit well with everyone.  For this novel I think it has more mass appeal, but I had a gripe or two.  I guess the pace of the book was a bit of a problem for me.  They spend quite a bit of time talking about the final adversary and yet we don't even see that stand-off in this book.  Cliffhanger enthusiasts should love it, but I can't say the same for those of you who don't.  I just wish it would have wrapped up the novel in a more serial fashion because towards the end I was anticipating a conflict I didn't get. The book just kind of ended and that was that.I do like her efforts to redeem Arturo.  I mean, sometimes the graphic and horrific things he endured got a little hard to stomach, but he had a lot of ground to make up and I think he did that.  Tish was okay. I never really had a problem with her, though her over protectiveness of her brother, while noble, got a little annoying after a while.  The chemistry between Tish and Arturo was s still immensely strong which certainly adds to their appeal.I liked the history and backstory about the vampires and other supernaturals that live in Washington, VC, learning of their gradual deterioration into what they have become and why.  It was thought-provoking and I was often conflicted about the best course of action to fix everything.At this point I am sort of wondering if Palmer plans to make this a trilogy or if it's an ongoing series.  If it's a trilogy it certainly feels like a middle book.  I feel as if all the issues presented can certainly be resolved in one more.*ARC provided by the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RHAVFIXR86B0U/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062107534#wasThisHelpful","RHAVFIXR86B0U","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I'll start off by saying that the cover is gorgeous and I think this was a pretty good start for this series. Wicked as They Come (The Blud Series) by Delilah Dawson truly turned me onto the steampunk vampire genre so I'm always eager to read more. I think the writing was well done and it captured the steampunk/period style perfectly.  I think the plot was well-paced and the relationship between Honoria and Blade developed nicely. They both have tremendous responsibilities and hardships, so it's easy to sympathize with them in their own ways.One gripe for me was the choice of name ""Blade"" for the leading man.  I constantly found myself thinking about another vampire (or dhampire rather) anti-hero made famous for Marvel comics and Wesley Snipes.Though the book was good, I'm not sure if I want to continue right away based on my personal tastes.  I'm just not sure if I like the brand of vampire that she has to offer.  As overdone as it may be, I will always prefer that they have fangs.  I understand that authors want to make their creatures unique and she accomplishes this to an extent, but I still have my preferences.I think the story will been enjoyable for many of you.  Though it will be like usual paranormal romances and focus on one couple per book,  I don't believe Honoria and Blade are finished with their contribution to the series.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 25, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SVHIVL72BE5D/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1402270275#wasThisHelpful","R1SVHIVL72BE5D","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I read the first three books back to back and then took a break.  It was a good break because returning to this one unveiled a whole new level of drama! Based on the synopsis, get prepared for a huge dose of awkwardness. We can finally put a face to the name for Dex's girlfriend, and it was great seeing the layers gradually peel back on their relationship as the book progressed. It felt more real that way.  While I enjoyed the book,  a few revelations were pretty predictable, but I was glad to see them resolved.Dex and Perry both experience a bit of growth in this one, even though the novel ends on a cliffhanger.  This series is considered horror, but character development is at the forefront this time around. Thankfully each book provides enough revelations to keep me coming back.  Often times when a book tries to do too much (ie: spending more focus on the book's mystery rather than the overarching plot), I find it lacking.  Even though character relationships are probably the most important aspect, I prefer when it ties into the series storyline,  and I don't want the revelations to feel like breadcrumbs.  Some ongoing series have a habit of doing that to the point of where I give up because there's too much filler and not enough meat.I really enjoyed the introduction of rival ghost hunters.  They were such tools. I kind of wish more happened there, but I also think we haven't seen the last of them.  I do like this series for the horror and I found this book very enjoyable.  I honestly wasn't bored for a second and I found myself laughing a bit too. Karina Halle does a great job with humor. I just wish there was more horror like Dead Morning Sky (book 3) where things were even scarier for me when some real life creepy things were happening while I was reading it.This book is an absolute must read if you're a fan of the series because things are never going to be the same from here on out. Halle has made it clear that she is not going to take the easy road for Dex and Perry, but that makes things all the more interesting.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RWHOLN99SH8KU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=146794825X#wasThisHelpful","RWHOLN99SH8KU","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Talk about an imagination!  I wasn't totally sure of what to expect going into this one.  I wasn't sure which book to choose for my monthly kindle prime freebie and time was running out.  It was a debut, and it was originally a Kindle serial series.  But all in all it turned out wonderfully.Though I've read other novels with a circus theme, this one certainly comes off as unique. Mab is a really cool leader.  There are a lot of questions but the story pulls you in so that you really want to read along to get them answered.  She can be generous but she absolutely has an agenda, so it keeps things interesting.I really enjoyed the evolving family dynamic.  Romance fans who prefer the slow build should appreciate this one, though it's not agonizingly slow progress either.  We are just scraping the surface for what the future will bring.I think A. R. Kahler keeping his name ambiguous was a good thing. I know that some people prefer female authors in this genre, especially when it's written in a female's perspective.  But A.R. handles it well and makes all gender appealing, especially the potential love interest.  Upon reading his bio I learned that he actually was a part of a circus troupe.  That's about the only way to explain why this book felt so authentic and legit (as far as the paranormal goes of course).The next one is due out soon and I'm getting it, Prime or no Prime! It's currently at $3.99 on the Kindle, but the pre-order for book 2 is $1.99.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JF8ALEDASLM/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1611099447#wasThisHelpful","R3JF8ALEDASLM","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"More like 3.5 stars. I'd read the sequel.The premise starts out interesting enough. I  just would have liked more of an actual story as opposed to the large amount of sex. Basically, this would have worked better for me as an urban fantasy than a paranormal romance.  I don't mind British or other non-American authors, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that the constant references to her ""knickers"" got annoying after a while. Blame it on my American ignorance (even though we use that term occasionally), but it just doesn't sound sexy.  Granted, neither do the words ""panties"" or ""drawers"" or ""bloomers"".  The point is that it was overused, though with how often those two went at it I wondered why she even wore them at all.In general I wasn't a huge fan of the dynamic either. I like for the heroines to have a bit more control and it was pretty clear that he was in the driver's seat.  Later in the book they develop the actual storyline a bit more, though it may be too little too late for some. I like the magic and the creatures, so I might keep up with this one for a book or two just to feel it out and see if this series is for me.  Like most serial PNR novels the next book focuses on another couple, but apparently the overarching storyline continues.Though it wasn't a personal fave of mine this year, I do see its appeal so I can recommend giving it a try.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3O0914V3O5FRF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1909490016#wasThisHelpful","R3O0914V3O5FRF","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I don't totally love these books but I like them enough to continue.  They are fun to read here and there between other books.  This one wasn't my favorite.  After four books in, I was hoping to be a bit more invested in the storyline and characters.  Cain is featured in this one.  He's an infamous throughout the course of fictional and biblical history, so it's a tall order to create a memorable version of him.  A number of authors do a fine job of taking old characters and making them their own (ie. Karen Chance with Mircea, Jeaniene Frost with Vlad ).  I didn't feel like this book accomplished that very well.  The characterization in general was sort of flat for not only him, but for Martha as well.  The constant comparisons to her dead husband didn't really enhance the story or character development.I am glad that this series goes the typical PNR route and focuses on a different hero and heroine because I wouldn't see myself continuing if it was focused just those two.  I have become somewhat invested in the world and the potential future of The Fallen and what appears to be the ultimate villain. The battles and politics actually keep me more interest than I though I'd be.  And I like the occasional focus on the stars of the prior books. I'll certain continue if only to see what happens on that front. I like that these books don't take the instalove route as well even though they do eventually end up together.  The author does a good job of making them take a pretty hard road so that you care a little bit more as a reader.  I just worry about her stretching things out so that it becomes long in the tooth.If you follow this series, I definitely don't recommend skipping this one. It has a lot going on.","3.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2BM7DFEM298N1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1451655924#wasThisHelpful","R2BM7DFEM298N1","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Calli, a tattoo artist, lost her memory some time ago believing she was in a terrible car accident that left her scarred.  The memories start to return when Nycholas, a predatory, serpentine Vesper comes into her life to save her from a dangerous situation.  As it turns out, this stranger may not be a stranger at all and as things heat up between them, his brutal master is honing in with plans that put Nycholas, Calli, and her family at risk.I wasn't totally sure what to expect when I took a chance on this one, but it surely exceeded my expectations.  Novellas tend to be more miss than hit for me when it comes to a brand new story and new characters, but Sarina did an excellent job with the world building, character development, and the suspense. I've seen less in full novels which really speaks to her talents and skills.  The Vespers, while attractive, can also be super creepy.  I found their species quite refreshing in the urban fantasy genre.  They really stand out to me in times when vampires and other supernaturals have become a dime a dozen.The story is not for the faint of heart, but if you like series that are on the darker side, then I definitely recommend giving this one a try.  Considering how the novella ended, I am assuming this is the start of a whole new series. If it is, I can't wait to read it in its full on glory.*ARC provided by the author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 18, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R24SNLYKWIPAEU/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1484197410#wasThisHelpful","R24SNLYKWIPAEU","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Unlikely best friends, Sophie and Agatha, test their level of friendship as they are whisked away to the School for Good and Evil, where failing your fairy tale is not an option.  Sophie, the embodiment of all things good, finds herself dumped in the School of Evil while Agatha, the dark and broody, is placed in the School for Good.  Clearly there's been a mistake, right?  But when the going gets tough, their journey exposes who they really are and all may not be what it seems.I could say this was one of my top 3 reads of the year thus far.  Though the story is categorized as middle grade, I thought it touched on a few mature themes here and there and could have been placed into the Young Adult category.  It's certainly impressive when that group is reading 500-page novels.  Though lengthy it's at least an easy read, which is to be expected, but it's still very engaging and well-written for the most part.  I think the youth and adults alike will thoroughly enjoy it.I loved how it took the lore and stereotypes of past fairy tales and pretty much turned everything on its head.  The book even includes some great underlying messages, so it's clear that the author did quite a bit of homework.  There is a lot of character development for both girls, and I appreciated the gradual process.  The POVs switched between the two throughout the novel.  I think I preferred Agatha's POV and thought process, but Sophie's POV served its purpose as well.I wasn't crazy about the ending.  That was probably the one area where I believe it deviated from the formula and not in a satisfying way (for me at least), but the rest of the book is very strong.Though I've only seen an episode of the show Once Upon a Time (I'll get around to more eventually), I feel like this type of book would appeal to those fans.  I highly recommend this entertaining and fresh take on what it means to be a fairy tale.  What most surprised me was how this appears to be Soman Chainani's debut novel.  This might be the beginnings of a new series, but the work as a whole could be a standalone.  If this is a sign of things to come, I will certainly make sure I follow this author's future works!*ARC Provided by the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 14, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D995EL6LEL5F/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062104896#wasThisHelpful","R2D995EL6LEL5F","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I enjoyed the first Night Prince novel immensely. As I've said before, Vlad is easily my favorite character of the franchise, so I'm super happy that he gets three books.  He's a very frustrating character at times with  arrogance that knows no bounds, but Frost knows how to make the payoff worth it.  I found the glimpse into his ruthless nature and past to be a highlight of the story, though I feel as if we're still only scratching the surface.  Leila was pretty cool in this book.  I like that she's a capable heroine, though clearly her humanity hinders her abilities and that's a major focus of the novel.  I wish the villains were fleshed out a little more, but it looks like book 3 will round that all out.  I'm looking forward to it.  There's an excerpt of the next Cat & Bones book as well.  I do hope we see more of Vlad and Leila in that installment. I don't believe we saw him at all in the prior Cat and Bones novel and he was sorely missed.I think it goes without saying that this is a definite recommend for fans of the series.*Review copy provided by the publisher.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R372GTXYYWLNTO/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0062076108#wasThisHelpful","R372GTXYYWLNTO","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Mercy's adjusting to  lot of changes theses days; she's now Mrs. Hauptman, wife and mate to alpha werewolf, Adam, and stepmom to his daughter, Jesse.  This level of normalcy is refreshing compared to the usual whirlwind of her life.  But of course things can't remain peaceful forever.  While taking advantage of Black Friday, Mercy and Jesse are in a car accident and find that they can't reach Adam or anyone else in the pack. And it's not a coincidence.The pack has been abducted and may be in serious danger.  It's a delicate time for the werewolf race as they work to gain public acceptance.  Without her pack to turn to, Mercy will reach out to every ally possible to save them, including some new and unexpected faces.This was a really great read! I breezed through it in no time. I really missed Mercy and the gang. Maybe that's a sign that this series is inching its way into my favorites group. And that's a pretty exclusive club!  But after this book it's earned it. Adam is a true badass here, even tied to a chair!  I don't quote Paris Hilton often, but that ""that's hott."" Seriously, he's to die for here, especially since we get TWO chapters from his point of view!His relationship with Mercy really is refreshing.  Though they have some drama and angst, they are secure in their relationship and don't bother with mind games.  That's become an oddity with a number of series, even some of my favorites.The story combines events that occur in Patricia Brigg's Alpha & Omega series.  It definitely helps if you've read the A&O series. I haven't yet, but I was able to keep up with no trouble.  Though at first I wasn't really planning to read the series, but after Frost Burned I think I'll go ahead and add A&O to my TBR pile, though I likely won't get to them until next year, maybe around the time when Mercy 8 will be released.  Thankfully that won't be two years.This is one of my favorite Mercy novels, but I would have liked more Bran and Stefan (who I think deserves a spin-off of his own).  The book wasn't too short or long, but maybe if it were a little longer they could have had a little more presence.  I hope we'll see a good bit of them next time.

While perpetually nighttime, it'd be easy to assume that she's been taken to Alaska during that time of year; but it turns out it's an uncharted location where vampires rule.  She soon learns that she's been abducted into slavery at the mercy of vampires that can be as cruel as they are beautiful.She may have a chance to fare better than most, as her master is the dark royal Prince himself, Derek Novak.  Though blood thirsty due to a 400 year stasis he may be her best chance at survival, meaning she'll do everything in her power to remain on his good side.  However, his more sinister Novak siblings may have other plans...I've been on somewhat of a YA kick lately, so this was a satisfying read for the time.  The writing and world-building were very good for a debut.  The characterization was adequate in that I found myself becoming invested in the cast. I liked who I was supposed to late and hated who I was supposed to hate.  I think Sofia makes a few silly choices, but that's pretty much the status quo for 99% of heroines out there.  Derek is a pretty good leading man, though I would like to see him more unhinged.  It would make him a little more interesting considering his age, though he looks eternally youthful.I enjoyed the premise but I read it almost directly after another novel with a similar idea, though this novel was published first. I plan to follow both, but I definitely want to stagger them so that I don't mix up plots.  Though only a novella, Bella Forest makes it count with a tight and suspenseful story.  I look forward to more, hopefully a full length novel at some point.*ARC provided by the author.","3.0 out of 5 stars","March 10, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/RD84XXC9Q45F3/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00AOHDMFE#wasThisHelpful","RD84XXC9Q45F3","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=7&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Overall the book was just an okay read for me. There were things I liked about it and things I didn't and so I guess 3 is a good average. It starts out fairly interesting, but then it drags quite a bit and I found myself speed reading as opposed to savoring the pages. I really am not interested in details about the shampoo she uses, and things of that nature which just filled the pages. The story picks up with a bit of force towards the middle but then there were still some slow parts.The writing felt more young-adult in quality, and it always weirds me out to combine that writing level with descriptive sex scenes.I wasn't a fan of the ending at all. It was completely rushed and I found myself really irritated. I was surprised by the twist but then predicted practically everything down to the letter that followed. Considering the ""surprise"" ending I kind of wonder if I could reread it and see his POV with new eyes, but I didn't like it that much to give it another go.To be honest I thought I could relate a little more to Camryn than I did. This summer was rough for me when my ex (who I was still very good friends with) died suddenly and then learned my grandmother was battling cancer for a second time (after 10 years of remission). But I never really felt a connection to the character. Not saying that it's a requirement for every book I read, but I thought it'd be inevitable here.Maybe I'm just not that moved by fictional characters. Usually nonfiction is what does me in, and in movie form. I'm not unfeeling. I cried during Stepmom (that was more realistic than this though) and Pursuit of Happyness (though that actually is based off nonfiction). I just didn't find myself all that emotionally invested here. But that's just me. *shrugs*It's a good book and I don't regret reading it. It only took two days (faster than average for me) and I did want to finish it. But it's not a read I'm personally reeling from and see myself thinking about a lot down the road.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODFAZLEZ5ZW7/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A7EPCY8#wasThisHelpful","R1ODFAZLEZ5ZW7","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I.S. cops Ivy Tamwood and Rachel Morgan were having a pretty good week, working their beat, busting brimstone street dealers left and right. That is until they realize someone may be gunning for them directly. That'll put a damper on anyone's week.  Fortunately dodging risky attempts on their lives, it's up to Ivy to figure out whose targeting them and why. Could it be Piscary? Does he want to eliminate Rachel to get Ivy back in his clutches faster? Or could it be a new big bad with something else in mind entirely?My favorite format of The Hollows will forever be in written novel form, but I'll take it any way I can get it.  Ivy fans will enjoy this book as much as the last, Blood Work. It's told from her POV even though Rachel maintains a consistent presence.  It's not a requirement, but it will help to have read the short story told from Ivy's POV, Undead in the Garden of Good and Evil, because certain characters and events become relevant again.Considering that this is a graphic novel, I'll start with the graphic part.  The cover is actually a bit disappointing.  The cover of Blood Work was one of my favorite parts about the novel. The colors and badassness really made it pop. This one? Not so much. It's dark and vaguely mysterious, but it's not interesting. I feel like the model should be wearing a more sinister expression.It's no secret that I'm not particularly fond of the artwork. Even though there's a new illustrator, they implemented the original artwork so the overall style is unchanged.  After reading this one, I'm still not a fan but it is definitely improved over the first one in a few areas. For one, the coloring is more professional. It's more vibrant and saturated, giving it an all around better look.  Interestingly enough, I think Ivy looks better in this one than in Blood Work. But on the other hand, I thought Rachel looked prettier in Blood Work than she does here.  Piscary looked pretty spot on to how I envisioned him in my head, and a new character, Celeste, actually had a pretty cool design.  The artist definitely does better work with her own original creations.The story itself was pretty good, if a bit short. It's natural to feel that way when a usual Hollows entry is over 400 pages. Though I'm pleased with the direction the later books have taken, I do miss the old I.S. runner days when they had to solve mysteries and tag bad guys.  This book brings a little bit of that back.  I liked how it continued the plot lines from Ivy's short story because it expands the vampire world just a bit more when it comes to their politics, connections, and the domino effect that comes with certain actions. There's a lot of inner turmoil with Ivy, fighting her attraction to Rachel, fighting her vampiric nature, fighting Piscary's mind games. That's pretty much all the poor girl does! Not to mention actually physically fighting the bad guys. Piscary was pretty scary at times, especially when pulling auras.  He's certainly one you love to hate.  Kisten's role is even smaller here than in Blood Work, but we do see enough to know how strong of a bond he and Ivy shared.  Rachel wasn't quite as funny as she was in the first novel, but she still felt like Rachel, kicking butt, taking names.  And seeing her cherry red splat gun in action again was pretty cool too.All in all, I don't think these are the best that The Hollows has to offer, but it is worth a read and fans will appreciate the story.*Review copy provided by the publisher","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R93O9YIO6GPOS/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0345521021#wasThisHelpful","R93O9YIO6GPOS","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The Quiet King.  The blind and deaf ruler of vampires seemingly should be disadvantaged, harmless even.  But that's not quite the case here.  With a harem of human dominas acquired for the sole purpose of bearing his vampire children, he maintains an upper hand.  Brie, a domina for two years, is nearing her turn to begin procreating with the King. Unfortunately, his policy to slaughter babies who could challenge him is a pretty big turn off. Her only hope to escape lies with Samuel, a vampire known for leading slaves to freedom.Slaves are one thing; dominas are another, and they happen to be the one exception for Samuel as it's too risky, and not just the from the ramifications of the palace.  Brie lies about her identity, but her blood doesn't and the closer she gets to freedom, the closer she gets to Samuel as her blood becomes increasingly irresistible.For 127 pages, I was very enthralled. Usually it's hard to get into a novellas for me, especially for a new and unestablished series, but the world-building and characters were well done.  Brie's inner conflict as she fights the temptation of Samuel while trying to remain faithful to her husband and children to whom she desperately wants to return kept things pretty interesting.  I finished actually wishing this could have been a full length novel. I was definitely left wanting more.  There is a lot of romantic tension, but plenty of action as well, often times pretty gruesome.  There's certainly more to the story that can be told and I, for one, hope it is.  The Quiet King has potential to be a very good villain and we're only scratching the surface.There are illustrations provided sporadically which were a nice touch, though I think they could be colored and placed all together in a certain sections of the book.

But in the vain of ""I Am Legend,""  the cure to one (or two in this case) leads to an even worse pandemic that will change the course of humanity as we know it.  Fast forward two decades and we see a new world where the infected roam, humans, while maintaining some sense of civilization, are as paranoid and as ever, and the country looks towards leadership to continue the fight to restore the ""land of the free and home of the brave"" to its former zombie-less glory.  But with power comes corruption, and the brother sister blogging team of Shaun and Georgia Mason are determined to expose this corruption in order to deliver the truth to the people, no matter the cost.This book was certainly one of the more unique takes on the genre that I've seen.  It gets very technical and scientific, but it also gets very political.  The thing is, if the second book is more of the same with practically 20 pages of zombie action among 550+ pages of just about everything else, I think I might pass on continuing down this road. In fact, I'm probably more likely to just read The Road.  I didn't see the need for 571 pages here and the next books are even longer.  I interrupted my progress more than once by reading other novels because this just wasn't keeping my interest as much as I would have hoped.  Since this is a favorite of many, I tried my best to muddle through it.  In the end, I need more tension and action in these kinds of stories.  Politics is fine and dandy, but I would have liked to have seen a better balance with actual zombie screen time.  The plot kind of shambled along, like the zombies this book is supposed to be about.  It became annoyingly repetitive at times, from the countless blood screenings to countless references to Georgia's eye condition.It did offer an extensive amount of world building that made scientific and technological references believable in the scope of the story.  It was occasionally thought-provoking and there were a few moments that had potential to get me hooked, but ultimately it never really took off.  However, the last 15% was boldy executed and if that intensity was maintained for a larger portion of the novel, I would read the rest of the series without a doubt. In fact, it gained one extra star for that alone.In the end, I wasn't scared, the zombies were more like a backdrop to drive the plot (so much so that they could have been arguably interchangeable with some other pandemic, but I doubt this book would have sold as well), and I was mildly intrigued at best for the majority of the book. If I continue it won't be anytime soon. I'm certainly in no rush.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 3, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T12MRZ45K3XW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0316081051#wasThisHelpful","R1T12MRZ45K3XW","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"3.5 stars may be a little harsh, but I had to rate it relative to how much I enjoyed the other novels and short stories of this series.Don't pick up these novels if you can't handle heavy and dark themes--often to the extreme. Some scenes are certainly not for the faint of heart, but if you've read the first two then you know what you're getting yourself into.Having practically inhaled this series reading everything back to back, this book definitely had a different feel to it than its predecessors. There was a lot of drama and angst that sort of came out of nowhere, particularly on Kingsley's part. Not saying he has to be ""on"" all of the time but I enjoyed his playfulness, confidence and allure in prior books (especially in his short story Submit to Desire), yet it was hardly anywhere to be found here as he spends the majority of this book being lovelorn and bitter. Though it wasn't unfounded, I just didn't enjoy it as much.I wasn't too surprised regarding Soren and Kingsley's past, but I wasn't expecting a third of the book to focus on it, and after a while the flashbacks felt a bit superfluous at times.I do root for Nora and Wesley to find happiness with each other, but in this book it felt a little drawn out. By the 60% point I felt like the bulk of what needed to be told was told. It picked up somewhat towards the end, but it made the read feel more disjointed to me because there was such a slow build to that point.There's a cliffhanger which will probably anger some readers. Usually I don't like them, but I honestly felt apathetic because I predicted the twist and knew that there wouldn't be enough page time to resolve it. It was a little too over-the-top and melodramatic for me.Overall I do enjoy Tiffany Reisz's writing. It's very cultured, thought-provoking, and it invokes a sense of horror which might add to the appeal since erotica is usually not my genre of choice. It still isn't' outside of this series. While there are some pretty graphic and explicit scenes, the series as a whole transcends that. I will keep reading due to the quality writing more so than the subject matter. I just wonder what Reisz could possibly have in store for us with the 4th book as this one could have served as a fine conclusion to the series with a few adjustments.*ARC provided by NetGalley","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 29, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKU38Q9S5VBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0092MLCNQ#wasThisHelpful","R3VKU38Q9S5VBN","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This is a novella from the Blud series. As a follow-up to Delilah Dawson's debut novel Wicked as They Come, to hold us over until the next book we get to revisit her alternative London and Criminy Stain's caravan. Instead of Criminy and Leticia (Tish) getting focus, we meet Madam Morpho, a new addition to the caravan with a unique ability to re-animate butterflies, and we meet Mr. Murdoch, the mysterious engineer behind the caravan's clockworks and staging. Morpho is running from her past, but is she valuable enough for the caravan and Mr. Murdoch to run with her?I love this series for a combination of reasons, from the quirky steampunk London makeover to the blud bunnies to enigmatic Criminy himself. The first two are there in spades which is great, but I've unfortunately caught a case of Criminy fever and found myself missing his presence immensely this time around, Tish as well. The world building remains impressive, with enough imagination to satisfy any urban fantasy/paranormal/steampunk fan, but the romance itself came up a bit short for me. Insta-love stories never really do it for me, namely because I just can't suspend my belief enough to completely buy it, and that's what we see here. Granted, Ms. Dawson is only working with 100 or so pages so she has to move quickly. It's just that it didn't resonate with me very much and if I was going to read this for the romance, I think it would have enjoyed it more if it was Criminy and Tish, an establish ship that readers are already invested in. Nevertheless, it's a solid read and I do recommend fans of the series give it a shot.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 27, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JJVQ31727F7G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007EE56AY#wasThisHelpful","R2JJVQ31727F7G","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I do enjoy this series, but no installment has surpassed the first book as my favorite. Archangel's Storm doesn't do it either, but I would probably rate it top 3. Much like Archangel's Blade, Elena and Raphael take a back seat as the story gives Jason, one of Raphael's Seven, focus as he enters the rival territory of archangel Neha to solve the grisly murder of her consort.  Jason has his own demons to face from his past, and they do challenge him; however, he must put it aside to work with Princess Mahiya, daughter of the slain archangel, to find the murderer and return to Raphael.Jason isn't particularly one of my favorite side characters. In all honesty, I never really thought too much about his character at all so I wasn't really looking forward to this book.  I sooner expected angel Illium to get his own story or even my personal fave, the vampire Venom.  While Illium doesn't get much time at all here, Venom actually does get significant focus which was a pretty good consolation prize. As progeny of Neha, his presence helped to flesh out the story and character development, though I would have liked more.Both Jason and Mahiya have had pretty difficult upbringings, easily making them sympathetic characters. You root for them to find happiness, but it isn't the easiest love story and there is no insta-love, which is for the better in my opinion.  There is a lot more mystery and story than romance in this book which is personally how I like it, but it's hard to say if other readers will feel the same. I love the world building and the focus on angel politics, but I am sure there is a contingent that reads these more so for the romance aspect.It was a satisfying read, but I am still hoping Ms. Nalini Singh gifts us with a Venom-centric book at some point.  With the next book set to go back to Raphael and Elena, I am not sure how far off  that possibility is. Either way, I'll be reading all the same.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 26, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R39VRHAJ5OTWYN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0425246582#wasThisHelpful","R39VRHAJ5OTWYN","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Betrayal and redemption are the primary themes in Love is Mortal, book 3 in the Valerie Dearborn series. It also completes the story arc of Valerie and Lucas. Stuck in the land of the Fey, Valerie is desperate to get out of Cerdwellyn's clutches. Her powers as an empath, while useful, are not enough and she'll have to work with Lucas if they have any hope of freedom. But can she trust him after his betrayal?I have enjoyed this series quite a bit so it was sad to see this come to the end, though this book was a fitting way to conclude their story. There's a lot of character development, particularly on Lucas's end. After the devastating revelations in Love is Fear, there was a lot of rebuilding to be done when it came to Lucas and Valerie's relationship and not a lot of time to do it. The work around was effective.There wasn't as much action this time around as Val and Lucas spend a great deal of time captive. It's more of a psychological game. The the start was a little on the slow side for me because of this, but it does hit its stride and doesn't really stop until it's over.Even though this doesn't leave on a cliffhanger, there are a lot of questions still left when it comes to the land of the Fey and Cerdwellyn's past and future, as well as Jack and Rachel, so thankfully we're not completely finished with Valerie Dearborn world. It's a fabulous series and I still want more.*ARC provided by the author.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 24, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2YM4HXD8FVMQN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00A73LMES#wasThisHelpful","R2YM4HXD8FVMQN","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This controversial spin-off of the Fever series switches from the point of view of MacKayla Lane's to her former sidekick, Dani ""Mega"" O'Malley.  After a tragic revelation, Dani goes from friend to foe.  On the run from Mac, Dani does what she does best-survive.  Of course her super powers make her a target for bigger and badder supernaturals, namely Ryodan, the immortal nightclub owner, and Christian, an Unseelie prince in the making after a shocking turn of events from the original novels.  Her abilities are particularly useful after certain parts of the already ravaged city turn up frozen, killing innocent people for no apparent rhyme or reason. To save her city, she begrudgingly joins forces with these guys, though her mere compliance may not be all they have in mind.To be honest, I wasn't really sure if I'd like this book.  Dani was fine for me as a supporting character, but I wasn't quite sure if she could be main character material.  After actually reading it I'm still not quite sure, but the final product turned out better than I thought.  Moning adopts a completely different voice for Dani and she is every bit the obnoxious teen that we've come to love or loath. I try to cut her some slack; she facing the most awkward time of her life with little to no support system, and she still wants to do good things and protect people.Moning can do the love triangle thing pretty well. Normally I don't like them, but the Barrons/V'Lane thing was an exception.  In this instance, it's got an extra little statutory dimension that's bound to ruffle a few feathers.  The book walks a fine line for me, but I can see how it could cross it for other readers.  I just keep in mind that these guys are immortal and they are enamored with the woman Dani will be, not the girl she is now. But again, it's a fine line. Her human buddy, Dancer, is also another good prospect (and probably the healthiest), but 3 potential love interests obviously makes things a bit crowded.  Someone's gotta go.The mystery wasn't that great to me. It was interesting the first couple of times, but it felt a little repetitive after a while as they stumbled upon scene upon scene.  However, a new recurring villain is introduced, and boy is she freaky! I loved reading those scenes and I felt genuinely scared!I wish there was more Mac and Barrons presence, but I wasn't expecting that so it wasn't too disappointing.  Cruce is also back, tormenting the Sidhe Seers in their dreams.  I don't know about anybody else, but I hope there is a more permanent solution to get rid of him for good.  Not a big fan of rapists and I don't care to read about them on an on-going basis if it doesn't include their deserved castration...A little much? Sorry...All in all, there were flashes of brilliance that reminded me why I love the original Fever novels (they're my #2 or #3 fave), but it wasn't quite as addictive for me.  I read all 5 Fever novels in 6 days.  This one took me a few days, but I will definitely continue reading.  This world is just too good to resist.","4.0 out of 5 stars","November 13, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R7HBGJIWJ0DY1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0385344406#wasThisHelpful","R7HBGJIWJ0DY1","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"The trauma after the drama from the events of Third Grave Dead Ahead has left Charley in a bit of a rut.  Instead of solving cases, she's taken up a new hobby: sitting on her couch all day, acquiring a Home Shopping Network addiction in the process.  She finally finds a bit of motivation once a woman shows up who needs her help.  Someone is trying to kill her, but something is amiss when all of her loved ones believe she's paranoid.Meanwhile, Reyes Farrow, Son of Satan and her better half, has been released from prison, making ends meet by doing what he does best: fighting. He's been keeping his distance from Charley, but that doesn't last long (not surprisingly) as he becomes a person of interest in an arson case.I decided to shelf this series after the third book, but I agreed to an experiment for fellow blogger to go the audiobook route in order to determine if my reading experience could redeem the series for me.  I can say that this book was a bit more bearable.  I'm not sure if it's because I had a break from reading the books back to back or what.  There were a few moments when I got annoyed with Charley's punchlines and dialogue, but it wasn't so bad. I thought the narrator did a pretty good job, though she sounds slightly older than how I imagine Charley would sound.  I liked her voices for the supporting characters, particularly her aunt.My biggest gripe with this series is the lack of supernatural conflict in place of the regular old murder mysteries. While I felt her grim reaper issues actually were a little better in that respect, things need to come to a head already.  I recently saw that the books have been extended through Book 6.  At this point, because I've read this far I would be willing to continue the series in the event that things end at Book 6, but not much further beyond that.Either way, this was a good opportunity.  If I didn't routinely use text-to-speech I'd likely go the audiobook route much more often.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ELPB1686BQR1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1250014468#wasThisHelpful","R2ELPB1686BQR1","AB5E23ZV79CVZ","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/AB5E23ZV79CVZ?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Price was very good and the Blu-ray arrived very quickly in new condition.I would rate this a 9.25 to 9.75 out of 10 - I deducted 0.25 points for them changing the lyrics to Arabian Nights but otherwise a perfect animated picture!","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 26, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RTZE4OFZIS1B5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WR534TK#wasThisHelpful","RTZE4OFZIS1B5","A6TYHY7LOFTNW","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A6TYHY7LOFTNW?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=3&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My wife and I love this series - it's a shame they didn't make anymore.The stories started out very true to the Stout books but just like Jeremy Britts Homes they started to deviate toward the end.

"Very nice poster for this nearly 85 year old movie - this movie made Boris Karloff a huge horror star.This was released (on 11/21/31 - close to Thanksgiving!) about 9 months after Dracula (2/12/31 - Happy Valentines Day! - w/Bela Lugosi - who, apparently,  was offered this monster role - some say her turned it down & others say they changed their minds, etc). Thus 1931 was the start of the modern monster movies by Universal.The poster arrived very quickly in new condition. Stated size was the actual size. Colors slightly subdued.

"This is a great product!.PQQ is a B vitamin like compound that - believe it or not - actually can increase both the efficiency AND number of Mitochondria in our cells - which are the little energy producers we all have. As a pharmacist I can tell you this is very important as we lose both the efficiency and number of mitochondria as we age. This is the main reason we get tired easier as we hit our 50's and beyond.

"This poster has a very nice, clear but slightly blurry image for this nearly 100 year old movie. This poster might have been better to be a little smaller and thus have a slightly sharper image - I would have preferred 18 by 24.This is a very creepy movie of the Dracula story. As many of you know it was thought 'lost' for quite awhile after they were sued for filming without approval from the Bram Stoker estate. All copies were to be destroyed but some managed  to survive. But all the copies I had seen until very recently were very dark, grainy and lacked a lot of detail. And now the film has been restored in Blu-ray format with much improved picture.The stated size was exactly the size I received. Image fairly sharp as are all printed words.

"This is a great poster for a truly great classic movie!I have seen this film at least a dozen times and every time I see some little detail that I had missed before. The on screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is very 'real'. And Claude Rains does his usual great job. And the ending is quite simply one of the best of all time - simply classic!I only have one very minor complaint - it looks to me like 1/8 of a inch got cropped during coping this poster as a little of the face of Paul Henreid has been cut. But otherwise this is super - the paper is very heavy - the size was perfect, the red is great and all the images are razor sharp. All of the printing is sharp as well. I am having trouble deciding what color the frame should be - I first thought a subdued red but am now leaning to a flat black or maybe a dark gray.

"I've only used this twice but it went on smoothly. I wore while I worked out to test how it would stay on.  I walked/jogged a mile then lifted weights for about 50 minutes then rode the bike for 3 miles. Afterwards I sat on my deck for about an hour reading. Since I didn't even turn pink I think I can safely say that the product worked as advertised.As a pharmacist I feel the ingredients listed are both safe and effective.This sunscreen worked well and resisted wearing off very well.However (and it seems there is always a however) there is no way the average person would pay the $70 list price. Most people would not even pay the Amazon price of $40 as you can find good stuff for under $20. You might have to apply it more often than this product but so what? I have had skin cancer removed 3 times - the last time from my nose using the Mohr's procedure. I required some minor plastic surgery for that as well so I understand the importance of being protected. When I was a younger (and stupider) guy I, as most people, didn't think about this kind of thing - I was a both a roofer and framer in the construction industry for a little more than 3 years so I was in the sun 12 hours some days.And that my friends was not very smart!So in summary - a very good product that I felt was too high in price. I would rate the product a very high 9.0 to 9.5 without thinking about the price.For the average person the price will be almost as important as how the product performs however - taking in consideration the price I would have to lower my rating to 6.0 to 6.5.

"For some reason the touring Broadway productions are no longer selling posters. I think that's stupid as that's just lost profit.I asked and was told that too many of the posters were be damaged when they moved from city to city. That's just dumb and easily avoided. We usually buy a poster and frame it when we see the show. Since we see 5 to 7 shows a year that I will now have to buy thru Amazon, etc usually for a lower price than the show charges the shows are losing a lot of revenue. The one guy I talked with said they usually sold around 150 posters a city. IF the average show did 15 cities a year that's 150x20x15 or $45,000 or so lost money.I don't understand why you would walk way from that much money.But anyway - the poster was dead on for the size.

For a while in the mid 1960's he was hot as you could be.

"This is a nice overview of Sinatra's very long career. It includes all the big hits I remember and a few I had forgotten about as well.Of course even when you have a collection this big people will say why was this song included but not this other one. I didn't view this set in that light - if this was supposed to be ALL the songs he ever recorded that would be different. It is truly a career spanning collection however so it was nice to hear how his voice changed  - and the kind of songs he chose to record changed as well. Of course life changes a person and this is reflected in the songs he recorded.Sound quality is very good but the very old songs also reflect their age.I would like to see a series of collections that would in the end release EVERY SONG he ever recorded.

"Not as interesting or well done as I remembered but still worth watching. A bunch of us went to see this when it first came out at a small old theater in Carmel, Indiana. Most of the group had read the book and had discussed it into the ground. The ones who had read the book and were at least open to the concepts therein enjoyed it - the rest not so much - in fact most of them thought it was crap.An interesting aside - the ones of us who liked and thought the concepts thought provoking are much better off (economically speaking) than those who thought the whole idea sucked.  I'm not sure what the means but it is true.Anyway the music was intriguing as well. I almost wonder it this is not the whole and complete movie we saw as (and yes - I know that this was a long time ago) some of it seems missing, etc.So - if you find the whole ancient aliens thing at least pluasible you will at least enjoy seeing some of the footage.

I now have a copy of every James Bond story every written irregardless of who wrote it or when it was written.Ths book it self was only fair to good as it only kind of follows the movie and has little in common with the Fleming story. There was more back story for the characters and the plot deviated a little from the movie making this book kind of a freak.

"I took a chance on this for an application using an SCR to control a 1500 watt heater.  It says 100 - 300VAC, but turning u the SCR slowly with load, it comes on at 20VAC.  Not sure if it's true RMS voltage or not because all I need is repeatability. I was hoping it would work with an SCR and I'm so glad it does, although I would have been able to use the current value alone for my control purposes (which I am taking from the power input to the SCR).  Nice that it can read voltages so low after it kicks on although I'll be using it mainly for the range of 80 - 130 VAC.  Hard to believe the low price.  Hope it lasts a while !!

"We are glad we got Alexa!  Just as a voice recognition music speaker alone this was worth our purchase price of around $120.  Alexa will find and play any artist or song from all the ripped CD's we've ever purchased through Amazon via The Cloud, Amazon Prime music, much of which can be added to our music library for free, Pandora, iHeart, TuneIn, Audible, and whatever content we have on our cell phones via Bluetooth, or she will randomly mix a selection of music we may specify.  Naturally, we are finding ourselves listening to a lot more music than we every did before because it is now so easy.  And the sound is quite good and fills our living room and kitchen area very acceptably.We absolutely love the shopping list function that works in conjunction with our smart phone Echo app.  It is so easy to just tell Alexa what to add to our shopping list and then check items off the list as we pick them up at the stores.It's also fun to fool around with Alexa and sometimes get surprised.  The other day, just goofing around I said, ""Alexa, open the pod bay doors."" , and she replied, ""I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that.""  My wife and I were almost literally rolling on the floor laughing.  There are all these little surprises that continue to delight us. And Amazon is planning to evolve this platform by adding new capabilities.  We're looking forward to seeing what happens.If you have read Ray Kurzweil's book The Singularity is Near, you will recognize Echo as being on the leading edge of a technological advance that has been and will continue to grow at an increasingly exponential rate.  When I was a kid, we had to go to the library to look things up in the encyclopedia.  More recently, all we had to do was type our questions into a search engine like Google.  Now we can just ask Google, or Siri or Alexa as technology continues to augment human intelligence.This is not to say that the current iteration of Echo is equivalent to Siri, for example, in terms of information; it's definitely not.  But it is very good at finding and playing music, podcasts, spelling words, getting simple facts from Wikipedia, etc., and occasionally wowing us with the unexpected response like ""Sorry, Dave, I can't do that.""  But we feel like this isn't just about it as it is at this moment but rather about the process it is part of and where that process will take us.So I think if you look at it in those terms, you will have fun and enjoy it; not focusing upon what it currently is not, but rather upon what it is, and more importantly what it will be.My wife's comment on the review is (1) I forgot to mention the ""Alexa: set timer"" function which she and I now rely upon when cooking, and (2) that she considers this among the best purchases we've made since we got our turbo hot air Oyama oven.  What can I say; she's always right:)","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3VKW8PA7T1I46/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00L9EOQCO#wasThisHelpful","R3VKW8PA7T1I46","A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I had an older keyboard style Kindle for years and it came up missing.  We looked everywhere for it and figured I'd lost in while traveling.  So I finally decided to pick up this new Kindle.

I found the older Kindle in the zippered pocket in a bag, right where I'd put it.  So now I have two.  I have a case for the older one with a light, so I use that at home in bed.  I'll be taking the newer one with me when I travel for its form factor.  I love how all my content is linked together so I can read on my cell phone, computer, or either Kindle.

"We placed these in halls, bedrooms and kitchen.  They illuminate a good size area when your eyes adjust to the dark, turn on and off automatically depending upon ambient light levels, and the direction of light can be changed in 360 degrees by swiveling so that the light doesn't shine directly into your eyes (which would perhaps reduce your overall night vision)  The LED should require minimal electricity, generate very little heat, and last a long time.  If you wanted one to operate continuously, you could put a piece of tape over the small optical sensor window.  We will probably pick up another pack.

The best alternative, perhaps, is to find a physician you can establish a trustful relationship with, one who you feel is your advocate, and one who is not too fanatic when it comes to at least considering alternatives with an open mind.  So, in conclusion, I think the movie serves to disrupt the mindless trust and confidence many have in doctors and the pharmaceutical industry these days and at least get us to think a bit for ourselves instead of just (literally) swallowing whatever we're told blindly.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2U4URDIF0A7EC/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4LDO4K#wasThisHelpful","R2U4URDIF0A7EC","A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

Plus, from the phones we can pull down and say a word or phrase and the system recognizes that and present us with a menu of choices based upon what we say.We have a simple dsl internet connection, relatively slow speed, and we have watched a number of movies and internet TV programs with no delays whatsoever, and we've been listening to Pandora music on the surround sound system much of this afternoon without any problems.  I was concerned that our internet wouldn't be fast enough, but no problem; system works great!This device has already truly transformed our use of the TV / Home theater system; we are finding that we are using the Fire TV Stick 2 - 3 times as much as we are other options such as Direct TV programs and media options, DVD's, etc.  For both music and video entertainment, this device provides such a wide array of options it's hard to beat, and I think we haven't even scratched the surface of its capabilities.If you get one and have an android phone, definitely get the Fire TV app download.Just another step on the path on the road to singularity :)  Thanks, Amazon !!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1EU1GSPCMABYF/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00GDQ0RMG#wasThisHelpful","R1EU1GSPCMABYF","A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"In combination with a Kuissential burr grinder (reviewed separately by me on Amazon), this Bodum press makes the perfect cup of coffee every time. It makes two regular cups; one for me and one for my wife; and we enjoy the process of making it and the time we sit together and talk each morning while making and enjoying it.  We are also now exploring various offerings from a local coffee roaster in Geneva, IL. Freshgroundroast dot com.  Great stuff!The purchase of these two items; the Bodum Chambord 17 oz maker, and the Kuissential burr grinder (operated with a cordless screwdriver as explained in my separate review of that item), has made a big change in our time together each morning and a our start of each day.  You'd be surprised how great a basic coffee like Eight O-clock Original beans can taste when freshly ground and brewed with this system.We were concerned about clean-up, but it's so easy. After the four minute extraction time, before plunging, I remove the floating grounds with a couple of table spoons into a paper towel in a small stainless bowl.  Then we press the coffee, pour it off and enjoy.  Later, after removing the plunger and pushing the few grinds on it into the paper towel, I use the plastic spoon to help dump the grounds in the beaker bottom out into it as well.  I just gather up the paper towel, put it in the kitchen trash can, and rinse off the plunger, the beaker, and the spoons in the sink. Done. Much easier than cleaning the Mr. Coffee 4 cup drip coffee maker which is now history.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1395SNKI0IWC1/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B005FFBTOQ#wasThisHelpful","R1395SNKI0IWC1","A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"We received our Kuissential mill yesterday and also an e-mail from the company with some helpful instructions.  Most importantly for us, they explain how to achieve the best settings of grind for your application.  You tighten the slotted wheel to draw the bottom, conical ceramic fully in contact with the fixed upper ceramic.  Then you back it off various turns for different grind sizes; 1/2 turn for fine, 1-1.5 for medium, and 1.5-2 for coarse.  We found that 1.75 turns is perfect for the coarse grind we want for our 17 oz Bodum French press (2.5 turns was too coarse).On You Tube, we found a cool idea by pvn2plus2 where he removes the handle and puts a 10 mm (6.1 mm hole) nut on the end of the shaft that allows him to operate it with his cordless drill.  I bought this nut ($0.25) and screwed it on but it quickly got tight because of the rough edges of the flats machined on the bolt. You have to turn it on with some force once, then it will come on and off easily like the knob does. Now I can use my little Ryobi  cordless screwdriver with a hex extension that has a 3/8"" socket drive and a 10 mm socket to turn the mill while applying direct, downward pressure to help it stay aligned and not wobble for the coarser grind. I keep the screwdriver plugged in to get optimum power because it takes a fair amount of torque.This grind is definitely much more repeatable and of uniform size than we can achieve with our Krups blade grinder by pulsing it 12 - 15 times.  However, it does take several minutes to grind the 30 gm of beans we need for the 17 oz press even with the cordless screwdriver (slow speed) -- about the time it takes to bring the water to a boil in the microwave. If you have a blade grinder and pulse your beans 3-4 times, they feed into the burr mill faster. (If you are in a real hurry, of course, just go with instant coffee and hot water. ;P)We have negligible ""silt"" in the bottom of the cup, and the combination of this mill with the Bodum French press makes very flavorful coffee even with an old standard like Eight O'clock Original beans. I'm saying good-bye to my Mr. Coffee 4-cup drip machine.====================================================================on Dec 11, after using this product for several days, we have decided it works much better with the supplied handle than trying to use a drill and nut.  The best setting for us is like 2 full turns off bottom / fully engaged.  It works great for AeroPress and our Bodum French press.With the manual grinder mode, it works very fast (about 1 minute for 33 gm of beans - two 8 oz cups of coffee) and is fun to use.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 7, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/R21Z7F0P64092R/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008YK3IUM#wasThisHelpful","R21Z7F0P64092R","A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2SQ4D1YGGAQ5T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"The first thing I noticed about this pan was that the heavy bottom and rounded handle make tipping it sideways to slide out an omelette considerably harder than with some other pans.  I've gotten used to it, but someone with arthritic wrists might find it a problem.This heavier base also takes longer to heat up than my old lightweight pan did, so I had to get used to that too.  On the upside, once heated, the additional weight gives it more ""thermal momentum"", so the pan stays hotter when the food hits it--which speeds cooking time a bit.The non-stick coating seems about average.  When I first got it, the non-stick actually seemed worse than the pan I was throwing out (and yes, I seasoned it), but in the end, it's probably about the same.The instructions say to not ""shock"" the pan with cold water while it's still hot, but with limited time to make breakfast and clean up, I basically do exactly that, spraying it with water and washing it up quick before putting it away.  The coating has survived just fine, so it seems durable, and the pan seems well-made.With all the 5-star ratings I think I sort of expected this pan to change my life---I mean holy smokes, everybody just loves it!

"A friend and I decided to read this (having been blown away by all the positive reviews) and neither of us could get past the first several chapters.For example, in the first chapter, we're treated to the story of a super-rich woman buying a hotel she has just arrived at, just so she can fire the front-desk clerk to punish him for a snub.  (Yes, that was the entire first chapter.)  It wasn't even slightly funny.  Instead, it came off like a badly-written adolescent revenge fantasy, and amazingly, things get even worse from there.In fact, when my friend asked me a couple of weeks in if I had read any of the book yet, I felt guilty telling her that I had only read a few chapters because I just couldn't get into it.  She stopped me short and said that she had struggled quite a bit further into the book than I had, hoping it would get better, but that it just got worse, and she urged me not to continue.  We both quit in relief.This book is the second time both my friend and I have been badly fooled by a few hundred positive reviews, only to find the book itself virtually unreadable.

"About six people in my book-club decided to read this based on the glowing reviews.  When we convened to discuss it, I had to admit that I hadn't been able to finish it; it just didn't hold my interest.  As it turned out, only one person had finished it, and he thought it was just okay.  The rest of us thought it was so bad we agreed to waste no more time on it.I'm still shocked at the number of 5-star reviews for this book.  When I went back to actually read a few pages' worth of them, however, I found a large number were one-sentence reviews, or even one word, like ""excellent"", which made me wonder if they weren't simply friends of the author.  Most of the remaining reviews were enthusiastic about the book simply because they thought it did a good job of ripping Bush and Cheney or even just America in general.So if that sounds like something you might enjoy, then you might enjoy this book.

"This product is, like many spray bottles, simply a metal can with a screw-off plastic spray nozzle--but with a top that ingeniously doubles as the pump.  It seems like a really great idea, but it's not so great in practice.First, when you're done and want to simply replace the top, you have to pump it one more time (because that's how it works, after all), after which the cap rebounds a little bit from the pressure in the can.  So the cap never actually seats on the can very well.Then, if you leave it pressurized on the counter, the cap slowly rises off the bottle again from air--and oil--slowly leaking out of the spray nozzle.  This eventually makes the can greasy and you have to wash the whole thing.  (Plus it looks weird sitting on the counter with the top inexplicably standing halfway off the can...)Eventually I decided to just unscrew the top a little bit and depressurize it to stop it from leaking, but that didn't really seem to help very much.  The can was somehow always greasy when I picked it up again.As far as spraying performance, it works okay; it's just that using it wasn't really a pleasure.

"Normally I hate giving gift cards.  But in this case, I'll make an exception, because this kind does serve a purpose:First, the main reason I don't like gift cards is that they're just cash limited to a single retailer. So it's no more ""thoughtful"" than plain old cash, just less flexible.A second reason I don't like most gift cards is that many of them become lost or are incompletely redeemed, and the residual value becomes pure unearned profit for the cards' sellers.  No wonder they try to make people believe they're a ""thoughtful"" gift.However, in one case, I can recommend the use of THIS particular gift card, and it involves redeeming a prepaid VISA or MasterCard debit card.  These types of gift cards have the advantage of being accepted almost anywhere, and are very commonly used nowadays to issue product rebates (one reason for which is that the issuer gets to see what you buy with it, learn a little more about your buying habits and sell that knowledge to others.  But I digress...)The point is, although these prepaid-type cards are widely accepted, they're a pain to use, because unless your entire purchase fits into the remaining balance, the checkout system (or cashier) has to know how to do a ""split tender"" transaction, with part of the balance coming from the prepaid card and the rest from another card.  As of this review (7/8/2013), even Amazon's checkout system provided no way of doing that with two ""credit"" type cards.  Like other retailers, they only know how to do a split-tender transaction involving their own brand of ""gift"" card.  A lot of retail cashiers don't know how to do that either, in my experience.So that's where the Amazon Gift Card comes in.  Your prepaid VISA rebate or gift card comes in an even-dollar denomination, and if you simply use the entire amount to buy an Amazon gift card of the same amount, you have now transformed it into something that WILL work with Amazon checkout.  Better yet, because Amazon isn't just a single retailer but a whole marketplace of retailers, you're not locked into spending your money at a single store.  Problem solved--at least if you shop on Amazon.(Incidentally, the same technique works in retail stores when the cashier is unable to do a split-tender transaction:  just use the prepaid VISA to buy a store-brand gift card first, then make your regular purchase using that gift card.  This works because EVERY checkout clerk is trained on their own store-brand gift cards.)Incidentally, if you ARE stuck with a prepaid VISA with only an odd few residual dollars left on it, one of the easiest ways I've found to drain the remaining balance is to use it on gasoline purchases.  It seems that those systems, unlike most others, are capable of detecting the remaining balance on a gift card and dispensing only that amount of gasoline---after which you can finish filling up with a regular card.  Still more of a hassle, but at least you get to fully drain the card of money.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1QYVNY1KZMOZP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B004LLIKVU#wasThisHelpful","R1QYVNY1KZMOZP","A5KRM3621UHG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KRM3621UHG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I couldn't quite figure out how this dressing container worked from just looking at the picture, and I wasn't sure about buying it as a result---especially after reading that someone had a problem with a piece falling off.  Now that I've used it, my doubts are gone---it's great.Basically, the white plastic top portion screws onto the glass bottom, and when it's closed (which is how it's pictured), you can shake your dressing vigorously with no problems.  Then, when holding it, a finger-press on the lower back portion of the top hinges open the dispenser, unplugging the hole at the top of the lid, enabling you to dispense dressing.  Another finger-press closer to the top pops the lid closed again, and neatly reseals the bottle.I was a little worried that it would be cheaply made or not worth it, but I really do like it now that I've had it a while.  All my previous dressing dispensers seemed to always be leaking or oozing oil onto the outside no matter how hard I tried to keep them clean, and leaving a ring where they stood.  This one stays absolutely clean from top to bottom at all times.  It was a great purchase, one I'm happy I made.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 8, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3XBU4Q71ATNP/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B007PNH4SG#wasThisHelpful","R3XBU4Q71ATNP","A5KRM3621UHG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KRM3621UHG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"There are two ways to pay for a coffee-maker:  in research time and dollars up front, or in frustration, anguish and despair later.  This coffee-maker is so bad that I literally just finished wrapping it as a white-elephant gift for our office holiday party.  I would not be surprised to see it pressed into piata duty afterwards:We purchased this coffee maker for our small office because it grinds beans and makes coffee.  Unforeseen were 1) the amount of time required for cleaning, 2) the sharpness of the plastic edges on the parts (and the thousand nagging cuts they would inflict), and 3) the overall rapidity with which we would all grow to deeply hate it.The bean-grinder is like any other $10 stand-alone grinder, except that it contains a built-in screen and delivery chute and is therefore much harder to clean.  The filter basket is permanent and also requires a toothbrush and running water to clean, and doesn't take standard disposable filters as an option.  Every time you brew coffee and do the subsequent 10 minutes of cut-inflicting cleaning in the sink with a toothbrush, only to discover that the machine is still visibly dirty in multiple inaccessible areas and will never, ever, truly be clean again, your desire to live ebbs just a little more, until you, like us, eventually decide that 1) either it dies or 2) you will.We replaced this unit with a Baratza Virtuoso bean grinder (simply excellent) and a Bunn coffee maker (simply excellent) and we now enjoy delicious coffee with literally no cleanup needed because of the thoughtful design and ability to use disposable filters.  I earnestly suggest that you do the same while skipping the pain of buying this one first.  Don't let the low price lure you into a life of scullery duty.","2.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2012","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2MIC3LEKO4Z0C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000VTP45Q#wasThisHelpful","R2MIC3LEKO4Z0C","A5KRM3621UHG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KRM3621UHG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I happen to be a fan of Adam Smith's work, so I had high hopes when I happened across this ""modern interpretation.""  Adam's writing is tough to read, so anything that makes it more accessible seems like a good thing.  But that's not what this is.  Even the samples afforded by Amazon's ""Look Inside!"" feature quickly revealed why I didn't want to read more.Essentially, the author takes small excerpts from the ""Wealth of Nations"" and comments briefly on each in a ""quick tips for success!"" style, seemingly aimed at business people.  Unfortunately, she seriously misses his point at times, and seems to be using his words more as a launching pad to promote her own liberal notions.For example, she cites Adam's statement (as best I can put it from memory) that ""The power of exchange is what gives rise to the division of labor, so it (the division of labor) is limited by the extent of the market,"" a fairly straightforward idea.  You're not going to see anyone set up an assembly line to produce a single item for a single customer, in other words.  A small marketplace doesn't support that great a division of labor.But the author interprets this, confusingly, to claim that Adam was proposing the idea that ""innovation creates its own marketplace,"" which is not at all what he was saying.  She then goes on to refute what he didn't say, by saying that innovation mainly occurs only in existing industries.  I couldn't find a single useful take-away from that discussion.At some point the author says we should all be driving more electric cars to avert anthropogenic global warming, and that indeed we would be, except that Big Oil is distorting our choices.  I expect the author would be shocked to learn that the electricity used by those electric cars is just a storage form of energy originally produced by (wait for it) fossil fuels and nuclear power.  (Electric car drivers merely outsource their carbon footprints, in other words.)  She has also not considered the problem of heating an all-electric car sufficiently to make it a viable choice for the bitterly cold climates many of us are doomed to live in until the blessed global warming finally arrives.She even goes on to say that global trade results in a win only for the consumers who get cheap products, not for the workers in less-developed countries who get only low-paying jobs.  She seems to miss the point that the low-paying jobs in question must still be more desirable than other choices in those countries, or nobody would take them.  It's a win-win presented as a win-lose, presumably because those workers aren't instantly promoted to the same economic level as their customers, an idea that would have been preposterous to Adam---and is to me as well.Adam's original work is available free on Kindle, incidentally, and although the writing style is hard to read, the principles are still alive and running the world to this day.  If you're interested in economics, it's worth the slog.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 10, 2011","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1T42BHPO6LKBN/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1906821038#wasThisHelpful","R1T42BHPO6LKBN","A5KRM3621UHG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KRM3621UHG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"When someone gushes about a movie being the funniest thing they've ever seen, it usually kills it for me.  Fortunately, I had no expectations at all for this movie, and ended up thinking it was hilarious.I don't know where to start...Napoleon's brother is SUCH a dweeb you'll want to smack him yourself---yet I'm laughing even now thinking about him.  There are all these subtle continuity errors and era-inappropriate artifacts that are so obvious they had to be intentional, and even those still make me laugh.But the real reason the movie is funny is because most of the characters are so incredibly pathetic they'll remind you, sometimes quite painfully, of real people.  Some parts almost make you cringe that way.If you're looking for something a little different, and if you can sit down to watch this without any particular expectations, you might accidentally get a huge kick out of it.  I did.

"I really expected to like this boombox, but I was disappointed almost immediately, because the radio tuning isn't selective.In other words, even when you're listening to strong stations, you can hear other stations ""bleeding over"" into the one you're tuned to.  It's like a ghost station in the background.  It's not horrible, but it messes with the sound.For example, when listening to a rock station, I could hear faint talk-radio.  On talk-radio, I could hear faint music.  On a classics station, commercials from nearby stations were *really* noticable when they came on.There was actually another problem with my particular sample, which is that it arrived with a faulty display (didn't have all the segments working in the rightmost character/number), but I could have lived with that.The sound quality might be pretty good for CD's, MP3's and other clean sources, but I bought this specifically for the radio, and that part stinks (both AM and FM were plagued with this problem).  There is simply no excuse for poor selectivity in a $140 radio.  No speakers sound good playing two radio stations at the same time.Other disappointments were the lack of a simple, conventional cord (it comes with a transformer), and a significantly cheaper feel than I expected.  But the lack of clean, clear radio reception makes this a no-buy recommendation from me.","2.0 out of 5 stars","October 19, 2006","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3D3NUNFKZLDQJ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000FHD7PI#wasThisHelpful","R3D3NUNFKZLDQJ","A5KRM3621UHG1","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A5KRM3621UHG1?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a nice basic slow cooker with off, low, high and warm settings.  My other one (different brand) allows more temperature settings, so I like that one a bit better, but this one does the job also and is larger.  Cooking with this unit has been even, no hotter or cooler points. If you just want a basic slow cooker with simple controls and settings this could be a good unit for you.  You may get an odd smell when you first use it, but that is normal and will go away.

"Our granddaughter is all about the Disney princess girls.  Her favorites until Frozen came out were the mermaid and Cinderella.  She also loves making dresses and assorted clothing.  Big on colors.  She has a very creative mind at this point in her life. This Play-Doh Princess Castle toy is perfect for her.  She loves it.  What I like is that the play-doh does not make much of a mess and is safe for kids to play with.  No complaints here.  I would recommend however that you get more play-doh.

"This is a nice toy for the younger kids.  Ours is about to turn 4.  No batteries required.  I trust the Fisher-Price brand.  The toy has wheels on the bottom and as you roll it the shark jaws go up and down.  There are also two action figures on the deck, Jake and a pirate dressed as a shark.  There is a lever at the side that allows the child to pretend the two are having a sword fight. My only objection is that the price (currently listed at just under $50) seems excessive.  I thus deduct 1 star, leaving 4 stars.","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2UQT3TSNBKSPA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VJKTFK6#wasThisHelpful","R2UQT3TSNBKSPA","A1DO9LRCO23EOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DO9LRCO23EOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I was originally going to give this toy 2 stars. I got it, set it up with the trackball (not the app) and could not get it to work in the ""ball"" and ""leash"" modes.  Music, dance and feed modes worked fine. Plus there is no volume control.  Then I got my 8 year old to help out.  We downloaded the app and he mastered it quickly.  So I guess the problem was not the toy but me.  This toy takes 4 AA batteries for the Miposaur itself and 4 AAA batteries for the trackball.  Batteries are not included.  Also you need a small Phillips head screwdriver to install and replace the batteries. The boy loves this toy so I upgrade it to 4 stars. I deduct 1 star however as Amazon currently has no price listed for this toy and without a price I cannot make a value judgment on this toy (a toy may be a good value at $75, but not at $125 for example). I also believe the instructions could be better written and more clear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R30SVSQT00D54G/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VFZDOC0#wasThisHelpful","R30SVSQT00D54G","A1DO9LRCO23EOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DO9LRCO23EOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"This is a fairly simple USB charging station that does what it is supposed to do, i.e., slowly recharge USB devices.  There is an on/off switch at the front and this product has 3 separate USB charging ports.  Two ports are 1 amp capacity and the middle port is 2.1 amp capacity.  The pegs unfortunately are fixed and your devices may or may not fit within the pegs, depending upon the thickness of whatever devices you want to charge and whether or not you have them in cases.  The main advantage of this station for me is that it saves usage of wall outlets, allowing one wall outlet to be used to charge 3 devices at one time. The box does not come with any additional USB cables.  You get the charging station, which comes with its own power cord, and that is it.  This was not a problem for me however as all my devices came with their own USB charging cords.  If you are part of a family with multiple phones to charge this could be a great product for you.

"This is a very good lock for the money.  Uses a 4 digit combination that is easy to set.  And you can make up your own combination and then change it whenever you like.  Appears very well made and weather resistant.  Comes with instructions hidden behind the lock in the packaging.  Once you have opened the cover and dialed in the combination, you release or open the shackle by pressing in on both sides of the lock near the top of the case.A few things I did not like.  First, the numbers on the combination dials are not easy to see in low light environments, so unless you have near perfect vision you will likely need a flashlight to open this lock in a low light environment.  I would have preferred that the combination dials be black with white numbers or white with black numbers for more contrast and easier reading.  Second, there is a lift up cover that conceals the combination dials.  It says ""PUSH & LIFT.""  But when you push the cover does not always lift, the result being you may have to push more than once to get at the combination dials to enter the combination.  Third, the written instructions could be more clear on how to set your initial combination.  I set an initial combination I did not want, the default combination, by mistake, and then found it easier to reset than to initially set.  Now that I have figured it out I do not expect problems in this regard in the future, but the instructions on the initial combinations set could have been better.All things considered this is a strong, good quality lock at a good price, which makes it a good value.

"Got this TEKTON hammer just in time to use it on some wood deck work in back of the house.  Also needed to do some repairs to a wood tree house I built for the kids years ago, damaged by a recent storm.  Never used a TEKTON hammer before and never used a fiberglass handle hammer.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Took me a minute to get used to the handle, mainly because it curves at the end.  You can see the curve in the product pictures.  All my previous hammers for over 50 years have had straight wood handles with no curves so at first the handle of this new TEKTON hammer felt strange to me.  This particular design does absorb some of the impact shock from my old wood handle hammers and I like that a lot.  The magnet for starting nails is fantastic.  I really, really like that.  After I got the feel of this hammer I was able to keep a very good grip on it.  Product appears well made in addition to being well designed and I expect it to last for life.  I find this to be a great hammer for the price, a good value.  Never heard of ""TEKTON"" before this, most of my tools are Craftsman, Snap On and Stanley.  TEKTON is a new brand for me.  But I can and do recommend this hammer.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3FIPM2H6U67QV/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00MWVAV40#wasThisHelpful","R3FIPM2H6U67QV","A1DO9LRCO23EOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DO9LRCO23EOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"We grill a lot during the summer, but I am not feeding a huge family anymore as most of the kids are now grown and have their own homes and grills.  All I use now is a kettle grill about 26 inches in diameter.  This product fits my kettle grill well and appears very well constructed and weather resistant.  I expect it to last the rest of my life.  I like the vents, which have been absent on some of my previous covers.  The vents allow moisture to escape and reduce wind problems during storms.

"I have a small 10x10 ft. storage shed on the back of my property where there is no electricity.  I wanted a light that would be bright enough at night to let us see the door lock well enough to fit in the key.  I keep a large flashlight inside the unit so once we are inside if we need to access something I use the battery powered flashlight.  I mounted this solar powered light just over the door on the outside and turned on the ""auto"" setting.  The door of the shed gets plenty of sunlight during a normal day to recharge the unit as needed.  This solar light has been a perfect solution for me, throwing down enough light at night if I need to enter the shed to allow me to easily find the lock and fit in the key.  Once I have the door open I simply grab the battery powered flashlight to find whatever I need inside.  Only time will tell how durable this unit is.  Right now I have no complaints and the product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  Make sure when you get this unit to let it sit in the Sun and fully charge.  Also, it would obviously be best to mount this unit in a position and place that normally gets a lot of sunlight during the day.  I have seen a few people complain about the solar panel detaching from the unit.  Not a problem for me as mine is securely attached and if it were not I would likely just glue it in place.  I have to review the product I received not the product somebody else received.  5 stars from me.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RS6OP7AHCSK2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00J7JX82C#wasThisHelpful","RS6OP7AHCSK2Y","A1DO9LRCO23EOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DO9LRCO23EOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This headboard arrived in a huge very well protected box in perfect condition.  Some assembly is required but it is not complicated.  My main recommendation regarding assembly is that you have some help.  You can assemble it yourself acting alone, but it makes assembly difficult and it is better not to take the risk of injury.  With a helper I was able to assemble this in about 20 minutes or less.The product comes with all bolts needed.  With 2 exceptions they are hex head bolts and an Allen wrench is included with the package.  The 2 exceptions require a standard Phillips screwdriver and perhaps a pair of pliers or adjustable wrench, not included but common in most homes.  An instruction sheet is included and is very easy to understand so far as it goes.One matter that caused me some minor frustration is the padding that is fitted over the headboard once it is assembled.  The padding is a very close fit so you must be careful installing it.  There is a cloth side to the padding and a plastic mesh like side.  Make sure you turn the padding inside out if needed so that the cloth side is facing outside and the plastic mesh side is facing in.  Otherwise installation of the padding will be more difficult and you may rip it (the cloth side).  The instructions do not clearly state which side of the padding faces in and out and I wish that were corrected.  At first, not paying close attention, I just assumed the padding was the same on both sides.  It is not.I had no problems at all with holes and bolts matching up.  All matched up well.  What I recommend during assembly is that you not tighten up the bolts until all have been lined up and started in the threads.Once the board is assembled and the padding installed you simply slip on the cover (mine is sand color) and you are ready to hook on your full or queen size bed rails. Full size rails are bolted to the inside holes in the legs, queen size rails are bolted to the outside holes in the legs.  Lay on your box springs and mattress and you are done except for making the bed.All things considered I am very pleased with this headboard.  4 stars.  I deducted 1 star because (1) the price seems a bit high at $484 (current price listed as of date of this review); (2) the wood is not solid but appears well reinforced.  Just do not be standing on it; and (3) the instructions could have been a little more clear about which side of the padding faces out.

"I assembled this Spalding Portable Basketball System with a friend last week end in our backyard (we have a large flat back patio).  So far we have played 5 games with it.  All of us like it.  Assembly was relatively easy for us, but I would strongly recommend you do the assembly with some help instead of trying to do it all alone. This unit is heavy at about 165 pounds without any sand or gravel or water.  Assembly alone may be possible but is just not worth the risk of injury.  We like the acrylic backboard, although glass usually gives better rebound performance.  Our goals are simply to have some fun and get some exercise so the acrylic works fine for us.  This backboard at 54""x32"" is smaller than regulation size (if memory serves me correctly regulation size is 72""x42"").  Nevertheless the rectangular shape and size of this acrylic backboard still gives us a lot of bank shot plays.  What I like best about this unit is the adjustable height, 7.5 to 10 feet.  That makes it easier for more to play including the young teens.  We filled ours with both sand and water.  Spalding has been known for quality products for years and the quality of this unit appears very good.  I am not expecting this unit to wear out and if we have any problems with it I will certainly come back and update this review.  But so far all love it and there are no complaints.  This is a big improvement for us.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 30, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2EMZH65TP5TZZ/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00SYYOCBM#wasThisHelpful","R2EMZH65TP5TZZ","A1DO9LRCO23EOM","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1DO9LRCO23EOM?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I have to be honest. This is the best book light I have found for any e-reader. I currently have 6 Kindles, and because I get headaches I prefer to read on my regular old DX. Which is not back lit. It works like a charm.Pros: Lights well, the lamp can be angled to prevent glare and gives enough light to read without straining your eyes, while still a very gentle lamp.Cons: Battery. News flash folks the battery drains even when your aren't using it. On or off it doesn't make a difference the battery life is the same. To change the battery you need a specializes ultra small (3/32nds) Philips head screw driver. On my particular light, the very first time I needed to change the battery I found that the screw was so secure I stripped it trying to get it out... so I undid the other three screws on the back cover and removed the entire back in order to access the battery. Yes removing three of 4 screws I intentionally broke my light so that I could change the battery. Its reassembled now and working, but if you aren't tech/mech savy then you may be better off with a different light or getting a case that has a light. I have one of those too, and while the lamp causes a slight glare the battery is MUCH easier to access. No special tools required.","3.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2XUJ404F3N9FX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0031116K8#wasThisHelpful","R2XUJ404F3N9FX","A190BQGZL0R6QA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A190BQGZL0R6QA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT WORK FOR FITBIT, NOR IS THIS A PAID REVIEW.I am employed by a major US Cell Phone carrier (Desk Job) and the FitBit Zip made our list as ""Accessory of the Month"" in February. I had wanted one since August, so I finally picked one up. Now my hopes were not all that high, I have used pedometers before (they usually vanish into the nine hells of the laundry room) and to be honest don't do much to inspire me and usually make me self conscious because you can HEAR them chime when you move.No such Issue, I clip it on my bra with the display facing in, and it doesn't even disrupt the line of my clothes. Vanity satisfied, the price tag had me careful not to wash it.I love this thing so much FitBit SHOULD Hire me.Pros: Size, color selection, the mobile App and website.FitBit has made their little corner of the market by making it social, a way to be exercise buddies with pals in the Military no matter how far apart we are. Your account with FitBit can be connected to your FaceBook account, HUGE Plus.When you use the App you can track your calories (Just like MyFitness Pal) and Track your water (food diary). BUT when you get close to your CUSTOMIZED goals, the App will send you an Alert. ""Almost there, 200 steps to go!"" You can earn badges, and if you are at all competitive its a great asset when you don't have an exercise buddy.They also send you a weekly e-mail, summarizing your highs and lows and average caloric intake. (Sold Yet?) If you are on a weight-loss program or working with a Trainer of Physician these updates can be forwarded straight to them. Diabetic? Talk to your doctor about it, walking encourages circulation, gotta fight nerve damage!FitBit has a great family of products, take a look at the Aria Scale (sends your weight wirelessly to the fitbit site) keeps you honest. Sleep Monitors (for our friends with apnea) they all work together in a very cohesive fashion.I'm converted.Cons: I want a Barcode Scanner.This little gem has taken me from less than 1000 steps a day to 5500 daily in less than 3 months. Everyone should have one, I should know, I just talked my boss into it to help her shed baby weight, also got our work Wellness Center to host a contest to win one.

"Now to be honest, I bought it because it was cheap. The one I wanted was 60.00 and I just couldn't do following the holidays, I will be upgrading in a few months.My doctor told me that 10,000 steps is considered active, being asthmatic it can be very difficult to be active, but I do enjoy walking, so I decided that along with my New Years Diet I would start tracking my activity. I received my Pedometer, I would say it was over-packaged, had no instructions and getting it open so I could check it out was a feat. I do not see how it can be practical to check throughout the day when shaking the thing tracks steps. Also you can hear it chime for each step it tracks. I think that the developer could up the resistance just a little and improve accuracy, the chime it makes is audible enough to me and that it makes it less than discreet and me very conscious of myself when I am around others.-1 for not coming with instructions and being difficult to open.-1 for sensitivity/inaccuracy.Good for what you pay, but not impressive value.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2013","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3S3ZLVV1EMHBX/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B002MVTO98#wasThisHelpful","R3S3ZLVV1EMHBX","A190BQGZL0R6QA","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A190BQGZL0R6QA?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=4&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Sean Michael is a master of sensual writing. Never have I FELT writing the way I felt this. Normally I can pick out little flaws in structure or grammar that pulled me out of the story, not in this case. When I was in Highschool my best friends mother was involved in the BDSM culture. Parties and Dom/Sub full time, she had parties and had all sorts of people in and out of the house. Her only steadfast rule was ""Touch my girls and you'll lose a hand."" We could do what we wanted and participate in anything that wasn't sexual. I learned about knots and how sensual pain could be even without sex being involved. So when I say Sean's writing is real and felt I mean it. When I bought this book without any reviews on it, I thought it would probably rank a three star... but I was so pleasantly surprised.

"I bought these bags because my toaster was getting full of bread crumbs and melted cheese. I found these bags will accommodate almost any size of bread. The limitation is the thickness. It will easily take a toast with a couple of cheese slices and pepperoni pieces but using very thick fillings would be difficult. The advantage is tough you do not need use butter to make a toast. I can make toasted sandwiches in under 3 minutes.My toaster is now free of bread crumbs and melted cheese because all fall into the bag. If the bags are wiped clean with a paper towel right after use there really is no significant clean up. Crumbs and cheese do no stick to the bags, I can just wipe them off.I can use these in microwaves to heat up frozen food. Then I use a fresh bag to heat them up in the toaster. They do turn out so crispy, absolutely delicious. My food no longer has 'microwave sogginess'.I have found them so useful that I keep some at work and some spares at home.

"This entire movie encourages wild and reckless stunts. There is a disclaimer at the end of the movie but no one will probably see it or care about it. There is no way a person can jump from one level of a bridge to a lower level while catching another person and survive. Windshields are not trampolines.  The tank was really cool though.

"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. I watched the unrated version and it was less gory then ""The Walking Dead"". The movie is frantic and loud. I think most summer action movies are made like this now and I don't like it. I like the slow pace of ""The Walking Dead"". I am also a slow zombie type and in this movie the zombies move at warp speed as well as the virus with a 12 second incubation time. Brad Pitt is very bland in this and all the other characters are just supporting him(also a producer). This movie is far from the best zombie movie but it is about average. A good watch once. The extras are just more advertising for the movie and Brad Pitt. He also made sure to be the only handsome actor in the movie.

"I was so anxious to receive this book because of the reviews that if you loved ""The Shack"" you will love ""Eve"".  Well......I absolutely loved ""The Shack"" and didn't see how anyone could write a better book but I sure was excited to see if they could.  I was right, for my reading interests, in that ""Eve"" wasn't better for me and ""The Shack"" remains the best book I have read in a very long time.  The absolute best.  In ""Eve"" I felt like I was reading science fiction all through the book in spite of the fact that reality struck with Biblical references that constantly came to light through the book. I did read it all the way through, though, to see if the ending was what I expected having fairly good knowledge of the Bible and what happened in the beginnings of our earth, and I was kind of disappointed.  I thought it was just me, but my sister-in-law who also loved ""The Shack"" also anxiously awaited ""Eve"" said that she gave up trying to follow it and quit reading. Maybe I'm just not deep enough - don't know. I'm glad I got the book, read it, even though I was really disappointed in it. I buy a lot of Biblical books always trying to get deeper and clearer understanding ofBiblical events, prophecy, stories.  This just didn't do it for me.","3.0 out of 5 stars","November 11, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2S3NNC9G0KKQ8/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1501101420#wasThisHelpful","R2S3NNC9G0KKQ8","A2VUSLI3LTA7I9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUSLI3LTA7I9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=1&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"I love the Keurig brewers but this machine is a big disappointment to me due to the fact that it completely controls and dictates what kcups you can and can't use with it.  It absolutely won't accept the inserts so you can use your favorite brand of coffee; it won't accept many of the kcups currently on the market that actually may be one of your favorites (like Tim Horton, Gevalia, SanFrancisco Bay, Cameron's, etc) because they have not been approved by Keurig even though they will work in all the brewers by Keurig up until this 2.0 model and won't even accept Keurig approved Kcups purchased before about July since it will only accept those who say Keurig Brewed on the top of the cup.  This brewer reads the lids - I was told if I put an ""older"" approved kcup in the machine it would say ""oops"" and I could call their 800# presumably to be able to be talked through an option that might let me use one of their approved coffees.  This feels like a giant control effort to prevent people from enjoying their brewers unless you also use their coffees.  Sooooo - if you happen to like a brand of coffee they don't approve of you will have to choose between their new brewer and all it has to offer or your coffee.  I chose my coffee; there are a good many brewers that will still let me use my favorite brand of kcup that I don't need their new brewer.  And given time, I expect the other coffee makers will also offer what this one does (like the option of making either a single cup of coffee or a 4 cup carafe of coffee with their new kcup size) without dictating what coffee you enjoy in it.  It seems that Keurig would prefer to sell these brewers to anyone who wants one, while enjoying the approved coffee to those who choose to drink it, or will actually let people enjoy their brewer and their favorite coffee even if Keurig doesn't approve of their coffee.  I expect there will be others who did what I did - bought the machine only to realize this after I got it home and quickly realized I'd have to give up my favorite coffee to keep it, or throw out 95% of the kcups I had that were purchased before about July of this year.  I returned it - don't tell me what coffee I can like, Keurig - the other makers of single serve brewers that accept your kcups don't tell me what I have to like to use their brewers.

"Love this coffee....blend is medium and no bitter aftertaste.  Nice that Keurig has approved it for their machines.  Now........if Keurig would approve some of the other coffees out there that are good (Tim Horton's, SanFrancisco Bay, Cameron's) I might get their new machine which only accepts Keurig approved kcups and nothing else.  Give up my coffee? Give up the machine?  I'll keep my coffee thank you, and if my Keurig dies I'll find a machine that will accept my favorite coffees (like the older model Keurigs or one of the many other single serve machines out there that will accept them all and will even let you use an insert to use your own coffee.) Their new machine (2.0)won't, nor will it accept any kcup that doesn't say ""Keurig Brewed"" around the top of the cup.  95% of the kcups I have were bought more than a month ago and therefore won't work in the 2.0.  This kcup (Starbucks one listed here) is one of the older ones I have - still tastes fresh - but won't be accepted by the 2.0.  Sorry......on a soapbox as I really would have liked the new Keurig - WalMart has it now and love that it has a carafe to make up to 4 cups as well as makes 1 cup.  But I won't give up my Starbucks coffees I have, nor will I give up my Tim Horton kcups, nor any of my older kcups that don't have the new labels that the 2.0 reads, to get their new machine............Anyway......love this decaf Starbucks.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 30, 2014","http://www.amazon.com/review/RRX0PE2CZNCC5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0094IWNJA#wasThisHelpful","RRX0PE2CZNCC5","A2VUSLI3LTA7I9","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A2VUSLI3LTA7I9?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=5&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summary: These washcloths are super soft. They're so nice to feel. I've been using them more as mini-handtowels, but I'm sure they function just fine as wash cloths for babies or big people.Random comments: (including some things I think people have legit cause to complain a bit if they're so inclined.)- They're tiny. I know they're intended to use for babies, but they're very, very tiny. I have small hands and I still feel it's barely there.- Super soft. :-)- The package is cute, but those little rings can easily damage the delicate clothes. First one I pulled off took several threads with it...I didn't rip a hole in it but it was a close call. Even being careful, several had a few damaged threads.- Not sure how they'll hold up long haul. I plan to test that through the next few weeks and I'll update accordingly.11/21/15, so far so good, I've been using them as hand towels....they're so nice and soft, quick drying.Conclusion: So far, so good.

"Summary: Nancy's in NYC to support Bess Marvin's bid for stardom on a early vision of American Idol (idea probably existed about a decade before those shows took off). She gets caught up in a case of trying to help this girl with amnesia recover her memories. The Hardy Boys are in town to investigate an embezzling case for a hot shot producer.Random Comments:- Okay, so the book's a lot out of date, but it's still fun.- The plot's convenient, but when were these books ever not full of convenient plot pts? That's part of their antiquated charm. I think payphones were mentioned. Nothing of today's technology yet the detectives are still top of their game. Must be nice to be 17/18 forever. I'm slightly jealous.- There's quite a lot of mystery in here. Some of the conclusions and leaps of logic are laughable, but it works.- Not my favorite cover, but probably my favorite of the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series.- Danger level is about on par with their typical cases. The files/casefiles era was particularly fond of endgame violence.Conclusion: Classic. But I'm not sure how teens today will like it.","4.0 out of 5 stars","September 24, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RXQ7KWFE7O13M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0671781693#wasThisHelpful","RXQ7KWFE7O13M","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary of what you get: Easy to use beginner microscope. It's got a stand, lens, course focus, and fine focus.Random Comments:- Might drive some bio teachers crazy because it doesn't have all the parts of a traditional microscope. That said, these would be super easy to stock in a classroom and you could get them for a fraction of the cost of a microscope.- The picture taking opportunities are awesome.- I'd actually probably use this to show off a chemical reaction, provided I could mount the camera on a proper ring stand. It's basically a glorified camera with a pretty powerful zoom function.- It works fine and is easy to install but you sort of need a CD drive, which I'm hearing some computers aren't coming with. My new laptop had one, but it's not a mac.- Packaging was well done.- Instructions are fair. Nothing spectacular, but not horrific either.- Price is fair.- Picture quality is good.- Great for homeschool use for those who don't have the money or inclination to buy an expensive one from a science supply company.- It's more a hobbiest's toy, but it's also got a ton of potential for easy learning opportunities. The way you use it is limited to your imagination...and the reach of the relatively short cord. I've decided a short cord's okay, I'm sure some company out there is willing to sell you a USB extension cord for a few more bucks if you really need a longer cord.Conclusion: Easy to use microscope. Doesn't do all that a traditional microscope can do, but it does some things that a ""normal"" microscope can't do. The ability to take a dozen pictures in seconds is kind of awesome.*I received a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 22, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R12SCNW1RMJO2V/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B012G28SLC#wasThisHelpful","R12SCNW1RMJO2V","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary: You get a lot for the money this time around. The main item is a case that's built for the belt clip and holder. Bonus items include a stylus, a plastic protector and a microfiber cloth to clean the glass surface of your phone.Random Comments:- Changing Cases (4/5 stars) - The case was big enough for my phone but it took a fair amount of prodding to actually get the cover on. It's good that it's not likely to fall off, but the silicon inner lining kept folding under the phone as I tried to put it in.- Style (4.5/5 stars) - Okay, so it's not the slickest look but it's functional and the black-gray color combination works nicely.- The case has a tiny notch that latches into the holder. Not sure how this would hold up over time, but it seems sturdy as of this moment. (Might not go jogging with it, but I think it would hold at least for a while.)- Phone snaps in and out reasonably well. I'd be careful not to scratch the face on the clip on the holder that keeps the phone in place.- kickstand is an interesting idea. Not sure how much practical use I'll give that feature, but it works swell.- Usefulness (5/5 stars) - Fits right on nearly any belt. It's pretty lightweight.

"Summary: Nancy goes to Scotland to investigate the case that got her mother killed. (That's not a spoiler, that's in the trailer.)Random Comments:- I've been on a bit of a ND game hiatus here. I think the last I played was #14 or #15, but I was/am excited to play a story that tells you a little about Nancy's mother.- It was slightly annoying that they changed the canon info that Nancy's mom died when Nancy was 3 years old...I guess they needed it for their story line here but would have been nice to stick to some basic facts.- The puzzles in here were crazy hard (though take this from a non-puzzle gaming person)...I'm in it for the story not the puzzles. This is why it's always good to get the game a year or so after it releases...then the detailed gaming guide will walk you right through the tough stuff.- Even with the guidebook, the story takes about 5 ish hours to play through if you talk to everybody and investigate everything.Conclusion: Fun story.

Torture scene included. Lots of strong language. Even for the type of movie it is, that could have been toned down a little. There are some R movies that are still on a level where most kids could watch it and be fine, but I wouldn't recommend this to teenagers.- Does include some themes about racism and gang wars...Conclusion: Worthwhile netflix or amazon instant pick, but probably not a keep on your shelf and cheris forever sort of movie.","3.0 out of 5 stars","September 14, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R260UUFZN8UM9C/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B009HIKAN8#wasThisHelpful","R260UUFZN8UM9C","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary: Very nice glass screen protector.Installation: (4/5 stars) I cleaned the screen with the wet and dry wipes then lined up the screen and put it down in place. There was one large bubble in the middle and I couldn't find anything to squeeze it out with. I ended up usng the foam the glass had been originally wrapped in to try and press the bubble out. Fairly smooth installation.Feel: (4.5 stars) nice feel ... though it's a little strange to feel the glass near the bottom button, especially when trying to unlock with a thumbprint. Will just take some getting used to.Random comments:- I liked that you could clean the phone easily.- I like that it covers most of the screen but doesn't interfere with the case.- So far so good.

"It took me a long time to write this review because strawberries were ridiculously expensive for a while there.This is a fun, little simple device that lets you pull the core out of a strawberry in about 2 seconds.Random Comments:- it takes a fair amount of thumb strength to push down enough to get the front part to open, but once you slide it into the strawberry and release it does the rest of the work.- It works better with strawberries that are ripe but firm stil. Squishy strawberries get mangled a little.- It's fun to play with as well as functional. I used it for prepping strawberries for a shortcake dessert, but you could use it for nearly any instance you need strawberries.- It works best if you tear off the green stem first, but you don't absolutely have to.Conclusion: Excellent for tearing the hearts out of strawberries.*I received a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion.*","5.0 out of 5 stars","September 6, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY0QS8QDNNJO5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0111KHRNK#wasThisHelpful","RY0QS8QDNNJO5","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Note: I did buy a kindle, but I also listened to the audio performance thanks to a code from the author.The opinions are fully my own.Summary: Political pressure from the suspicious suicide of a Senator's son sends the FBI scrambling to solve a series of other suspect suicides.Random Comments:- On the personal front, I'm glad there are significant gains on the Lei relationship front. The almost teenage internal back and forth of what to do for several books got annoying. (It might very well be realistic...but it's still annoying.)- This story expands quite a bit on Sophie Ang. I think the author could have safely scaled back on the pages dedicated to her, but she's a cool character. I like how in the series the side characters do get some spotlight time.- The mystery is ... unique ... in a good way. Not many murder mysteries focus on suicide.- The wrapup is okay but there are a few threads left hanging. There's a big to-do in the beginning with the senator and his wife, but then they're pretty much never mentioned again in the entire book.Conclusion: A decent entry in the Lei Crime Series.

"*I received a free pair in exchange for my honest opinion.*Summary: 1 pair of (navy) waxed shoelaces.Random Comments:- I'd never head that shoelaces could be waxed. It feels a little odd, but they work fine.- I had to tie it in a double knot to get it to stay. I do that with all shoelaces, so I'd say that's par for the course.- These are a little thinner than the shoelaces I'm used too, but I imagine they're way easier to clean off, if one were so inclined to clean their shoelaces.- Colors and color selection are very nice.- The shipping would probably be negligible because they can fit in a business envelope and sail the USPS under a single stamp.Conclusion: If you're in the market for new shoelaces, these are a great choice. I do think the wax may have them untie a few more times than normal for heavy use, but just double knot them and they should be fine.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1NLXWAP8X46IT/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T3NAG1I#wasThisHelpful","R1NLXWAP8X46IT","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion.*Summary: Cute, portable humidifier. Perfect for traveling.Random Comments:- I've needed a humidifier for the past few winters because the heat just dries up the air. This is a nice option.- The cord's not terribly long.Slight Cons:- Having to plug into a USB port is odd. I had an adapter I stole from my kindle, but other than that, you'd have to have a power strip that has a USB port, which is just an extra ""thing"" to have to be awarre of in a traveling situation.- It doesn't last the whole night. I think it'll work for a good 6 hours, but if you sleep for much more than that, you'll wake up with it straining to pump the last little bit. Incidentally, it will never get the last centimeter because of how far down the filter can reach.Pros:- The LED light works great and is a very soothing color.- It worked immediately and very well at that.- Lightweight. You could easily pack it and not have to worry about dragging about much more than that adapter to get it to fit in a socket.Conclusion: If you need a humidifier and travel alot, you should definitely consider this. Also, if your humidifier needs are modest, I'd say you could go for this anyway. It's not going to turn your room into a tropical jungle, but it should help fight off the dry winter air.","4.0 out of 5 stars","May 3, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R10FF3RXPMY07M/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VSI4H66#wasThisHelpful","R10FF3RXPMY07M","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Summary: John Puller's brother escapes from the military prison.Random Commentary:- This is a pretty long audiobook, but it's decently read. The music behind certain parts fits very well. Nice presenation.- The dialogue isn't super wonderful, but it's workable.- The plot's extremely far-fetched, but what thriller isn't? That's kind of the point. Danger.

"*I received a free sample in exchange for my honest opinion.*Summary: I'm not sure what the difference is between a serum and a lotion. Guess I just don't try enough of these things.Random Comments:- I am always leary of trying new skin things because my skin seems to be tempermental when it comes to new products. So, I tried a little on my hands first.- First impression: It smells nice (faintly citrusy; not overpowering; the scent comes across as light and purposeful rather than heavy handed to mask something) and goes on smoothly.- It's only been used a few days, but so far so good.- It's a very tiny bottle, but you don't need all that much. And it's not meant to be a full body lotion, so it should last a while.- The discounted price of $24.95 seems pricey, but that could just be that my typical lotion can be bought off a shelf at Target/Walmart, etc. In the grand scheme of serums, it is modestly priced, so take that into consideration.Conclusion: If you're in the market for an anti-aging serum, this is a decent choice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 23, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2LIQH9YAONX1H/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00OGUB23E#wasThisHelpful","R2LIQH9YAONX1H","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"*I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review.Summary: This is a stick designed to hold your phone so you can take pictures of yourself and a friend or things behind you without the super awkward angle of a normal selfie.Random comments:- Worked swell on an android phone. No trouble hooking up.- Maybe it's just me, but I have trust issues when it comes to something like this that essentially places one's very expensive phone in the air at a height quite able to damage it if it falls. So far, no mishaps though, so I think it's a decent design. The clamp worked well. The stick was easy to maneuver in and out.- I like that it has its own carrying case.- Would make a nice gift.- I'd be cautious about using it over ledges. Just my paranoia, but it's one thing to risk possible dropping a phone and another to risk dropping it someplace irretrievable.Conclusion: If you're in the market for a Selfie Stick.

"Summary: Lei's Aunt Rosario ships her off into the woods with some camplike counselors and some other troubled teens. Chaos ensues.Random Comments:- The scenario described is somewhat plausible, though I doubt a program like that would allow a male counselor any alone time with a female client for the sake of both the client and the counselor. Misunderstandings could lead to lawsuits.(That whole conversation with Tim was irksome.)- The beginning was rather slow moving, but 1/2 way through things picked up very quickly.- A bit dark but compelling.- Lei's survivor instincts are intact here. She's the most developed character here. In a novella with this many side characters, it's hard to make everybody 3d. Some are and some aren't fleshed out here. That doesn't detract from what you get.- I love the last scene.Conclusion: Great story to read for some early insight into the mind of Lei as a teenager.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ODF1EJIF654W/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00VQWUFT2#wasThisHelpful","R1ODF1EJIF654W","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Summary: Nikki Sotos body washes up on shore, setting Detective Lei and co on another murder mystery adventure. But thats not all, theres another victim, another young woman missing and she happens to be the daughter of one of Leis acquaintances.Random Comments:- The endings a little abrupt, but the mystery unfolds at a nice pace.- There were some threads that seemed to go nowhere. Im being purposefully vague to avoid spoilers, but some aspects of the investigation seemed hyped up for no reason.- The medical examiner was suitably quirky. Dr. Harris was nicely fleshed out for a side character.- To my knowledge, the story doesnt contain any spoilers for those who havent yet read the Lei Crime Series canon. I believe this story fits near the second book. (Jack Jenkins is her partner and shes a detectivedefinitely not first book.)- The bad guys a little stock, but thats not a terrible thing.- This novella also brings up a topic thats close to my heart.

The 8 year old kid is neat; wise beyond his years. Lem's annoying. His father's annoying. Victor's family is sort of interesting. Reena seems like a lady with a good head on her shoulders but she gets like 2 scenes.- There's a large cast here, but it doesn't seem like the page distribution is very even.- I think it's cool to be exploring the backstory, but like any spinoff, it suffers from trying too hard to be what was and not enough time being an awesome story in and of itself.Conclusion: Okay but skippable.","3.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1O46IFSJCA482/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0765329069#wasThisHelpful","R1O46IFSJCA482","A3DWENW34NQEAV","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A3DWENW34NQEAV?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Title:  LION FOR HERSeries:  N/ACategory /Genre:  Paranormal RomanceRecommended for:  18+ due to sexual contentReceived from:  Brandy Walker (in exchange for an honest review)Grammar/editing:  A  near perfectThis is a stand-alone novella in the Southern Shifters Kindle World.  It is not part of any other series.One of the best questions an author can ask is, what if?  So, what if the one you thought was your fated mate isnt?  How did you read that wrong?  How can this be resolved?I thought there were great characters and a different story.  Most PNR have the H/h meeting as adults and fated mates recognize each other immediately.  Instead, Maddie, Van, and Mack have known each other since they were children.  They wouldnt know each other as mates on the playground and as they reached puberty they were a threesome of best friends.  Maddie makes a mistake and so do the boys.  As adults sometimes the hardest thing is recognizing a colossal mistake, admitting it, and then finding a fix.  I loved how Brandy Walker made it all happen.  She has great secondary characters that could also be brought into their own stories (hint, hint).I have begged Brandy Walker to write about at least one of the other characters, to (pretty, please) return to the Southern Shifters World.  She agreed!!!!  Vans brother, Mack, deserves his HEA, too.  Eliza Gayle has created a wonderful world that I am enjoying exploring.  In fact, I still have two more books in the series and hoping for more.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1V3NQX5QRVC2L/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B013PYJL7U#wasThisHelpful","R1V3NQX5QRVC2L","A1UPHTDW5GM12T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UPHTDW5GM12T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Title: SINFUL DEEDSSeries: Cynfell Brothers #2Category /Genre: Historical RomanceRecommended for: 18+ due to sexual contentReceived from: Samantha Holt (in exchange for an honest review)Grammar/editing: ungraded  book received as an unedited ARC / errors excusedThis is the second book in the Cynfell Brothers series. Though each does stand alone, I would recommend reading in the order of publication. You can expect updates on the previous couples.Dante Cynfell is the second son in this family. I am reminded that the traditional aristocracy procreated with the motto of an heir and a spare. Meaning that each family wanted there to be two boys born, because of the high infant mortality rates of the times.Born as the spare, Dante lacks the seriousness of his brother. He lives a life of privilege with no responsibility. He doesnt see his responsibility even for his mistress. When Josephine, Jo-Jo, tells him that she wants more or freedom, he really doesnt understand what more a woman could want.I loved the banter between these two. I also loved the growth they each experienced. Its obvious from page one that they love each other, but they are both strong enough to ask for what they want and fight for what they need. I thought this was a great story and extremely well written. This was not the usual boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy fights for girl. Instead we start at boy loses girl and they both make the fight worthwhile. I cheered when he inevitably re-won the heart of the girl without making her lose herself in the process.As stated in the previous review, the chores are often ignored when a truly good read is available  still guilty. I began this one as soon as I finished Sinful Confessions and now Im done. I guess its time to get back to work but rest assured, I have one eye on my kindle account to see when the next book in this series will be released.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1I2M5T4ZXWB17/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X0GXKEE#wasThisHelpful","R1I2M5T4ZXWB17","A1UPHTDW5GM12T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UPHTDW5GM12T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"Title: SINFUL CONFESSIONSSeries: Cynfell Brothers #1Category /Genre: Historical RomanceRecommended for: 18+ due to sexual contentReceived from: Samantha Holt (in exchange for an honest review)Grammar/editing: ungraded  book received as an unedited ARC / errors excusedThis is the first book in the Cynfell Brothers series, each embodying one of the seven deadly seasons. Each will stand alone, but I would still recommend reading them in the order of release. You can expect updates on the previous couples.The Marquees of Lockwood, Julian Cynfell, is wrath personified and with good reason. Three times he has been left a widower and the tongues of the ton are wagging, as one might expect. His only joy comes in the letters from his pen pal in America. Viola Thompson is the daughter of a business associate and she provides all of the correspondence for her ailing father. Besides being awkward for both of them, I thought their first meeting was as intriguing as it was funny. In fact, I loved the whole story  Julian fighting the love vs lust battle and Violas secrets and background add to the tensions, both sexual and societal.Somehow, Samantha Holt is always able to provide intelligent, unique romance with a solid side of humor. She has delivered again and I am looking forward to continuing this series. I read it in one sitting (instead of doing the chores i had set for myself for the day LOL). I know that I will never go wrong with a romance from Samantha Holt.Bonus: Yeah!!

Thats all it takes for the reclusive man to pull up stakes and fly across the country with Gus and Bill in an effort to find and save her.  Paisley doesnt even know she needs to be saved until moments before they arrive.  I loved her determination in all things  whether it was supporting her friend or chasing her heart for the sake of her mate.  She is powerfully strong emotionally and intellectually.Gus and Bill have returned in this story as well and they have never been funnier.  When Bill asked Paisley if she had a sister named Plaid for their Scottish friend (Striker) who wears a kilt, I thought I was going to die laughing!!  In fact the interaction between Gus and Bill was even more endearing this time around.  I just felt closer to both of them and adored their symbiotic and brotherly relationship.My final word:  Another one hit clean out of the ball park.  Mandy M.

It is not part of any other series.This is the third story that I have read that is set in the Southern Shifters Kindle World (fan-fiction set in the fictional area called Tail of the Dragon in the Southern Appalachian Mountains).  I have loved each of the ones I have read thus far.  I have two more downloaded and Im looking forward to more from this series (see list of books and authors below).Who can resist a damsel in distress?  Murphy Hazen is doing his best to resist her, but knowing she is her fated mate and she is in her first heat is making it damn hard (pun intended).  Still, he is intent on doing the right thing for her, even if that means giving her up.  As I said on the day of my divorce, sometimes loving someone means letting them go if that is what will make them happy.  Along the way, Murphy is going to find out that Sable knows that passion and love are the only things that will make her happy.  He will also learn that needing a helping hand doesnt mean that she was hopelessly helpless.I loved this quick romantic story and the characters are just so sweet!  The ending had me smiling for hours!  Im not spoiling anything when I say that a romance novel has an HEA, but the road to getting there is filled with love, loyalty, and surprises.This is the first book I have read from Dee Carney.

It does stand on its own, though now Im curious about the rest of the pride, but it also has a cliff-hanger.  The primary conflict (why shes chasing the rogue, Kerr, is not resolved), but it is an excellent introduction to all of the characters and I didnt feel cheated by it ending where it did.This is also a novella in the Southern Shifters Kindle World, set in the Tail of the Dragon area in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  In this world, this book also stands alone and does not need any other knowledge, though there are references to other story lines that has me clamoring for more!I have to share my favorite statement from Lakota.  Derria is one of the most capable women I know.  If she could get here and ambush you alone, trust me, shell be fine.  Besides, the newly healed claw marks on my chest from just this morning are a reminder that when I get the urge to try to control her, its best to change my mind.That about sums up Derria.  She is doing her job and nobody, not even a mate, will get in her way.  I loved that she immediately recognizes the mate bond and doesnt fight it.the first time around.Kerr is the mystery man running from Derria with no idea why he is being chased.  He is hot and alpha.  I fell in love with him on page one even if he was the bad guy.Lakota (Kota to his friends) is a basketful of secrets, but everything changes when he meets Derria.  He is also hot and alpha.  From first sight, he is devoted to making Derrias life easier and more comfortable, whether that means tracking a rogue or finding her a place to lie down at night.If they were food, Lakota would be dark chocolate, Kerr a cinnamon caramel, and Derria the cherry whip that brings them all together.  Now Im hungry for more of them, more Southern Shifters, and a special chocolate, caramel, cherry treat!

"Series: Crossfire, #1Category /Genre: Erotica, Psychological ThrillerRecommended for: 18+ due to sexual contentReceived from: A friend, as a birthday gift (Kindle edition)Grammar/editing: A  near perfectThis is the first book in the Crossfire Series. They do need to be read in order.Thank you, Ivan. He told me to pick a book from my Amazon wishlist and he was giving it to me for my birthday in January 2015. It has sat in my TBR until now when I finally had some me time.I recommended this book before I had read it. 'Twas the day before Christmas, and I was at a local department store. As is my routine, I went to the book section to see if any of my favorite authors were on display. It was very early in the morning and there was only one other shopper in the section. He looked lost. After a few minutes, I asked him for whom was he shopping. He said his wife waited until the last minute to tell him that she wanted a book for Christmas. I asked what she likes and his answer is ""I don't know."" So, I try to change tact and ask him what the last book that she read was. His answer made me giggle, when he said, ""I suck."" Now, I need to tell ya'all I haven't read FSOG and I hadn't read the Crossfire series, but I was told that anyone who liked FSOG would like this one. So, I suggested to him that he pick up the boxed set. As he stood there looking at the rather generic cover he asked what kind of books they were. Of course, I recognized that he was asking me what I had asked him in the beginning. This time I blushed (yes, I really do blush), and whispered ""erotica."" He lifted an eyebrow at me, questioningly. So I suggested that HE would thank me if she read the books. That's all it took and into the cart they went.Since then, I have read all three of the FSOG books (on a dare)  and I hated them. So, I was reluctant to read anything with the if you liked FSOG, then tag. On the other hand, I was told these ones were *better than,* so here I am. I agree  this was much better than FSOG. The relationship was the most important part of the relationship, not just his ego being stroked - it was a real couple, not just him demanding and her doing.

Instead, Lila is offered a raise if she complies and threatened with the loss of her job if she doesnt. This is sexual harassment in its most basic form.

Tara also has a tormenting boyfriend.  He knows her secret and is using it as only a domineering jerk could.  When Tara (literally) runs into Nick, she is immediately thrown off center and wishing for a life she believed could never be hers.  Nick, too, has a secret.  One that could destroy them.I loved Tara.  She is beautiful mixture of vulnerable, nave, and intelligent.  She is determined and strong, despite her toxic relationship with Alex.  Alex is a classic silent-movie style villain in the black hat.  There is not a single redeeming quality to him, except in her dreams.  I was cheering for Nick the whole way through the book.  He is gorgeous, sexy, sweet, and alpha-dominant.  A dominant man (Nick) is always sexier than a domineering one (Alex). and then the last chapter happened.  I did NOT see it coming.  I wanted to throw my Kindle.  I wanted to scream.  I settled for contacting the author, calling her a naughty word (after thanking her for sharing the book with me), and then insisting that she get writing because I need to know what happens next!This is the first book released by Mia Rivers.  I consider it a treat to find a new author just starting out that I believe could be a big name in the literary world.  There were a few places where she could have provided more description and there were a few places that it was obvious she was going for word count  newbie mistakes, but I feel she has a great story-telling ability that only needs to be nurtured to life.","4.0 out of 5 stars","April 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RY8C2OLN6TSY/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U9SFE4A#wasThisHelpful","RY8C2OLN6TSY","A1UPHTDW5GM12T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UPHTDW5GM12T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=8&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They will need to be read in order.Carter has been in love with Brielle since they were very small children.  No matter what she does, he loves her  even when he doesnt like her.  His father marries her mother and the emotional torment she gives him increases to a fever pitch.  When she moves away, breaking his heart, and then returns, he is left to wonder if her demons can ever be put to rest.  Can they ever have the HEA he wishes to have? Im not sure what I expected, but this story idea surpassed my imagination.  I didnt realize I love my step-brother/sister was a modern trope, especially since its near to life in my family. (My sister married our foster-brother.)  Now, Im curious what other authors may invent with this concept.At 50%, I couldnt keep it to myself and had to gift a copy to a friend.Brielle reminds me of every mean girl I ever met in high school.  Her favorite target is the one boy she knows will love her and protect her no matter what.  Its such a horrible way to repay such dedication and devotion.  Here is an example of their interaction:<b> Why cant you just leave me alone?Because I dont want anyone else to have you just in case I decide I want you later on. </b>That pretty much sums up Brielles attitude.  Even with that, I still love her just as much as Carter.  As always, Scarlett Jade creates characters who are beautifully flawed, lovable, and relatable.I cant wait to read Good Stepbrother.  Were going to find out WHY Brielle acts that way.  Knowing Jade, this is not just a simple case of narcissism.

Being in NYC also means time with Crystal and Riptide.  He is dealing with the loss of Rebecca, the investigation, and threats to himself and his family.  Now more than ever, he believes he must take control.  With Crystal he feels more than he ever has before.I love Crystal even more after this story.  She seems to be a balm to Marks soul  more even than he ever believed was possible outside of the control he held over his submissives.  This is not to say that he has been cured.  He is still a dominant and enjoys being in control, but, with Crystal, hes finding the balance that will make him a whole person.

For me, I had not read any, so this is book one to my mind. I was not lost. Each character is well-introduced. BTW: the introduction to Dria and Rafe is hawt, hawt, hawt!!A year ago, college student, Jonathan Winchester, was bitten by a wolf and forced to believe that the things that go bump in the night are real. Romeo, alpha of the Manitoba pack, takes him in to train him, but it is soon evident that Jon is an alpha and will one day outgrow or challenge for the pack. Jon decides to leave after a tremendous argument with Romeo that shows no sign of resolution. He finds himself in Virginia, close to but unable to go home. He's surprised to chance upon another lone wolf, his waitress, Raine. When he discovers her secret and the danger she is in, he is determined to save the woman he believes could be his mate. His determination leads him to a pretty redheaded vampire, Dria, and her human husband, Rafe. Will saving Raine mean death for Jon?If you are new to the series, as I am, I recommend this as a first read. Allow yourself to fall in love with Jon as I have!

"Title:  SOME WOLF BLUESeries:  Wide-Angle Lens #4Category /Genre:  Paranormal Romance, BBW, MenageRecommended for:  18+ due to sexual contentReceived from:  Ruby Glass (in exchange for an honest review)Grammar/editing:  ungraded  book received as an unedited ARC / errors excusedThis is the fourth book in the Wild-Angle Lens series.  Each does stand alone, but I recommend reading them all and in order.Talya has been requested for another unusual wedding.  This time it is just her, the bride, and the two men climbing a mountain for a private hand-fasting.  Once again, she has asked the bride to share their story of meeting and falling in love.  So which man is the groom?This was a sweet romance perfect for the Valentine season.  Adeline has an unusual job and is place in an unique position between the alpha boss, Gregor, and the beta, Thad.I love the consistency of having the photographer in each of the books in the series combined with the new characters in each of the books in this series.  It provides a continuity mixed with diversity.I cannot wait to read the companion short-story that is going to follow-up this series.  In the final installment, perhaps the photographer will be on the other side of that camera  I hope!","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 13, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R2ECWQPWW193IA/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00T1UDYI0#wasThisHelpful","R2ECWQPWW193IA","A1UPHTDW5GM12T","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1UPHTDW5GM12T?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=10&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

It is great for tossing around and playing catch. This ball is perfect for kids because of the size and the padding. The black also looks nice and the rubber laces add some extra grip.

"Another winner from Lenox. This ornament is a heavy silver-plated metal. It is very sturdy and says bless this home on it. The front and back are engraved, so it will look good at any angle on the tree. The house looks like a little bird house with a heart on it. Then it's a silver wreath with a bow.

"I am really enjoying the Lenox ornaments this year. I have the angel and now I've added the mercury glass snowman to my collection. This is very pretty. The crystal glass snowman is glittery, but the real magic happens when the lights are switched on. There is a button on the bottom that switches on a color changing light.The ornament then lights up with an ever changing color. It is very pretty, and there are no batteries ar assembly required. This ornament can be hung, but it can just sit on the base too. I'm going to have it on the mantle with the angel and some other light changing ornaments. This also comes very well packed. It is fragile, but arrived in perfect condition.

"I'm one of those weird people who actually like the taste of water. Crystal Geyser is my preferred spring water. That being said, this Pact water is pretty good. I have often hit the cranberry juice when I thought some type of bladder issue was coming on, so I appreciate the benefits of cranberry and Ocean Spray are the cranberry experts. I doubt as many of us would have had cranberry juice on a regular basis if it wasn't for this company.I also like the ingredients of this product. I am fine with both of the sweeteners, the cranberry extract, and the filtered water. The only thing that may be a little suspect is the ""natural flavor"", I'm not sure if it is an urban legend or if castoreum is really used in berry flavors, but ever since I have heard of this extract I try to stay away. Instead of ""natural flavor"", I wish they would say raspberries or castoreum free.Still this stuff is pretty good, although it's a little on the sweet side.

"Olaf is the goofy, yet lovable snowman from Frozen. Frozen is the smash Disney hit that kids love to watch over and over. The Olaf snowman is a large but cute replica of Olaf. I like shaved ice and snow cones and love the simplicity of this snow cone maker. Simply put in the ice, put in a cone, and press Olaf's forehead. Next thing you get is shaved snow cone ice. Just add flavoring and you are good to go.This is cute and simple enough for the kids to make. Just keep them away from the sharp shaving blade. The Olaf is goofy but adorable at the same time. For the syrup, I made a modified simple syrup using a couple of Kool-Aid packets for flavoring. Just heat sugar and water on the stove and put in the flavoring. I like to make homemade simple syrups instead of using store bought syrups. I'll have to find some healthier flavoring alternatives than Kool-aid packets.Frozen is still popular with the kids. It will soon be cold, so I'm not sure if snow cones will be as popular, but the loveable snowman is still a hit.","5.0 out of 5 stars","October 27, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R1Z1TZOPS862DW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00Z7G5SWM#wasThisHelpful","R1Z1TZOPS862DW","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=2&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"It's been awhile since I have taken sleep aids, so I don't have a tolerance built up. I took two of these and sat down to watch TV. It didn't take long before I started feeling drowsy. I went to bed and slept, well. Usually, when my cat wakes me up at two or four am, I stay up. Not after taking these. I let the cat out, fell back into bed and instantly fell asleep. I was still a little drowsy in the morning but was quickly able to shake it off.So these seem to work if you don't have a sleep aid tolerance built up. My only complaint with these is the natural claim. They do contain herbs and melatonin, but the caps are gelatin caps and they contain blue dye. The blue pills look cool, but the dye isn't necessary. They also seem to overhype the natural claim. I was trying to find the brand of these, and I guess it is Natural Rest. The label says All Natural, Natural Rest, sleep the way nature intended.

The pendant was also in a little plastic bag with a paper tag that says made in China.This may not make the best gift, without some work on the packaging, but it would be a fine necklace just to wear.","4.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R34S5GVHUS2PRD/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00PIW1AG8#wasThisHelpful","R34S5GVHUS2PRD","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love the fact that the aluminum doesn't rust. I also like the lightness of the caddy and the finish of the aluminum. I have a sprayer on my shower head, so I put a nail in the wall above the shower and the caddy hangs down on the side. It doesn't slide and the suction cups aren't an issue.I like that it is small and simple. My shower has some built in shelves, but having the extra space is always useful. I've heard that razors will last longer if the blades are kept dry, so the razor hanger seems like a great idea.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 20, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R18TIB7LVR4DKW/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00HWQ7ZNA#wasThisHelpful","R18TIB7LVR4DKW","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I always credited my success in college to being organized. I always used a binder with dividers to keep my notes straight. My tip for all college students is to rewrite your notes at the end of the day and clarify and fill in any gaps that you may have. It really helps to have solid notes as a reference, instead of a scribbly unclear mess.These dividers are big and heavy duty. They come in bright colors and the plastic is see-through. If I only had these back then. Still I make notes for projects and still like to keep organized, so I'll get a lot of use out of these. The Ultralast are strong and durable. I was also fortunate enough to get an Ultralast binder to go with these. This is a really great system.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R4PPMITPLFI2Y/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00X5GC16M#wasThisHelpful","R4PPMITPLFI2Y","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

"Stress and free radicals are the enemy for me. Fortunately, there are some herbal supplements that help with both. I first started taking Holy Basil and it seemed to help with my anxiety. After adding the Rhodiola I feel calmer and more focused. I also like that they are both strong anti-oxidants. I have a spot on my cheek that I am concerned about. After taking these two supplements it has gotten smaller. I also haven't noticed any negative side effects or upset stomach taking either of these. The effects may be small, but I don think they help.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/RFSGHRE1CBV9P/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UV5APJA#wasThisHelpful","RFSGHRE1CBV9P","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I have had a few different Sonicares over the years. This one does have some improvements. I like the two modes and the 3 intensity settings. Although, I thought using my first Sonicare years ago was hilarious. It vibrated so much it would tickle my mouth. After awhile, you get used to it, but full intensity at first is pretty dramatic.This battery stays charged, it says up to 3 weeks, either way it doesn't need to be charged daily, like the older models. It also has a slim profile and doesn't take up a lot of space in the bathroom. I'm not sure about the whitening, but it really makes my teeth feel clean so removing stains would help with whitening.I also think the handle feels good and I like the new brush design. The green buttons look nice too. The only thing I don't like is the timer and the 30-second intervals. I understand the concept of brushing for two minutes and getting all 4 quadrants of the mouth, but I don't need a timer to tell  me that. I wish it could be turned off. I find the intervals and the timer annoying.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R3JKMJZIWEB28I/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00YAR86BY#wasThisHelpful","R3JKMJZIWEB28I","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=6&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"

They are sweat resistant and I can still hear outside noises a little bit for safety.I wasn't sure about the style of earbud, but after getting used to them they are not bad.

"This game is sort of fun, but it's also a little confusing and a bit of work. The dessert cards are dishes that have 2 or 3 ingredients, we need to serve guests their favorite food from either our ingredients or if we are lucky our card will be the exact dish in which case we can draw another dessert card. Cute theory and the idea of playing with and thinking of desserts is fun.It is just kind of hard to figure out what is what. Still once the game is understood and we know what each image is there is some strategy to combining items with guests wishes and getting rid of the cards first. This is one of those games that would be more fun with more practice and everyone getting with the Just Desserts program.","4.0 out of 5 stars","June 19, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R14F0WGDNBE1L5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00U05Y830#wasThisHelpful","R14F0WGDNBE1L5","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"This small clear snorkel set isn't overly prominent, but it works. The small mask has a tight comfortable fit and the snorkel works well and blocks water when going under. So far, this baby is only swimming pool tested, but in a couple of weeks it will be beach tested when I go on vacation. I'm too afraid to use it in the river because I don't want to actually see what is in that water. Maybe if I go higher up to the mountains where the streams are less intimidating.

"I love how this first smells when I wash my hands. This soap also looks high end on the counter and the bottle says made in France. I love lavender scented products and this lavender sage smells very nice. It also rinses clean and feels gentle on my hands.The only slight drawback is after my hands are rinsed and dried there is a slight lingering smell of something other than the lavender. I think it is a slight glycerin smell. Which is still clean and natural, but I prefer the lavender scent over the soapy glycerin scent. Still this is some nice soap and it is going to get a lot of use sitting next to my sink.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 17, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R176SWAH5D75Q5/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I06ZXPS#wasThisHelpful","R176SWAH5D75Q5","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"I love appliances that serve more than one function. The first thing I did when I received this was throw my old rice cooker away and give my crock pot to a neighbor. Now I have a little extra room in the cupboard.I'm pretty lazy and I'm not much of a meat eater, but what I would frequently cook in my rice cooker was rice or quinoa, with vegetables steaming at the same time. This nice KitchenAid handles steaming veggies alone or with rice on the bottom with ease.It also acts as a very high-end slow cooker and can easily replace a crock pot. I'm not very good at slow cooking, but I thought I would make a blueberry cobbler or crumble and use the cooker like an oven. I found a recipe online where you just put blueberries and sugar in the pot along with a yellow cake mix stirred into melted butter.I think I should have just put the pot on 350 for 40 minutes and it probably would have turned out perfect. Instead, I put it on high slow cooker, and then when after 3 hours it didn't seem cooked enough, I turned it up to 450 and I ended up burning the edges. The non-burned parts were pretty tasty with ice cream, but I'm still confused about the best way to use this.There are recipes in the manual that sounds really great, including soups, and meats, and pudding and risotto. If I ever get the stirrer I will try the pudding and risotto. They both sound really good and relatively easy to make with the stirrer attachment.I wish there was more information in the manual or that there was a forum or something. Maybe I'm overthinking it and can use the cooker exactly like a stove and oven. I'm just not sure about that part. Even though, the rice cooking, steaming, and slow cooking already make this cooker worth it.This is a very nice looking appliance and has that stylish KitchenAid quality. The steaming, roasting basket is solid, the non-stick cooking liner is very nice, and the lid is nice too. You can also use the pot as a kitchen timer, without any heat.I still need to experiment and figure out the best way to use this, but I think it is a very nice cooker and I really like it. If I ever decide to attempt yogurt making, it even does that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 16, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R277X2FC9U9NLK/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00UL3K722#wasThisHelpful","R277X2FC9U9NLK","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"These are interesting earbuds. They are very small and light weight. I used the tips that were on it, but two other sizes came with them. They looked like they would be too small for my ears, but they fit perfectly inside my ear. The sound was surprisingly good. The earbuds are marked with and R an L, so there is no guessing about which ear to put each one in.The microphone is on the left ear side. These don't feel like you are wearing anything at all, yet they sound very good. The cord is cloth and the magnets aren't in the earbuds like other ones I have used. Instead, there is a rubber magnetic loop that you can wrap the cord and earbuds with. For such a reasonable price, these are very comfortable and sound great.","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 10, 2015","http://www.amazon.com/review/R15B6KORZIA1FE/ref=cm_aya_cmt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBTQNAO#wasThisHelpful","R15B6KORZIA1FE","A1FPQ54AIB26L0","http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A1FPQ54AIB26L0?ie=UTF8&display=public&page=9&sort_by=MostRecentReview","correct"
"My first experience with a flat iron was several years ago. The stylist showed me how to use it, and said to never iron dry hair or it will burn and frizz. At the time, we used Aquage shine spray and I shelled out $100 for a professional ceramic flat iron. If you have long hair, a flat iron will get out the weird natural bends and twists and make your hair look shiny and awesome.Several years later, I became lazy and gave up on using the flat iron and I'm not even sure if shine spray is still in style. Products seem to come and go, and I may be a bit out of the loop. In comes the Remington PROtect Flat Iron, this thing works as good as the professional flat iron plus it infuses my hair with moisture.I love the Macadamia Conditioning Treatment, this stuff smooths and conditions and keeps hair from being damaged while adding moisture. This is actually a great product and a really nice flat iron.

"This dog bed is the medium size which would work for most dogs. The faux sheepskin is soft and my cat started using this immediately. This would be great for protecting a couch, chair or car seat from pet hairs. It would also be better than nothing for a pet that lives outside. The only downside is that the bolsters are very padded, but the inside where the animal actually lays isn't very thick.

"These silicone kitchen utensils are interesting. The handles feel like hard plastic, but the ends are bendable silicone. They are also BPA free, dishwasher safe, and heat resistant up to 480 degrees. I like the regular spoon and the slotted spoon. This is my first spaghetti noodle spoon and it is actually pretty handy. My only complaint is the spatula, or as they call it, the turner needs more contour in the handle. It's almost like flipping something with a flat spatula. The red color matches my Paula Deen cookware and comes close to the color of my Kitchen Aid multi-cooker.
